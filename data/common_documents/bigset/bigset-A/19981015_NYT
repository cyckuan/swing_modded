   FURNITURE-TRENDS _ HIGH POINT, N.C. _ In the '80s, Americans
``cocooned,'' as trends guru Faith Popcorn called the Yuppy
obsession with bettering their homes instead of hanging out at
bars. Now, as a new century looms, will that lifestyle change?
Popcorn, chairman of BrainReserve, a marketing consultancy to
Fortune 500 companies, had a captive audience Thursday as
retailers, designers and media from around the world flocked to
High Point for the International Home Furnishings Market. Here,
where next spring's furniture lines get their first showing, all
eyes and ears as fixed on trend watchers such as Popcorn for
predicting, as best anyone can, how home furnishings will sell. 15
inches with file photo of popcorn and new products pix. (Flanders,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CANCER-DRUG _ AUSTIN, Texas _ More than once, doctors had warned
Lizette Coleman that her chances offor a long life were not good.
In the seven years since her first treatment for breast cancer, the
disease had returned time and again until finally she told her
doctor that she wouldn't take chemotherapy for the rest of her
life; she would find a better way. In June, on the verge of signing
up for an all-natural treatment in the Bahamas, Coleman learned
about Herceptin, the first genetically engineered drug for breast
cancer, and quickly began traveling once a week to Houston to
participate in the small clinical trial of the drug. Last week, the
drug hit pharmacy shelves for the first time, an answered plea for
many more women desperate to stanch their spreading disease. (Park,
Austin American-Statesman). MOVED

   LOVE-CONNECTICUT _ We bid farewell to our hundreds of Pratt &AMP;
Whitney neighbors who, by virtue of the vagaries of corporate
America, find themselves moving to Hartford, Conn., and vicinity.
Good luck, Godspeed. Moving can be an unsettling business, so we
offer a few tips about life up north: Hartford's nickname is ``The
Insurance City.'' Does that tell you anything? (Reid, Palm Beach
Post). MOVED

   WITCH _ PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Peggy Butera, a practicing witch,

   LIVE _ ATLANTA _ In these waning days of the American Century,
it's pretty clear the country isn't perfect. For one thing,
democracy didn't come with an owner's manual. So Sacramento,
Calif., lawyer Steven Strauss has come writing to the rescue. His
book, due in stores by the end of the month, is titled: ``The
Complete Idiot's Guide to Impeaching the President.'' It figures. A
nation built on self-sufficiency, independent spirit and
enterprising pioneer grit has come to the point where we can't even
throw the bum out without a how-to book. (Scott, Atlanta

   FRAMPTON _ If there were a test to determine whether you're a
rock has-been, Peter Frampton would pass with flying colors.
Appeared on an album of children's songs? Check. Moved to
Nashville? Check. Started going bald? Check. Things have changed so
much for the 48-year-old rock legend, whose classic Frampton Comes
Alive remains the best-selling live album of all time, that when he
plays Friday at the Coral Sky Amphitheatre, he'll be opening for
Lynyrd Skynyrd, a band that lost much of its original membership in
a 1977 plane crash. (Passy, Palm Beach Post). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MIGHTY _ Be wary of the ads for The Mighty that feature the
faces of Sharon Stone, The X-Files' Gillian Anderson, Harry Dean
Stanton and Gena Rowlands. They are merely supporting players in
this lesson-laden teen movie about growing up a misfit. (Erstein,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   EVIL _ There are artists who are of their time, and there are
artists who are ahead of their time. Then there are those complete
originals who exist in a time of their own. The most tragic of them
all, if only because he was probably the most naturally gifted man
ever to walk on a sound stage, was Orson Welles. And he is
inimitable. ``Touch of Evil'' is 40 years old, but it could be
made, not yesterday or today, but tomorrow _ not that there's
anybody around with the necessary audacity and insolence. With the
exception of some leather-jacketed toughs who seem to have stepped
out of West Side Story, this movie isn't dated at all. (Eyman, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-MAGIC _ Practical Magic is a lumpy witches' brew of
romance, comedy, horror and twaddle. With so many batty females
flitting about _ albeit attractive ones _ sitting through the movie
is a bit like spending two hours at a pajama party. The giggles.
The hugs. The squeals. The gossip. The nicknames: ``I love you,

 &HT;    Even `Dummies' can learn how to impeach the president
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In these waning days of the American Century, it's
pretty clear the country isn't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, democracy didn't come with an owner's manual.
</P>
<P>
   So Sacramento, Calif., lawyer Steven Strauss has come writing to
the rescue. His book, due in stores by the end of the month, is
titled: ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Impeaching the President.''
</P>
<P>
   It figures.
</P>
<P>
   A nation built on self-sufficiency, independent spirit and
enterprising pioneer grit has come to the point where we can't even
throw the bum out without a how-to book.
</P>
<P>
   We are overrun with advice and self-help books from a publishing
industry so certain of our ineptitude that the two hottest how-to
series are marketed by flip-flopping the old adage that the
customer is always right.
</P>
<P>
   The customer, as it turns out, is always either a dummy or a
complete idiot.
</P>
<P>
   But, please, don't take that the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `dummy' is our way of giving advice but taking the
snobbery out of it,'' says Mimi Sells, spokeswoman for IDG, the
publisher that since 1991 has sold 50 million ``Dummies'' books on
373 topics ranging from computers to sex to hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, says Sells, some pretty famous Americans have been
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton read `E-Mail for Dummies' so she could
communicate with her daughter,'' says Sells. ``And this is no dumb
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other niche publishers mint a mind-numbing number of
how-to titles each year, sending their authors off on the talk-show
circuit packing advice from tomes with titles that read like flat
jokes from a Letterman Top Ten list:
</P>
<P>
   ``Left Brain Finance 4 Right Brained People''
</P>
<P>
   ``The One-Minute Father''
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Creative Divorce''
</P>
<P>
   ``Be Your Own Dating Service''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop Screaming At The Microwave''
</P>
<P>
   How-to books for parents is an industry in itself, where each
cloying, guilt-ridden title (``How To Really Love Your Child'')
invites a rebuttal from the publisher down the street (``Loving
Your Child Is Not Enough'').
</P>
<P>
   Even the pedestrian business of putting one foot in front of the
other has spawned at least 10 how-to books, including ``Walk
Yourself Thin,'' and ``Walk Yourself Well''. Here's a sage piece of
advice from ``The 90-Day Fitness Walking Program'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Walk out of your door and walk for five minutes in any
direction at any speed. Then turn around and come home. That's it.
You're done.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of how-tos goes back a bit. The Bible contained this
parenting tip: ``Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and
reject not your mother's teaching.'' And Ben Franklin may have
written the first how-to book on American soil: ``Every Man His Own
Doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dale Carnegie _ whose 1936 ``How To Win Friends and
Influence People'' still sells steadily _ is considered the daddy
of the modern how-to.
</P>
<P>
   ``His was the first book that gave people nuts and bolts advice
on how to transform and reinvent themselves,'' says Richmond-based
writer Robert A. Carter, who has studied the how-to genre and
taught publishing at Pace University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the 1970s _ when shrinks began wrapping their
advice in best selling how-to tomes such as ``What You Always
Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask'' _ that the
self-help industry became imbedded in the popular psyche,
eventually spilling over from books to talk radio and other media.
</P>
<P>
   Today, how-to books do an estimated $500 million in sales. Their
appeal, say publishers, is that they're fast studies on difficult
subjects for readers increasingly crunched for time. And they fill
a knowledge gap for Boomers who threw out many of their parents'
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   A critic of the how-to industry agrees, but she sees a downside
to getting life information from professional advisers. ``Our
parents were luckier,'' says Anne Cassidy, author of ``Parents Who
Think Too Much,'' who advocates we go back to trusting our
instincts. ``They didn't have all this research and pop psychology
to sort through. It bedevils us. It really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem: In the how-to genre, the only real checks and
balances are in the authors' bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the business and wonder if it's any more credible
today than it was at the turn of the century, when there were
self-help books that said masturbation would make you crazy,'' says
Gerald Rosen, a Seattle psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen has written pieces in professional journals citing
research that showed even when the advice in how-to books is from
professionals, and backed by research, it doesn't necessarily work
when tried at home.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers put the 1974 parents guidebook ``Toilet
Training in Less Than A Day'' to scrutiny, for instance, they found
that the program worked four out of five times when parents were
assisted by therapists.
</P>
<P>
   When parents applied the advice on their own, it failed four out
of five times.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this, too: Americans have been desperately gobbling up
hundreds of diet books for decades but, as of 1997, according to
the National Center for Health Statistics, we're fatter than ever.
</P>
<P>
   If dieters are at their width's end, imagine the befuddlement of
mom and pop trying to wrest sanity from the some 2,000 parenting
books in print.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Montgomery, a 41-year-old Decatur mother of two young
children recently paid $25 to attend a seminar by John Covey, who
helped research his brother Stephen Covey's best-selling book,
``The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Parents.''
</P>
<P>
   She was impressed, but not exactly a Covey convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read a lot of these advice books on parenting,'' she
says. ```Infants And Mothers,' `Parent Effectiveness Training,'
`When Your Child Drives You Crazy.' But I try to limit them to ones
recommended by psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's still confusing. There are too many of them. The best
are the one's that confirm what you already know, what's
instinctual.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some how-to authors concede the rash of advice books makes
them uncomfortably hot and bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen McGrath, a clinical psychologist, said she did some real
soul-searching before agreeing to write the latest in the
``Complete Idiot's'' series: ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to
Beating the Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath was afraid she'd get lumped in writers like Judith Rich
Harris, whose ``The Nurture Assumption'' has made headlines with
the startling assertion that parents don't have much effect on
their kids' development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ... books out there that may based on
research, like 'The Nurture Assumption,' but they're not written by
someone with clinical experience,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they tend to take an extreme view just to get media
attention. But they're not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, says McGrath, she was ``turned off'' by the
``Idiot's'' title, but she agreed to do the book because she
figured it would give her broader appeal than her previous, more
academic how-to: ``When Feeling Bad Is Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the book is broken up into chapters _ ``Coping With
Cancer Blues'' _ that are a shade glib. And she goes by ``Dr.
Ellen,'' instead of ``Dr. McGrath'': ``It's less intimidating,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The high tide of how-tos shows few signs of ebbing _ and why
should it?
</P>
<P>
   Two advice books _ ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution,'' and
``Don't Sweat the Small Stuff...And It's All Small Stuff'' _ seem
permanently camped on best seller lists. And last year, combined,
the ``Dummies'' and ``Complete Idiots'' series did more than $130
million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The next ``Dummies'' title is ``Herbal Remedies for Dummies.''
Says ``Dummies'' spokeswoman Sells: ``We're publishing new titles
as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as fast, in fact, as the Idiot's savants at Macmillan
Publishing, where _ when editors get through with Clinton and
impeachment _ they plan to dumb down another pretty ripe subject:
God.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in bookstores next year: ``The Complete Idiot's Guide
to the Bible.''

 &HT;    Doctors say drug not for everyone
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than once, doctors had warned Lizette
Coleman that her chances offor a long life were not good. In the
seven years since her first treatment for breast cancer, the
disease had returned time and again, sneaking into organs and bones
from her liver to her lungs until finally she told her doctor that
she wouldn't take chemotherapy for the rest of her life; she would
find a better way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we were going nowhere with chemo,'' says Coleman,
38, of WestlakeWest Lake Hills. ``It froze the disease but it
didn't go away. I told him, 'I'm looking for the cure.'''
</P>
<P>
   In June, on the verge of signing up for an all-natural treatment
in the Bahamas, Coleman learned about Herceptin, the first
genetically engineered drug for breast cancer, and quickly began
traveling once a week to Houston to participate in the small
clinical trial of the drug at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Last
week, the drug hit pharmacy shelves for the first time, an answered
plea for many more women desperate to stanch their spreading
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken 10 percent of the cancer which is in my liver . . .
and on my spine also,'' Coleman says, unable to mask her
hyperactivity, an exuberance she attributes to the Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Her name was drawn in a lottery of women wanting to be among the
first to try Herceptin. ``I always ask the doctor to assure me that
this drug is working and he says 'It's working.'''
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is not the cure for breast cancer, it only works for
about one-fourth of women with the disease and it offers only a
small boost over other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only women whose cancer has come back after multiple
rounds of chemotherapy can get Herceptin. But its release marks a
milestone in the history of cancer drugs, raising the bar for
future research and development. From now on, it's genes they're
targeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of therapy of cancer is going to be in the genetic
management of the disease, in terms of prevention and treatment,''
says William Thames, director of pharmacy at Southwest Regional
Cancer Center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've been waiting for for a long time,'' says
Austin oncologist Robert Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's precedent-setting and . . . based on the molecular
knowledge of a cancer, and I think that makes it different _ as
opposed to a lot of therapies in the past that have been quite
honestly hit-or-miss,'' says Richard Elledge, assistant professor
of medical oncology at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is not the first gene-based drug for cancer, but it is
the most anticipated. An impressive coalition of activists,
bureaucrats and some of the world's top breast oncologists worked
with Genentech Inc., the San Francisco biotechnology firm behind
the drug, to get it in patients' hands quickly. As Herceptin was on
the verge of FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval last
month, a journalist hawked a book on the drug's story on national
television and Genentech employees prepared to work around the
clock to get Herceptin shipped to doctors way ahead of its
anticipated release.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough with Herceptin goes back to discoveries madein
the early 1980s, when scientists identified a gene called HER-2. In
the breast tissue of some women, HER-2 produces too much of a
protein who's job it is to tell the cells to multiply. With too
much of the protein, those cells multiply faster than they should
and cause cancer tumors to grow to dangerous levels. Women with
this genetic defect _ called overexpression _ are more likely to
have an aggressive, life-threatening form of breast cancer that
attacks them early and resists chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering the protein that HER-2 overproduces,
scientists created an antibody that attaches itself to the protein
and blocks the signal to the cell to multiply. By interrupting the
growth of the cells, the antibody can slow or stop the progression
of breast cancer and make the disease more receptive to
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hype about Herceptin growing, many doctors are
urging women to temper their hope.
</P>
<P>
   HER-2 is just one of scores of genes that are factors in the
spread of breast cancer, and it causes overexpression in only 25 to
30 percent of women with breast cancer. The antibody, dubbed
Herceptin by Genentech, will only help women who test positive for
overexpression of the protein, and it is only available to women
whose cancer outlasts multiple rounds of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people who have been involved in this have been
guilty of overdramatizing this event,'' says Elledge, who has
worked with the drug's clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors describe the clinical impact of Herceptin as modest. It
didn't keep many of the women who participated in the clinical
trials from eventually dying, prolonging their lives by an average
of several months. But for those who have had the chance to take
Herceptin, there is no denying its near-mythical impact.
</P>
<P>
   Two months shy of Marsha Geib's fifth year free of cancer _ when
doctors begin to think of the disease as cured _ it reappeared in
her breast and chest wall. The Midland teacher resumed round after
round of chemotherapy, treatments that caused her to lose dangerous
amounts of weight, suffer around-the-clock nausea and lose feeling
in her hands and feet. Eventually, she took to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Geib took her first Herceptin treatment at the
Allison Cancer Center in Midland, hopeful it would be a drug she
could live with. By most accounts, the side effects are relatively
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got three kids and I need to be here,'' said Geib, who is
48. ``I really feel this is going to be the drug and going to help
a lot of us get through these tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   Paz Polanco's breast cancer progressed much faster. In three
years, she's had three kinds of chemotherapy, a mastectomy and a
bone marrow transplant, but none could stop invasions of her spine,
brain and liver. When clinical trials were expanded, Polanco drove
to San Antonio to take Herceptin. Friday, she took her treatment at
the Southwest Regional Cancer Center for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Propped back in a red leather recliner in a row of chairs
reserved for chemotherapy patients, Polanco said she already feels
better than she did during her three bone-aching cycles of
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hope and there is something out there for everyone,''
says Polanco, 50, of Austin. ``If I can be a witness to some of
them, I want to.

 &HT;    Revised `Evil' restores some of Welles' genius
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are artists who are of their time, and there are artists
who are ahead of their time. Then there are those complete
originals who exist in a time of their own. The most tragic of them
all, if only because he was probably the most naturally gifted man
ever to walk on a sound stage, was Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences couldn't get a grip on him any more than movie
executives. The fact that he never had a hit movie, and that he
perversely needed to insult and madden the people who provided the
money to make movies, sealed his professional doom.
</P>
<P>
   Since he's safely dead, Welles' films have rolled out in
restored versions every few years _ ``Citizen Kane,'' ``Othello,''
``It's All True'' and now a new, slightly revised print of the 1958
``Touch of Evil,'' in which all of his jagged, impressionistic
brilliance is on display.
</P>
<P>
   Some great directors are easy to imitate _ look at Alfred
Hitchcock and the nihilistic hash made by people who copy his shots
and chilly misanthropy but can't come near his underlying feeling
for fear.
</P>
<P>
   But Welles is inimitable. ``Touch of Evil'' is 40 years old, but
it could be made, not yesterday or today, but tomorrow _ not that
there's anybody around with the necessary audacity and insolence.
With the exception of some leather-jacketed toughs who seem to have
stepped out of West Side Story, this movie isn't dated at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some background: Welles shot ``Touch of Evil'' in the winter of
1957 quickly, authoritatively, on schedule and on budget in
memorably tawdry Venice, Calif. Universal didn't like the picture
and took it away from Welles after the first preview. In spite of
the fact that it had good performances by two big stars and was in
a commercial genre, Universal treated the movie as if it was
something to be scraped off its corporate shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Welles never made another movie in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The version in circulation for the past 15 years has been the
preview print that Welles didn't have a chance to fine-tune. The
difference in running times between the old print and the new one
is precisely three minutes, and that's because the credits were
taken from the legendary three-minute tracking shot that opens the
film and put at the end.
</P>
<P>
   There is no new footage. What the great editor and sound
designer Walter Murch (``Apocalypse Now,'' ``The Conversation'')
has done is follow a 58-page memo that Welles fired off to
Universal after he was taken off the picture and do some internal
reediting.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Leigh always seemed to disappear in the old version, and
this cut makes a much stronger, symbiotic connection between her
and her newlywed husband, played by Charlton Heston, a Mexican cop
struggling to find a killer in a nightmare border town ruled by
Welles' Sheriff Hank Quinlan.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh and Heston do what they're asked to do very well in their
stock parts. The attention is naturally diverted by the billed and
unbilled cameo parts _ Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Cotton and other
old Welles cronies from the Mercury Theater days.
</P>
<P>
   Welles gave himself the best part. With his rheumy eyes, vast
bulk and unshaven jowls, Hank Quinlan is a grotesque, fascinating
beached whale of a man, a great detective and a bad cop who seems
to have been marinated in corruption. With the exception of his
Falstaff in Chimes at Midnight, it's Welles' best performance.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the new print is an improvement. Janet Leigh doesn't
disappear for half the movie, the plot makes more sense, and the
suspense of the last sequence is ratcheted up a little more. On the
other hand, Henry Mancini's sleazy, evocative score has been
severely cut back, which is a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch of Evil'' remains what it's always been: The best
B-movie ever, by the greatest director of them all.

 &HT;    Frampton still comes alive in concert
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If there were a test to determine
whether you're a rock has-been, Peter Frampton would pass with
flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   Appeared on an album of children's songs? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Moved to Nashville? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Started going bald? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed so much for the 48-year-old rock legend,
whose classic Frampton Comes Alive remains the best-selling live
album of all time, that when he plays Friday at the Coral Sky
Amphitheatre, he'll be opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd, a band that lost
much of its original membership in a 1977 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton survived the Disco Decade, but not without watching his
glory days pass by. But say this for the once shaggy-haired
guitarist: He's got a sense of humor about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Rubik's Cube thing,'' he says with a laugh, likening
his career trajectory to that of another once mighty '70s
pop-culture icon. ``You're just a flavor-of-the-month.''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton's ``flavor'' was a tuneful, guitar-thick rock that
managed to catch the public's attention before the disco beat took
over. It was also a music meant to be heard live. Back then, it was
one man, one guitar _ and a million screaming fans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, 17 million fans, if you count all the people who
purchased Frampton Comes Alive. The album continues to sell a
respectable 100,000 copies yearly _ and that figure should increase
with the recent release of a digitally remastered version.
</P>
<P>
   As Frampton tells it, he always knew the album, which yielded
such hits as Show Me the Way, Baby I Love Your Way and Do You Feel
Like We Do?, would sell well. Just not that well. He recalls that
after its release, he took ``a breather'' before hitting the road
to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went away for eight days or something and came back,'' he
says by phone from Evansville, Ind., where the Lynyrd Skynyrd tour
was set to open. ``And suddenly, we didn't just have one date in
Detroit, we had like five sold-out shows. And this was my first
tour as a headliner.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frampton wasn't a complete rock neophyte. The
British-born musician's career had started in the '60s, when he
joined an English band called the Herd that enjoyed a bit of
teeny-bop fame. Then came a stint with the blues-rock outfit Humble
Pie.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Frampton released four solo albums, setting the
stage for the mass hysteria that would greet Frampton Comes Alive.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton handled the success _ until it started to handle him.
``A lot of money came in quickly, it seemed like it was never going
to stop,'' he says, speaking like the subject of a weepy VH-1
Behind the Music documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Frampton's runaway success? In a word, greed.
``Not my greed,'' he insists, but rather his record company's.
Frampton was cajoled into making another album right away, I'm in
You, which featured the guitarist in a bare-chested pose that
accentuated his sexy, rising star status. Even though it sold more
than three million copies, it was considered a disappointment after
Frampton Comes Alive.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Frampton became the first of rock's boom-or-bust
stars, paving the way for the likes of Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish, who
suffered a similar downward fate after their gazillion-selling
debut, Cracked Rear View.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Alanis Morissette, whose second album (due in
November) will no doubt be measured heavily against her first, the
alt-rock sensation Jagged Little Pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor girl,'' says Frampton with genuine concern. ``I so
empathize with her.''
</P>
<P>
   After I'm in You, Frampton essentially lost his way. First,
there was his disastrous 1978 film debut in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band with the Bee Gees and George Burns. Then came a
series of ill-received albums in the '80s. And finally, just when
Frampton had hopes for jump-starting his career by teaming up with
Humble Pie cofounder Steve Marriott, the musician died in a house
fire in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton takes a, well, meteorological view of his career.
``It's like one of those outdoor thermometers where you've got a
line that pushes it up and down and (says), `This was the high mark
and this was the low mark.'''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a positive side to winding up at the bottom: ''I've
got nothing to lose,'' Frampton says.
</P>
<P>
   And so the rock legend is reinventing himself. Part of the plan
involves a move to Nashville, where Frampton lives with his third
wife and the couple's two kids.
</P>
<P>
   No, Frampton hasn't gone country. But like a lot of one-time
rock stars, he appreciates the fact that the city has ``studios up
the wazoo'' and a wealth of veteran musicians to draw upon for
recordings. ``You can get a classically trained violinist or a
blues guy. Whatever you want, you've got it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although he still sings his classic rockers in concert, he
recently hooked up with Disney for a Winnie the Pooh album. Next up
is a recording of lullabies. ``This is what I really want to do,''
he insists, adding that he wasn't cool with his children until he
appeared on The Simpsons as _ what else? _ a rock has-been at a
concert called Homerpalooza.
</P>
<P>
   As far as maintaining his chops, Frampton is doing quite well,
thank you. Critics have taken note of his recent performances with
Ringo Starr's band and on VH1's Hard Rock Live show. And when he
was on tour this summer, The Dallas Morning News had this to say:
``The singer-guitarist and his three-man band did a good job of
mixing the golden oldies with a few new tunes _ one groovin'
guitar-rocker was better than most of the new Dave Matthews band
disc.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only change in Frampton's life that isn't part of the
plan is his thinning hair. He'd like his long locks back but
accepts the situation like the good-humored rock dinosaur he is.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when one of his kids finds an old picture of
him in all his big-haired glory?
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it like this: `Daddy used to be really good looking.' ''
</P>

 &HT;    Button up, Pratt folks. `Insurance City' is ice cold
 &HT;    By By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ We bid farewell to our hundreds of Pratt
&AMP; Whitney neighbors who, by virtue of the vagaries of corporate
America, find themselves moving to Hartford, Conn., and vicinity.
Good luck, Godspeed.
</P>
<P>
   Moving can be an unsettling business, so we offer a few tips
about life up north:
</P>
<P>
   Hartford's nickname is ``The Insurance City.'' Does that tell
you anything?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a city known for nightlife,'' says Pat Seremet,
columnist at the Hartford Courant.
</P>
<P>
   How about cost of living?
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of Hartford as having New York costs without New York
amenities,'' says Seremet. ``A nice three-bedroom house will cost
around $200,000.''
</P>
<P>
   At least you'll get the change of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Keep those Florida clothes because you'll need them for 8 or 10
weeks during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But you can toss your bathing suit because the nearest beaches
are 40 miles away. Avoid swimming in the Connecticut River. It's
like the Lake Worth Lagoon: long, dirty and full of fish with
lesions.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other relevant considerations:
</P>
<P>
   Waterfront vibrancy _ Neither Hartford nor West Palm Beach has a
functioning waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Pro baseball _ No pro ball club in Hartford, none to speak of in
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   State song _ Connecticut: Yankee Doodle. Florida: Old Folks at
Home. (Now there's truth in advertising.)
</P>
<P>
   Average January temperature _ 42 degrees. This can be deceiving.
Wind-chill factors below zero are common from December to March.
Spend these months looking at old photos of South Florida, where 73
degrees is a cool day in February.
</P>
<P>
   Driving _ Connecticut drivers are mostly polite and unarmed.
Speeders will be caught by state troopers, and speeding fines are
humongous.
</P>
<P>
   Museums _ Mark Twain's house. Hey, it's not New York.
</P>
<P>
   Theater _ Good off-Broadway productions and serious theater at
the Hartford Stage and Bushnell Theater. You'll never miss the
BRITT.
</P>
<P>
   Civic pride _ The annual Hooker Day parade commemorates the
city's founder, Thomas Hooker. Residents throw off inhibitions,
dress as bikers, parade their lawn mowers. Great fun.
</P>
<P>
   Things to do in Hartford on Saturday _ Go to New York or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Student-teacher ratio _ 14.4 to 1. Now there's some good news.
Florida's student-teacher ratio is 19.1 to 1. And Connecticut
teacher salaries average a tad over $50,000 versus $33,000 in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Chief crops _ Christmas trees and mushrooms. Martha Stewart
lives downstate so you'll have plenty of ideas about what to do
with all those old Christmas trees and mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   State tax _ Here, none. There, 4.5 percent top income tax
bracket and property taxes are pretty high.
</P>
<P>
   But forget the high taxes, here's the best thing about Hartford.
No drawbridges.

 &HT;    Muddled `Practical Magic' tosses too much into the pot
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Practical Magic is a lumpy witches' brew of romance, comedy,
horror and twaddle.
</P>
<P>
   With so many batty females flitting about _ albeit attractive
ones _ sitting through the movie is a bit like spending two hours
at a pajama party. The giggles. The hugs. The squeals. The gossip.
The nicknames: ``I love you, Jellybean.''
</P>
<P>
   The horror, indeed!
</P>
<P>
   This is a story of witches in search of love. It's risky
business, since when one of them finds true love, their man croaks,
and not like a frog. It's a curse dating back to the Puritans.
</P>
<P>
   These are basically nice witches, however, and an underlying
theme of the movie is female empowerment _ without the male
bashing. Still, most men in the audience will wish they'd stayed
home to watch that John Wayne flick on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Owens clan has numbered witches for centuries. That's not
easy. Sally and Gillian Owens grew up, well, different. Orphans,
they lived with their spinster aunts in a rambling Victorian house
in a New England fishing village. The aunts taught the girls
``practical magic'' to help them with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sally (Sandra Bullock) wants none of the witchcraft business
when she grows up. She marries happily and has two kids. Alas, the
curse kicks in, and her husband gets run over by a truck.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gillian (Nicole Kidman) enjoys casting
``spells'' over men, although she does so in the traditional way _
by wiggling her hips. She escapes home and lives fast with the
wrong crowd, turning into a bit of a slut along the way.
</P>
<P>
   When she's threatened by one of her seedy beaus (Goran Visnjic),
Sally rides her ``broomstick'' to the rescue. The girls dig into
their bag of witch's tricks to take care of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, namely the beau, isn't done for yet. Talk about
toil and trouble. A chain of spooky events leads to a cop (Aiden
Quinn) showing up on the island to sort things out. This, of
course, gives Sally a chance to brave the curse and find true love
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Alice Hoffman, the movie version takes its
cues from Arsenic and Old Lace, The Exorcist, Bewitched and your
average soap opera. The two eccentric aunts, played by the always
amusing Diane Wiest and Stockard Channing, provide the touch of Old
Lace.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, there's a possession. And an exorcism, during which
the townswomen who once scorned the Owens clan come together in
sisterly solidarity. Bewitched shows up in the form of practical
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the movie is lighthearted without being funny. The
tale takes a bit too long to set up, and too many ingredients are
tossed into the pot to make for a coherent or compelling story
line.
</P>
<P>
   In both a visual and narrative sense, the film has the feeling
of clutter. Director Griffin Dunne rarely shoots a frame that isn't
jumbled or simply busy with people and objects. That's not
necessarily a bad thing, and he does evoke a nostalgic, storybook
feeling to a movie about witches.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bullock and Kidman add more than beauty to their roles. We
know Kidman can get down and dirty from her work in Malice and To
Die For. And Bullock is more mature and determined, less passive or
frazzled _ less cute _ than in past performances
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, a movie with so many different elements
lacks the one ingredient that would make it whole. Practical Magic
lacks magic.

 &HT;    Do you believe in `magick'? this Wiccan lives it
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the Wicked Witch of the West casting the
Stuffed Animal Sweet Dream Spell.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Come to Me Love Spell. Or the Little Bo Peep Spell to
Find Lost Objects.
</P>
<P>
   These are the creations of Silver RavenWolf, the author of Teen
Witch: Wicca for a New Generation (Llewellyn, $12.95, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   The book is a witchcraft primer, something of a Wicca 101 for
kids, with the first two pages devoted to calming down parents who
discover the book in their child's room. (``Okay _ you've picked up
this book, and you're going through minor coronary arrest.'')
</P>
<P>
   RavenWolf, who lives in Mechanicsburg, Pa., has four children,
ages 12 to 19. They helped make up the spells.
</P>
<P>
   Witchcraft, commonly known as ``Wicca'' from the Old English
word for ``witch,'' is similar to Native American nature-based
religions, practioners say. Central to the religion is the Wiccan
Rede: ``Do what you like, so long as you harm none.'' And a rule
most Wiccans follow _ the three-fold law of return _ says that all
deeds, good and evil, return to the doer magnified three times.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes a chapter called ``The craft: What it is and
what it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   What it isn't, RavenWolf says, is flying on brooms, worshipping
the devil (Wiccans do not believe in Satan), attacking people and
animals or eating babies (``Yuckie!'').
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the book consists of spells _ or ``focused prayer''
_ as RavenWolf puts it.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Call Me Spell, and the Don't Call Me Spell (which
involves a piece of paper with the person's name crossed out, a
handful of pepper and several chants). And the Elf Locker Spell, to
keep people from breaking in.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a spell to keep people from bothering you on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it wasn't needed here. RavenWolf answered the
following questions by e-mail. Q. Were you a teen witch? A. Yes. I
began at age 13, finding my own way. My mother died when I was 17,
which pushed me further into alternative studies. Q. With this
book, are you recruiting? A. No. What I'm trying to do is stop the
misinformation on several levels. I tried to write the kind of book
that I would have been looking for when I was 13. Q. Why does
witchcraft suit you better than any other faith? A. I like the
freedom of Wicca, the connection to nature, the ability to work to
enhance my life no matter what the difficulty or goal, and the
balanced masculine-feminine spirituality. Q. How are kids hearing
about witchcraft in the first place? A. In many cases, kids seem to
know that magick (she spells it with a `k' so it's not confused
with a magic act) is inherently real even though they've been told
it is not, and therefore start looking for it. That's what happened
to me. In some cases, the Christian propaganda on how negative the
Craft, actually makes kids curious. You know, don't tell a kid what
not to do because they will therefore do it. So, some come that
way, and then are surprised that the Craft isn't what they'd heard
it was. Then, there have been some major pushes (interestingly
enough) from television and the film media. Book sales on real
magick skyrocketed immediately after the movie The Craft, and then
with Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. With Practical Magic coming up and
the Charmed show, sales will most likely show an improvement. Some
buy just to ``see,'' where others buy to practice. Q. A new TV
show, a new movie about witches _ what makes witches ``cool''? A. I
wish I had an intelligent answer for this one, but I have no idea
why the general community is suddenly focused on WitchCraft. The
religion is very positive, nonthreatening, and we have been working
for the last 20 years to educate the public as to what WitchCraft
is, and is not. Q. What do teens find the hardest to understand
about witchcraft? A. Due to the overabundance of Hollywood trash
material, the hardest thing teens find to understand is the
difference between real magick and Hollywood magick. I've
especially noticed this with the newer generation that has seen
special effects in movies and can't discern that those special
effects are orchestrated. This is scary on many levels _ not just
when dealing with the Craft. Q. How are real witches different from
the ones we see on TV? (Tabatha, Samantha, etc.) A. I wish I could
wiggle my nose and get my housecleaning done. Q. How do your kids
explain witchcraft to people they meet? A. My children have
experienced discrimination about their faith. My oldest daughter
had her arm slammed in a locker by a kid. In the past, some have
taunted my children. One group of children waited after school and
physically accosted my other daughter. Q. What would you say to a
teen who gets into witchcraft because they think it is dark and
wicked? Or who thinks they can use it to jump into Satanism or
something? A. Don't bother. We don't go there. Q. Any statistics,
demographics on how many Americans are into witchcraft and who they
are? Is it becoming more popular, and why? A. The statistics of the
Wiccan/Pagan Press Alliance indicate that approximately one in 10
Americans are involved in some type of alternative spirituality.
(Note: Teen Witch says one in five in the U.S. have dabbled in it.)
The popularity of Sabrina, Charmed, and Practical Magic indicate
that the American public is hungry for a positive way of life that
does not require you to expend money and can fulfill the
spirituality in each individual. Q. In your book, you say that when
people ask what Wicca is, you think of a thousand wonderful things.
What are, say, five of them? A. 1. Wicca provides a way of
self-empowerment and empowerment through the divine. 2. In Wicca,
there is always something to do, regardless of your situation. You
are never left thinking, ``Why me?'' 3. Wicca provides the road to
feminine spirituality. 4. Wicca does not need a middleman to tell
you what is or is not the right thing to do. 5. Wicca is a
life-affirming, nature belief system.

   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Peggy Butera, a practicing witch, doesn't
consider any question too dumb.
</P>
<P>
   She's explaining spells at her Port St. Lucie spinning and

magic,'' she says, sitting at a small table, knotting the fringe on
a shawl.
</P>
<P>
   And a spell to get someone to sleep with you just once?
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be gray magic, not good,'' says Butera, 44.
``Witchcraft is a tool,'' she explains, her voice soft and patient.
``People can put curses on other people, but what goes around comes
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witches, more than most people, think of the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention a witch and most people think of actress Margaret
Hamilton in The Wizard of Oz. Butera's face is not green, her nose
has no warts. She says she's been a witch all her life, but eight
years ago she aligned herself with a mentor, a woman named Tzipora,
who introduced her to the world of spells and ceremonies, harmony
and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Joe, is schooled in witchcraft. Her daughter,
Nicole, 21, has a mentor, and son, Joey, 23, has studied.
</P>
<P>
   Witchcraft is a lifestyle, she explains, involving the study of
traditions and learning how to live in harmony in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a movie about witches comes out, such as the upcoming
Practical Magic, Butera will see it. Soon to follow, she says, is a
new wave of interest in witchcraft. When The Crat came out a few
years ago, she was running a metaphysical store and was flooded
with people asking questions, looking for books.
</P>
<P>
   Butera's 16-member witch ``family'' meets in Port St. Lucie
during full moons and new moons, plus high holidays such as
Samhain, which is commonly linked to Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a celebration of the final harvest marked by the first
killing frost,'' she explains. ``And it's a new year, the start of
a new season.''
</P>
<P>
   Witchcraft's beliefs are similar to North American Indian
traditions and include the use of herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about worshiping the old gods of nature, the Earth,
the moon,'' she explains. ``It has survived for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you do has layers of meaning. The media has
convinced people that spells and magic are the alluring part of
witchcraft.''
</P>
<P>
   A witchcraft ceremony is meant to draw energy from a god and
direct it toward a purpose, such as healing. This ritual can last
two hours and involves chanting and holding hands. A witch's tools
include incense, candles, a ceremonial knife, a bell and statues of
gods and goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   A spell is created, she says, ``if you put enough energy into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She offers an example of a spell she used. Her son Joey wanted
to try skydiving four years ago. She had a typical mother's worries
about the adventure and created a spell to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   When Joey got to the airfield, the money to pay for the lessons
was missing from his glove compartment. He had no choice but to
abandon the plan. But on his way home, the money reappeared in the
glove box.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fear what they don't understand,'' she's saying,
methodically tying knots in the shawl. If being a witch is right
for you, she says, you'll know quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the people who actively start studying witchcraft
and say, `I feel like I'm coming home.'

 &HT;    Film has mighty fine lessons for kids, adults
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be wary of the ads for The Mighty that feature the faces of
Sharon Stone, The X-Files' Gillian Anderson, Harry Dean Stanton and
Gena Rowlands. They are merely supporting players in this
lesson-laden teen movie about growing up a misfit.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Rodman Philbrick's Freak the Mighty, a popular novel
for young adults, it has been brought to the screen with some
success by director Peter Chelsom (Hear My Song), despite its
heavy-handed assaults on our tear ducts and its tangential dips
into melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it is an improvement over the mawkish Simon Birch,
which it superficially resembles. It, too, has a young, disabled
main character, Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin), with a degenerative
disease that causes his internal organs to grow faster than his
bones. But Kevin has learned to cope by emphasizing his mental
facilities, devouring books and wielding a heady vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after moving into a low-rent Cincinnati home with his
doting single mother (Stone), Kevin meets Maxwell Kane (Elden
Henson), a lumpish, slow-witted, brawny but gentle classmate. ``You
need brains, and I need legs,'' reasons Kevin, and so they bond, as
Max hoists Kevin on his shoulders. Together, they roam the streets
as Freak the Mighty, gaining a new respect from their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin becomes Max's reading tutor, turning him on to literature
through the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round
Table. Together, they do good deeds and vanquish bullies, but Max
remains under the dark cloud of his violent felon father.
</P>
<P>
   About midway, the movie loses a lot of its gentle urban fable
quality, trading it in for unlikely melodrama, when the father
escapes from prison and abducts his son. It is the weakest part of
The Mighty, an overwrought segment that almost negates the goodwill
the movie had been building.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the movie hangs on the credibility of the two young
actors, and they deliver impressively. Henson projects a palpable
vulnerability as Max, haunted by dark memories, wounded by cruel
classmates and desperate for friendship. He is well-complemented by
Culkin _ Macauley's younger brother _ as Kevin, who uses his
intelligence and sarcasm as defensive shields, masking an
emotional, as well as physical, fragility underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is sheer earnestness as Kevin's put-upon mother, an
un-glam-orous and rather thankless role that she manages to handle
well enough. Anderson also seems intent on image-changing, playing
an alcoholic housewife with a few scenery-chewing moments. That's
more than you can say for Rowlands and Stanton, who are all but
irrelevant as Max's doting, and often puzzled, grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to admire the way The Mighty doesn't fit into any of
the usual Hollywood formulas, though that was undoubtedly a factor
in its sitting on the studio's shelf for almost a year. Surely, it
is intended to reach a wider audience than young teens, but the
heavy-handedness of Charles Leavitt's screenplay argues against
that.
</P>
<P>
   For youngsters, there are messages galore about the importance
of friendship, the trap of assumptions about the disabled and the
value of reading and using one's imagination. Come to think of it,
those aren't bad notions for adults to consider.

 &HT;    Doctors say drug not for everyone
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than once, doctors had warned Lizette
Coleman that her chances offor a long life were not good. In the
seven years since her first treatment for breast cancer, the
disease had returned time and again, sneaking into organs and bones
from her liver to her lungs until finally she told her doctor that
she wouldn't take chemotherapy for the rest of her life; she would
find a better way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we were going nowhere with chemo,'' says Coleman,
38, of WestlakeWest Lake Hills. ``It froze the disease but it
didn't go away. I told him, 'I'm looking for the cure.'''
</P>
<P>
   In June, on the verge of signing up for an all-natural treatment
in the Bahamas, Coleman learned about Herceptin, the first
genetically engineered drug for breast cancer, and quickly began
traveling once a week to Houston to participate in the small
clinical trial of the drug at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Last
week, the drug hit pharmacy shelves for the first time, an answered
plea for many more women desperate to stanch their spreading
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken 10 percent of the cancer which is in my liver . . .
and on my spine also,'' Coleman says, unable to mask her
hyperactivity, an exuberance she attributes to the Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Her name was drawn in a lottery of women wanting to be among the
first to try Herceptin. ``I always ask the doctor to assure me that
this drug is working and he says 'It's working.'''
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is not the cure for breast cancer, it only works for
about one-fourth of women with the disease and it offers only a
small boost over other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only women whose cancer has come back after multiple
rounds of chemotherapy can get Herceptin. But its release marks a
milestone in the history of cancer drugs, raising the bar for
future research and development. From now on, it's genes they're
targeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of therapy of cancer is going to be in the genetic
management of the disease, in terms of prevention and treatment,''
says William Thames, director of pharmacy at Southwest Regional
Cancer Center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've been waiting for for a long time,'' says
Austin oncologist Robert Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's precedent-setting and . . . based on the molecular
knowledge of a cancer, and I think that makes it different _ as
opposed to a lot of therapies in the past that have been quite
honestly hit-or-miss,'' says Richard Elledge, assistant professor
of medical oncology at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is not the first gene-based drug for cancer, but it is
the most anticipated. An impressive coalition of activists,
bureaucrats and some of the world's top breast oncologists worked
with Genentech Inc., the San Francisco biotechnology firm behind
the drug, to get it in patients' hands quickly. As Herceptin was on
the verge of FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval last
month, a journalist hawked a book on the drug's story on national
television and Genentech employees prepared to work around the
clock to get Herceptin shipped to doctors way ahead of its
anticipated release.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough with Herceptin goes back to discoveries madein
the early 1980s, when scientists identified a gene called HER-2. In
the breast tissue of some women, HER-2 produces too much of a
protein who's job it is to tell the cells to multiply. With too
much of the protein, those cells multiply faster than they should
and cause cancer tumors to grow to dangerous levels. Women with
this genetic defect _ called overexpression _ are more likely to
have an aggressive, life-threatening form of breast cancer that
attacks them early and resists chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering the protein that HER-2 overproduces,
scientists created an antibody that attaches itself to the protein
and blocks the signal to the cell to multiply. By interrupting the
growth of the cells, the antibody can slow or stop the progression
of breast cancer and make the disease more receptive to
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hype about Herceptin growing, many doctors are
urging women to temper their hope.
</P>
<P>
   HER-2 is just one of scores of genes that are factors in the
spread of breast cancer, and it causes overexpression in only 25 to
30 percent of women with breast cancer. The antibody, dubbed
Herceptin by Genentech, will only help women who test positive for
overexpression of the protein, and it is only available to women
whose cancer outlasts multiple rounds of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people who have been involved in this have been
guilty of overdramatizing this event,'' says Elledge, who has
worked with the drug's clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors describe the clinical impact of Herceptin as modest. It
didn't keep many of the women who participated in the clinical
trials from eventually dying, prolonging their lives by an average
of several months. But for those who have had the chance to take
Herceptin, there is no denying its near-mythical impact.
</P>
<P>
   Two months shy of Marsha Geib's fifth year free of cancer _ when
doctors begin to think of the disease as cured _ it reappeared in
her breast and chest wall. The Midland teacher resumed round after
round of chemotherapy, treatments that caused her to lose dangerous
amounts of weight, suffer around-the-clock nausea and lose feeling
in her hands and feet. Eventually, she took to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Geib took her first Herceptin treatment at the
Allison Cancer Center in Midland, hopeful it would be a drug she
could live with. By most accounts, the side effects are relatively
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got three kids and I need to be here,'' said Geib, who is
48. ``I really feel this is going to be the drug and going to help
a lot of us get through these tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   Paz Polanco's breast cancer progressed much faster. In three
years, she's had three kinds of chemotherapy, a mastectomy and a
bone marrow transplant, but none could stop invasions of her spine,
brain and liver. When clinical trials were expanded, Polanco drove
to San Antonio to take Herceptin. Friday, she took her treatment at
the Southwest Regional Cancer Center for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Propped back in a red leather recliner in a row of chairs
reserved for chemotherapy patients, Polanco said she already feels
better than she did during her three bone-aching cycles of
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hope and there is something out there for everyone,''
says Polanco, 50, of Austin. ``If I can be a witness to some of
them, I want to.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Mentor's belief in us forces us to believe in ourselves
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hear they're doing a remake of All About Eve, the 1950 classic
about the fawning starlet who ingratiates herself to the reigning
diva, Bette Davis, only to dethrone her. It's a great movie, even
if it bears no resemblance to the real working relationships of
women. But who needs reality? Who would flock to a flick called
Mentors?
</P>
<P>
   In Eve's universe, I should be hot-pink with chagrin right now,
because my former boss, one Laura Archer Pulfer, has beaten me to
the punch in publishing her first book.
</P>
<P>
   During the eight years I worked for her at Cincinnati Magazine,
Laura wasn't even a full-time writer. Her official title was editor
and publisher. Her unofficial titles were myriad: Friend.
Cheerleader. Wordsmith. Giver of good counsel. Keeper of the
talking toilet seat. (Trust me, it was hilarious.)
</P>
<P>
   Yep, I should be steaming mad. Not only has my former editor
written a book, she has written a wonderful book, funny and wise
and pointed and passionate (especially when the subject is kids).
You can catch her Saturday at 2 p.m. at Books &AMP; Co. in Kettering,
sharing selections from I Beg to Differ: Politically Incorrect,
Proudly Midwestern, Potentially Funny, a collection of her columns
from National Public Radio and the Cincinnati Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I thrilled for Laura instead of properly jealous? It must
be her fault. She was my editor during my formative years in this
business, and she should have taught me how to get ahead by
stepping all over people and taking credit for their work. Instead
she went around town telling everybody that her job consisted of
taking ``prolonged lunches and raising Chia pets and collecting
congratulations'' for the accomplishments of her staff. Whenever
something went right, it was to our credit; when something went
wrong, it was her responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, when she called the staff together to tell us
about her breast cancer diagnosis, she was the one who ended up
reassuring us. Today, as a vocal and eloquent survivor, she is
still the one doing the reassuring, although now in very public
forums _ in her columns, before packed auditoriums and even once on
Fountain Square. ``When I first got breast cancer, I never thought,
'Why me?' '' she said. ``I understood 'Why me?' It was to be as
open as possible and to show up looking as healthy as possible any
time I'm asked.''
</P>
<P>
   The message around Cincinnati Magazine was clear: Be a good
person first, lead a full life outside the office, and it will
follow, as the night the day, you will be a good employee. Maybe
all of us alumni should file a class-action suit against Laura, or
at least act real snotty next time we see her, for giving such bum
advice for women of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, maybe nobody ever set her the right example.
Consider the book's dedication: ``To the memory of my first editor
and mentor, Hope Strong, who taught me what I needed to know to
make my living as a writer. And to my mother, Betty Rose Archer,
who taught me everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong hired Laura straight out of high school to work at the
Lima News during her college summers. That first day, the editor
``leaned across the desk and said, 'Listen, Toots, I just want you
to know this ain't no tea and cookies outfit,' '' Laura recalls.
Strong sported New York fashions and wrote about issues such as
battered women long before it was stylish to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Strong must have seen some raw talent in the teen, ``but believe
you me it was raw ,'' Laura said. ``It made all the difference . .
. having an editor who was kind but always made me do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. For a writer, it makes all the difference, having
an editor whose belief in you forces you to believe in yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, there was a woman like that in my life
once, too.

 By SUSAN GOUGH HENLY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Forged with gold-rush money at the height of the Victorian era,
Melbourne is graced with grand public buildings, tree-lined
boulevards and decorous parks. While it may be the most British of
Australian cities, it also has one of the world's largest Greek
cities, a sizable Vietnamese quarter, neighborhood markets that
rival those in Paris, and a palm-fringed waterfront akin to Venice
Beach, Calif. Decades ago, Italian immigrants brought espresso to
its cafes. Today its restaurants are sophisticated and multiethnic,
drawing from the rich surrounding farmlands, vineyards and coastal
waters.
 &HT;    Trams still rattle along the middle of streets on the way to
distinctive neighborhoods that ring the city center:
fashion-conscious South Yarra, funky St. Kilda by the bay, the
terrace houses of Albert Park, retro Fitzroy and the bargain
shopping haven of Richmond, to name a few.
 &HT;    The people here are generally easygoing, but when it comes to
sports _ be it Aussie Rules football, the Melbourne Cup horse race,
the Australian Grand Prix auto race or the Australian Open tennis
tournament _ they display a rare fanaticism. Long before Sydney,
Melbourne was the first Australian city to host the Olympic Games
in 1956.
 &HT;    Melbourne's theater and live music scenes are among the most
vibrant in the country, and the National Gallery of Victoria has
one of the strongest art collections in the Southern Hemisphere.
With the Australian dollar near its 12-year low, this is an ideal
time for Americans to visit.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The 13th Melbourne Festival, Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, is a celebration
of international and Australian performing and visual arts and free
street festivals, with this year's themes focusing on the family,
migration and indigenous culture. Highlights include ``Paintings
from Utopia'' by the Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye at the
National Gallery of Victoria, Sept. 8 to Nov. 22, and the
French-Albanian company Ballet Preljocaj's erotic ``Romeo and
Juliet'' set in a police state, Oct. 29 to Nov. 1.
 &HT;    Oz Opera and Company B Belvoir presents its remake of Leonard
Bernstein's ``Trouble in Tahiti'' Oct. 22 to 25, and performances
of the Abbey Theatre of Dublin's ``Secret Fall of Constance Wilde''
are Oct. 28 to Nov. 1. ``Teatro,'' Oct. 21 to 24, by the Italo-,
Greek- and Hispanic-Australian IRAA Theater and Canto Coro,
explores the stories of people living far from their countries of
birth searching for a home that does not exist. Tickets:
Ticketmaster, (61-3) 9256-8800.
 &HT;    The Victoria Racing Club's Spring Racing Carnival at Flemington
Racecourse, Oct. 31 to Nov. 7, is Australia's biggest annual
international sporting event, the culmination of which is the
Foster's Melbourne Cup.
 &HT;    More than a horse race, it is a 138-year-old tradition that
brings the nation to a stop (this year at 3:20 p.m. on Nov. 3) and
is full of all the pomp and fashion of its British counterparts.
Tickets, $48 reserved seating in lawn stand, $15 general admission
(based on $1.56 Australian to the United States dollar), through
Ticketmaster at www.ticketmaster.com.au.
 &HT;    Wine Australia, Oct. 22 to 27 at the Melbourne Convention and
Exhibition Center, offers a chance to sample more than 8,000 wines
from 350 Australian wineries, representing 42 Australian winemaking
regions. Visitors can meet the winemakers and match the wines with
the country's diverse cuisines. Tickets are $16 a day. Information:
(61-8) 8364-1122.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Melbourne's city center encompasses a wide range of architecture
and shopping. For each of its major east-west streets there is a
bustling lane in between worth exploring. Stop by the 19th-century
Old Treasury Building, State Houses of Parliament, and the
elaborate Princess Theater on Spring Street and wander into the
nearby Fitzroy Gardens.
 &HT;    Collins Street offers the ultra-chic George's Department Store
(No. 162), the ornate old-world Block's shopping arcade (No. 282)
and a world of diversity in between. Slip into Flinders Lane for
the galleries; several specialize in Aboriginal art. Little Bourke
Street is in the heart of the city's Chinatown. Free city-circle
trams (painted burgundy and gold) run every 10 minutes and pass
many of the major sights, taking about 40 minutes to make the
circuit.
 &HT;    With almost 1,000 merchants in a series of landmark buildings at
the corner of Elizabeth and Victoria streets, the Queen Victoria
Market is a multicultural food mecca and a good place to pick up
picnic fare. Trading hours are Tuesday and Thursday 6 a.m. to 2
p.m., Friday 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sunday 9
a.m. to 4 p.m. Two-hour tours ($9.60 or $11.50) are offered

which winds through the heart of Melbourne. Southgate River Tours,
(61-3) 9682-5711, takes up to 12 passengers (every hour from 11
a.m.; $9) up to Herring Island sculpture park in a spit 'n polish
1918 steamboat. The sleek white Spirit of Melbourne, (61-3)
9696-0311, offers lunch ($29, departing 1 p.m.) and dinner cruises
($42, 7:30 p.m.). Both boats leave from Southgate and reservations
are essential.
 &HT;    Melbourne's tranquil Royal Botanic Gardens, bordering the Yarra
on Alexandra Avenue, offer a diverse selection of native and
imported plants. Highlights include the rain forest walk, the
eucalypts and the fern gully (where you may hear flying foxes
making a racket in the trees). A delightful teahouse sits beside
one of the lakes. Free tours depart from the National Herbarium (F
Gate) at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Sunday to Friday; (61-3) 9252-2300.
 WHERE TO STAY

Victorian terrace houses in the delightful inner-city suburb of
Albert Park. Guests stay in one of three charming rooms ($80 to
$87), all with private bath and decorated in Laura Ashley-style
prints, and indulge in full cooked breakfasts.
 &HT;    The Olembia Hotel, a restored 23-room Edwardian guesthouse at 96
Barkly Street, in beachside St. Kilda, (61-3) 9537-1412, fax (61-3)
9537-1600, is one of the best bargains around if you don't mind
sharing one of the black-and-white tiled bathrooms. Guests can

 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The restaurant of the moment, Circa, The Prince, 2 Acland
Street, St. Kilda, (61-3) 9536-1122, is dramatic with its designer
curtains, minimalist with its spare courtyard and large potted
olive trees.
 &HT;    The British chef, Michael Lambie, offers seared scallops with
potato salad and truffle oil before an entree such as bouillabaisse
with saffron potatoes and rouille, a garlicky sauce, and a
caramelized pear tarte tatin for dessert. Dinner for two with wine
is around $110. Currently serving lunch Friday and Sunday, dinner
Tuesday through Sunday; starting Oct. 5, lunch daily except

seen. The food is classic with strong flavors delivered in delicate

rouille and parmesan cheese followed by a duck medley ``pot au
feu,'' and, perhaps, a waffle served with chocolate ice cream and

and is also open for breakfast Monday to Friday.
 &HT;    Guernica, 257 Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, (61-3) 9416-0969, looks
and feels like a Left Bank bistro, but its food is an exotic
melange of cultural influences that the restaurant calls modern
Australian.
 &HT;    It offers, for starters, drunken chicken with deep-fried Asian
cole slaw and chile mayonnaise followed by prosciutto- and
olive-basted lamb cutlets with spinach, caramelized garlic, field
mushrooms and goat cheese. Desserts might include a Jerusalem
artichoke and vanilla-bean creme brulee. Dinner for two with wine,
$70. Lunch daily except Saturday, dinner every night.
 &HT;    Toofey's, at 162 Elgin Street, in the inner-city Italian
neighborhood of Carlton, (61-3) 9347-9838, is arguably Melbourne's
finest seafood restaurant.

 By SUSAN GOUGH HENLY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Forged with gold-rush money at the height of the Victorian era,
Melbourne is graced with grand public buildings, tree-lined
boulevards and decorous parks. While it may be the most British of
Australian cities, it also has one of the world's largest Greek
cities, a sizable Vietnamese quarter, neighborhood markets that
rival those in Paris, and a palm-fringed waterfront akin to Venice
Beach, Calif. Decades ago, Italian immigrants brought espresso to
its cafes. Today its restaurants are sophisticated and multiethnic,
drawing from the rich surrounding farmlands, vineyards and coastal
waters.
 &HT;    Trams still rattle along the middle of streets on the way to
distinctive neighborhoods that ring the city center:
fashion-conscious South Yarra, funky St. Kilda by the bay, the
terrace houses of Albert Park, retro Fitzroy and the bargain
shopping haven of Richmond, to name a few.
 &HT;    The people here are generally easygoing, but when it comes to
sports _ be it Aussie Rules football, the Melbourne Cup horse race,
the Australian Grand Prix auto race or the Australian Open tennis
tournament _ they display a rare fanaticism. Long before Sydney,
Melbourne was the first Australian city to host the Olympic Games
in 1956.
 &HT;    Melbourne's theater and live music scenes are among the most
vibrant in the country, and the National Gallery of Victoria has
one of the strongest art collections in the Southern Hemisphere.
With the Australian dollar near its 12-year low, this is an ideal
time for Americans to visit.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The 13th Melbourne Festival, Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, is a celebration
of international and Australian performing and visual arts and free
street festivals, with this year's themes focusing on the family,
migration and indigenous culture. Highlights include ``Paintings
from Utopia'' by the Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye at the
National Gallery of Victoria, Sept. 8 to Nov. 22, and the
French-Albanian company Ballet Preljocaj's erotic ``Romeo and
Juliet'' set in a police state, Oct. 29 to Nov. 1.
 &HT;    Oz Opera and Company B Belvoir presents its remake of Leonard
Bernstein's ``Trouble in Tahiti'' Oct. 22 to 25, and performances
of the Abbey Theatre of Dublin's ``Secret Fall of Constance Wilde''
are Oct. 28 to Nov. 1. ``Teatro,'' Oct. 21 to 24, by the Italo-,
Greek- and Hispanic-Australian IRAA Theater and Canto Coro,
explores the stories of people living far from their countries of
birth searching for a home that does not exist. Tickets:
Ticketmaster, (61-3) 9256-8800.
 &HT;    The Victoria Racing Club's Spring Racing Carnival at Flemington
Racecourse, Oct. 31 to Nov. 7, is Australia's biggest annual
international sporting event, the culmination of which is the
Foster's Melbourne Cup.
 &HT;    More than a horse race, it is a 138-year-old tradition that
brings the nation to a stop (this year at 3:20 p.m. on Nov. 3) and
is full of all the pomp and fashion of its British counterparts.
Tickets, $48 reserved seating in lawn stand, $15 general admission
(based on $1.56 Australian to the United States dollar), through
Ticketmaster at www.ticketmaster.com.au.
 &HT;    Wine Australia, Oct. 22 to 27 at the Melbourne Convention and
Exhibition Center, offers a chance to sample more than 8,000 wines
from 350 Australian wineries, representing 42 Australian winemaking
regions. Visitors can meet the winemakers and match the wines with
the country's diverse cuisines. Tickets are $16 a day. Information:
(61-8) 8364-1122.

either Frommer's or Fodor's, the giants in the field.
 &HT;    But it's no coincidence that their mutual success is in large
part due to one man, Michael Spring. The former editorial director
of Fodor's is the current publisher of Macmillan Travel and its
flagship imprint, Frommer's, which claims to be the fastest-growing
travel-guide series in the United States.
 &HT;    Reshaping the two biggest guidebook names in the United States
has made Spring something of an expert on what traveling readers
are looking for.
 &HT;    ``Readers want to feel special,'' Spring says. ``They want to
know about traditional sites but in a fresh way. They want to have
the special moments you usually don't find in guidebooks. It's fine
to tell people about the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, but the
memories they come home with are private moments. Sitting on a
bench in St. James Park watching a game of bowls or walking along
the Seine at 6:30 in the morning and coming upon Notre Dame. The
real challenge is when you're doing a whole series of guides.''
 &HT;    Spring should know. Before coming to Macmillan in 1994, he spent
seven years as the editorial director of Fodor's Travel
Publications.
 &HT;    Spring's efforts to remake that guidebook series were widely
acclaimed in the industry. Now he's attempting to do the same thing
with Frommer's, offering guidebooks to an increasingly segmented
market.
 &HT;    ``There's no longer a single traveler,'' Spring says. ``There
are different series to satisfy the needs of different travelers.
Frommer's had a reputation for being geriatric, for being safe and
school-marmy. We've rewritten everything for today's more savvy and
curious traveler. We're taking people off the beaten track. There's
a lot of outdoor information, on things like bike trips and sea
kayaking. People want to come home with more than a tan.''
 &HT;    There are 17 distinct series under the Frommer's imprint.
There's ``Frommer's Complete Guides,'' comprehensive guides aimed
at both leisure and business travelers. ``Frommer's Portable
Guides'' are smaller and less-expensive guides for short-term
visitors. There's also ``Frommer's Irreverent Guides.''
 &HT;    ``You had student guides and guides for grownups but nothing for
savvy people in their 20s and 30s who hated guidebooks,'' Spring
says. ``These guides are unabashedly honest. They do knock
things.''
 &HT;    The ``Frommer's $-a-Day Guides'' are for value-oriented
travelers who want bang for their buck.
 &HT;    ``When Arthur Frommer started these guides in 1957 with `Europe
on $5 a Day,''' Spring says, ``his idea was not to travel cheaply
so much as to make travel a process of discovery, of getting inside
a culture. He just felt you could do it best on low budget.''
 &HT;    Arthur Frommer sold his interest in the series years ago, but
his name remains. Spring says that ``We're trying to put back that
sense of adventure and discovery in the books. So that you can have
adventure on whatever budget you have.''
 &HT;    Spring prides Frommer's on publishing exact prices and for
publishing annual editions, which few competitors do.
 &HT;    ``It takes almost a year to put together a guidebook and it's
out there for one year,'' Spring notes. ``That means that the
material is no more than two years out of date. In other guides,
the material is likely to be three or four years out of date. It's
enormously expensive to update, which is why many people only
publish a new edition every three or four years. The information is
incredibly perishable, but it's what people count on us most for.
We provide the details that let you have a worry-free vacation.''
 &HT;    Speaking of vacation, Spring had just returned from China, a
visit he said combined both work and play. His own sense of
adventure leads him to go on wilderness camping trips with his
family, to go dog sledding in Alaska or hiking with his kids at the
Arctic Circle.
 &HT;    He also has a fondness for trips he's done to Iceland, Tuscany,
Provence and Morocco, admitting that there are a lot of places he
hasn't been to yet _ places that he insists his writers live in
before they write about them.
 &HT;    And for anyone who has despaired of good, honest guidebook
writing, they should have a chat with Spring.
 &HT;    ``I love good writing,'' he says. ``I used to be an English
teacher. If someone says to me, `So what if a sentence has mixed
metaphors, it's just a travel guide,' I see purple. Travel writing
can be beautiful. And there's also the matter of honesty. Most
travel writing is the `What can I say that's nice variety.' It's
promotional. But if people want to be sold on destinations they can
get brochures. It's not our job to say nice things. We always
include the good and the bad.''
 &HT;    As for pundits who've predicted the demise of guidebooks because
of the advance of electronic media, Spring strongly disagrees.
 &HT;    ``They're not endangered by the Internet,'' Spring insists.
``When people travel, they want to have a book with them. But for
guidebooks to survive, they need to make people feel privileged.''

 &HT;    Read a good guidebook lately?

</P>
<P>
   Whether you're traveling solo or in a group, there are
discounts, deals and special offers just for the mature traveler.
Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRITRAIL SENIOR PARTY PASS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BritRail hasn't forgotten a thing for mature travelers _
including a Senior Party Pass for those ages 60 and older that's
priced as much as 25 percent lower than the regular BritRail Senior
Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Party Pass permits each senior in a party of three to travel
any four days in a month first class for $224, or $202 for each of
four people in a party. These rates compare to $269 for a single
senior BritRail pass.
</P>
<P>
   To travel any eight days in one month the three-party price is
$325, or $293 for four people (compared to $390 for an individual).
</P>
<P>
   The price per senior in a three-person party for one month?
$608; the four-person Party Pass price is $548.
</P>
<P>
   It's all detailed in ``Britain's Heritage Cities,'' a brochure
that helps the independent traveler plan routes and stops for major
events in the cities and to decide which treasure houses and
gardens are available.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the end of October in Stratford-on-Avon is the
English Music Festival, and from November through the end of
September 1999 the Royal Shakespeare Company will be performing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of November, unique Christmas shopping is promised in
York's City Centre.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy of the brochure, call (888) 424-3731, or visit their
Web site at www.raileurope.com.
</P>
<P>
   To book, call your travel agent or BritRail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DELTA FLIES SKYWISE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delta is flying high with its updated program for mature
travelers. Now called The Delta SkyWise program (formerly ``Senior
Select Savings Plus''), those ages 62 and older can enroll for $40
to get discounted zone airfares to nearly 300 U.S. destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If you're accustomed to flying with friends or relatives, you
can also enroll up to three companions of any age for $25 a person.
</P>
<P>
   While the pricing is good, there are restrictions, including
capacity control, non-refundable fares, blackout dates and such.
Key provisions call for reservations made 14 days in advance with
tickets purchased at the time, round-trip purchase and a required
Saturday-night stay.
</P>
<P>
   Travel must be booked by June 12, 1999, started by June 26,
1999, and completed by June 30, 1999. If you had enrolled in Senior
Select Savings Plus, that program is cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There are also deal sweeteners: discounts at Radisson and
Swissotel hotels, Alamo, Avis, Hertz and National rental cars, and
Delta Queen, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean cruise lines as well as
select Delta Vacation packages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new SkyWise program, Delta still offers 10
percent discounts for those ages 62 and older on most posted fares
and has the ``Young at Heart'' senior coupon books that cost $596
for four coupons.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call Delta or visit their Web site at
www.delta-air.com/SkyWise. To enroll, call (800) 325-3750 and be
prepared to give your date of birth, SkyMiles number, Social
Security number and credit-card information.
</P>
<P>
   If you are enrolling companions, you'll need their SkyMiles
numbers and dates of birth, too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COAST TO COAST FOR $254 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak offers many ways to travel America, but its Fall Explore
America Fares provide a leisurely way to travel coast to coast and
back for about $254, which includes the 15 percent senior discount
for travelers ages 62 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket structure starts with the regular fare for traveling
one region at $179, two adjacent regions at $239 or the entire
country at $299. If you want to explore just Florida, the price is
$69.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers take 15 percent off these rates, as they can on
all full-fare Amtrak tickets, or special one-way fares.
</P>
<P>
   The Fall Explore America rates are on sale through Nov. 14 for
travel through Dec. 17. Tickets are non-refundable and require
14-day advance purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Work with your travel agent or call (800) 872-7245. You can also
visit their Web site at www.amtrak.com.

<P>
   &UR; ALASKA SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gray Line of Alaska makes seeing the Great State easier _ and
cheaper _ for those traveling on their own or adding extra
sightseeing days before or after cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Two popular tours eligible for the senior discounts are the
Portage Glacier Cruise aboard the mv Ptarmigan, south of Anchorage,
and a visit to Gold Dredge No. 8 at Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   The three Portage Glacier tours are a 10-hour tour that combines
the highlights of Anchorage with the cruise for $77; a seven-hour
cruise tour that includes a stop at Alyeska Ski Resort for an
optional tram ride to the top of the mountain for $60; and a
one-hour tour for those with their own transportation to the cruise
dock for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Dredge No. 8, the only dredge open to the public and a
National Historic Site, has two tours eligible for the senior
discount.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour Discover the Gold Tour for $57 includes a miner's
lunch and a chance to try your hand at panning gold. An eight-hour
tour that combines a tour of the Dredge site and a four-hour
Sternwheeler Cruise on the Chena and Tanana rivers costs $57.
</P>
<P>
   A senior discount of 10 percent is applied to all sightseeing
tours offered by Gray Line of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   All these tours are available from mid-May to the end of
September. For reservations, call (800) 544-2206. For brochures,
call (800) 628-2449.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRY BEFORE YOU BUY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For seniors looking to try an active adult community lifestyle,
Del Webb's Vacation Getaway packages have been extended to their
Spruce Creek Communities in Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   For $99, a mature traveler age 55 or older can stay three days

the recreational amenities like the fitness center, bocce,
billiards, tennis courts and swimming pool. Travel companions must
be 18 or older. For reservation information, call (888) 932-2639.
</P>
<P>
   Many Del Webb communities in tourist markets such as Phoenix,
Ariz.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Hilton Head, S.C.; Georgetown, Texas; and
Palm Desert, Calif., offer similar Vacation Getaway programs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ISRAEL'S HOTEL DEAL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Dan Hotel chain offers its Silver Star promotion at Dan
Panorama in Tel Aviv, Dan Panorama in Haifa or the new Dan Pearl in
Jerusalem for guests ages 65 and older.

food bills through April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This offer is valid Sunday-Thursday in Haifa and Jerusalem and
weekends in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Contact your travel agent or call (800) 223-7773.
 &UR; ----- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For mature travelers it's the best time of life to get up and
go! The aim of this column is to help make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the bargains and special trips that will be
reported on are for 49ers-plus, the information can help younger
travelers spot values too.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers should remember that wherever they go, whatever
they do, they should always ask for the senior-citizen discount,
even if one isn't posted. That's one of the main privileges of
being among the ``chronologically gifted'' who are 50 or over. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Whether you're traveling solo or in a group, there are
discounts, deals and special offers just for the mature traveler.
Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRITRAIL SENIOR PARTY PASS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BritRail hasn't forgotten a thing for mature travelers _
including a Senior Party Pass for those ages 60 and older that's
priced as much as 25 percent lower than the regular BritRail Senior
Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Party Pass permits each senior in a party of three to travel
any four days in a month first class for $224, or $202 for each of
four people in a party. These rates compare to $269 for a single
senior BritRail pass.
</P>
<P>
   To travel any eight days in one month the three-party price is
$325, or $293 for four people (compared to $390 for an individual).
</P>
<P>
   The price per senior in a three-person party for one month?
$608; the four-person Party Pass price is $548.
</P>
<P>
   It's all detailed in ``Britain's Heritage Cities,'' a brochure
that helps the independent traveler plan routes and stops for major
events in the cities and to decide which treasure houses and
gardens are available.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the end of October in Stratford-on-Avon is the
English Music Festival, and from November through the end of
September 1999 the Royal Shakespeare Company will be performing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of November, unique Christmas shopping is promised in
York's City Centre.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy of the brochure, call (888) 424-3731, or visit their
Web site at www.raileurope.com.
</P>
<P>
   To book, call your travel agent or BritRail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DELTA FLIES SKYWISE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delta is flying high with its updated program for mature
travelers. Now called The Delta SkyWise program (formerly ``Senior
Select Savings Plus''), those ages 62 and older can enroll for $40
to get discounted zone airfares to nearly 300 U.S. destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If you're accustomed to flying with friends or relatives, you
can also enroll up to three companions of any age for $25 a person.
</P>
<P>
   While the pricing is good, there are restrictions, including
capacity control, non-refundable fares, blackout dates and such.
Key provisions call for reservations made 14 days in advance with
tickets purchased at the time, round-trip purchase and a required
Saturday-night stay.
</P>
<P>
   Travel must be booked by June 12, 1999, started by June 26,
1999, and completed by June 30, 1999. If you had enrolled in Senior
Select Savings Plus, that program is cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There are also deal sweeteners: discounts at Radisson and
Swissotel hotels, Alamo, Avis, Hertz and National rental cars, and
Delta Queen, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean cruise lines as well as
select Delta Vacation packages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new SkyWise program, Delta still offers 10
percent discounts for those ages 62 and older on most posted fares
and has the ``Young at Heart'' senior coupon books that cost $596
for four coupons.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call Delta or visit their Web site at
www.delta-air.com/SkyWise. To enroll, call (800) 325-3750 and be
prepared to give your date of birth, SkyMiles number, Social
Security number and credit-card information.
</P>
<P>
   If you are enrolling companions, you'll need their SkyMiles
numbers and dates of birth, too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COAST TO COAST FOR $254 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak offers many ways to travel America, but its Fall Explore
America Fares provide a leisurely way to travel coast to coast and
back for about $254, which includes the 15 percent senior discount
for travelers ages 62 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket structure starts with the regular fare for traveling
one region at $179, two adjacent regions at $239 or the entire
country at $299. If you want to explore just Florida, the price is
$69.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers take 15 percent off these rates, as they can on
all full-fare Amtrak tickets, or special one-way fares.
</P>
<P>
   The Fall Explore America rates are on sale through Nov. 14 for
travel through Dec. 17. Tickets are non-refundable and require
14-day advance purchase.

   Gray Line of Alaska makes seeing the Great State easier _ and
cheaper _ for those traveling on their own or adding extra
sightseeing days before or after cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Two popular tours eligible for the senior discounts are the
Portage Glacier Cruise aboard the mv Ptarmigan, south of Anchorage,
and a visit to Gold Dredge No. 8 at Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   The three Portage Glacier tours are a 10-hour tour that combines
the highlights of Anchorage with the cruise for $77; a seven-hour
cruise tour that includes a stop at Alyeska Ski Resort for an
optional tram ride to the top of the mountain for $60; and a
one-hour tour for those with their own transportation to the cruise
dock for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Dredge No. 8, the only dredge open to the public and a
National Historic Site, has two tours eligible for the senior
discount.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour Discover the Gold Tour for $57 includes a miner's
lunch and a chance to try your hand at panning gold. An eight-hour
tour that combines a tour of the Dredge site and a four-hour
Sternwheeler Cruise on the Chena and Tanana rivers costs $57.
</P>
<P>
   A senior discount of 10 percent is applied to all sightseeing
tours offered by Gray Line of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   All these tours are available from mid-May to the end of
September. For reservations, call (800) 544-2206. For brochures,

</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRY BEFORE YOU BUY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For seniors looking to try an active adult community lifestyle,
Del Webb's Vacation Getaway packages have been extended to their
Spruce Creek Communities in Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>

the recreational amenities like the fitness center, bocce,
billiards, tennis courts and swimming pool. Travel companions must

Palm Desert, Calif., offer similar Vacation Getaway programs.

 &UR; ----- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For mature travelers it's the best time of life to get up and
go! The aim of this column is to help make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the bargains and special trips that will be
reported on are for 49ers-plus, the information can help younger
travelers spot values too.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers should remember that wherever they go, whatever
they do, they should always ask for the senior-citizen discount,
even if one isn't posted. That's one of the main privileges of
being among the ``chronologically gifted'' who are 50 or over. &QL;

   GEORGE-MITCHELL (Albany, N.Y.) _ Friday already has meaning for
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. It's the
first birthday of his son. It also is the day Mitchell, 65, will
learn whether he is the recipient of the Nobel prize for his role
in brokering the Northern Ireland peace agreement. By PAUL
GRONDAHL.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GOV (San Francisco) _ A San Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll
shows Republican Dan Lungren trailing Democrat Gray Davis for the
governorship of California. Davis remains favored by 48 percent of
those surveyed _ the same percentage of voters backing him in three
polls since July. Lungren is backed by just 42 percent of those
surveyed with two weeks left in the campaign. By ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   GIRLS-COMPUTERS (San Antonio) _ The ``boys only'' sign has moved
from math and science classrooms to technology, a key to the
information age, a national study has found. Girls still trail boys
in math and science achievement, and an emerging gender gap exists
in the number and difficulty of computer classes they take, the
report said. By JEANNE RUSSELL.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CAREERS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Part of me wishes that all the
workers on Earth would call in sick tomorrow and keep calling in
sick every day until they use up all the sick days that their
employers offer. It would wake up all those companies that have
antiquated sick leave policies _ policies that essentially
discriminate against dedicated workers. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BELOVED (San Francisco) _ An unrelenting story of
what slavery did to one woman and the people caught up in her life,
``Beloved'' left those in the cast _ Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover
and Thandie Newton _ to deal with memories from their past. By
EDVINS BEITIKS.
</P>
<P>
   GARBAGE-MUSIC-PROFILE (Undated) _ Many musicians point to a
defining moment when they knew absolutely what they wanted to do
with their lives. Butch Vig, drummer/producer with the group
Garbage, remembers his: It happened in the late 60s when he saw the
Who perform on television. The band's drummer wreaked havoc on the
set and a little kid in Wisconsin got hooked on the spirit of rock
'n' roll. By RICK MITCHELL.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY-GARCIA (San Francisco) _ The bitter monetary dispute
between the widow of Grateful Dead leader Jerry Garcia and his
former wife is coming to a rapid close after both sides reached an
agreement that would pay Carolyn ``Mountain Girl'' Adams Garcia
about $1 million. By RAY DELGADO.
</P>
<P>
   COKIE-ROBERTS (San Francisco) _ After 10 months of reporting and
analyzing the White House sex scandal, Cokie Roberts says she feels
``imprisoned by the story, both literally and figuratively.''
Despite being pinned down inside the Beltway, Roberts' reach has
extended nationwide with the publication of ``We Are Our Mothers'
Daughters,'' her reflection on and celebration of women. By ERIC
BRAZIL.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD (``d'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MICROWAVE-FOOD (Undated) _ Making frittate _ Italy's answer to
omelets _ takes mere minutes in the microwave without sacrificing
the superior taste of a dish that takes longer to cook
conventionally. And the results are lush. Creamy eggs hold enticing
chunks of whatever one chooses to add. As with omelets, one usual
addition is cheese, which can be the cook's choice. By ANN STEINER
and CICI WILLIAMSON.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-WINE (Undated) _ They don't call it the Grape State of
Texas for nothing. While some small Texas wineries continue to
produce amateurish efforts, others have made noticeable strides in
upgrading the quality of their wines. By MICHAEL LONSFORD.
</P>
<P>
   LI-WINE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Long Island is known for many things,
not all of them positive, but perhaps the least likely is that the
extreme east end supports one of the state's four wine regions, and
the one with by far the longest growing season. By FRED LEBRUN.

FEATURE SUMMARY -- No. 2490 -- Oct. 15, 1998 We are offering the
following articles for sale. Please contact us for availability

<TEXT>
<P>
   1. TODAY'S KOSOVO CRISIS IS HARDLY A SURPRISE The Dayton Accord
that ended Bosnia's war has been oversold. Had Washington
intervened in 1993, as Bill Clinton promised to, 100,000 lives
could have been saved, writes Warren Bass. Dayton has strengthened
the two nastiest dictators in the region, Serbia's Slobodan
Milosevic and Croatia's Franjo Tudjman, and edged towards accepting
the de facto partition of Bosnia. The violence in Kosovo today is a
reminder of the costs of appeasing aggressors. From Foreign Affairs
magazine. 2,000 words. 2. FOR AMERICA'S SAKE, IT'S TIME FOR CLINTON
TO RESIGN As the evidence has mounted against him, Ross Perot
writes that he believed President Clinton would resign in shame and
in the best interests of the country. But it is now obvious that
Clinton will not voluntarily resign. (Ross Perot is a businessman,
philanthropist, former Reform Party candidate for U.S. president
and the author of books including ``United We Stand,'' and ``Not
for Sale at Any Price.'') 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
A LOVE STORY BEYOND MONICA AND BILL This time it's not the tiresome
adventure that has forever joined Bill Clinton with Monica
Lewinsky, but a real love story, without disgraceful power
struggles or treacherous friends. The central character in this
story is Simone de Beauvoir. The other one isn't Jean Paul Sartre,
but rather the American novelist Nelson Algren. By Tomas Eloy
Martinez. 1,500 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
BEWARE, YELTSIN. DO NOT MEDDLE IN NEW GOVERNMENT'S WORK Russia is
at a dangerous threshold. The clock shows five minutes to midnight,
writes Mikhail Gorbachev in this article. 1,000 words. 5. TACKLING
INTERNATIONAL CORRUPTION After years of being tolerated with a
mixture of apathy, cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a
target of serious international action. By John Brademas and Fritz
Heimann. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 1,500 words. 6. SEEKING
BETTER TREATMENTS FOR STROKE Stroke (when a blood clot in an artery
blocks blood flow to the brain) is the third most common cause of
death worldwide, and leaves many more victims seriously disabled.
Researchers report the results of a large, international study that
sought to determine if the clot-dissolving drug alteplase can help
patients if it is given as late as 6 hours after the onset of
symptoms of a stroke By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News Service.
1,000 words. 7. From MEDICAL TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE :
</P>
<P>
   A. BRAIN IMPLANT EASES SOME PARKINSON'S SYMPTOMS : Dual implants
that electrically stimulate the brain offer hope as a treatment for
Parkinson's disease, French researchers report. 500 words. B. MORE
MEN SNORE, BUT THE HABIT FADES WITH AGE : After men hit 50, their
snoring seems to calm down - but young men are louder than ever,
according to a Swedish study. 300 words. C. EARLY-BIRD, NIGHT-OWL
TENDENCIES MAY BE GENETIC : A ``clock'' gene may determine who's a
morning person or a night owl. 250 words. D. DRUG RESTRICTION CUTS
HOSPITAL INFECTIONS, BUT AT A PRICE : By limiting the use of
certain antibiotics, hospitals can combat drug-resistant bacteria
and the infections they cause, but at the price of increasing the
bacteria's resistance to other antibiotics.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
TRICK OR TREAT SMARTS Simple ways to keep your kids safe at
Halloween without taking any of the fun out of the occasion. By
Liza N. Burby. From Child magazine. 700 words. 9. HANDLING THE FEAR
FACTOR ``Parents have to determine how much of Halloween is for
them - because they want to see their child dressed as a pumpkin -
and how much of it kids really enjoy,'' says one child
psychologist. ``Halloween is not just about a photo-opportunity.
It's a children's holiday, so if they are not having fun, don't
celebrate it.'' By Candy Schulman. From Child magazine. 700 words.
10. A RUN ON THE WILD SIDE The New York City Marathon will take
place this year on November 1. Ten thousand of the runners will be
from outside the U.S. (last year 95 other countries were
represented, led by France, Germany and Great Britain.) Here is a
brisk tour of the most tiring race in the city that never walks,
with advice on how to make it across the finish line. By Andrew
Blum. 500 words + photo. Please fax to Paris 33.1.47.42.80.44 or

   ``ACTOR STANLEY TUCCI IS AN IMPOSTOR!'' From W magazine. One
color slide. ``As soon as somebody says, `Don't do it the way you
want to,' I say, `See you later,''' actor Stanley Tucci explains in
his mellifluous voice that helped make him so creepily convincing
as suspected murderer Richard Cross on television's ``Murder One.''
Cross isn't the only villain on Tucci's resume. The 38-year-old
actor's parts have ranged from various Italian heavies to the
dogcatcher in ``Beethoven,'' Demi More's husband in
``Deconstructing Harry'' and an assassin in ``The Pelican Brief.''
In this interview from W magazine, Tucci talks about his latest two
starring roles _ in the film ``The Impostors,'' a shipboard farce,
and in HBO's ``Winchell,'' in which he portrays the legendary
gossip columnist Walter Winchell.

   ``BEAUTY TREND: NEUTRAL TERRITORY.'' From W magazine. One color
slide. We always suspected Catherine Deneuve was on to something.
What started as a mere trendlet at the fall ready-to-wear

emerged as a fullblown trend at the fall couture. A report.

   ``ACTOR STANLEY TUCCI IS AN IMPOSTOR!'' From W magazine. One
color slide. ``As soon as somebody says, `Don't do it the way you
want to,' I say, `See you later,''' actor Stanley Tucci explains in
his mellifluous voice that helped make him so creepily convincing
as suspected murderer Richard Cross on television's ``Murder One.''
Cross isn't the only villain on Tucci's resume. The 38-year-old
actor's parts have ranged from various Italian heavies to the
dogcatcher in ``Beethoven,'' Demi More's husband in
``Deconstructing Harry'' and an assassin in ``The Pelican Brief.''
In this interview from W magazine, Tucci talks about his latest two
starring roles _ in the film ``The Impostors,'' a shipboard farce,
and in HBO's ``Winchell,'' in which he portrays the legendary
gossip columnist Walter Winchell.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Picture the country of Brazil as just one free-wheeling,
spend-happy consumer.
</P>
<P>
   He gulps Coca-Cola, vacations in Florida, and feels lost without
his cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine that he's broke.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it's easy to see why economic troubles in
Brazil -- home to 164 million potential consumers -- could deal a
devastating blow to U.S. businesses as wide-ranging as Coca-Cola
Co., Motorola Inc., and Walt Disney Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Boasting the world's ninth-largest economy, the South American
country has become a major concern for analysts and investors who
fear that Brazil could plunge into recession by 1999, or be forced
to avert recession with a currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Brazil hopes to receive a bailout of up to $30
billion assembled by the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, to
help stabilize the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy could still crumble if President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso fails to implement an austerity package he is
expected to announce by Oct. 20, and somehow push through Brazil's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso faces the daunting challenge of needing to cut the
government's 8 percent budget deficit, overhaul a shaky social
security system, and adjust a 15 to 20 percent over-valuation in
Brazil's currency.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high because economic woes in Brazil portend
economic woes throughout the rest of Latin America, which would
place the global financial crisis smack on the doorstep of the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget how important Brazil is to the U.S. economy, but
the export market in Brazil is 25 percent bigger than China's,''
said David Hirschmann, executive vice president of the Brazil-U.S.
Business Council in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Brazil's importance is best explained in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's $800 billion-a-year economy is twice the size of
Russia's and nearly twice the size of Mexico's. More than 400 of
the top 500 U.S. companies have subsidiaries in Brazil. The country
accounts for 45 percent of Latin America's output.
</P>
<P>
   And here are just a few ways in which Brazil and the U.S.
economy are inextricably linked:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  American banks had made $34 billion in outstanding loans to
Brazil by September.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than one million Brazilian tourists vacation in the
United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. corporations have more than $25 billion invested in
Brazilian factories.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors wonder whether Brazil's precarious economic
situation might take some of the steam out of the future earnings
of companies that have made big investments there.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is Coca-Cola's third-largest market, behind the United
States and Mexico. The Atlanta-based company and its bottlers,
which employ 42,000 people in Brazil, invested $1.4 billion in
infrastructure and marketing in Brazil from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of potential in Brazil,'' said Bill Hensel, a
spokesman for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Motorola Inc., just won a five-year, $220
million contract from Brazil's Global Telecom to supply a cellular
phone network system in southern Brazil. Motorola completed a
50,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Brazil only last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Brazil's future certainly will have repercussions
on Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Trade between Brazil and Florida totaled more than $8 billion
last year, meaning Brazil has become Florida's most-important
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 Brazilians live in Florida, and most of the
one million Brazilians who visit the United States each year travel
to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the U.S. exports that go to Brazil go through Florida
or are produced in Florida,'' Hirschmann said. ``You could argue a
compelling case that, in fact, the way Brazil goes, so will go
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for the future of Brazil's economy have been running high
since Oct. 4, when Cardoso, credited with stabilizing his country's
currency in recent years, became the first president in 109 years
of the Brazilian republic to be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Even the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have
promised to help Brazil make economic reforms, although neither has
specified how much financing will be offered.
</P>
<P>
   But now all eyes are on how well Cardoso's allies fare during
the second round of Brazil's national elections scheduled for Oct.
25.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old sociologist will have a tough time cutting back
on public spending without the key support of Brazil's governors.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes also are focused on Congress, which has proved to be a
stumbling block to Cardoso's plans for reform in the past.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During Cardoso's first term he repeatedly failed to push
money-saving reforms to the public sector through Congress,
preferring the line of least resistance and raising taxes that did
not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time Cardoso did move on other important fronts:
he privatized several bloated state monopolies, including the
country's phone company; and he helped Brazil draw massive amounts
of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   And, earlier this year, Cardoso's government managed to avoid a
collapse of the currency and stem at least some capital flight by
hiking interest rates to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some economists are reluctant to predict whether
Cardoso can be successful this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainty in Brazil is whether the Congress has been
shaken from its complacency and whether reforms can actually be
passed,'' said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin America for
the Economist Intelligence Unit in London, an economic research
firm. ``I'm not sure they can because there's not a lot of party
unity in Brazil and there is a wide range of views within the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso supporters say the mounting urgency of the world's
financial crisis will give the president the muscle he needs to
deal with Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardoso and his team are smart and they know what needs to be
done,'' said James Ferrer, head of the Institute of Brazilian
Issues at George Washington University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer said he expects Cardoso's package to include sharp
spending cuts, some small tax increases, and reforms to the social
security system.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends.)
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that the government wants to do all it can
to avoid a devaluation of the real, which would send shock waves
through a population that fears a return to the days of
hyperinflation that ended just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso was a popular finance minister whose 1994 currency plan
brought price increases to zero from 3,000 percent in less than
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, foreign currency reserves, the best defense
against a speculative attack on the real, have plummeted from $67
billion at the end of August to $47 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's devaluation of the ruble in August scared U.S.
investors away from emerging markets such as Brazil, causing
dollars to disappear faster than candy before hungry children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone expects a devaluation except, perhaps,
Cardoso and his associates,'' said Jerry Haar, director of the
Inter-American Business and Labor Program at the University of
Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Cardoso may be forced to devalue if the country
keeps hemorrhaging money in the public sector due to the lack of
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, you can work for the government for 10 years and
still retire at 110 percent of your salary,'' Haar said.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that Cardoso's plan must shave at least $25
billion off a whopping public deficit of $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a devaluation would almost surely throw the economy
into a recession, as well as reintroduce high inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And it most certainly would erode the spending power of
Brazilian consumers and businesses, hurting U.S. exporters.

   MIAMI _ Picture the country of Brazil as just one free-wheeling,
spend-happy consumer.
</P>
<P>
   He gulps Coca-Cola, vacations in Florida, and feels lost without
his cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine that he's broke.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it's easy to see why economic troubles in
Brazil -- home to 164 million potential consumers -- could deal a
devastating blow to U.S. businesses as wide-ranging as Coca-Cola
Co., Motorola Inc., and Walt Disney Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Boasting the world's ninth-largest economy, the South American
country has become a major concern for analysts and investors who
fear that Brazil could plunge into recession by 1999, or be forced
to avert recession with a currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Brazil hopes to receive a bailout of up to $30
billion assembled by the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, to
help stabilize the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy could still crumble if President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso fails to implement an austerity package he is
expected to announce by Oct. 20, and somehow push through Brazil's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso faces the daunting challenge of needing to cut the
government's 8 percent budget deficit, overhaul a shaky social
security system, and adjust a 15 to 20 percent over-valuation in
Brazil's currency.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high because economic woes in Brazil portend
economic woes throughout the rest of Latin America, which would
place the global financial crisis smack on the doorstep of the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget how important Brazil is to the U.S. economy, but
the export market in Brazil is 25 percent bigger than China's,''
said David Hirschmann, executive vice president of the Brazil-U.S.
Business Council in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Brazil's importance is best explained in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's $800 billion-a-year economy is twice the size of
Russia's and nearly twice the size of Mexico's. More than 400 of
the top 500 U.S. companies have subsidiaries in Brazil. The country
accounts for 45 percent of Latin America's output.
</P>
<P>
   And here are just a few ways in which Brazil and the U.S.
economy are inextricably linked:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  American banks had made $34 billion in outstanding loans to
Brazil by September.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than one million Brazilian tourists vacation in the
United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. corporations have more than $25 billion invested in
Brazilian factories.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors wonder whether Brazil's precarious economic
situation might take some of the steam out of the future earnings
of companies that have made big investments there.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is Coca-Cola's third-largest market, behind the United
States and Mexico. The Atlanta-based company and its bottlers,
which employ 42,000 people in Brazil, invested $1.4 billion in
infrastructure and marketing in Brazil from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of potential in Brazil,'' said Bill Hensel, a
spokesman for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Motorola Inc., just won a five-year, $220
million contract from Brazil's Global Telecom to supply a cellular
phone network system in southern Brazil. Motorola completed a
50,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Brazil only last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Brazil's future certainly will have repercussions
on Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Trade between Brazil and Florida totaled more than $8 billion
last year, meaning Brazil has become Florida's most-important
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 Brazilians live in Florida, and most of the
one million Brazilians who visit the United States each year travel
to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the U.S. exports that go to Brazil go through Florida
or are produced in Florida,'' Hirschmann said. ``You could argue a
compelling case that, in fact, the way Brazil goes, so will go
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for the future of Brazil's economy have been running high
since Oct. 4, when Cardoso, credited with stabilizing his country's
currency in recent years, became the first president in 109 years
of the Brazilian republic to be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Even the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have
promised to help Brazil make economic reforms, although neither has
specified how much financing will be offered.
</P>
<P>
   But now all eyes are on how well Cardoso's allies fare during
the second round of Brazil's national elections scheduled for Oct.
25.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old sociologist will have a tough time cutting back
on public spending without the key support of Brazil's governors.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes also are focused on Congress, which has proved to be a
stumbling block to Cardoso's plans for reform in the past.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During Cardoso's first term he repeatedly failed to push
money-saving reforms to the public sector through Congress,
preferring the line of least resistance and raising taxes that did
not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time Cardoso did move on other important fronts:
he privatized several bloated state monopolies, including the
country's phone company; and he helped Brazil draw massive amounts
of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   And, earlier this year, Cardoso's government managed to avoid a
collapse of the currency and stem at least some capital flight by
hiking interest rates to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some economists are reluctant to predict whether
Cardoso can be successful this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainty in Brazil is whether the Congress has been
shaken from its complacency and whether reforms can actually be
passed,'' said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin America for
the Economist Intelligence Unit in London, an economic research
firm. ``I'm not sure they can because there's not a lot of party
unity in Brazil and there is a wide range of views within the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso supporters say the mounting urgency of the world's
financial crisis will give the president the muscle he needs to
deal with Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardoso and his team are smart and they know what needs to be
done,'' said James Ferrer, head of the Institute of Brazilian
Issues at George Washington University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer said he expects Cardoso's package to include sharp
spending cuts, some small tax increases, and reforms to the social
security system.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends.)
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that the government wants to do all it can
to avoid a devaluation of the real, which would send shock waves
through a population that fears a return to the days of
hyperinflation that ended just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso was a popular finance minister whose 1994 currency plan
brought price increases to zero from 3,000 percent in less than
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, foreign currency reserves, the best defense
against a speculative attack on the real, have plummeted from $67
billion at the end of August to $47 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's devaluation of the ruble in August scared U.S.
investors away from emerging markets such as Brazil, causing
dollars to disappear faster than candy before hungry children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone expects a devaluation except, perhaps,
Cardoso and his associates,'' said Jerry Haar, director of the
Inter-American Business and Labor Program at the University of
Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Cardoso may be forced to devalue if the country
keeps hemorrhaging money in the public sector due to the lack of
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, you can work for the government for 10 years and
still retire at 110 percent of your salary,'' Haar said.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that Cardoso's plan must shave at least $25
billion off a whopping public deficit of $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a devaluation would almost surely throw the economy
into a recession, as well as reintroduce high inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And it most certainly would erode the spending power of
Brazilian consumers and businesses, hurting U.S. exporters.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Oil barons around the world, take heart: China's leap
toward prosperity has caused nearly 1 million families to switch
from bicycles to cars.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the coming of the car culture to China isn't going to
shock the world's oil markets, as did the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Chinese private car phenomenon should gain momentum
in the next few years just when the rest of Asia is soaring back
from its current economic crisis, the combined impact on world oil
prices could be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The simple mechanism of supply-and-demand could slowly crimp the
world oil market in much the same way as members of OPEC did in the
oil cartel's heyday, when they agreed to cut production quotas --
and then stuck to the rules. Gradually, oil would become less
available and the price would go up.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the number of private cars in China has jumped from
virtually zero five years ago to at least 699,000, according to a
report by the China Automobile Market Survey and Research Society.
China's auto makers are now increasing the production of passenger
sedans by 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, there will be at least 1 million privately
owned vehicles in China's cities,'' the research society declared.
``In major municipalities and provincial capitals, the ownership
rate among families will reach five(CQ) percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since 1996 China has ``trimmed'' the production of
bicycles, the China Light Industry News reported last month. It
attributed the fall-off to ``shrinking market demand'' and
``accelerated development of the automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though affluence is on the rise in China, the rest of Asia is in
a deep recession. This has flattened Asia's spectacular 5
percent-a-year growth in oil consumption that generally kept world
prices above $24 a barrel throughout the 1980s. When Asia's energy
demand sagged last year, world oil prices slid by this summer to
below $11 a barrel, their lowest level (on an inflation-adjusted
basis) since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, almost every expert believes that Asian oil demand will
start to rebound fairly soon. When that happens, it will probably
spell the end of cheap gasoline around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Writing this March in the American journal ``Foreign Affairs,''
world oil experts Daniel Yergin, Dennis Eklof and Jefferson Edwards
predicted that overall Asian energy consumption ``will again rise
sharply in two or three years'' -- once Japan and its neighbors
solve their internal economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the lowest trough of the Asian economic doldrums,
Asian countries consume about 19 million barrels of oil a day.
That's just over one-fourth of the oil that is used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Oil fields in Asia produce just 8 million barrels for Asia's
daily needs; the remaining 11 million barrels a day must be
imported. Three-fourths of Asia's imported petroleum comes from the
Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia by far the largest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the prospects for Asia's oil supply look decidedly
grim,'' wrote Yergin, Eklof and Edwards. ``By 2010, (Asian)
productive capacity will have declined 6 percent from its 2005
peak, with new oil field developments unable to compensate for
maturing Indonesian, Malaysian and Australian fields. So regardless
of exploration, Asia is destined to import more than 20 million
barrels of oil per day by 2010, compared with approximately 11
million today.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   China is the newest and fastest-growing customer for Middle East
oil. Until five years ago, China was proud of its status as an
``energy-independent'' oil exporter. But thanks to its own meteoric
economic growth, China now imports 25 percent of its oil, amounting
to 1 million barrels a day. So far, most is for industrial uses and
only a small fraction for private cars.
</P>
<P>
   China derives another 3 million barrels a day of oil from
domestic oil wells while obtaining the balance of its energy from
massive reliance on coal, and hydro-electric and a few nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of China's imported oil now comes from Saudi Arabia, Iran
and the United Arab Emirates. Determined to diversify its oil
sources beyond the Persian Gulf, China's national petroleum
corporation last year outbid some of the biggest Western oil
companies for the right to help develop some of the choicest
Caspian Sea Basin oil properties in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, China's steep increases in oil imports worries some
Chinese energy experts. Early last year retired scientists Yang
Jike, the former vice president of China's national environmental
protection committee, published a warning that it was better to
rely
</P>
<P>
   on coal than imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   If China allowed its oil imports to increase, ``China will get
entangled in Middle East politics, like the United States,'' Yang
wrote.

   MEXICO CITY _ When the price of crude oil falls, it's happy days
for American consumers and the U.S. economy. But those same price
cuts strike fear in the hearts of Mexicans and Venezuelans, now
critical exporters of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil dominates the economies of Latin America's biggest
producers. And every time prices fall, big cuts in federal spending
and economic crisis are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind the U.S. and its Latin American suppliers
have grown strong since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, part of
a promise by the U.S. to diversify and avoid oil dependence on one
region.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for example, is expected to supply the U.S. with 13.4
percent of its imported oil in 1998. That's up from 1.2 percent in
1975. In 1985 Mexico's share of U.S. oil imports hit a high of more
than 16 percent, then dropped a bit before rising again this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   The growth of mutual dependency between the United States and
Mexico is ironic, given how jealously Mexico guards its national
resources. In Mexico, the day that oil was nationalized in 1938 is
still celebrated as a moment of civic pride, and suggestions that
privatizing the nation's oil industry to make it more efficient
always prompts a flurry of angry denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, not all of Mexico's oil was sold to the United
States,'' said John Lichtbleu, an analyst with Pira Energy Group in
New York. ``There was a time when they didn't want to sell more
than 50 percent of exports to the U.S. because of a fear of
domination. Now 85 to 90 percent of Mexican exported oil goes to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While the northward flow helps stabilize the Mexican economy, it
also means demand and price fluctuations have a greater impact on
average Mexicans. About 33 percent of the country's federal revenue
comes from Petroleos de Mexico -- Pemex -- the government's oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   That's a dependency Mexico has tried hard to shake. A decade
ago, oil money made up 45 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   And oil used to be Mexico's number one export, drawing three out
of every four dollars worth of foreign capital flowing into the
country. Today, as Mexico has built up its manufacturing base, oil
accounts for only 5.4 percent of the foreign revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy and the national budget are highly vulnerable
to the ups and downs of international oil prices. Three times this
year Mexican government officials made emergency budget spending
cuts to make up for oil revenue shortfalls. More cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico will have to operate next year with an austere budget
and somehow depend less on oil revenues,'' said Jonathan Heath, a
Mexico City-based economist. ``That will be tough for a country
like Mexico, where public needs are so great today.''
</P>
<P>
   The bust-and-boom oil price cycles have been even rougher on
Venezuela, who's main crude producer, Petroleos de Venezuela, is
the world's second largest.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela puts out 3 million barrels of crude each day, and
relies on oil to generate 60 percent of its government budget
revenue and 80 percent of its foreign income.
</P>
<P>
   The result: recession and political instability this year as the
price for Venezuelan crude hit a 12-year low; oil revenue is off by
a third; the government has slashed spending by $4 billion; and
bank-loan interest rates have soared to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos has opened the door for protectionist politicians like
Hugo Chavez, a former military leader who headed a failed coup in
1992 against then-president Carlos Andres Perez. Chavez is the
front-runner in the race for presidency, which culminates in a
December vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has promised to revisit Venezuela's open-door policy on
outside investments in the nation's oil business -- a move that
could crimp the revenues of dozens of foreign companies that
operate in Venezuela. He's even hinted at cutting back on exports
to rich nations, like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is really the big unknown and he's got investors
scared,'' said Don Bowles, Latin America director for the Economist
Intelligence Unit, a research firm in London. ``Whether he wins,
and what he decides to do if he does, will shape the country's
economic future and could affect the oil industry.''

   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ There has never been so much available
oil, which is good news for motorists at gas pumps just about
everywhere -- but here.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are dropping. So, nervous officials in this oil-rich
sheikhdom might raise the price of gasoline in their own land to
raise money for the government-sponsored lifestyle of free
health-care, full employment and air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced gasoline would be a reversal of fortune for Kuwait.
It's oil reserves make up nearly one-tenth of the world's supply
and gushes up through drill holes to the desert surface without the
pumps needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when many countries
are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're increasing it in
Kuwait,'' said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasir Al-Sabah in a recent
interview with Cox News Service. ``That's absurd . . . I don't
think this is something that's acceptable to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is still good here. Car dealerships are busy every night
and young Kuwaitis can still count on a job in the bloated
government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwait and its oil-producing neighbors, from wealthy Saudi
Arabia to giant and volatile Iran, are struggling with the
ramifications of low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the so-called Arab oil embargo shocked
the West. Attempting to keep the U.S. from backing Israel, these
countries threatened to cut oil supplies -- particularly to the
U.S., where frightened Americans rushed to line up their
gas-guzzling automobiles at pumps despite rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in the West brought a windfall in the Gulf, which
became awash in cash as well as oil. Big countries like Iran and
Iraq could bring their people modern social services, roads and
education. Small countries, like Kuwait, could luxuriate.
</P>
<P>
   It raised the gulf countries' world clout. Arabic became an
official language at the United Nations. The United States started
selling sophisticated military airplanes to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   But, prompted by the higher prices, new competition in oil
production took off from Mexico to Russia. And, oil importers --
especially the United States -- found ways to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, oil prices are about as low, adjusted for inflation, as
they were before the embargo in 1973. More oil is produced than
ever -- 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Persian Gulf oil exporters still sit on 65 percent of
the world's supply, it is losing value. The 11-member OPEC cartel
(including three nations outside the Mideast) will see revenues
drop by a third this year -- down about $40 billion. Since 1980,
the per capita income in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and three other
oil-producing monarchies has dropped by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A continued decline in oil prices could cause hard times here,
leading to radicalism -- or worse, instability -- even among
stalwart American allies like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kuwait has just 1.8 million inhabitants and nearly 10 percent
of the world's oil. But, Kuwaitis are edgy about the soundness of a
system that provides free health-care, subsidized utilities and
charges no income or sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More vulnerable is Saudi Arabia, with about 18 million people.
It is also cutting back benefits -- like the low-income housing
loans for newlyweds -- while trying to calm a restless minority of
have-nots and religious fundamentalists. Unemployment is rising.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More volatile still is Iran. A regional giant with 68 million
people, Iran's government deficit and economic recession could
undercut nascent steps toward detente with the West.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Iraq is another story. Its oil production has been limited by
economic sanctions and industrial disrepair following the Persian
Gulf War. But, should things improve -- and Russia and China have
their way -- its production will kick into gear and add to the oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zalmay Khalilzad, director for Strategic Studies at the Rand
Corp., warns that the United States is still dependent on Persian
Gulf oil supplies. If Americans want low prices, he said, they may
have to be ready to help quell the resulting unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The oil producers tend to make the problem worse. Most have
refused to make tough cuts in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf countries, unfortunately, are still dreaming that the
welfare state will last forever,'' said Kuwaiti political scientist
Shamlan al-Essa(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they just try to raise money by pumping and selling
more oil. That lowers the price even more.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the market, OPEC members now are struggling
just to keep their organization together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is very different than it was in the
past,'' Al Sabah said. ``We have to be extremely careful about
mixing oil and politics.''

   MOSCOW _ Think of the world's major oil powers and the first
images likely to come to mind are of Persian Gulf sheikdoms or the
sun-baked Texas plains.
</P>
<P>
   Think vodka and snow, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of the world's future oil and natural gas
supplies will come from Russia and other former Soviet republics,
if Western oil companies can get to it.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union seven years ago sparked the
last great oil boom of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Oil giants like Exxon, Amoco, Mobil, Shell, Texaco and British
Petroleum are investing billions of dollars across the continent to
tap oil and gas fields from the Siberian tundra of Russia to the
arid Central Asian plains of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here and ready with this kind money if it
wasn't worth it,'' said Alexander Ordjonikidze of the Sakhalin
Energy Investment Company, a consortium of Shell, Marathon and
several Japanese partners that is set to begin offshore production
next year off Russia's far east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Worthwhile maybe, but it is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's second largest energy supplier; it
produces more natural gas than any country in the world and is
third behind Saudi Arabia and the United States in quantities of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   But its teetering economy and aging production facilities have
left its status as an oil and gas giant in a sorry state, pumping
about half the levels it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies have touted themselves as the solution to
Russia's problem -- with partnerships to help Russia extract its
oil and get it to market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet frustrated oil companies have run up against a snarl of
bureaucracy, unfavorable tax conditions and changing terms of the
production deals by Russian partners who want a bigger stake. With
Russia's economy now in crisis and its market reformers on the
political outs, conditions are not expected to improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   Flat world oil prices and a threat of global recession have
further eliminated the urgency and eagerness to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Caspian Sea on Russia's southern fringe, billions of
dollars in deals are going forward in a region with the largest new
oil finds in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is hailed as the next great Middle East, and the Caspian Sea
basin -- including the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and the breakaway Russian republic
Chechnya -- could be just that.
</P>
<P>
   The region combines the lucrative and dangerous elements of oil,
political unrest and geopolitical implications as the United
States, Russia and Iran vie for influence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cliche about the former Soviet Union is it is a place with
lots of problems and lots of opportunities. The problems may now
look bigger than they did two or three years ago, but the oil is
still here,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil and gas industry
analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Caspian prizes is the Tengiz oil field in
Kazakhstan. Tengiz potentially could produce more than 1 million
barrels a day -- more than the current yield of Alaska's Prudhoe
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But how to get the oil from the Caspian basin to market has been
a source of diplomatic frustration and intrigue. Russia, Iran and
the United States have differing alternatives for pipelines to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In the far east, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 400
billion cubic meters of natural gas lie under the waters around
Sakhalin Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Sakhalin consortium so far has spent $1 billion and is
prepared to spend ten times that to fully develop its offshore
fields. But it is stalled by the Russian parliament's refusal to
approve legislation on a production-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is dominated by
Communists and die-hard nationalist parties suspicious of the West
and reluctant to share Russia's resources with big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the allure of Russia is fading. Countries in Latin America
and Asia, whose economies also need foreign investment, have begun
to woo the oil companies. Even Saudi Arabia, which nationalized its
oil interests in the 1970s, is making overtures to Western
companies to buy a stake there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Western oil companies take a very long view in
Russia, but they've begun to direct their attentions elsewhere,''
said O'Sullivan. ``They won't leave completely. But they may be
content to allow the oil to stay in the ground another five, 10 or
20 years longer.''

   THEN AND NOW: CHANGES SINCE THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Imports, 28 percent of total U.S. oil consumption in 1973,
have risen to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which supplied 54 percent of the world's crude oil, now
provide 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inflation-adjusted retail prices have risen 6.5 percent for
gasoline and 7 percent for electricity in those 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price paid by refiners for crude oil
has risen by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price of natural gas as it comes out of
the ground has increased by 187 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. consumption of petroleum is up by 13 percent, though the
nation's growing population means that on a per-person basis, it is
down by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Improved exploration and development technology has cut the
cost of finding new oil and gas wells by 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The average car then got 14 miles per gallon, compared to
today's 28.5 miles per gallon for a car and 20.4 miles per gallon
for light trucks -- including minivans, sport utility vehicles and
small pickups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today's average car or light truck has 25 percent more
horsepower than its equivalent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 31 percent share of homes heated by oil has dropped to 17
percent. The main reason: The 54 percent share of new homes heated
by natural gas has risen to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Electric utilities, which got 17 percent of their power from
oil before the embargo, get only 2.5 percent from oil today.
Natural gas, then 18 percent of fuel for utilities, fell to 9.5
percent. To make up the difference, coal rose from 46 percent to
nearly 57 percent of utility fuel, and nuclear rose from 4.5
percent to about about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While U.S. energy consumption has increased by 27 percent
since the embargo, energy use has grown so much faster in other
countries that the U.S. share of the world's energy consumption has
dropped from 31 percent in 1973 to 25 percent today.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, Arab countries around the
Persian Gulf started an oil embargo that shattered Americans'
complacency over the security of their energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial oil shortage that began on Oct. 18, 1973, led to
six months of agonizing and improvising by government officials and
drivers desperate to find a service station that still had gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the next quarter-century, the federal government spent more
than $90 billion looking for ways to reduce our reliance on foreign
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over-production and faltering demand from developing
countries has created a worldwide glut of oil. Half the oil
consumed in the United States -- or roughly one-fifth of the
nation's total energy supply -- is imported from Mexico, Canada and
other foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans have apparently forgotten about that crisis of
25 years ago,'' said Cecile Warner, who has not. An engineer who
directs the federal Center for Renewable Energy Resources in
Golden, Colo., she designed, built and lives in ``a passive solar
home that uses less than one-third of the energy of a home built to
today's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   New energy efficiencies have cut petroleum use per person. But
expensive efforts to develop clean, non-nuclear alternatives to
fossil fuels have failed to come up with a product cheap enough to
compete with deregulated oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half our oil now is imported, compared to only a
little more than one-third before the embargo, and that figure is
expected to rise to about two-thirds by 2020,'' Warner cautioned.
``Average vehicle miles per gallon are decreasing because of the
popularity of sport -utility vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's SUVs and other light trucks average more than 20
miles per gallon -- while the average car or pick-up of 1973 burned
up a gallon every 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why few Americans even noticed the three
price-propping production cutbacks announced in the last 10 months
by the the Arab and non-Arab countries in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's first two cutbacks flopped. The third, announced in June,
might be taking hold. After sliding from $25 a barrel in October
1996 to under $14 in August, the world price for crude oil has
bobbed up to around $16 in the last two months. The two-dollar jump
translates to about a nickel a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from new suppliers dilute any cutback's effects. ``Russia,
the Caspian Sea region, Asia, West Africa and Latin America'' are
the industry's new frontiers, said Michael Cates, chief economist
of the American Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond this, our vulnerability to such disruptions has been
significantly reduced by the development of the (federal) Strategic
Petroleum Reserve,'' Cates said. The reserve's storage pits hold
enough crude oil to make up for the loss of all U.S. imports for
about 60 days -- longer in the more likely event that only part of
the imports are blocked. The reserve system worked well in 1990
during and after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   But the 1973 embargo was another story. The Saudis announced
that if the United States continued supporting Israel militarily,
it wouldn't be allowed to buy Arab oil.
</P>
<P>
   That threat was issued just one day after 11 Arab nations agreed
in Kuwait City to raise the charge for their oil by 17 percent and
prop up the new price by cutting their production by five percent
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the economic and political threat, the United States
continued to re-supply the Israelis as they drove back the
Soviet-supplied armies of Syria and Egypt, which had invaded Israel
earlier in the month on the solemn Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in American leaders was sinking that month, as
Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign and President
Richard Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate special
prosecutor. In addition, an elaborate system of price and wage
controls had failed to prevent heating-oil shortages the previous
winter and disruptions of the gasoline supply that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall consumers following our delivery trucks and when the
truck arrived at the station, it would be trailing a ready-made
line of cars waiting for gas,'' said Leo Liebowitz, president and
CEO of Getty Oil, an independent oil marketer on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pumping about 52,000 gallons a month, but as soon as
the embargo hit, I was cut back to 26,000,'' remembered station
owner Larry Beattie of Augusta, Ga. ``I think the oil companies and
the government, both of them, overdid it, and, of course, there was
a little abuse of the situation by some people on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Station closings were most common in Florida, Georgia, the
Carolinas and Tennessee. ``We'd have 70 to 100 dealers who'd spend
their own money to go up to Washington and lobby for relief,'' said
Jack Houston, retired executive director of the Georgia Association
of Petroleum Retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who used to wait until their gas tank was three-quarters
empty began refilling when their tank was three-quarters full.
``Better safe than sorry,'' said Lois Epstein's grandfather, when
she asked why they were lined up to buy gasoline for the second day
in a row. Multiplied by millions of motorists, that precaution
drained oil terminals, tank farms and refineries of surpluses that
could have eased the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, now a senior engineer with the Environmental Defense
Fund, said she worries that oil today is so cheap and plentiful
that careless companies lack economic incentives to fix leaky
equipment that could contaminate water or soil.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   At the embargo's peak, crude oil imports dropped by 17 percent.
The 38-cent average price for gasoline jumped to 54 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a governor who three years later would be elected
president, asked Georgia's state employes to save electricity by
using the stairs instead of the elevators at work.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans heeded Nixon's pleas to turn down their
home and office thermostats to 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines conserved jet fuel by packing more passengers onto
fewer flights. They overbooked so heavily that when consumer
advocate Ralph Nader was bumped, a federal district judge ordered
the airline to pay him $25,100.
</P>
<P>
   The big neon signs in front of motels blinked off. Nixon parked
Air Force One and caught a commercial flight to his home in
California. That year, the lights on the national Christmas tree
erected outside the White House each December were kept turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices stayed up, and Israel reached a truce with Syria and
Egypt. Missions accomplished, the Arabs halted their embargo in
March 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But many older Americans still suspect it was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on,'' recalled Lee Ramsnyder, who
operated the Lan-Mar Marina on Georgia's Lake Lanier. ``I remember
hearing there was a secret supply in Louisiana or someplace like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pumped most of our gas to boaters on weekends, and we kept
running out by Sunday afternoon,'' he said. ``I think maybe a lot
of it was done by the government to pull us out of a little
recession by making people back up a bit on fuel use and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ramsnyder rebuilds used tour buses, installs luxuries
ranging from stoves and showers to trash compactors, and then sells
the vehicles to entertainers and other travelers who don't care
that they only get about eight miles to the gallon.

OPRAH-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ When Oprah Winfrey read ``Beloved,''
Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, she immediately
wanted to turn it into a movie. Now the film nobody _ including
Morrison _ ever thought could be made is here and it's generating
strong buzz for its unflinching portrayal of an African American
family coming to grips with the legacy of slavery. Winfrey, in just
her second film role, is being talked up for an Oscar (``Oprah ...
Oscar ... Oscar ... Oprah''), too, but she says she's not going to
give up her daytime job any time soon. ``What I need to do in TV is
just beginning,'' Winfrey says. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
HAPPINESS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ There's irony in the movie
``Happiness'' from writer-director Todd Solondz, whose comedy about
extreme sexuality and dysfunction seems more disapproving than
empathetic. (3 stars). By Bob Strauss. 
. 
BELOVED-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Faithful to a fault to Toni
Morrison's 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Jonathan Demme's
shockingly vivid ``Beloved'' is a movie _ whether you like it or
not _ that will stay with you long after the house lights go up. (3
stars). By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
MAGIC-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Practical Magic'' blends romance,
rah-rah sisterhood, family drama and outlandish supernatural
effects into a bland, watered-down concoction that rarely bubbles
into anything appetizing. (2 stars). By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
NUDITY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Odette Springer's ``Some Nudity
Required'' hits the expected feminist notes, reveals repressed
memories of child abuse and confirms that Roger Corman and his ilk
who make movies like ``Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers'' can be kind of
crude. (2 stars). By Bob Strauss. 
. 
CELEBRATION-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Funny, fiercely well-acted but
hardly as revolutionary as it wants to be, ``The Celebration'' is a
dysfunctional family drama that won a special jury prize at the
Cannes Film Festival, presumably for its character honesty. (3
stars). Bob Strauss. 
. 
EVEREST-IMAX (Los Angeles) _ On May 23, 1996, filmmaker David
Breashears and an IMAX film crew stood on top of the world, only
days after the worst climbing tragedy in the history of Mount
Everest. Their quest for the summit is told in ``Everest,'' which
opens today in Los Angeles. By Bob McCarthy. 
 
 
MORRISSETTE-CONCERT-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Review of Alanis
Morrissette's concert Wednesday night at the Hollywood Palladium..
By Fred Shuster. 
. 
SHARPS-FLATS (Los Angeles) _ Kokomo. It was one of the greatest
'70s soul revues you've never heard of. From 1974 to 1982, this
supremely talented band cut three excellent yet hard-to-find
platters for Columbia and toured the States opening for Average
White Band. Much of the band's best material is collected on the
anthology ``Kokomo: The Collection'' (Castle), which can be ordered
through the online mail-order shop at NME.com. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ By Fred Shuster and James Hames.

XFILES-VIDEO (Los Angeles) _ For all you fans who didn't make it to
the theaters, now you can watch ``The X-Files'' movie in your
living rooms. And, as a bonus, the video has a couple of prolonged
scenes _ one that explains the fate of one of the characters, and
another that elaborates on the ongoing conspiracy. By Rob Lowman.

ELDER BUSH SAYS SON'S SUCCESS HIS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush has not asked his powerful
father for ``one darn thing'' during a long career that has ranged
from oil and gas ventures to the state's top political job, former
President Bush told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush's comments came amid increasing speculation, and
scrutiny, over the possibility of his son's run for president in
2000. Among the questions being raised by political opponents are
whether the younger Bush relied on his father's help in business,
politics and military service.
</P>
<P>
   Such accusations, the former president said, are ``groundless,
untrue and unfair to my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41st president, who has largely kept a low profile at his
Houston home since leaving office in 1993, has begun to speak out
more often as two of his sons conduct gubernatorial campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about his eldest son undergoing media scrutiny
at a time when politicians' private lives are increasingly becoming
public, the 74-year-old father said he is thankful that sons George
W., 52, and Jeb, 45, a gubernatorial candidate in Florida, haven't
been discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current `gotcha' atmosphere discourages a lot of good
young people from getting into public service,'' the former
president said, responding in writing to questions from the
Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank heavens my two sons have not been discouraged. I feel
many in the media are too often intrusive and unaccountable. Some
unnamed source makes a groundless charge and it is repeated and
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened to me, and I expect it will continue to happen to
my two decent sons in the political arena, who deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   President Bush also called the Texas governor a ``true leader
who brought dignity and respect to his office,'' saying that he and
Barbara Bush ``have been proud of him at every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The former chief executive agreed to accept two questions in
writing. A spokesman in the elder Bush's office said that, because
of the number of inquiries being received, Bush's time is limited.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about whether the governor had ever
used connections to help him advance in business, politics or
military service, Bush wrote: ``I am offended by the suggestion.
George never asked me for one darn thing in business, politics, and
certainly not the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``In business, he built his own company and never tried to drop
my name. And I can guarantee you that the head of George's National
Guard unit told the truth when he said anyone who intimated
influence was used was a `damned liar.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to recent comments by retired Lt. Col. Walter
B. ``Buck'' Staudt, the younger Bush's commanding officer, in the
Washington Post. George W. Bush, who entered the Air National Guard
in 1968, flew F-102 fighter jets. He was not drafted and did not
serve in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable father/son comparisons also provoked comment from
the former president. He told GQ magazine recently that he is
``immune to these things now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts George and it hurts Jeb to have it look like they're
riding a wave their incompetent father couldn't,'' he told GQ.
``And I've tried to assure them that it's inevitable, and, in some
schools of journalism, mandatory, so don't you boys worry about it;
it's not going to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, George W. Bush's gubernatorial
opponent, Democratic land commissioner Garry Mauro, called the
governor a ``decent man from a decent family.'' He said Bush
benefits from having George and Barbara Bush as parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is look at his contributor list,'' Mauro
said, referring George W. Bush. ``There's a lot of people on his
list that are former contributors to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president has become involved in the Texas lieutenant
governor's race. He has helped Republican Rick Perry raise money,
and also appears in a recent TV ad, saying that the former first
family supports Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The election is Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Fero, a spokesman for Perry's Democratic opponent, state
Comptroller John Sharp, said Sharp has a ``great deal of respect''
for the former president. But Fero said the candidates' records and
their platforms will decide the race, not ``partisan
endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, George W. Bush said his famous name has both
helped and hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a great name,'' the governor said. ``When your name is
George Bush and you've had a father who has brought class and
dignity to the process, it's helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, some people assume that he ``can't possibly do
any good as governor _ `He's just this spoiled kid who's got famous
parents.'''

LONG ISLAND WINERIES OFFER A TASTE OF THE GOOD LIFE

   Long Island is known for many things, not all of them positive,
but perhaps the least likely given the din and congestion of the
townships closest to New York City is that the extreme east end
supports one of the state's four wine regions, and the one with by
far the longest growing season.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest is only coming to its conclusion now at Paumanok, as
it is at the 16 other wineries along a concentrated length of Long
Island's North Fork.
</P>
<P>
   The North Fork's season is at least a month longer than the
Finger Lakes, or Hudson Valley, or Niagara frontier, and even
several weeks longer than the nearby South Fork, because of
prevailing air and water currents.
</P>
<P>
   So not surprisingly there are 17 wineries on the North Fork, and
only two on the South Fork. A little of that has to do with the
availability and cost of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamptons are on the South Fork, where property is valued
practically by the cubic inch. But then, the entire Long Island
winery industry is a rich man's game, just as this used to be
strictly a rich man's playground. Even real estate along the North
Fork, formerly rich potato and vegetable farms, runs $18,000 to
$25,000 an acre, which is a major reason there are few big
vineyards _ only two are over 100 acres, Pindar and Macari. As a
result there are rarely bargains to be had in Long Island wines.
It's pricey stuff because it's made for the most part in limited
quantity on very pricey land.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, some of the best wines made in New York, or anywhere
in the United States for that matter, are created here. That
remains a moderately well-kept secret because so much of the
produce, particularly from the smaller wineries, doesn't travel far
from the vineyard, and seldom past a few restaurants in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The east end of Long Island is a terrific spot for wine lovers
for a weekend or even better, mid-week getaway. All 17 North Fork
wineries are located on two roads along 18 miles, from Riverhead to
Greenport.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration and variety are such that one home base at one
of the dozens of stately old bed-and-breakfasts in the area is
perfect for forays at two and three wineries at a time. There are
plenty of good restaurants in the neighborhood since the North Fork
and South Fork have been touristy areas for centuries. This year,
Hargrave Vineyard, the first winery on Long Island, is celebrating
its 25th anniversary, indicative of just how new this business is
on the North Fork. The winery is also up for sale, also indicative
of the ``shaking-out'' that is ongoing in these essentially
formative years.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa and Alex Hargrave, in their early 20s, fresh out of
Harvard and from affluent families, wandered the West Coast and
Finger Lakes for a place to open a winery in order to produce big
red wines like the ones they admired in Bordeaux. They were
attracted to the potato fields of the East End, and created what
had only been dreamed about before. And they did indeed create some
wonderful, big reds, award-winners still talked about years later.
The cabernet sauvignon grape has the needed time to ripen here as
it does nowhere else in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The big red of a perfect cabernet sauvignon, perhaps softened a
little in the Bordeaux manner with either cabernet franc or merlot,
remains the preferred quest of almost all the other winery owners
drawn in by the Hargrave experiment. The most notable successes in
my view, however, have been with chardonnay, riesling and the
medium reds, particularly merlot, but also cabernet franc.
</P>
<P>
   If a single grape is best suited for the area, it's chardonnay,
as riesling is for the Finger Lakes. Virtually every Long Island
winery puts its own signature on this grape, from the most austere
finish in stainless steel and without a mellowing secondary
fermentation, to the biggest, oakiest, fruitiest California finish
imaginable. The years 1988 and 1995 are the benchmarks, although
characterizing benchmarks for a region that's only been making wine
for a quarter of a century is about as presumptuous as slapping
``vintage'' on a gallon jug of California bulk wine.
</P>
<P>
   This year also could be world-class for all of Long Island's
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are two-thirds the way through a potentially remarkable
year,'' acknowledged Charles Massoud, winemaker and co-owner with
his wife, Ursula, of Paumanok in Aquebogue. ``A mild winter and hot
August, and even the 11 days of uninterrupted rain early came just
at the right time for when the vines need to push and grow. We are
about a week ahead of a normal year,'' he added, due to the mild
winter and spring.
</P>
<P>
   Massoud is also president of the Long Island Wine Council, and
is a reasonably representative North Fork winery owner. He was born
in Lebanon of a well-to-do international hotel and restaurant
family. His wife is German, from a family with a long history in
wine production. Of the 19 winemaking vineyards, two are owned by
physicians, others by retired advertising executives and venture
capitalists. A few are owned by the less rarefied, but not many.
</P>
<P>
   The upside for the visitor is that nearly all the vineyards have
excellent tasting rooms, open year-round. Most of the wines are
free for the tasting, with a few of the rarer bottles of the better
wines requiring a small tasting fee. Touring the wineries is
inexpensive and enormously rewarding because of the wide range of
attempts with European vinifera grapes and also with native grapes
like Niagara and catawba, and hybrids like Suffolk red and baco
noir.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As to which ones of the wineries to visit, that is a personal
choice. But a suggestion is to start with Pindar, which is
somewhere in the middle geographically, but will establish the
standard. Herodotus ``Dan'' Damianos has the most acreage in grapes
_ 300 _ and offers the most choice and range in wines, sparklers
and stills. He is also the owner of the excellent Duck Walk
Vineyard, one of the two on the South Fork. Duck Walk merlots may
be the best on the island, but there is plenty of stiff competition
for that designation.
</P>
<P>
   After Pindar, must-visits include Hargrave, because of its
distinction as the first winery on Long Island; Palmer and Lenz
because they win the most awards (although I personally feel Lenz
tends to be overrated and overpriced); Paumanok for the chardonnay;
and Pugliese for sparkling wines.
</P>
<P>
   A word about pricing. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to
it, which was confirmed by discussing the matter with winery
owners. One bottle of merlot will be $18, and another from an
adjoining vineyard, same year, same style, will be $10 more. Price
relates more often to the whim of the owner. So shop around. There
is a wide range in pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind this is a tony tourist area, and plan accordingly.
A bed-and-breakfast in high season before Labor Day, and for
weekends through September, may well have run $125 a night and up.
But prices drop like a pebble in the wishing well in October, which
would be my first choice. Any time before Jan. 1, actually, would
be ideal. The moody Sound and Peconic Bay, bobbing with boats at
anchor, are as romantic a backdrop as Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau
(800-441-4601) for lists of bed-and-breakfasts and other
accommodations. Especially ask for the Long Island Wine Council's
seasonal publication, The Wine Press, which does an excellent job
of profiling all the vineyards, the players, and all available
wines. A helpful booklet is ``Newsday Guide to the Wines of Long
Island,'' by Peter M. Gianotti, and the more in-depth ``The Wines
of Long Island,'' by Philip F. Palmedo and Edward Beltrami.

<P>
   The nuclear tests India conducted this year on May 11 and May 13
were not only inevitable, but also a continuation of policies from
almost its earliest years of independence.
</P>
<P>
   India's nuclear policy remains firmly committed to a basic
tenet: that the country's national security in a world of nuclear
proliferation lies either in global disarmament or in exercise of
the principle of equal and legitimate security for all.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, when a free India took its rightful place in the world,
both the nuclear age and the Cold War had already dawned. Instead
of aligning with either bloc, India rejected the Cold War paradigm
and chose the more difficult path of nonalignment.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, India's foreign policy was based on its
desire to attain an alternative global balance of power that,
crucially, was structured around universal, nondiscriminatory
disarmament. Nuclear technology had already transformed global
security. Nuclear weapons, theorists reasoned, are not actually
weapons of war but, in effect, military deterrents and tools of
possible diplomatic coercion.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Indian nuclear policy, therefore, remains that a
world free of nuclear weapons would enhance not only India's
security but the security of all nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of universal disarmament, India could scarcely
accept a regime that arbitrarily divided nuclear haves from
have-nots. India has always insisted that all nations' security
interests are equal and legitimate. From the start, therefore, its
principles instilled a distaste for the self-identified and closed
club of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, nuclear weapons were routinely tested above
ground, making the mushroom cloud the age's symbol. Even then, when
the world had witnessed only a few dozen tests, India took the lead
in calling for an end to all nuclear-weapons testing, but the calls
of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, India's security concerns deepened. In 1962, China
attacked India on its Himalayan border. The nuclear age entered
India's neighborhood when China became a nuclear power in October
1964. From then on, no responsible Indian leader could rule out the
option of following suit.
</P>
<P>
   With no international guarantees of Indian security forthcoming,
nuclear abstinence by India alone seemed increasingly worrisome.
With the 1962 war with China very much on his mind, Indian Prime
Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri began tentatively investigating a
subterranean nuclear-explosion project.
</P>
<P>
   A series of Indian nonproliferation initiatives had scant
impact. In 1965, to make matters worse, the second war between
India and Pakistan broke out. Shastri died in 1966 and was
succeeded by Indira Gandhi, who continued the fruitless search for
international guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, India reaffirmed its commitment to disarmament but
decided not to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In 1974 it
conducted its first nuclear test, Pokharan I.
</P>
<P>
   The first 50 years of Indian independence reveal that the
country's moralistic nuclear policy and restraint paid no
measurable dividends, except resentment at home that India was
being discriminated against. Disarmament seemed increasingly
unrealistic politics.
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent five's possession of nuclear weapons increases
security, why would India's possession of nuclear weapons be
dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent five continue to employ nuclear weapons as an
international currency of force and power, why should India
voluntarily devalue its own state power and national security?
</P>
<P>
   If deterrence works in the West _ as it so obviously appears to,
since Western nations insist on continuing to possess nuclear
weapons _ by what reasoning will it not work in India?
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear-weapons powers continue to have, but preach to the
have-nots to have even less. India counters by suggesting either
universal, nondiscriminatory disarmament or equal security for the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11 India successfully carried out three underground
nuclear tests, followed on May 13 by two more underground,
sub-kiloton tests. These five tests, ranging from the sub-kiloton
and fission variety to a thermonuclear device, amply demonstrated
India's scientific, technical and organizational abilities, which
until then had only been vaguely suspected.
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight later, on May 28 and May 30, neighboring Pakistan
predictably carried out its own tests in the bleak fastness of the
Chagai Hills in Baluchistan, near the Afghan border. Suddenly the
strategic equipoise of the post-Cold War world was rattled. The
entire nonproliferation regime and the future of disarmament were
at the forefront of international agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence, India has consistently advocated global
nuclear disarmament, convinced that a world without nuclear weapons
will enhance both global and Indian security.
</P>
<P>
   India was the first to call for a ban on nuclear testing in
1954, for a nondiscriminatory treaty on nonproliferation in 1965,
for a treaty on nonuse of nuclear weapons in 1978, for a nuclear
freeze in 1982 and for a phased program for complete elimination of
nuclear weapons in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of these initiatives were rejected by the
nuclear-weapons states, who still consider these weapons essential
for their own security. What emerged, in consequence, has been a
discriminatory and flawed nonproliferation regime that damages
India's security.
</P>
<P>
   For years India conveyed its apprehensions to other countries,
but this did not improve its security environment. This disharmony
and disjunction between global thought and trends in Indian thought
about nuclear weapons is, unfortunately, the objective reality of
the world. Nuclear weapons remain a key indicator of state power.
</P>
<P>
   During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to
Washington, the United States insisted on a separate agreement with
China on Chinese proliferation to Iran and Pakistan, which the
Chinese signed instead of professing their innocence. Both the U.S.
unease and the Chinese signature attest to Chinese proliferation as
a threat to India's security.
</P>
<P>
   After all these assurances, China continued to pass missile
technology and components to Pakistan. Despite this, the Clinton
administration was still willing to certify that China was not
proliferating or _ even worse for India _ that the United States
was either unable or unwilling to restrain China.
</P>
<P>
   As the range of options for India narrowed, so too did the
problems of taking corrective action. The tests of May 11 and May
13 were not directed against any country. They were intended to
reassure the people of India about their own security.
</P>
<P>
   India is now a nuclear weapons state, as is Pakistan. That
reality can neither be denied nor wished away. India's strengthened
nuclear capacity adds to its sense of responsibility _ the
obligation of power. India, mindful of its international duties, is
committed to not using these weapons to commit aggression or to
mount threats against any country. These are weapons of
self-defense, to ensure that India too is not subjected to nuclear
coercion. India stated that henceforth it will observe a voluntary
moratorium and refrain from conducting underground nuclear-test
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that the end of the Cold War did not result in the
end of history. The great thaw that began in the late 1980s melted
down the ancient animosities of Europe. But India still lives in a
rough neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a great error to assume that simply advocating the
new mantras of globalization and the market serves to make national
security subservient to global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century will not be the century of trade. The world
still has to address the unfinished agenda of the centuries.

<P>
   The nuclear tests India conducted this year on May 11 and May 13
were not only inevitable, but also a continuation of policies from
almost its earliest years of independence.
</P>
<P>
   India's nuclear policy remains firmly committed to a basic
tenet: that the country's national security in a world of nuclear
proliferation lies either in global disarmament or in exercise of
the principle of equal and legitimate security for all.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, when a free India took its rightful place in the world,
both the nuclear age and the Cold War had already dawned. Instead
of aligning with either bloc, India rejected the Cold War paradigm
and chose the more difficult path of nonalignment.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, India's foreign policy was based on its
desire to attain an alternative global balance of power that,
crucially, was structured around universal, nondiscriminatory
disarmament. Nuclear technology had already transformed global
security. Nuclear weapons, theorists reasoned, are not actually
weapons of war but, in effect, military deterrents and tools of
possible diplomatic coercion.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Indian nuclear policy, therefore, remains that a
world free of nuclear weapons would enhance not only India's
security but the security of all nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of universal disarmament, India could scarcely
accept a regime that arbitrarily divided nuclear haves from
have-nots. India has always insisted that all nations' security
interests are equal and legitimate. From the start, therefore, its
principles instilled a distaste for the self-identified and closed
club of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, nuclear weapons were routinely tested above
ground, making the mushroom cloud the age's symbol. Even then, when
the world had witnessed only a few dozen tests, India took the lead
in calling for an end to all nuclear-weapons testing, but the calls
of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, India's security concerns deepened. In 1962, China
attacked India on its Himalayan border. The nuclear age entered
India's neighborhood when China became a nuclear power in October
1964. From then on, no responsible Indian leader could rule out the
option of following suit.
</P>
<P>
   With no international guarantees of Indian security forthcoming,
nuclear abstinence by India alone seemed increasingly worrisome.
With the 1962 war with China very much on his mind, Indian Prime
Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri began tentatively investigating a
subterranean nuclear-explosion project.
</P>
<P>
   A series of Indian nonproliferation initiatives had scant
impact. In 1965, to make matters worse, the second war between
India and Pakistan broke out. Shastri died in 1966 and was
succeeded by Indira Gandhi, who continued the fruitless search for
international guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, India reaffirmed its commitment to disarmament but
decided not to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In 1974 it
conducted its first nuclear test, Pokharan I.
</P>
<P>
   The first 50 years of Indian independence reveal that the
country's moralistic nuclear policy and restraint paid no
measurable dividends, except resentment at home that India was
being discriminated against. Disarmament seemed increasingly
unrealistic politics.
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent five's possession of nuclear weapons increases
security, why would India's possession of nuclear weapons be
dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent five continue to employ nuclear weapons as an
international currency of force and power, why should India
voluntarily devalue its own state power and national security?
</P>
<P>
   If deterrence works in the West _ as it so obviously appears to,
since Western nations insist on continuing to possess nuclear
weapons _ by what reasoning will it not work in India?
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear-weapons powers continue to have, but preach to the
have-nots to have even less. India counters by suggesting either
universal, nondiscriminatory disarmament or equal security for the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11 India successfully carried out three underground
nuclear tests, followed on May 13 by two more underground,
sub-kiloton tests. These five tests, ranging from the sub-kiloton
and fission variety to a thermonuclear device, amply demonstrated
India's scientific, technical and organizational abilities, which
until then had only been vaguely suspected.
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight later, on May 28 and May 30, neighboring Pakistan
predictably carried out its own tests in the bleak fastness of the
Chagai Hills in Baluchistan, near the Afghan border. Suddenly the
strategic equipoise of the post-Cold War world was rattled. The
entire nonproliferation regime and the future of disarmament were
at the forefront of international agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence, India has consistently advocated global
nuclear disarmament, convinced that a world without nuclear weapons
will enhance both global and Indian security.
</P>
<P>
   India was the first to call for a ban on nuclear testing in
1954, for a nondiscriminatory treaty on nonproliferation in 1965,
for a treaty on nonuse of nuclear weapons in 1978, for a nuclear
freeze in 1982 and for a phased program for complete elimination of
nuclear weapons in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of these initiatives were rejected by the
nuclear-weapons states, who still consider these weapons essential
for their own security. What emerged, in consequence, has been a
discriminatory and flawed nonproliferation regime that damages
India's security.
</P>
<P>
   For years India conveyed its apprehensions to other countries,
but this did not improve its security environment. This disharmony
and disjunction between global thought and trends in Indian thought
about nuclear weapons is, unfortunately, the objective reality of
the world. Nuclear weapons remain a key indicator of state power.
</P>
<P>
   During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to
Washington, the United States insisted on a separate agreement with
China on Chinese proliferation to Iran and Pakistan, which the
Chinese signed instead of professing their innocence. Both the U.S.
unease and the Chinese signature attest to Chinese proliferation as
a threat to India's security.
</P>
<P>
   After all these assurances, China continued to pass missile
technology and components to Pakistan. Despite this, the Clinton
administration was still willing to certify that China was not
proliferating or _ even worse for India _ that the United States
was either unable or unwilling to restrain China.
</P>
<P>
   As the range of options for India narrowed, so too did the
problems of taking corrective action. The tests of May 11 and May
13 were not directed against any country. They were intended to
reassure the people of India about their own security.
</P>
<P>
   India is now a nuclear weapons state, as is Pakistan. That
reality can neither be denied nor wished away. India's strengthened
nuclear capacity adds to its sense of responsibility _ the
obligation of power. India, mindful of its international duties, is
committed to not using these weapons to commit aggression or to
mount threats against any country. These are weapons of
self-defense, to ensure that India too is not subjected to nuclear
coercion. India stated that henceforth it will observe a voluntary
moratorium and refrain from conducting underground nuclear-test
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that the end of the Cold War did not result in the
end of history. The great thaw that began in the late 1980s melted
down the ancient animosities of Europe. But India still lives in a
rough neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a great error to assume that simply advocating the
new mantras of globalization and the market serves to make national
security subservient to global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century will not be the century of trade. The world
still has to address the unfinished agenda of the centuries.

<P>
   On Nov. 16, 1995, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark sat in Dayton, Ohio, in
a PowerScene virtual reality imaging system, using a joystick to
fly back and forth through simulated three-dimensional scenes of
the hills of Bosnia east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 p.m., Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic joined
him, as well as some other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lubricated by Scotch, Milosevic and the Americans zoomed back
and forth on the computer simulation to try to carve out a path
from the besieged Bosnian capital to Gorazde, a U.N. ``safe area''
surrounded by Bosnian Serbs. In the wee hours of the morning, Clark
used crayons to draw a corridor from Sarajevo to Goraz de that was
not hopelessly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic shook hands with Clark, who is now the supreme allied
commander in Europe, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the main American
peace negotiator, and what is variously known as the Clark Corridor
or the Scotch Road was born.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the United States had shifted from a determination not
to be dragged into the Balkans to using U.S. officials and
computers to draw Bosnia's new frontiers. Winston Churchill used to
brag about having drawn Jordan's borders on a map one afternoon;
the American general could say much the same thing about Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But America's entry lacked swagger. Rather, U.S. policymakers
came to sketch the Scotch Road with a profound sense of
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to this diplomacy _ including Holbrooke's
memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996 official
study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of November 1995
_ show that American officials were painfully aware of the
shortcomings of U.S. Bosnia policy and the distance it had shifted
from the goals that Bill Clinton had espoused in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Dayton was a vast improvement over the muddle and
bloodshed that preceded it. But it has been oversold.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton represented not the vindication of the liberal ideals
with which Clinton excoriated George Bush on the 1992 campaign
trail _ firm action to halt genocide, bringing war criminals to
justice, tolerance, multiethnic nation-states, liberal nationalism
and the use of international and European institutions _ but rather
a version of the chilly realpolitik that kept the Bush
administration out of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal the administration helped cut edged ominously close to
partition, writing an epitaph for Bosnia as a multiethnic state and
ceding much of its territory to the Bosnian Serbs. Many of Dayton's
better provisions, especially the prosecution of war criminals and
the return of refugees, remain largely unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Dayton required dealing with and ultimately strengthening
Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, two ethnic
nationalists whose ideology and ruthlessness are antithetical to
liberal values.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's lessons are grimly appropriate when considering the
current violence in Kosovo, where Milosevic's demagoguery helped
set off Yugoslavia's demise and which is the latest target of his
ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the approach that
strengthened Milosevic and Tudjman. By doing so, Dayton plunged
Serbia deeper into ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb
soil'' of Kosovo matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the
Albanians living on top of it. As such, today's crisis comes as
scant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater has shifted, and while Kosovo is part of
Serbia proper, the underlying questions are much the same. As in
1993, the Clinton administration finds itself faced with a
fundamental choice. Will the United States push Milosevic to
respect autonomy, the rights of minorities, and the rule of law, or
will it retreat, as it did for two years in Bosnia, by saying that
getting involved is not worth American blood and treasure?
</P>
<P>
   If it does back down, the retreat must include the realization
that the Clinton administration's earlier policy of realpolitik
eased the way to future episodes thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Winning any accord in Bosnia was not easy. Dayton took
considerable diplomatic skill and tenacity. Congress' isolationists
proved unhelpful and irresponsible, and the administration ran huge
political risks by deciding to intervene. But it ran those risks
for a reluctant realism.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to wonder what might have been if it had run them
on behalf of the liberal ideals that it promised. In the end, the
very policies that the administration balked at in May 1993 _ using
military force and firm leadership of the Europeans _ were the ones
that stopped the war in the autumn of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia, the cost of delay was more than 100,000 lives. The
fuller our picture of Dayton becomes, the clearer it is that the
Dayton process _ its accomplishments notwithstanding _ is less a
how-to manual for peacemakers than a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Clinton administration inherited a mess. Its
Republican predecessors were consummate realists. After meeting
Milosevic in Belgrade in June 1991 to warn him against
``exploitation of ethnic resentments (and) failure to respect human
rights in Kosovo'' _ complaints that could be lifted from today's
headlines _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt he ``was
talking to a wall with a crew cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration greeted Yugoslav intransigence with a
shrug. Its basic _ and correct _ diplomatic calculus was that only
military force would deter the ambitions of Milosevic and Tudjman.
Its basic _ and incorrect _ political calculus was that such an
intervention could never be sold to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shaded by Bush's determination not to try.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said that the president
would frequently ask him, ``Tell me again what this is all about.''
He saw no U.S. interests engaged in Bosnia, and his European allies
reinforced his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in, where does it end?'' asked British Prime Minister
John Major. Instead, the Bush administration treated Bosnia as, in
Baker's words, ``a humanitarian nightmare in the heart of Europe,''
as if Bosnia's woes were the result of a famine or an earthquake
rather than an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Baker put it, was that the costs in
casualties ``would have been staggering ... the necessary support
by the American people for the degree of force that would have been
required in Bosnia could never have been built or maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different policy on
the campaign trail. ``I know that ethnic divisions are one of the
strongest impulses in all of society all over the world,'' he said,
``but we've got to take a stand against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration, he charged, was immoral ``for turning
its back on violations of basic human rights,'' and needed to show
``real leadership.'' When the Clinton administration dithered,
unlike the Bush administration, it did so in defiance of its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The war could well have been ended in May 1993 had the president
fulfilled his campaign pledge to lift the arms embargo on the
Bosnians and launch air strikes on the Serbs. At that time, Clinton
sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to sound out the
Europeans about lift and strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher was instructed to consult, not to lead, and what
he heard was across-the-board opposition, concern for European
soldiers in the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), distaste for
supposed American arrogance and warnings that NATO might sunder.
</P>
<P>
   At a pivotal briefing in the Roosevelt Room the morning of his
return, Christopher told Clinton that lift and strike was still
viable, but that it would require, as he put it, a ``raw power
approach'': telling the Europeans ``that we have firmly decided to
go ahead with our preferred option and that we expect them to
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the choices, Christopher explained, the least attractive
_ and most hypocritical _ would be to continue the Bush policy of
``doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton blanched.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, after two years of fecklessness, did Clinton
ultimately act decisively, backing heretofore toothless diplomacy
with force and American leadership? Alas, the answer to this puzzle
lies in a startling decision _ or, better, a nondecision _ that no
administration should repeat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the August 1995 decision to push for Holbrooke's
shuttle, without being fully aware of it, Washington had already
committed itself to a military presence in Bosnia. The decision was
made in so aimless a manner that almost all senior officials were
caught off guard when the implications of what they had done
finally sank in.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Bosnia study confirms that most senior
foreign policy officials, most notably the president himself, were
surprised to learn in June 1995 that U.S. troops might soon be on
their way to Bosnia whether the administration liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion stemmed from an earlier presidential decision
that, should the situation on the ground become chaotic enough to
prevent UNPROFOR _ the hapless U.N. peacekeeping mission already in
Bosnia _ from functioning, NATO would intervene to help the blue
helmets flee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration confirmed this commitment in late
1994, and NATO military planners duly began work on Op-plan 40104,
which called for using 20,000 U.S. troops as part of a
60,000-person evacuation force.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO approved this mission in the spring of 1995 with the
consent of American NATO Amb. Robert E. Hunter and U.S. military
planners in Brussels, the Clinton administration boxed itself in.
</P>
<P>
   While an intervention to limit U.N. failure would be dangerous
and humiliating, the White House figured that reneging on its
promise to NATO would destroy the remains of its credibility and
devastate an already frayed alliance.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.N. peacekeeping force daily revealed to be impotent,
the only way Washington could forestall the withdrawal mission to
which it had committed itself was to push the parties to peace _ a
better option, but one that would still require sending American
troops to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   What one Clinton adviser called ``the single most difficult
decision of (Clinton's) presidency _ to send troops to Bosnia'' had
been made without anyone realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   As the war worsened, the specter of Op-plan 40104 loomed larger.
The Serb massacres of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in July 1995 in
the U.N.-designated ``safe areas'' of Srebrenica and Zepa _ the
worst war crimes in Europe since those of the Nazis _ made
UNPROFOR's ignominy complete.
</P>
<P>
   European countries participating in UNPROFOR began warning that
they would soon pull their troops out, triggering what American
policymakers referred to as the 40104 ``doomsday machine'' _
intervention triggered by humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior officials, including U.N. Amb. Madeleine K.
Albright and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, began arguing
that since American troops were headed for Bosnia anyway, the
administration should try to implement a success rather than ratify
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   As one official memorably put it, the question on Bosnia was not
whether to stay in or out; it was ``choosing which waterfall we
will go over.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven mainly by Lake and the National Security Council staff,
senior officials spent the rest of the summer scurrying to come up
with a plan. In August, Holbrooke's mission began.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to reevaluate its Bosnia
diplomacy came not from a realization of the failure of its earlier
rudderlessness or a renewal of Wilsonian principle. Rather, it came
from a decision few could even remember making.
</P>
<P>
   When apprised of the details of Op-plan 40104, everyone _ from
Holbrooke to Christopher to Clinton himself _ was shocked. The
choice to commit U.S. troops to help withdraw UNPROFOR was not the
fruit of any formal deliberative process in which the president
approved the mission through such standard means as a decision
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was made by inertia. If there were lessons to be
learned from the earlier decisions not to intervene, they were not
learned by the Clinton administration. Instead, it became bold
almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dayton accord, which emerged from the haphazard process
triggered by Op-plan 40104, as Holbrooke himself concedes, is
hardly perfect. To be sure, it stopped the fighting, at least for
the time being, which should not be underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   But what is left of Bosnia are the tatters of a tolerant,
cosmopolitan society. Ultimately, the West lacked the will to
reverse Serb and Croat aggression, and the Bosnian-Serb obsession
with self-rule was ratified.

Serbia deeper into ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb
soil'' of Kosovo matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the
Albanians living on top of it. As such, today's crisis comes as
scant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater has shifted, and while Kosovo is part of
Serbia proper, the underlying questions are much the same. As in
1993, the Clinton administration finds itself faced with a
fundamental choice. Will the United States push Milosevic to
respect autonomy, the rights of minorities, and the rule of law, or
will it retreat, as it did for two years in Bosnia, by saying that
getting involved is not worth American blood and treasure?
</P>
<P>
   If it does back down, the retreat must include the realization
that the Clinton administration's earlier policy of realpolitik
eased the way to future episodes thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Winning any accord in Bosnia was not easy. Dayton took
considerable diplomatic skill and tenacity. Congress' isolationists
proved unhelpful and irresponsible, and the administration ran huge
political risks by deciding to intervene. But it ran those risks
for a reluctant realism.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to wonder what might have been if it had run them
on behalf of the liberal ideals that it promised. In the end, the
very policies that the administration balked at in May 1993 _ using
military force and firm leadership of the Europeans _ were the ones
that stopped the war in the autumn of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia, the cost of delay was more than 100,000 lives. The
fuller our picture of Dayton becomes, the clearer it is that the
Dayton process _ its accomplishments notwithstanding _ is less a
how-to manual for peacemakers than a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Clinton administration inherited a mess. Its
Republican predecessors were consummate realists. After meeting
Milosevic in Belgrade in June 1991 to warn him against
``exploitation of ethnic resentments (and) failure to respect human
rights in Kosovo'' _ complaints that could be lifted from today's
headlines _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt he ``was
talking to a wall with a crew cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration greeted Yugoslav intransigence with a
shrug. Its basic _ and correct _ diplomatic calculus was that only
military force would deter the ambitions of Milosevic and Tudjman.
Its basic _ and incorrect _ political calculus was that such an
intervention could never be sold to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shaded by Bush's determination not to try.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said that the president
would frequently ask him, ``Tell me again what this is all about.''
He saw no U.S. interests engaged in Bosnia, and his European allies
reinforced his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in, where does it end?'' asked British Prime Minister
John Major. Instead, the Bush administration treated Bosnia as, in
Baker's words, ``a humanitarian nightmare in the heart of Europe,''
as if Bosnia's woes were the result of a famine or an earthquake
rather than an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Baker put it, was that the costs in
casualties ``would have been staggering ... the necessary support
by the American people for the degree of force that would have been
required in Bosnia could never have been built or maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different policy on
the campaign trail. ``I know that ethnic divisions are one of the
strongest impulses in all of society all over the world,'' he said,
``but we've got to take a stand against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration, he charged, was immoral ``for turning
its back on violations of basic human rights,'' and needed to show
``real leadership.'' When the Clinton administration dithered,
unlike the Bush administration, it did so in defiance of its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The war could well have been ended in May 1993 had the president
fulfilled his campaign pledge to lift the arms embargo on the
Bosnians and launch air strikes on the Serbs. At that time, Clinton
sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to sound out the
Europeans about lift and strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher was instructed to consult, not to lead, and what
he heard was across-the-board opposition, concern for European
soldiers in the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), distaste for
supposed American arrogance and warnings that NATO might sunder.
</P>
<P>
   At a pivotal briefing in the Roosevelt Room the morning of his
return, Christopher told Clinton that lift and strike was still
viable, but that it would require, as he put it, a ``raw power
approach'': telling the Europeans ``that we have firmly decided to
go ahead with our preferred option and that we expect them to
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the choices, Christopher explained, the least attractive
_ and most hypocritical _ would be to continue the Bush policy of
``doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton blanched.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, after two years of fecklessness, did Clinton
ultimately act decisively, backing heretofore toothless diplomacy
with force and American leadership? Alas, the answer to this puzzle
lies in a startling decision _ or, better, a nondecision _ that no
administration should repeat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the August 1995 decision to push for Holbrooke's
shuttle, without being fully aware of it, Washington had already
committed itself to a military presence in Bosnia. The decision was
made in so aimless a manner that almost all senior officials were
caught off guard when the implications of what they had done
finally sank in.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Bosnia study confirms that most senior
foreign policy officials, most notably the president himself, were
surprised to learn in June 1995 that U.S. troops might soon be on
their way to Bosnia whether the administration liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion stemmed from an earlier presidential decision
that, should the situation on the ground become chaotic enough to
prevent UNPROFOR _ the hapless U.N. peacekeeping mission already in
Bosnia _ from functioning, NATO would intervene to help the blue
helmets flee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration confirmed this commitment in late
1994, and NATO military planners duly began work on Op-plan 40104,
which called for using 20,000 U.S. troops as part of a
60,000-person evacuation force.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO approved this mission in the spring of 1995 with the
consent of American NATO Amb. Robert E. Hunter and U.S. military
planners in Brussels, the Clinton administration boxed itself in.
</P>
<P>
   While an intervention to limit U.N. failure would be dangerous
and humiliating, the White House figured that reneging on its
promise to NATO would destroy the remains of its credibility and
devastate an already frayed alliance.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.N. peacekeeping force daily revealed to be impotent,
the only way Washington could forestall the withdrawal mission to
which it had committed itself was to push the parties to peace _ a
better option, but one that would still require sending American
troops to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   What one Clinton adviser called ``the single most difficult
decision of (Clinton's) presidency _ to send troops to Bosnia'' had
been made without anyone realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   As the war worsened, the specter of Op-plan 40104 loomed larger.
The Serb massacres of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in July 1995 in
the U.N.-designated ``safe areas'' of Srebrenica and Zepa _ the
worst war crimes in Europe since those of the Nazis _ made
UNPROFOR's ignominy complete.
</P>
<P>
   European countries participating in UNPROFOR began warning that
they would soon pull their troops out, triggering what American
policymakers referred to as the 40104 ``doomsday machine'' _
intervention triggered by humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior officials, including U.N. Amb. Madeleine K.
Albright and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, began arguing
that since American troops were headed for Bosnia anyway, the
administration should try to implement a success rather than ratify
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   As one official memorably put it, the question on Bosnia was not
whether to stay in or out; it was ``choosing which waterfall we
will go over.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven mainly by Lake and the National Security Council staff,
senior officials spent the rest of the summer scurrying to come up
with a plan. In August, Holbrooke's mission began.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to reevaluate its Bosnia
diplomacy came not from a realization of the failure of its earlier
rudderlessness or a renewal of Wilsonian principle. Rather, it came
from a decision few could even remember making.
</P>
<P>
   When apprised of the details of Op-plan 40104, everyone _ from
Holbrooke to Christopher to Clinton himself _ was shocked. The
choice to commit U.S. troops to help withdraw UNPROFOR was not the
fruit of any formal deliberative process in which the president
approved the mission through such standard means as a decision
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was made by inertia. If there were lessons to be
learned from the earlier decisions not to intervene, they were not
learned by the Clinton administration. Instead, it became bold
almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dayton accord, which emerged from the haphazard process
triggered by Op-plan 40104, as Holbrooke himself concedes, is
hardly perfect. To be sure, it stopped the fighting, at least for
the time being, which should not be underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   But what is left of Bosnia are the tatters of a tolerant,
cosmopolitan society. Ultimately, the West lacked the will to
reverse Serb and Croat aggression, and the Bosnian-Serb obsession
with self-rule was ratified.

</P>
<P>
   The way the Japanese bureaucracy is now tackling _ or, rather,
not tackling _ the Japanese banking system's crisis is commonly
seen by Westerners as mere political cowardice, especially by
official Washington: the U.S. Treasury, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But to Tokyo's ruling coterie, procrastination and delay appear
the only rational policies.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows yet how much Japanese financial institutions have
suffered from the bursting of the bubble of their prior financial
boom. On top of their domestic losses now loom huge additional
losses inflicted by the economic crisis in other Asian countries _
South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia _ where Japan's banks
were by far the heaviest lenders, as they have also been to China.
</P>
<P>
   Japan faces the largest financial crisis of any developed
country since World War II. According to an estimate last May in
Business Week, the Japanese banking system will eventually have to
write off domestic losses of about $1 trillion, not including
losses on loans and investment elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This sum handily tops even the highest estimate of the losses
incurred in the U.S. savings and loan debacle 15 years ago, and
this in an economy barely half the size of America's. It amounts to
a stunning 12 percent or so of the funds of all Japanese financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious _ and much harder to handle _ are the banking
crisis' social threats. The entire Japanese financial system is
already being radically downsized. Japan is grossly overbanked, not
so much in the number of institutions as in the number of bank
branches, which are both ubiquitous and heavily overstaffed.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and American financial experts estimate that Japan's
commercial banks employ three to five times as many people per
thousand transactions as do American or European banks. This has
made the banking system one of Japan's largest employers, as well
as its highest-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the redundant though well-paid employees are middle-age
people with limited skills who would find it hard to get other jobs
if laid off. Unemployment in Japan has already risen to the highest
levels in 40 years _ above 4 percent by the official count. If
Japan used American or European definitions of unemployment, it
would be 7 or 8 percent. Only two years ago the official
unemployment rate was still below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even graver than the threat of unemployment is the threat to the
country's social contract, especially the job security of lifetime
employment. If the banks laid off large numbers of people, the
social contract would shatter. The seriousness with which the
Japanese view the social aspects of the crisis is shown by the
lengths to which they will go to preserve a few jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They took the virtually unthinkable step of allowing (indeed,
probably inviting) an American financial firm, Merrill Lynch, to
take over the main branches of Yamaichi, Japan's fourth-largest
brokerage house, when it failed in 1997 simply because Merrill
Lynch promised to keep on about a sixth of Yamaichi's employees _ a
few thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   Only six weeks earlier senior officials in the Ministry of
Finance, which oversees brokerage firms, had still loudly insisted
that they would never let a foreigner do domestic Japanese
securities business.
</P>
<P>
   The bank crisis undermines the structure of Japanese business
and society. It may dissolve Japan's most distinctive economic
organization: the ``keiretsu,'' the cluster of businesses around a
major bank. Contrary to common belief in the West, the keiretsu
does not primarily serve business purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Its first function is to act as the real board of directors for
the member companies, since the official board of each individual
company is just an internal management committee. The keiretsu
quietly removes incompetent top management and checks out proposed
promotions into the top echelons of member companies.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, the keiretsu is a mutual support association. The
members of a component company collectively hold enough of each
other's shares to give the keiretsu effective ownership control. It
thus protects each member against outsiders and hostile takeover
bids.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is the ultimate guarantor of lifetime employment.
If a keiretsu member gets into such serious trouble that it has to
lay off people, the other keiretsu companies will provide jobs for
them. This lets the fellow keiretsu member cut costs and still
fulfill its commitment to permanent job security.
</P>
<P>
   Can the keiretsu survive the financial crisis? The banks at the
core of the typical keiretsu have begun to sell off their holdings
in the group in order to offset their losses. More keiretsu members
are, in turn, selling off their shares in other keiretsu members to
get cash to shore up their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   But, quite apart from the threat to lifetime employment and job
security, what will replace the keiretsu as the organizing
principle of the Japanese economy?
</P>
<P>
   There are no answers to these questions. Thus, the only rational
course for the Japanese bureaucracy may indeed be to have no
policy. That delay will whittle the banking problem down to a
manageable size is probably wishful thinking. But surely the West,
especially the United States, can only hope that the
procrastination strategy will work again.
</P>
<P>
   Social unrest in Japan would be a far more serious threat to
U.S. political, strategic and economic interests than anything that
U.S. businesses or the U.S. economy could possibly gain through the
actions, such as rapid deregulation of the financial sector, which
Washington is now pressing on Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most important key to understanding how the
Japanese bureaucracy thinks, works and behaves is understanding
Japan's priorities. Americans assume that the economy takes primacy
in political decisions, unless national security is seriously
threatened. The Japanese _ and by no means the bureaucracy alone _
accord primacy to society.
</P>
<P>
   Again the United States is the exception and Japan more nearly
the rule. In most developed countries other than the United States,
the economy is considered a restraint on policies rather than their
major, let alone sole, determinant. Ideology and, above all, the
impact on society come first.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, the primacy of economics in public
life and policy is fairly recent, dating no further back than World
War II. Until then, the United States too tended to consider
society first. Despite the Great Depression, the New Deal put
social reform well ahead of economic recovery. America's voters
overwhelmingly approved.
</P>
<P>
   But while hardly uniquely Japanese, giving pride of place to
society is more important to the Japanese than to most other
developed countries, save perhaps France. To the outsider, Japan
appears to have extraordinary social strength and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   No other society in history has successfully met such extreme
challenges and dislocations. For example, as a result of the
180-degree turn forced on Japan by Commodore Perry's black ships in
the 1860s, the world's most isolated country, hermetically sealed
for more than two centuries, opened itself to modernity overnight
and became Westernized. Or, equally traumatic, after its defeat in
1945 Japan endured a radical social turnaround and the long years
of foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, however, see their society as fragile. They know
how close to collapse and civil war their country came both times.
Hence the extreme importance, for instance, of lifetime employment
as Japan's social glue.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Japanese society is hardy or delicate is beside the
point. What matters is that the Japanese take its primacy for
granted. If Americans understood this, especially in dealing with a
Japan in trouble, they might cling less to myths about the
uselessness of the Japanese bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the bureaucrats is still heresy, of course, but heresy
is often closer to the truth than conventional wisdom.

 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR 1: WHAT'S TRUE ABOUT JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Peter Drucker &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   American policy on Japan, especially during Asia's economic
crisis, is based on five assumptions that have become articles of
faith for most American policymakers, Japan scholars and even a
good many business executives.
</P>
<P>
   But all of them are either plain wrong or, at best, highly
dubious:
</P>
<P>
   1. The government bureaucracy's dominance is assumed to be
unique to Japan, like its near-monopoly on policymaking and its
control of business and the economy through ``administrative
guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Reducing the bureaucracy's role to what it should be _ ``the
experts on tap but not on top'' _ would not be that difficult. All
that is needed is political will.
</P>
<P>
   3. A ruling elite like the Japanese bureaucracy is both
unnecessary in a modern developed society and undesirable in a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Japanese bureaucracy's resistance to ``deregulation,''
especially now in the financial sector, is nothing but a selfish
clinging to power that will do severe damage. By delaying the
inevitable, it can only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   5. Finally, the Japanese _ they are intelligent people, after
all _ put the economy first, as we do.
</P>
<P>
   The right assumptions about Japan, however, are:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bureaucracies dominate almost all developed countries. The
United States and a few less populous English-speaking countries
such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada are the exceptions rather
than the rule. Indeed, the Japanese bureaucracy is a good deal less
overbearing than that of some other developed countries,
particularly France.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bureaucratic elites have far greater staying power than we
are willing to concede. They manage to keep power for decades
despite scandals and proven incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   3. This is because developed countries _ with the sole exception
of the United States _ are convinced that they need a ruling elite,
without which they fear social disintegration. As such, they cling
to the old elite unless there is a universally accepted
replacement, and no such replacement is in sight in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   4. Their experience has proven to the Japanese that
procrastination works. Twice during the last 40 years, Japan has
overcome major and apparently insoluble social problems not by
``solving'' them but by delaying until, in the end, the problems
evaporated. The procrastination strategy will probably fail this
time, considering the shaky structure and solvency of Japan's
financial system. Given Japan's earlier experiences, however,
procrastination is not an irrational strategy.
</P>
<P>
   5. In fact, it is the logical strategy since for the Japanese
policymaker _ whether politician, civil servant or leading business
executive _ society comes first, not the economy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR 2: IS `DESCENT FROM HEAVEN' STRICTLY JAPANESE? &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Drucker &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Descent from heaven'' _ the Japanese term for the practice
whereby senior civil servants, having reached their terminal
government position around age 45 to 55, become ``counselors'' to
big companies _ is seen in the United States as uniquely Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is considered the most visible manifestation of the
dominance, power and privilege of the Japanese bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is actually a universal custom in all developed
countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To use a personal example, my father was the civil service head
of the Austrian Ministry of Commerce just after World War I. When
he retired in 1923, not yet 50, he was promptly appointed chairman
and CEO of a big bank, as were his predecessor and his successor.
So were their counterparts in the Ministry of Finance. Senior
Austrian civil servants in key ministries ``descend from heaven''
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese counselors who descend from heaven are well paid, but
the job is a sinecure. They are usually not even expected to show
up at the company's office except to collect their paychecks once a
month. By contrast, in most European countries these ``retiring''
civil servants move into real jobs, as did the Austrian civil
servants who became bank CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is wise or foolish is beside the point. Such
practices are universal.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany the second-tier civil servant who will not make it
into a top position in a ministry becomes secretary-general of an
industry association, a job that not only pays well but has real
power. Membership in such associations is compulsory in Germany,
and all but the very largest companies must conduct their relations
with both government and labor unions through them. If the civil
servant is a Social Democrat he gets a similar job _ equally well
paid and powerful _ as chief economist or secretary-general of a
labor union.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the civil servant who has reached the exalted
position of inspecteur de finance, usually around age 40 or 45,
moves into a top position in industry or finance. Almost every
power position in the French economy and society is filled by a
former inspecteur de finance. Even in the United Kingdom, it
remains customary for the top civil servant in a major ministry to
chair a big bank or insurance company after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States too ``descending from heaven'' is anything
but unknown. Scores of generals and admirals have, upon retirement,
taken senior executive positions in defense and aerospace
companies.
</P>
<P>
   An even larger number of congressional staffers and political
appointees in the upper and middle levels of executive agencies _
together, Washington's ruling elite _ routinely come from on high
to become well-paid lobbyists or partners in Washington law firms.

were by far the heaviest lenders, as they have also been to China.
</P>
<P>
   Japan faces the largest financial crisis of any developed
country since World War II. According to an estimate last May in
Business Week, the Japanese banking system will eventually have to
write off domestic losses of about $1 trillion, not including
losses on loans and investment elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This sum handily tops even the highest estimate of the losses
incurred in the U.S. savings and loan debacle 15 years ago, and
this in an economy barely half the size of America's. It amounts to
a stunning 12 percent or so of the funds of all Japanese financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious _ and much harder to handle _ are the banking
crisis' social threats. The entire Japanese financial system is
already being radically downsized. Japan is grossly overbanked, not
so much in the number of institutions as in the number of bank
branches, which are both ubiquitous and heavily overstaffed.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and American financial experts estimate that Japan's
commercial banks employ three to five times as many people per
thousand transactions as do American or European banks. This has
made the banking system one of Japan's largest employers, as well
as its highest-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the redundant though well-paid employees are middle-age
people with limited skills who would find it hard to get other jobs
if laid off. Unemployment in Japan has already risen to the highest
levels in 40 years _ above 4 percent by the official count. If
Japan used American or European definitions of unemployment, it
would be 7 or 8 percent. Only two years ago the official
unemployment rate was still below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even graver than the threat of unemployment is the threat to the
country's social contract, especially the job security of lifetime
employment. If the banks laid off large numbers of people, the
social contract would shatter. The seriousness with which the
Japanese view the social aspects of the crisis is shown by the
lengths to which they will go to preserve a few jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They took the virtually unthinkable step of allowing (indeed,
probably inviting) an American financial firm, Merrill Lynch, to
take over the main branches of Yamaichi, Japan's fourth-largest
brokerage house, when it failed in 1997 simply because Merrill
Lynch promised to keep on about a sixth of Yamaichi's employees _ a
few thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   Only six weeks earlier senior officials in the Ministry of
Finance, which oversees brokerage firms, had still loudly insisted
that they would never let a foreigner do domestic Japanese
securities business.
</P>
<P>
   The bank crisis undermines the structure of Japanese business
and society. It may dissolve Japan's most distinctive economic
organization: the ``keiretsu,'' the cluster of businesses around a
major bank. Contrary to common belief in the West, the keiretsu
does not primarily serve business purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Its first function is to act as the real board of directors for
the member companies, since the official board of each individual
company is just an internal management committee. The keiretsu
quietly removes incompetent top management and checks out proposed
promotions into the top echelons of member companies.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, the keiretsu is a mutual support association. The
members of a component company collectively hold enough of each
other's shares to give the keiretsu effective ownership control. It
thus protects each member against outsiders and hostile takeover
bids.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is the ultimate guarantor of lifetime employment.
If a keiretsu member gets into such serious trouble that it has to
lay off people, the other keiretsu companies will provide jobs for
them. This lets the fellow keiretsu member cut costs and still
fulfill its commitment to permanent job security.
</P>
<P>
   Can the keiretsu survive the financial crisis? The banks at the
core of the typical keiretsu have begun to sell off their holdings
in the group in order to offset their losses. More keiretsu members
are, in turn, selling off their shares in other keiretsu members to
get cash to shore up their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   But, quite apart from the threat to lifetime employment and job
security, what will replace the keiretsu as the organizing
principle of the Japanese economy?
</P>
<P>
   There are no answers to these questions. Thus, the only rational
course for the Japanese bureaucracy may indeed be to have no
policy. That delay will whittle the banking problem down to a
manageable size is probably wishful thinking. But surely the West,
especially the United States, can only hope that the
procrastination strategy will work again.
</P>
<P>
   Social unrest in Japan would be a far more serious threat to
U.S. political, strategic and economic interests than anything that
U.S. businesses or the U.S. economy could possibly gain through the
actions, such as rapid deregulation of the financial sector, which
Washington is now pressing on Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most important key to understanding how the
Japanese bureaucracy thinks, works and behaves is understanding
Japan's priorities. Americans assume that the economy takes primacy
in political decisions, unless national security is seriously
threatened. The Japanese _ and by no means the bureaucracy alone _
accord primacy to society.
</P>
<P>
   Again the United States is the exception and Japan more nearly
the rule. In most developed countries other than the United States,
the economy is considered a restraint on policies rather than their
major, let alone sole, determinant. Ideology and, above all, the
impact on society come first.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, the primacy of economics in public
life and policy is fairly recent, dating no further back than World
War II. Until then, the United States too tended to consider
society first. Despite the Great Depression, the New Deal put
social reform well ahead of economic recovery. America's voters
overwhelmingly approved.
</P>
<P>
   But while hardly uniquely Japanese, giving pride of place to
society is more important to the Japanese than to most other
developed countries, save perhaps France. To the outsider, Japan
appears to have extraordinary social strength and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   No other society in history has successfully met such extreme
challenges and dislocations. For example, as a result of the
180-degree turn forced on Japan by Commodore Perry's black ships in
the 1860s, the world's most isolated country, hermetically sealed
for more than two centuries, opened itself to modernity overnight
and became Westernized. Or, equally traumatic, after its defeat in
1945 Japan endured a radical social turnaround and the long years
of foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, however, see their society as fragile. They know
how close to collapse and civil war their country came both times.
Hence the extreme importance, for instance, of lifetime employment
as Japan's social glue.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Japanese society is hardy or delicate is beside the
point. What matters is that the Japanese take its primacy for
granted. If Americans understood this, especially in dealing with a
Japan in trouble, they might cling less to myths about the
uselessness of the Japanese bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the bureaucrats is still heresy, of course, but heresy
is often closer to the truth than conventional wisdom.

 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR 1: WHAT'S TRUE ABOUT JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Peter Drucker &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   American policy on Japan, especially during Asia's economic
crisis, is based on five assumptions that have become articles of
faith for most American policymakers, Japan scholars and even a
good many business executives.
</P>
<P>
   But all of them are either plain wrong or, at best, highly
dubious:
</P>
<P>
   1. The government bureaucracy's dominance is assumed to be
unique to Japan, like its near-monopoly on policymaking and its
control of business and the economy through ``administrative
guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Reducing the bureaucracy's role to what it should be _ ``the
experts on tap but not on top'' _ would not be that difficult. All
that is needed is political will.
</P>
<P>
   3. A ruling elite like the Japanese bureaucracy is both
unnecessary in a modern developed society and undesirable in a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Japanese bureaucracy's resistance to ``deregulation,''
especially now in the financial sector, is nothing but a selfish
clinging to power that will do severe damage. By delaying the
inevitable, it can only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   5. Finally, the Japanese _ they are intelligent people, after
all _ put the economy first, as we do.
</P>
<P>
   The right assumptions about Japan, however, are:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bureaucracies dominate almost all developed countries. The
United States and a few less populous English-speaking countries
such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada are the exceptions rather
than the rule. Indeed, the Japanese bureaucracy is a good deal less
overbearing than that of some other developed countries,
particularly France.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bureaucratic elites have far greater staying power than we
are willing to concede. They manage to keep power for decades
despite scandals and proven incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   3. This is because developed countries _ with the sole exception
of the United States _ are convinced that they need a ruling elite,
without which they fear social disintegration. As such, they cling
to the old elite unless there is a universally accepted
replacement, and no such replacement is in sight in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   4. Their experience has proven to the Japanese that
procrastination works. Twice during the last 40 years, Japan has
overcome major and apparently insoluble social problems not by
``solving'' them but by delaying until, in the end, the problems
evaporated. The procrastination strategy will probably fail this
time, considering the shaky structure and solvency of Japan's
financial system. Given Japan's earlier experiences, however,
procrastination is not an irrational strategy.
</P>
<P>
   5. In fact, it is the logical strategy since for the Japanese
policymaker _ whether politician, civil servant or leading business
executive _ society comes first, not the economy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR 2: IS `DESCENT FROM HEAVEN' STRICTLY JAPANESE? &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Drucker &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Descent from heaven'' _ the Japanese term for the practice
whereby senior civil servants, having reached their terminal
government position around age 45 to 55, become ``counselors'' to
big companies _ is seen in the United States as uniquely Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is considered the most visible manifestation of the
dominance, power and privilege of the Japanese bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is actually a universal custom in all developed
countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To use a personal example, my father was the civil service head
of the Austrian Ministry of Commerce just after World War I. When
he retired in 1923, not yet 50, he was promptly appointed chairman
and CEO of a big bank, as were his predecessor and his successor.
So were their counterparts in the Ministry of Finance. Senior
Austrian civil servants in key ministries ``descend from heaven''
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese counselors who descend from heaven are well paid, but
the job is a sinecure. They are usually not even expected to show
up at the company's office except to collect their paychecks once a
month. By contrast, in most European countries these ``retiring''
civil servants move into real jobs, as did the Austrian civil
servants who became bank CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is wise or foolish is beside the point. Such
practices are universal.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany the second-tier civil servant who will not make it
into a top position in a ministry becomes secretary-general of an
industry association, a job that not only pays well but has real
power. Membership in such associations is compulsory in Germany,
and all but the very largest companies must conduct their relations
with both government and labor unions through them. If the civil
servant is a Social Democrat he gets a similar job _ equally well
paid and powerful _ as chief economist or secretary-general of a
labor union.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the civil servant who has reached the exalted
position of inspecteur de finance, usually around age 40 or 45,
moves into a top position in industry or finance. Almost every
power position in the French economy and society is filled by a
former inspecteur de finance. Even in the United Kingdom, it
remains customary for the top civil servant in a major ministry to
chair a big bank or insurance company after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States too ``descending from heaven'' is anything
but unknown. Scores of generals and admirals have, upon retirement,
taken senior executive positions in defense and aerospace
companies.
</P>
<P>
   An even larger number of congressional staffers and political
appointees in the upper and middle levels of executive agencies _
together, Washington's ruling elite _ routinely come from on high
to become well-paid lobbyists or partners in Washington law firms.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As the evidence has mounted against President Clinton, I
believed that he would resign in shame and in the best interests of
our country. But it is now obvious that Clinton will not
voluntarily resign.
 &HT;    Impeachment proceedings will drag on for months and preoccupy
our nation to the detriment of ourselves and the world.
 &HT;    Our attention should be focused on a global economy that is
crumbling and could melt down and on a number of unstable military
situations, from Korea to India to Pakistan to Kosovo. Aside from
the alarming international scene, domestic problems such as health
care, social security and education must be solved.
 &HT;    Our nation, which has been a source of stability and good
throughout the world, cannot be leaderless at such a crucial time _
and yet we are.
 &HT;    President Gerald Ford's recommendation that Clinton be publicly
rebuked in the well of the House of Representatives is not the
answer. It would only further diminish Clinton's effectiveness at a
time when we need a strong, respected president _ not a man whose
reputation has been totally destroyed by an embarrassing public
rebuke on the House floor.
 &HT;    By now, Clinton has been reduced to attending political
fund-raisers and making endless phone calls to friends seeking
their advice on his pitiful personal crisis.
 &HT;    More than 180 newspapers have called for Clinton to resign. Many
have editorialized that his inexcusable actions in the Oval Office
threaten to seriously erode the integrity of the nation and damage
the standards, morals and ethics of our young people.
 &HT;    History teaches us that for any free society to survive and
thrive it must rest on a strong moral and ethical base. The issue
is not, ``Did he lie under oath?'' The issue is, ``Did he lie?''
And the answer is yes.
 &HT;    Clinton has taught our children to lie. Clinton has taught our
nation that a man does not have to be faithful to his wife and
family and can repeatedly devastate them by his irresponsible
actions. Clinton has taught our students in high school and college
that anything goes in their sexual behavior.
 &HT;    No wonder at least seven Boy Scouts in Utah who won Eagle awards
for observing the oath of honor and duty to God, country and self _
the highest commendation boys age 11 to 17 can earn _ refused their
certificates with Clinton's signature as honorary president of the
Boy Scouts of America.
 &HT;    Our children learn the words of our first president, George
Washington, who said, ``I cannot tell a lie.'' Two hundred years
later we have a president, Bill Clinton, who cannot tell the truth.
 &HT;    Any person who observes Clinton's behavior _ ranging from
intelligent to clever to wildly reckless and juvenile _ can only
conclude that he is emotionally unstable. And he shows a complete
inability to learn from the ill-chosen experiences of his youth,
from promiscuity to ``experimentation'' with drugs to evading the
draft.
 &HT;    Again and again, as a married adult, he has taken advantage of
women _ whether it's Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky
or others whose names are not in the public record. He has earned
their disrespect and destroyed their lives. Any business executive,
high school principal or police chief who repeatedly lied and had
sex with an employee would be fired.
 &HT;    Why should we accept a lower standard from Clinton, who as
president is charged with life-and-death responsibilities?
 &HT;    Any member of the military who lies will be court-martialed,
without regard to whether he was under oath. Any military person
who is involved in sexual harassment or adultery will be
court-martialed.
 &HT;    Clinton, as commander in chief, surely must be held to these
same standards. He has the ability to order our precious sons and
daughters off to war to fight and die. Yet the motivation, wisdom
and rationality of his judgment are highly debatable in matters of
domestic and foreign policy.
 &HT;    Clinton has lied to the people he loves the most and he has
repeatedly devastated them _ his immediate family and closest
colleagues and friends _ and yet the pattern persists. He is
willing to inflict serious long-term damage on the Democratic
Party, our nation and millions of people throughout the world just
to stay in power.
 &HT;    As a young man campaigning for Congress in Arkansas in 1974,
Clinton repeatedly included references to President Richard Nixon's
predicament. ``I think it's plain that (Nixon) should resign and
spare the country the agony of this impeachment and removal
proceeding,'' Clinton said, according to the Arkansas Democrat on
Aug. 6, 1974. ``There's not any point now in (Nixon) putting the
country through an impeachment since he isn't making any pretense
of innocence now,'' Clinton said, according to the Little Rock
Gazette on Aug. 8, 1974.
 &HT;    After making these demands on Nixon, why doesn't Clinton hold
himself to the same standard of accountability and resign?
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't understand duty, honor, country or faith,
courage, service or truth _ and honor beyond all. He certainly does
not understand the Navy's ethic: ``When principle is involved, be
deaf to expediency.''
 &HT;    We cannot take the privileges and freedom we have in this great
nation for granted. We, the people, must be the guardians at the
gate.

<P>
   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   These expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most
significant achievement to date is the Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification
by the legislatures of 34 nations, will end the competitively
damaging isolation of the United States, which banned bribing
foreign public officials in 1977. Bribery scandals in half a dozen
countries led the United States to pass the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in hopes that other countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the act was derided as misguided American moralism, and
foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial
orders. Many countries, including Germany and France, even allowed
their deduction as business expenses. The United States also
promoted a U.N. treaty to ban bribery, but that effort fizzled. The
developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity
to bash multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic
of human behavior that, in any event, was not of debilitating
proportions in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly widespread in the Third World, endemic
corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such
as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery charges also caused the resignation of NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,
and of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was
fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption.
In China, a member of the Politburo resigned in a massive
corruption scandal. The foregoing, while far from complete,
demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence
of several political and economic pressures. The post-Cold War era
has brought an opening up of governmental processes, freer news
coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is harder to hide, as the wave of bribery scandals
involving high-level officials in Europe, Asia and South America
demonstrates. On the economic front, impediments to investment and
other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in
Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe. With the growth of the global
economy, international business leaders are increasingly
recognizing that common, morally defensible rules are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, people have recognized that corruption is a
major obstacle to democratic transitions, market economies and
development. Citizens are using protests, elections and agencies of
civil society to press for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Bank and other international financing
agencies paid little heed to corruption, apparently considering it
a political matter outside their purview. At the bank, this
attitude began to change with the appointment of James Wolfensohn
as president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at that year's annual meeting included the first
reference to corruption in a presidential address. At the 1996
meeting, Wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority. He
invited Transparency International _ an anticorruption organization
that in five years has established chapters in more than 70
countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country
by country _ to help develop the bank's anticorruption strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the bank adopted a comprehensive program, including
strong controls to prevent bribery on World Bank-financed projects
and assistance to governments to promote reforms. Similar changes
are taking place at other international financing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and
fiscal policy, is emphasizing the need for transparency and other
steps to curb corruption. The Inter-American, European and Asian
Development Banks are following the World Bank's lead in adopting
stricter controls over projects they finance. And the Global
Coalition for Africa has made combating corruption its most
important priority for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption was adopted in
March 1996. It has been signed by 26 countries, but ratified by
only 10. Momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to
create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled. Congressional renewal
of the fast-track authority needed by the executive branch to
negotiate trade treaties could reignite interest.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment by the Organization of American States of a body
similar to the OECD's Anti-Bribery Working Group to provide
professional support and monitor progress by Western hemisphere
governments would also be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is playing an
important role in encouraging the global business community to
become active in fighting corruption. The chamber's focus is on
improving corporate self-regulation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ``Rules of Conduct to Combat Extortion and Bribery,''
prepared by a group of lawyers, managers, and scholars from over a
dozen countries, were issued in 1996. The rules deal forthrightly
with such issues as payments to sales agents and other
intermediaries, business entertainment and gifts, and political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They cover not only bribery of public officials but bribery
within the private sector as well. The chamber is preparing a
manual to assist companies in complying with the rules and with the
OECD principles.
</P>
<P>
   This, along with greater use of corporate rules of conduct, will
reduce the supply side of international corruption. The demand side
_ extortion and other forms of corruption by public officials _ is
more difficult to target effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Every country has laws prohibiting its officials from taking
bribes, but such laws are unlikely to be enforced when top
officials are corrupt. The World Bank, IMF, Transparency
International and others are working on programs to promote greater
transparency in government operations and other measures to combat
demand-side abuses.
</P>
<P>
   By curbing foreign bribery, industrialized countries will
increase the credibility in the developing world of their proposals
for combating demand-side corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The developments of the last five years, although remarkable,
are only the start of a long, difficult effort. Although there is
widespread support for action against corruption, entrenched groups
oppose reforms. Corruption has powerful beneficiaries: officials in
high places, companies with large resources and a legion of
influential middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever corruption has become a way of life, wholesale change
is necessary. Tossing out a few rotten apples will not be enough.
During the last five years, the argument that the costs of
corruption are intolerable has been winning. The biggest challenge
for the next five years is to assure continued public support by
showing tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors contribute to the pressure for accountability in
the post-Cold War world: the spread of investigative journalism,
opposition parties anxious to expose corrupt ruling parties, more
independent prosecutors and judges, whistle-blower protection, the
growth of the corporate governance movement and the expansion of
the global economy with increased demand for international
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   These developments bolster the movement to curb corruption and
enhance the prospects for achieving lasting reforms.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For all its nuclear peril, the Cold War was in some ways a
reassuring time. The enemy was clear, and so were America's
choices, or at least it often seemed.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Congress can be forgiven for reverting to its Cold
War reflexes when confronted with a sudden series of proliferation
issues last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, India exploded several nuclear devices, becoming the
first nation in three decades to declare itself a new member of the
nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later came the shocking allegation that two U.S.
satellite companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, had violated U.S. export restrictions by helping
Beijing to improve its missile guidance systems _ and, presumably,
the aim of a handful of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles
targeted at U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Then on May 28, Pakistan set off its own nuclear tests, an event
unconnected to the China controversy but one that seemed,
nonetheless, to be insidiously linked. Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, after all, made a point of thanking the Chinese for
their technical help on the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a world long decompressed from the Cold War seemed to
be back on the brink. Only this time, Dr. Strangelove had a Chinese
face. On May 20, the House voted overwhelmingly to ban the sale and
launching of U.S. satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pakistani tests, Congress also approved a $2.5 million
investigation of all technology transfers to China. America's
national security, declared some politicians, was being sacrificed
at the altar of commerce. Both Republicans and Democrats accused
the Clinton administration of carelessly liberalizing high-tech
trade with China _ encouraged, perhaps, by $1 million campaign
donations from the likes of Loral chief Bernard L. Schwartz _ and
engaging Beijing with a stream of deals that were helping to
transform what is still a large developing nation into a
21st-century superpower.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyhow, was the perception. Despite the amicable
Clinton-Jiang summit in late June, it is a perception that has
endured. But the truth is that such thinking is a dangerous
anachronism. Demonizing China, a nation clearly in transition, may
prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, unnecessarily fostering
Cold War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Congress' reaction is a technological
throwback. Its worst mistake is not in misunderstanding China, but
in failing to comprehend the transformation going on before its own
eyes in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that national security and commercial interests trade
off _ that every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a
profit but lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to
a time when CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet
technology, and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in
top-secret grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed
exclusively for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to
America's Cold War allies.
</P>
<P>
   Today the situation could not be more different. Quietly,
without most Americans noticing, a revolution has turned the U.S.
defense industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is custom-made for the Pentagon. So reduced is its
procurement budget _ at about $50 billion, it is now about
one-third what it was at the start of the decade _ that few defense
contractors could survive without a heavy diet of commercial and
overseas contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, by necessity, the defense industry has grown
civilianized. Now much of the best defense technology _ such as
naval propulsion, electronics and command-and-control
telecommunications _ is coming from the commercial sector. Dual use
has become the rule and not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>

   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate
into a lost defense edge for the Pentagon down the line _
especially since military and civilian satellite technology is so
similar. The message is plain: To react to the putative threat from
China by banning satellite sales to that country is to cut off
Uncle Sam's nose to spite his face.
</P>
<P>
   There are side benefits to America's commercial dominance as
well: U.S. intelligence, for instance, is helped far more if the
Chinese military uses U.S. commercial satellites than it would be
if China developed its own hard-wired, secure military alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Today the line dividing military technologies from civilian ones
is constantly receding. One by one, commercial uses are being found
for formerly military technologies. Night vision goggles are
important military equipment, covered as munitions by the State
Department, but they are also available in the L.L. Bean catalog.
Global positioning satellites, once intended for guiding ballistic
missiles, today are within reach of every backpacker and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider chips hardened to withstand radiation. Once devised
because the U.S. military wanted to protect its satellites from
attack, today there is a civilian clamor for them. Fearing cyclical
spikes in solar activity, companies hope to use them to preempt
pager blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the West should just drop efforts
at export control. Nor is there question of the potential
seriousness of the allegation against Loral and Hughes. If it is
true that these two satellite companies evaded the required State
Department approval before passing on missile-guidance information
to China, that would be an indisputable violation of U.S. export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to remember that for now the allegation
remains a singular one, hardly something that would justify banning
all satellite exports to China. Contrary to reports, the Pentagon
is sharply divided over whether national security was harmed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that America's export control policy can no longer be
to close down its borders. In an era of open technology transfer,
the centerpiece of any viable strategy must be to keep one's
industries running faster than the next economy's.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should be twofold: to promote U.S. commercial
leadership in dual-use technologies, and to maintain tough but
reasonable export monitoring that will slow _ even if it does not
stop _ the acquisition of those technologies by potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security will be assured as long as the
Chinese (or, through them, the Iranians or Pakistanis) are always
lagging a few product cycles behind. But that is about all that can
be done.

<P>
   Virtually all feminists who study international politics seek
the laudable goal of greater female participation in all aspects of
foreign relations, from executive mansions and foreign ministries
to militaries and universities.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree as to whether women should get ahead in politics
by demonstrating traditional masculine virtues of toughness,
aggression, competitiveness and the willingness to use force when
necessary _ or whether they should move the agenda of politics away
from male preoccupations with hierarchy and domination.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence was demonstrated in the feminist reaction to
Margaret Thatcher, who by any account was far tougher and more
determined than any of the male politicians she came up against.
Thatcher's conservative politics did not endear her to most
feminists, who much prefer a Mary Robinson or Gro Harlem Brundtland
as their model of a female leader, despite _ or because of _ the
fact that Thatcher had beaten men at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent findings and research in genetics and new
biology, it would seem that there is something to the contention of
many feminists that phenomena such as aggression, violence, war and
intense competition for dominance in a status hierarchy are more
closely associated with men than women.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of international relations that see global politics as
a remorseless struggle for power are in fact what feminists call a
gendered perspective, describing the behavior of states controlled
by men. A world run by women would follow different rules, it would
appear, and it is toward that sort of world that all postindustrial
or Western societies are moving. As women gain power in these
countries, the latter should become less aggressive, adventurous,
competitive and violent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the feminist view is that it sees these
attitudes toward violence, power and status as wholly the products
of a patriarchal culture, whereas in fact it appears they are
rooted in biology. This makes these attitudes harder to change in
men and consequently in societies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of women, men will continue to play a major, if
not dominant, part in the governance of postindustrial countries,
not to mention less-developed ones. The realms of war and
international politics in particular will remain controlled by men
for longer than many feminists would like.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the task of resocializing men to be more like
women _ that is, less violent _ will run into limits. What is bred
in the bone cannot be altered easily by changes in culture and
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   While some gender roles are indeed socially constructed,
virtually all reputable evolutionary biologists today think there
are profound differences between the sexes that are genetically
rather than culturally rooted, and that these differences extend
beyond the body into the realm of the mind. In no area is
sex-related difference clearer than with respect to violence and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the feminist agenda for international politics seems
fundamentally correct: The violent and aggressive tendencies of men
have to be controlled, not simply by redirecting them to external
aggression but by constraining those impulses through a web of
norms, laws, agreements, contracts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more women need to be brought into the domain of
international politics as leaders, officials, soldiers and voters.
Only by participating fully in global politics can women both
defend their own interests and shift the underlying male agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The feminization of world politics has, of course, been taking
place gradually over the past hundred years, with very positive
effects. Women have won the right to vote and participate in
politics in all developed countries, as well as in many developing
countries, and have exercised that right with increasing energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and other rich countries, a pronounced
gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national security
issues endures. American women have always been less supportive
than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including World War
II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War, by an average margin
of 7 percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They are also consistently less supportive of defense spending
and the use of force abroad. In a 1995 Roper survey conducted for
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, men favored U.S.
intervention in Korea in the event of a North Korean attack by a
margin of 49 percent to 40 percent, while women were opposed by a
margin of 30 percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. military action against Iraq in the event it
invaded Saudi Arabia was supported by men by a margin of 62 percent
to 31 percent and opposed by women by 43 percent to 45 percent.
While 54 percent of men felt it important to maintain superior
worldwide military power, only 45 percent of women agreed. Women,
moreover, are less likely than men to see force as a legitimate
tool for resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how to account for this gender gap.
Observers have suggested various reasons why women are less willing
to use military force than men, including their role as mothers,
the fact that many women are feminists (that is, committed to a
left-of-center agenda that is generally hostile to U.S.
intervention), and partisan affiliation (more women vote Democratic
than men).
</P>
<P>
   It is unnecessary to know the reason for the correlation between
gender and antimilitarism, however, to predict that increasing
female political participation will probably make the United States
and other democracies less inclined to use power around the world
as freely as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Will this shift toward a less status- and
military-power-oriented world be a good thing? For relations
between states in the so-called democratic zone of peace, the
answer is yes. Consideration of gender adds a great deal to the
vigorous and interesting debate over the correlation between
democracy and peace that has taken place in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The ``democratic peace'' argument, which underlies the foreign
policy of the Clinton administration as well as its predecessors,
is that democracies tend not to fight one another. While the
empirical claim has been contested, the correlation between the
degree of consolidation of liberal democratic institutions and
interdemocratic peace would seem to be one of the few nontrivial
generalizations one can make about world politics.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic peace theorists have been less persuasive about the
reasons democracies are pacific toward one another. The reasons
usually cited _ the rule of law, respect for individual rights, the
commercial nature of most democracies and the like _ are
undoubtedly correct.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another factor that has generally not been taken
into account. Developed democracies also tend to be more feminized
than authoritarian states, in terms of expansion of female
franchise and participation in political decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   It should therefore surprise no one that the historically
unprecedented shift in the sexual basis of politics should lead to
a change in international relations.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if gender roles are not simply socially
constructed but rooted in genetics, there will be limits to how
much international politics can change. In anything but a totally
feminized world, feminized policies could be a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminists talk as if gender identities can be discarded
like an old sweater, perhaps by putting young men through mandatory
gender-studies courses when they are college freshmen. Male
attitudes on a host of issues, from child-rearing and housework to
``getting in touch with your feelings,'' have changed dramatically
in the past couple of generations because of social pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But socialization can accomplish only so much, and efforts to
fully feminize young men will probably be no more successful than
the Soviet Union's efforts to persuade its people to work on
Saturdays on behalf of the heroic Cuban and Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
   Male tendencies to band together for competitive purposes, seek
to dominate status hierarchies, and act out aggressive fantasies
toward one another can be rechanneled but never eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we can assume peaceful relations between democracies,
the broader world scene will still be populated by states led by
the occasional Mobutu, Milosevic or Saddam. Even if the democratic,
feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a zone of peace
where struggles are more economic than military, it will still have
to deal with those parts of the world run by young, ambitious,
unconstrained men.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On Oct. 7 millions of people demonstrated in the streets of
Russian cities. Their protest was responsible, their behavior
moderate, with no sign of extremism.
 &HT;    The demonstrators' main demand was for the resignation of
President Yeltsin and early elections of both the president and the
State Duma. It was a clear verdict on the political regime and the
kind of ``shock'' reforms that the country has had to endure for
the past seven years.
 &HT;    Russia is at a dangerous threshold. The clock shows five minutes
to midnight.
 &HT;    Yet, observers noted, the government of Yevgeny Primakov was
spared the demonstrators' criticism. Primakov, his first deputy
Yuri Maslyukov and the new Central Bank president Viktor
Gerashchenko had not been eager for jobs in the Russian cabinet. In
fact, they took some time before deciding to come on board. That
they finally agreed to carry this burden in the present dire
circumstances is a credit to them. These people are capable of
giving priority to the national interests rather than the narrow
interest of those who have become fabulously and unjustifiably rich
during the years of pseudo-reforms.
 &HT;    The new government, however, has already come under criticism
from extreme free-marketeers in Russia and in the West. Primakov is
being accused of dragging his feet and of lacking a clear economic
program. There is concern that the team may backtrack from market
economics. Much is being made of their past, such as the fact that
Maslyukov was chairman of Gosplan, the Soviet Union's central
planning agency.
 &HT;    I must disagree with this rush to judgment. I know these men,
their views and their character. During the years of perestroika
they were firmly in favor of reforms.
 &HT;    In spring 1990, Maslyukov was ready to resign from Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's government, accusing him of stalling on
much-needed change. Other members of the new cabinet have also
shown on many occasions their commitment to socially responsible
market economics and democracy.
 &HT;    It would certainly be too soon to demand that they produce an
elaborate, detailed program or far-reaching decisions on how to
advance reforms at the very moment they have to focus on how to
stabilize the overall situation and avoid total disaster. This
might require measures, some of which could resemble a return to
command economics. But don't rush to label the new government
``anti-reform.''
 &HT;    The steps that may be needed to take the situation in hand do
not mean that reforms are being abandoned. They are the price that
must be paid for the misguided policies of the recent past. If
chaos became total, any reforms would have to be written off and we
would see a very different government, an economic dictatorship.
 &HT;    During the time needed to put the real economy _ the production
of goods and services _ back on track, we shall need aid and loans.
Even more than aid, we shall need direct investment and cooperation
projects. After what happened here, creditors and investors are
understandably doubtful about dealing with Russia. I feel, however,
that Primakov and Gerashchenko will be able to persuade the world
that they are serious people and responsible partners.
 &HT;    So both the West and our own economic radicals would do well not
to push the new team. Do not scare people with the prospect of a
``return to communism.'' Russia has made an irrevocable choice.
Even the communists, the lunatic fringe excepted, are saying that
the clock cannot be turned back. So let us not panic; let us work
with quiet determination.
 &HT;    I am afraid, though, that the government could be dealt a blow
from an unexpected quarter, and where it is least protected. I am
afraid the president might try to meddle in the government's work.
Even worse, he could reshuffle it before it had a chance to make a
difference. I have reason to believe that Yeltsin's entourage is
already intriguing to make this happen.
 &HT;    The president should be reminded that such things have always
turned out badly, for himself as well as for the country. It would
be best for all of us if the president gave the Primakov government
a carte blanche _ and then called for early elections of president
and parliament.
 &HT;    Concerns about the results of early elections are, I believe,
exaggerated. The Russians will not support extremists or
irresponsible populists. Today, much more than before, there is a
good chance for the emergence of a coalition of moderate, centrist
forces capable of winning a majority in the Duma and fielding a
strong candidate for president. Tomorrow, that chance could
disappear.
 &HT;    Who that candidate would be depends in large part on the
``content'' of the presidency. I believe that the constitution
should be amended in order to allocate more power to the parliament
and the cabinet.
 &HT;    With a more reasonable balance of government powers, the
president would no longer be a monarch in democratic clothing, nor
would he be able to usurp power and paralyze the federal
government, as Yeltsin was able to do.
 &HT;    The president would become a true guardian of the constitution
and of the people's rights and freedoms _ the nation's moral and
political leader. Primakov could turn out to be just the right man
for this role.
 &HT;    The Cabinet of Ministers would then become the main body of the
executive branch of government. And, although the mayor of Moscow,
Yuri Luzhkov, has already declared his readiness to run for
president, I think that he is better suited for the role of prime
minister.
 &HT;    I urge our Western partners to analyze the political realignment
now under way in Russia without prejudging it and with a
willingness to help Russia. Objectively, Russia may now have a
chance to begin recovering, and gradually reemerge as a serious and
dependable international player.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On Oct. 7 millions of people demonstrated in the streets of
Russian cities. Their protest was responsible, their behavior
moderate, with no sign of extremism.
 &HT;    The demonstrators' main demand was for the resignation of
President Yeltsin and early elections of both the president and the
State Duma. It was a clear verdict on the political regime and the
kind of ``shock'' reforms that the country has had to endure for
the past seven years.
 &HT;    Russia is at a dangerous threshold. The clock shows five minutes
to midnight.
 &HT;    Yet, observers noted, the government of Yevgeny Primakov was
spared the demonstrators' criticism. Primakov, his first deputy
Yuri Maslyukov and the new Central Bank president Viktor
Gerashchenko had not been eager for jobs in the Russian cabinet. In
fact, they took some time before deciding to come on board. That
they finally agreed to carry this burden in the present dire
circumstances is a credit to them. These people are capable of
giving priority to the national interests rather than the narrow
interest of those who have become fabulously and unjustifiably rich
during the years of pseudo-reforms.
 &HT;    The new government, however, has already come under criticism
from extreme free-marketeers in Russia and in the West. Primakov is
being accused of dragging his feet and of lacking a clear economic
program. There is concern that the team may backtrack from market
economics. Much is being made of their past, such as the fact that
Maslyukov was chairman of Gosplan, the Soviet Union's central
planning agency.
 &HT;    I must disagree with this rush to judgment. I know these men,
their views and their character. During the years of perestroika
they were firmly in favor of reforms.
 &HT;    In spring 1990, Maslyukov was ready to resign from Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's government, accusing him of stalling on
much-needed change. Other members of the new cabinet have also
shown on many occasions their commitment to socially responsible
market economics and democracy.
 &HT;    It would certainly be too soon to demand that they produce an
elaborate, detailed program or far-reaching decisions on how to
advance reforms at the very moment they have to focus on how to
stabilize the overall situation and avoid total disaster. This
might require measures, some of which could resemble a return to
command economics. But don't rush to label the new government
``anti-reform.''
 &HT;    The steps that may be needed to take the situation in hand do
not mean that reforms are being abandoned. They are the price that
must be paid for the misguided policies of the recent past. If
chaos became total, any reforms would have to be written off and we
would see a very different government, an economic dictatorship.
 &HT;    During the time needed to put the real economy _ the production
of goods and services _ back on track, we shall need aid and loans.
Even more than aid, we shall need direct investment and cooperation
projects. After what happened here, creditors and investors are
understandably doubtful about dealing with Russia. I feel, however,
that Primakov and Gerashchenko will be able to persuade the world
that they are serious people and responsible partners.
 &HT;    So both the West and our own economic radicals would do well not
to push the new team. Do not scare people with the prospect of a
``return to communism.'' Russia has made an irrevocable choice.
Even the communists, the lunatic fringe excepted, are saying that
the clock cannot be turned back. So let us not panic; let us work
with quiet determination.
 &HT;    I am afraid, though, that the government could be dealt a blow
from an unexpected quarter, and where it is least protected. I am
afraid the president might try to meddle in the government's work.
Even worse, he could reshuffle it before it had a chance to make a
difference. I have reason to believe that Yeltsin's entourage is
already intriguing to make this happen.
 &HT;    The president should be reminded that such things have always
turned out badly, for himself as well as for the country. It would
be best for all of us if the president gave the Primakov government
a carte blanche _ and then called for early elections of president

irresponsible populists. Today, much more than before, there is a

   Will `Fast Eddie' face the music?
</P>
<P>
   By Anne Rochell
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The buzz around Louisiana these days sounds a lot
like the buzz in Washington. People are saying, ``This time, maybe
they've finally got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who earned his nickname ``Fast
Eddie'' the same way President Clinton earned the nickname ``Slick
Willie'' _ by escaping scandals that would have destroyed lesser
politicians _ could see his good luck run dry this week.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year federal investigation that involved wiretapping,
searches and seizures of large amounts of cash from Edwards' home
and office, as well as hundreds of hours of secret grand jury
testimony, is coming to a close. And the noose could be tightening
around the neck of the once-invincible, always colorful four-time
governor. He could be indicted this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two former Edwards associates accepted plea bargains
and agreed to testify against the former governor and his son,
Stephen Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Edward DeBartolo Jr., owner of the San Francisco 49ers,
testified that Edwin and Stephen Edwards pressured him to pay them
$400,000 and monthly fees to influence the state's gaming board to
grant DeBartolo a license for a riverboat casino in Shreveport. He
pleaded guilty to concealing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Ricky Shetler, a gambling consultant and a
childhood friend of Stephen Edwards, pleaded guilty to giving the
Edwardses $550,000 in payoffs, some allegedly during Edwards' final
term as governor. According to prosecutors, the money was part of a
scheme to extort from the Players Casino in Lake Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, Dempsey White, who served as chief highway
engineer in Edwards' administration, was charged with conspiring
with the Edwardses to wiretap the homes of two FBI agents involved
in the case. His lawyer said Wednesday that White has agreed to
testify against Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Edwards told reporters that he was entrapped by a
friend of White's who was a wiretapping expert and FBI informant.
Edwards said he did pay the man $4,000, but he said the money was
not to spy on the FBI but rather to obtain FBI tapes the man said
he had of Edwards. Edwards claims he only wanted to know if the FBI
was taping him illegally, without a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the government is building its case a lot
stronger than they have in the last trials,'' said John Maginnis,
publisher of the Louisiana Political Fax Weekly. Edwards was
indicted twice in the 1980s _ and he walked away both times.
``We've never heard Edwards wiretapped before. This will be
something new for the public and for a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 71, has denied all charges.
</P>
<P>
   After DeBartolo's appearance in a Baton Rouge court last week,
Edwards stood on the courthouse steps, cracking jokes and poking
fun. He called DeBartolo the ``new Linda Tripp,'' referring to the
former friend of Monica Lewinsky who turned over tapes of
conversations with her to federal prosecutors in the Clinton
scandal
</P>
<P>
   ``That performance at the courthouse is just a preview of what
will be the show of a lifetime should he get indicted and go to
trial,'' Maginnis said
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' attorney, Mike Fawer, said DeBartolo's plea is
meaningless because he has changed his story since he received a
letter last year saying he was a target in the investigation of the
Edwardses. Those discrepencies will be obvious if Edwards is
indicted and DeBartolo has to testify in court, Fawer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that before last week, he never suggested he
was victimized by Edwards,'' he said. ``He negotiated an agreement
with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   What's so unusual about an agreement between a client and an
attorney?''
</P>
<P>
   Much like Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, U.S. Attorney Eddie
Jordan and his team of more than 100 FBI agents have been
criticized for spending time and money on what until last week
seemed like a wild goose chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man has been through hell twice now, and they couldn't
convict him,'' said Jim Monaghan, owner of Molly's on the Market, a
hangout for journalists and politicians, including Edwards. ``This
investigation is cruel and unfair punishment, just like Starr's is
for the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Monaghan said talk at the bar included speculation that Edwards
himself might cop a plea to get the whole thing over with. But all
indications from Edwards and his attorney point to him going to
trial if he is indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the possibility of Edwards having to go to trial again
makes for good theater, the more troubling issue is the black eye
the scandal gives to the state's Gaming Control Board. The board
was created by Gov. Mike Foster to imbue Louisiana's casino
industry with a level of integrity it seemed to be lacking under
Edwards. But it was the board, under Foster, that awarded DeBartolo
the state's 15th and final gaming license. The U.S. Attorney's
Office, it is now clear, is accusing Edwards of influencing the
board to grant that license.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a shadow cast on the Gaming Control Board,''
Maginnis said. ``Even on the day they awarded that contract, they
made a speech about how there would be no outside influences on
them. Now, the idea that the politicians may have been influencing
even one board member _ maybe two, maybe more _ it makes you wonder
about some of their other decisions.'' To many here, it is hard to
believe Edwards could be convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards always thumbed his nose at propriety and the law and was
applauded for it. He rode in a horse and buggy to his 1985
racketeering trial to illustrate the slow wheels of justice. He
celebrated his fourth election victory _ won in large part because
people were voting against his opponent, former Ku Klux Klansman
David Duke _ in a Las Vegas casino, where his earnings reportedly
exceeded $40,000. A popular bumper sticker at the time was ``Vote
for the crook: It's important.''
</P>
<P>
   He boasted of his sexual prowess and flagrantly cheated on his
wife of 40 years. After divorcing her in 1989, he met Candy Picou,
a student more than 30 years his junior. They are now married.
</P>
<P>
   To give the public a hint of just how strong a case there is
against Edwards, the U.S. Attorney's Office has made public
tantalizing tidbits of the thousands of hours of tapes they
secretly made of Edwards on the phone and of him talking to his son
in the law office they share in Baton Rouge. The excerpts are
peppered with coarse language and contain what sounds like damning
evidence of schemes to extort money and influence government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's developments, a lot of Louisianans are
beginning to think that Edwards won't be able to escape punishment
this time. A cartoon in the New Orleans Times-Picayune last week
pictured Edwards in bed with his wife and her saying, ``Why didn't
you just have an affair with an intern?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is guilty or not, the idea of Edwards not skating out
of his latest troubles makes some people a little wistful for the
good old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is convicted, it will feel like the end of an era,''
Monaghan said.

   &UR; By JEFFREY GOLDBERG &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; FROM: The New York Times Magazine &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic located in a disagreeable
spot just south of Russia and just north of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   It is known for nothing except oil, and the smell of that oil is
inescapable, even inside the cabin of an arthritic helicopter
desperately trying to gain altitude for a trip across the Caspian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter, a rusting Soviet Mi-8, seems unable to move
forward, which is problematic, because we are already hovering 25
feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Our destination, an offshore pumping complex known as Oily
Rocks, sits 15 miles away. Azerbaijan Airlines inherited the
helicopter from Aeroflot but did not, apparently, inherit spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
   One of these helicopters recently crashed into an oil platform,
initially prompting the president of Azerbaijan's state oil company
to turn down my request for a lift. ``It would be very embarrassing
if foreigners were killed on the way to Oily Rocks,'' Natig Aliev
told me.
</P>
<P>
   But I told Aliev I couldn't leave Azerbaijan without seeing Oily
Rocks, one of the world's largest offshore oil complexes, a place
that would certainly rank as Azerbaijan's greatest tourist
attraction if Azerbaijan had tourists. And so the accommodating
Aliev lifted the ban, for an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After hanging in the air for two minutes, the pilot sets the
helicopter back down. Big yellow rings of sweat stain his shirt. He
tosses off the last man to climb aboard, and returns to his seat.
This time we're off, a single 150-pound oil worker making all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   As we gain altitude, the Apsheron Peninsula spreads out before
us. The ground below is brown and cracked dry in the heat. Crippled
oil pumps dot the landscape all the way back to the capital city,
Baku, which is built on vast reservoirs of oil and gas and is
crowded with ornate buildings that date back to the first great oil
rush here, more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   We fly out over the pale blue Caspian, which is spidered with
mean black slicks of oil. Which makes me think of ... caviar. Just
how safe can Caspian beluga be, if the sturgeon swim in light
crude?
</P>
<P>
   And then, there it is: Oily Rocks, a Stalinist fabulation of
broken-down oil platforms and causeways that stretch past the
horizon. Crosshatched streets, 125 miles of them, rest on pylons
sunk into the seabed.
</P>
<P>
   We touch down on a weedy landing pad and are met by a school bus
that will carry us down the causeways that link one platform to
another. The state oil company has sent a senior executive, Baba
Musayev, to be my official minder. He is a man of about 50,
rough-hewed, with rotting teeth and arms tanned the color of plums.
There is no place like Oily Rocks in the entire world, he says, and
this is true: In the West, oil platforms are built freestanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the Soviet Union,'' Musayev says, ``steel was cheap and
there was a lot of it, so the Soviet mentality said that everything
should be linked by road.''
</P>
<P>
   Oily Rocks is crumbling. Truck-size chunks of it are falling
into the sea, and everything is orange with rust. One-third of the
600 wells are inoperative, and miles and miles of causeway have
broken apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian is rising, and water now laps the second stories of
many buildings, even those that house oil workers. These
eight-story apartment buildings are a remarkable sight. Only the
Soviet Union could build slum housing in the middle of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that we couldn't sustain this when the market
economy came along,'' Musayev tells me, curling his lip when he
says ``market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   We are eating lunch in the cafeteria, fresh greens, white cheese
and boiled chicken, served by dour, henna-haired women. A
photograph of Azerbaijan's president, Heydar Aliyev, watches us
from the wall. It is impossible to avoid Aliyev's image _ or his
influence _ anywhere in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capitalism is only interested in revenue, not in
engineering,'' Musayev continues. And yet he wants to join the
market economy he so distrusts. He has already applied for jobs
with four Western oil companies. He earns $80 a month, and knows
that even drivers for Amoco and Unocal make three or four times
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are already aboard Oily Rocks, in a limited way.
We drive past a yellow-painted facility that shines in the
hammering sun. It is a gas-compression facility just built by
Pennzoil. ``No smoking around here,'' Musayev says, tossing his
cigarette. ``American rules.''
</P>
<P>
   American rules may soon apply to all of Oily Rocks. The complex,
like everything in Azerbaijan, is for sale. The government is
looking for a partner, a Western oil company, that will modernize
this mess. It will surely find one, because Baku is overflowing
with oilmen. The city stands at the center of the first great oil
rush of the 21st century, an oil rush of great consequence for
Washington and Moscow, and for a dozen capitals in between.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who believe that history ended with the collapse of
communism should visit Baku, because in Baku, nothing is settled.
Who could predict the future of a country that many in Moscow _
volatile, feverish Moscow _ believe shouldn't be a country at all,
but instead a province of a reanimated Russian empire?
</P>
<P>
   In Teheran, Azerbaijan is seen as an unforgivable contradiction:
a secular Shiite state, a country ripe for Islamization. In 10
years' time, Azerbaijan could be an Islamic state, or a
neo-Communist state, or a capitalist democracy, or a capitalist
autocracy, or even part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan gained its freedom in 1991, but soon lost 15 percent
of its territory to Armenia, which humiliated it in a vicious war.
Azerbaijanis were killing each other too; the country seemed
ungovernable, a failed-state-in-the-making of warlords and
gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, Aliyev came back to Baku. He was the former
Communist Party boss of Azerbaijan who had gone into self-imposed
rural exile, but returned to Baku and exploited the chaos there.
His bloodless coup brought a temporary stability.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought with him an idea that ensured his country's
independence. There has always been oil in Azerbaijan. Centuries
ago, the Zoroastrians built their fire temples in the hills of
Baku, worshiping the flames that burst from the gas-filled earth.
More than 100 years ago, the Nobel brothers and the Rothschilds
built fortunes on Baku oil. Then the Soviets came, and closed off
Azerbaijan's oil reserves to the West.
</P>
<P>
   It took an ex-KGB general and former Politburo member to open
them up again. For Aliyev, oil wasn't only a commodity; it was
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil is our strategy, it is our defense, it is our
independence,'' Aliyev's foreign-policy adviser, Vafa Gulizade,
told me. ``Iran is dreaming dreams of Azerbaijan, and if the
Russians were strong, they would colonize Azerbaijan. But they
can't because Aliyev invited the whole world in to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, the world's major oil companies, with Aliyev's
encouragement, were busy developing Azerbaijan's neglected oil
wealth. Aliyev's theory was that flag follows trade, and the theory
is proving correct. Aliyev has become Washington's man, and
Azerbaijan's oil has become an issue of great strategic importance
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan sits atop as much as 20 billion barrels of oil, which
makes its reserves smaller than Kuwait's but about the same size as
Nigeria's, from which the United States imports nearly 5 percent of
its oil. Azerbaijan may also become the conduit for even more oil
and natural gas that will flow from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, on
the east side of the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Caspian region could be the source of as much as
200 billion barrels of oil. For America, the stakes are enormous.
</P>

   ``The Caspian region will hopefully save us from total
dependence on Middle East oil,'' says Bill Richardson, the
secretary of energy and the administration's point man on the
Caspian oil rush. For the oil companies, the opening of the Caspian
means access to tens of billions of dollars of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Western companies have signed oil contracts totaling
$40 billion in Azerbaijan. More than 1,000 American oilmen are
making Baku their base, part of an expatriate community numbering
at least 4,000. Profits at this early stage, though, are still
theoretical, and some companies are having a lousy time of it. A
consortium including Pennzoil, for instance, recently spent a great
deal of money drilling in the Caspian and came up with no oil.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev has ladled out much of his oil already, entering his
state company into 12 development projects with foreign oil
companies, but there is still plenty of oil left to be found. In
the race to capture it, the Americans hold the early lead, with the
British close behind and the French, Germans, Norwegians, Japanese
and Italians all trailing. Even the Russian oil company Lukoil has
a presence.
</P>
<P>
   Baku is a United Nations of oil, and the jockeying for the most
lucrative oil fields is intense. But no more intense than the
jockeying between Russia and America, which find themselves in a
subterranean and unacknowledged war for primacy in an especially
dangerous corner of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have difficulty convincing the Russians that we're not
trying to edge them out,'' Richardson says. ``They see the area as
their sovereign, virgin territory.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Americans might have difficulty convincing the
Russians that they're not being edged out is because they are being
edged out. Aliyev has already cut favorable deals with American oil
companies at the expense of Russian ones. Which is why the Russians
don't like it when the Americans start talking about pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The next best thing to controlling the source of the oil is
controlling its flow. Some of Azerbaijan's oil already flows north
to Russia through a small pipeline. Another small pipeline is being
built to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But an international consortium of oil companies is scheduled to
recommend a route for a main export pipeline in October that could
eventually move one million barrels of oil daily.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wants the pipeline to run through its territory but the
United States wants it to run west, through Georgia and into
Turkey, a NATO ally. Iran too would like to have a pipeline, but
that won't happen as long as the United States says it won't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for all this oil means that Baku is filled with
intrigue and the fear of instability. Last month, Aliyev's police
and opposition demonstrators fought street skirmishes in advance of
the mid-October national election.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev has been the object of three, or four, or five
assassination attempts in the last several years (his intelligence
chief counted six for me, though two sounded more like wishful
thinking than executable plots), and his ally to the west,
Georgia's Eduard Shevardnadze, is also a semiregular target of
assassins.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed throughout the Caucasus that the assassins are
dispatched by Russian nationalists who have not accepted the death
of their empire. Russia's current meltdown has only heightened the
fear in Baku and Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, that Russian
hard-liners will be trying even more enthusiastically to pull
Azerbaijan and Georgia back into Moscow's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Assassins are only occasional visitors to Baku, but the city is
rampant with ham-handed Russian spies, as well as Turkish
gangsters, Chechen revolutionaries, American diplomats, Iranian
terrorists and financial speculators of various nationalities,
drawn to Baku because it is a frontier of global capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Before I left for Baku, I was inundated with propaganda from the
oil companies and from Azerbaijan's lobbyists in Washington,
assuring me that Azerbaijan is a lighthouse of stability, a
pro-American redoubt and a place ready to do business in the
community of Western nations. Most of all, they said, it is a place
whose shining future, under the leadership of Aliyev, is assured.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that's true, Baku is a fine place to watch the
future of capitalism unfold. The Caspian oil rush is a reminder
that not all commerce in the future will be carried out
antiseptically over the Internet, that the ethereal talk of
globalization means little to men who have to drill for oil and
then physically move that oil across dangerous territory.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the old verities apply. At least in this corner of the
globe, 21st-century capitalism looks very much like 19th-century
capitalism. Baku is a city of the bribe and the shakedown, of
florid corruption and baroque greed.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of high-tech capitalism _ in this place America hopes
will help solve its Persian Gulf oil problem _ the fragility of the
oil business is apparent. Success depends on the cooperation, or at
least the acquiescence, of Russians and Chechens, Iranians and
Armenians, as well as the fortunes of Azerbaijani politics.
</P>
<P>
   The future may be not nearly as hopeful as Aliyev believes it
will be, and not nearly as secure as the oil companies _ and
Washington _ need it to be.

 By MARGARET TALBOT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In October the Library of Congress opens the doors of its Thomas
Jefferson Building for the largest exhibit ever assembled on the
life and work of Sigmund Freud.
 &HT;    If the Library's estimates are correct, by the time the show
closes on Jan. 16, more than a quarter million people will have
inspected Freud's handwritten case notes on immortal patients such
as the Rat Man, the famous letter to his friend Wilhelm Fliess in
which Freud renounces the so-called seduction theory and dozens of
other manuscripts and first editions from the library's vast
collection of Freudiana.
 &HT;    Visitors will see the actual chair Dr. Freud used in his
examining room, the actual kilim rug that draped the iconic couch,
his actual spectacles and a phalanx of the antiquities Freud
collected and arrayed with fetishistic precision on his desk.
 &HT;    What makes this exhibit remarkable, however, is not so much the
objects in it as the fact that it is happening at all. In the
jagged cardiogram that is the history of Freud's reputation, 1998
is not, after all, a peak. Managed care has been notoriously
inhospitable to long-term psychotherapy and notoriously hospitable
to the quicker, cheaper fixes of behavior mod and Prozac.
 &HT;    The steady drip-drip of Freud criticism over the past decade _
attacks on his personal character, his originality, his therapeutic
models and his scientific status _ has corroded the cultural
prestige psychoanalysis once enjoyed among American intellectuals.
 &HT;    Moreover, the Freud show could just as easily have been doomed
by the increasingly contentious politics of museum curatorship as
by the anti-Freudian zeitgeist _ and for a time it looked as if it
would be.
 &HT;    Museums _ especially history museums _ are now subject, in
unprecedented degree, to the scrutiny and pressure tactics of
interest groups, many of which insist on being heard at the
earliest planning stages of a show and, more and more successfully,
on getting their point of view incorporated into exhibits.
 &HT;    Witness the fate of the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian's
National Air and Space museum, drastically altered after veterans
complained that it portrayed the Japanese as victims and failed to
credit the bombing of Hiroshima with ending the war.
 &HT;    Or the exhibit of 19th- and 20th-century photographs called
``Back of the Big House: The Cultural Landscape of the
Plantation,'' scheduled by the Library of Congress to open two
years ago but canceled entirely after a group of African-American
library staff members complained that the images it contained _ of
slaves and slave quarters _ were offensive.
 &HT;    Or the recent Smithsonian exhibit on the history of sweatshops,
which drew indignant protests from clothing industry lobbyists.
They didn't like the fact that the mock-up of a sweatshop featured
in the show happened to be one that made not cigars or trinkets but
apparel. The dust-up over ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture''
came just after the Enola Gay and ``Big House'' protests, and
seemed to presage a similar end.
 &HT;    In the summer of 1995, about a year after the library appointed
a guest curator and scheduled the exhibit, an independent
researcher and irrepressible Freud skeptic named Peter Swales
rallied about 50 other scholars, most of whom had published work
critical of Freud, to sign a petition. The show's planning
committee, the petitioners complained, was stacked with
psychoanalytic apologists and its goal, as one of the signatories
put it in an interview, was simply ``to polish up the tarnished
image of a business'' _ psychoanalysis _ ``that's heading into
Chapter 11.''
 &HT;    The petition said nothing about canceling or even postponing the
exhibit. But in December of that year, when the library suddenly
announced that it was delaying the show indefinitely, the decision
was widely perceived as a capitulation to the petitioners and to
the threat of controversy. The library's own explanation _ that it
had run short of funds _ convinced virtually no one writing about
the story at the time.
 &HT;    ``Underlying the attempt to block the Freud exhibit was a
particularly dangerous notion: that an institution owned by the
government should avoid doing anything controversial,'' wrote the
New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis. In the pages of The New
Republic, the sociologist Todd Gitlin declared that, just as it had
in the case of the ``Back of the Big House'' show, the library had
``chosen suppression over exhibition, silencing over debate.''
 &HT;    It now looks as if the library did delay the exhibit primarily
for financial reasons _ it was $350,000 shy of the $900,000 budget
projected for the exhibit, and this was not the first or last time
that it had postponed shows for lack of funds.
 &HT;    Moreover, the Freud petitioners had not mobilized the support of
members of Congress, as the Enola Gay protesters had, nor did their
objections pivot on racial sensitivities, patriotism or the kind of
populist, defense-of-decency politics that drove the disputes over
art-museum shows _ such as the one devoted to Robert Mapplethorpe's
photographs. For these reasons, the library could afford not to
yield to them.
 &HT;    Oddly enough, it was the assumption that it was caving in to
pressure that allowed the library to raise the extra money it
needed for the show. Members of the American Psychoanalytic
Association organized a letter-writing campaign. Subsequently, the
Discovery Channel made a gift of $125,000 and the Jewish Museum in
New York signed on as a new venue to which the exhibit would
travel. A number of individuals made small, unsolicited donations,
often tucked into letters decrying Freud-bashing or censorship or
both.
 &HT;    And yet it will be difficult for anyone who sees ``Freud'' and
who remembers the squall over it to judge it without some of the
criteria of the anti-Freudians in mind. Welcome to the era of
preemptive-strike criticism.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when library officials chose the Freud show's
guest curator, they selected, rather cannily, a young cultural
historian named Michael S. Roth. Roth, who was then at the
Claremont Graduate School and is now at the Getty Research
Institute in Los Angeles, was only 38 at the time.
 &HT;    And despite the fact that he had written a book called
``Psycho-Analysis as History: Negation and Freedom in Freud,''
Freudian theory wasn't really his specialty or obsession _ he had
published just as much about Hegel. His intellectual preoccupation
is with memory (``how people make sense of the past and what
happens when they can't or won't,'' as he puts it), which might be
thought of as a Freudian theme, but which clearly isn't exclusively
one.
 &HT;    For a time it seemed that even the petitioners were willing to
see Roth as a well-meaning sort, at worst a dupe of the older and
more orthodox members of the show's planning committee _ the
historian Peter Gay and the analyst Harold Blum, for instance.
 &HT;    ``It seems so odd to talk of a significant cultural figure in
terms of he's great or he's bad,'' Roth told me in an interview one
rainy evening this past summer. ``Historians don't talk that way.
It's almost hubris to talk that way.''
 &HT;    Yet in the saga of this exhibit, there was Roth, with his wry,
agnostic, historian's turn of mind, called upon to negotiate with
Freud critics for whom there was really only one salient question:
Was Freud right? and one answer: No.
 &HT;    ``It was so strange. I was used to the atmosphere of a small
college,'' Roth said, shaking his head. ``And then this petition
came up and the postponing of the show and all the press coverage
of it, and suddenly friends were calling me from France saying, 'My
God, Michael, we hear you're being burned in effigy over there.'''
 &HT;    The Library of Congress owns the pre-eminent Freud collection in
the world, but much of the material in it had arrived with
restrictions imposed by the organization that had assembled it, the
Sigmund Freud Archives.
 &HT;    In recent years, however, the library had engineered a
compromise with the archives' director, Blum, to make some sealed
papers available if the names of patients were blacked out by
reviewers chosen by the archives. In the year 2000, almost all of
the previously restricted material was at last due to be opened
anyway.
 &HT;    The exhibit, then, was to be for the collection a sort of early
and symbolic ``coming-out party,'' as the Librarian of Congress,
James Billington, took to calling it.
 &HT;    Then Swales entered the picture. Among the loose assembly of
Freud skeptics, Swales is the anti-Freudians' anti-Freudian. This
is not only because of his research over the last 25 years,
revealing the true identities of several early patients of Freud's
who had been known only by their pseudonyms, but because of his
appetite for provocation.
 &HT;    Swales is 50 now but still something of an enfant terrible. He
grew up in rural Wales, ran away from high school and home at 17
and spent much of his early career toiling in the British pop
industry, mainly as a personal assistant to the Rolling Stones.
Freud studies was something Swales fell into in the early '70s,
while working in New York with Stonehill Publishing, which brought
out the first thorough study of Freud's early infatuation with
cocaine.
 &HT;    In the summer of 1995, when Swales began circulating a letter of
protest about the library's Freud exhibition, it didn't take him
long to collect nearly 50 names. Some of them were obvious choices
_ for example, Frederick Crews, the literary critic turned
Freud-loathing polemicist who holds Freud responsible for
everything from ``egocentric and prurient encouragement to look for
low motives in everyone'' to the excesses of the recovered-memory
movement.
 &HT;    Gloria Steinem, a Freud disser from way back, added a glint of
celebrity to the campaign. And some of the signatories were rather
surprising _ the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, for one, who
had never made common cause with the anti-Freudians. (Sacks later
distanced himself from the affair, telling Psychiatric News that
``No one who knows me could imagine me as an anti-Freudian.'')
 &HT;    Apart from its rather mild language, the letter made one odd
request _ namely, that a man named Henry Cohen, an attorney at the
Congressional Research Service who was friendly with some of the
petitioners, sit in on committee meetings ``to keep all of us
apprised of the deliberations and developments.''
 &HT;    Roth would not have it: ``I remember being really disturbed by
the idea that we would have this guy who was not a Freud scholar
and who happened to be a lawyer monitoring us,'' he says.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, in the fall of 1995, Roth made a number of
overtures to the petitioners. He felt they deserved a serious
response and he clearly hated the idea of being construed as a
propagandist.
 &HT;    In October, he sent the petitioners each a ``Dear Scholar''
letter in which he said that they had ``alerted me to the dangers
that the exhibit might unwittingly contain a partisan defense of
Freud, or that we might not have paid sufficient attention to the
recent historical and philosophical critiques of psychoanalysis.''
 &HT;    That fall (and indeed over the next two years), Roth grappled
with the question of how an exhibit whose fundamental purpose was
to showcase manuscripts in Freud's own hand and to explicate for
the widest possible audience the ideas they contained could, at the
same time, do justice to the contemporary critique of Freud.
 &HT;    ``Some people wanted an exhibit that said that Freud was wrong,
that he was a bad person, that, as one critic put it, we should
have the moral courage to condemn him,'' Roth says. ``Well, that's
just not what this particular show is about.''
 &HT;    It turns out that in the end, some of the critics are
represented in a series of quotes that wrap around the display
panels and amplify or refute the arguments of the manuscripts
below. They are a little too sound-bite-y, though, to convey much
sense of their authors' objections.
 &HT;    And they are surrounded by quotes from earlier critics _
Wittgenstein, Nabokov, Germaine Greer _ which tend to make the
contemporaries seem like merely the latest and tinniest voices in a
long and clamorous parade of Freud detractors. Freud has always
generated resentment, this cacophony of commentary seems to say,
and yet, look: He's still with us.
 &HT;    For a while, Roth wanted to end the show with a section called
``Contested Legacies,'' which would have highlighted the continuing
debate over Freudian theory. He liked the idea of introducing this
section with ``two very simple, direct questions about
psychoanalysis: Is it true? and Does it work?''
 &HT;    But the other advisers worried that they were in danger of
accentuating the conflict over Freud at the expense of what they
saw as their first duty: setting out his ideas. Besides, they
concluded, the average museumgoer might well be alienated by an
exhibit that seemed preoccupied with what was essentially a debate
among scholars.
 &HT;    Now what viewers will see near the end of the exhibit, bracketed
by photos of Nazi book-burnings and of Freud's four sisters who
perished in concentration camps, are the manuscripts of ``A Word
about Anti-Semitism,'' ``Why War?'' and ``Civilization and its
Discontents.''
 &HT;    It is curious that the Freud show protests _ and all the new
museum protests _ seem to share the notion, or fear, that every
museumgoer will interpret an exhibit in exactly the same way and
indeed, exactly as its planners intended.
 &HT;    ``The premise behind all these protests,'' says Steven Conn, a
museum historian at Ohio State University, ``is that all museum
exhibits come heavily laden with political and interpretive baggage
_ and there is only one way to read them. The audience is
essentially a passive receptacle.''
 &HT;    But why should that be so? ``No one thinks of texts that way
anymore,'' as Conn points out. ``No one would argue that there is
only one way to read 'Hamlet.'''
 &HT;    On the one hand, the interest groups that protest museum shows
take a skeptical, post-modern view of exhibits. They maintain that
neutrality and objectivity are flimsy veils for the inescapably
ideological agendas of curators. And on the other hand, they take a
rather old-fashioned, not to say condescending, view of the
audience for those exhibits: They will think what they are being
told what to think.
 &HT;    The question is: Why should the rest of us accept that premise?

 By SARAH KERR  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Barbara Kingsolver has been hospitable beyond the call of duty
ever since I accidentally arrived early at her house in Tucson and
surprised her padding barefoot in a sundress and sipping a beer.
 &HT;    She's been solicitous about jet lag. She has gone out into her
woolly desert garden, plucked giant cucumbers and bright purple
eggplants and cooked up a delicious meal.
 &HT;    But when I ask about her childhood, she says, ``I'm not crazy
about myself,'' and emits a low, edgy chuckle.
 &HT;    Kingsolver, you see, doesn't want to be just another
late-20th-century image for sale. She's no performer, and the
history of her psyche is not in the public domain.
 &HT;    When I suggest that Dickens, Twain and Wilde all happily
embraced fame, she counters: ``Well, they weren't raising kids. And
Oscar Wilde was never shoved onto the noontime news in Denver and a
mike clipped to his lapel and asked, 'In 58 seconds, because that's
what we have, what did you mean when you wrote ``The Importance of
Being Earnest?'' '
 &HT;    What she does want is to be an engaged writer, a responsible
citizen, a positive moral force. Her novels have always been
indirectly political.
 &HT;    ``The Bean Trees,'' ``Animal Dreams'' and ``Pigs in Heaven''
touched, respectively, on the Sanctuary movement to shelter Central
American refugees in Tucson; on idealistic young Americans who went
to work with the Sandinista government and on laws concerning the
adoption of Indian children. But her latest novel moves politics to
the front burner.
 &HT;    ``The Poisonwood Bible'' is set in the Congo in the late 1950s
and early 1960s, just as that republic is winning independence from
Belgium. The novel is Kingsolver's first in five years, and it is a
quantum-leap breakthrough.
 &HT;    Where her earlier books tended to be simple and sweet, the new
one is learned, tragicomic and sprawling. It is also more truly the
work of an activist _ critical, especially, of American involvement
in the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the
installation of the dictator Mobutu.
 &HT;    Not that the politics are always right there on the surface:
``If I were to write a nonfiction book about the brief blossoming
and destruction of the independence of the Congo, and what the CIA
had to do with it, then probably all 85 people who are interested
in the subject would read it. Instead I can write a novel that's
ostensibly about family and culture and an exotic locale. And it's
entertaining, I hope.''
 &HT;    It's not your typical literary chat, this frank admission by
Kingsolver that she deliberately set out to hook people with a good
story, then smuggled in a political lesson. But Kingsolver is
pretty much indifferent to your typical literary chat.
 &HT;    Shy she may be, but she's also an iconoclast. She believes that
much of America's literary elite (``the gatekeepers, the inner
circle,'' she calls them, almost certainly overestimating their
influence) is squeamish and snobby. She believes critics made a
fatal mistake in the 1950s by caving in to McCarthyism and allowing
a gulf to divide art from politics. With some justification, she
points to great writers from George Bernard Shaw to Solzhenitsyn
who weren't afraid to mix literature and advocacy.
 &HT;    And when Kingsolver believes something, she tends to act on it.
With the advance from ``The Poisonwood Bible'' (estimated at close
to $1 million), she is endowing a new literary prize, the
Bellwether, which will award $25,000 to the writer of an
unpublished novel that addresses issues of ``social change.''
 &HT;    The prize, which will be handed out in the spring (on May Day,
to be exact), is, for all its idealism, also stunningly pragmatic _
and this is key to understanding Kingsolver. The typical literary
award entails a backbreaking amount of slogging through
manuscripts, but Kingsolver streamlined the process by asking 25
literary agents to submit one entry each.
 &HT;    Another shrewd idea: She'll team up each year with a different
publisher, who will guarantee a minimum run of 10,000 copies. So
the Bellwether winner won't be just another ``worthy'' book; it
will be a worthy book with a publisher behind it.
 &HT;    ``As much as she wants to encourage younger writers, she wants
publishers scrambling to publish these books,'' Frances Goldin,
Kingsolver's longtime agent, says of her client's aspirations. In
short, Kingsolver wants to change the world _ her way. She wants to
bring politics back into literature. She wants progress, not a chic
cocktail-party discussion of progress.
 &HT;    But she's realistic about what she can do, and careful not to
overextend. Hers is a pared-down radicalism _ a radicalism of
lowered expectations, aware of its limits and selectively
strategic. Kingsolver may object to the commodification of American
life. But in her own way, she's as wily as an entrepreneur.
 &HT;    In private, she considers herself just an average ``working
mom.'' And indeed, dinner with Kingsolver and her husband, Steven
Hopp, an ornithologist, is the same stop-and-go chaos as dinner in
any household with a toddler.
 &HT;    Two-year-old Lily hasn't been fed since lunch and is gearing up
for a protest. Barbara and Steven desperately hunt for the special
``sippy cup'' she likes to drink from, but it's too late. Lily
frets. She starts to cry. And while Lily is unhappy, Kingsolver is
unable to focus on anything else.
 &HT;    In several essays, Kingsolver has agonized about what lessons to
teach her daughters. (Besides Lily, there is Camille, who is 11 and
the child of a previous marriage.) Kingsolver tells me she worries
constantly about her performance as a mother. In fact, she seems to
approach motherhood with such specific ideas _ frequent walks in
the woods to learn about nature; don't outlaw TV but set an example
by curling up on the couch with a good book _ that you wonder if
she is trying to replicate her experience as a little girl or make
up for shortcomings.
 &HT;    For instance: Camille has been allotted a space in the garden
behind the house, where she's expected to grow a crop. When Lily's
a little older, she'll get one too. This, it turns out, was exactly
the practice in a certain household in Carlisle, Ky., the backwater
``one valley away from Appalachia'' where Kingsolver grew up.
 &HT;    Kingsolver sounds nervous when talking about her parents, who
are still alive _ admiring but defensive. She tells me that her
father was a physician who could have made a pile of money
practicing in the city but stayed behind to deliver babies to women
in need; her mother was a homemaker with exceptional strength of
character.
 &HT;    She speaks with gratitude about the sense of responsibility they
instilled in her, the way they gently guided her toward an
appreciation of nature and books. But as soon as she can change the
subject, she does, moving toward some general statement about the
world.
 &HT;    ``My parents always gave me to know I could make a difference _
and I'd better make one.'' Pause, then the move-out: ``In some
sense, I realize it's a luxury to feel the way I do. I know there
are plenty of people who are completely overwhelmed just by
survival.''
 &HT;    It is impossible to know whether Kingsolver is (quite
understandably) trying to protect her parents' feelings or whether
her own feelings about her childhood are simply unresolved. What's
true is that in her fiction, the subject of parents is a loaded
one.
 &HT;    ``Animal Dreams'' told the story of a young woman who feels like
an outsider in her small home town and who struggles in a
relationship with her distant father _ like Kingsolver's own, a
physician.
 &HT;    The parental issue becomes even more awkward when you consider
``The Poisonwood Bible.'' The new novel is told in the voice of
five females _ the wife and four daughters of a Christian
missionary who moves his family to the Congo and sacrifices their
health and safety in order to further his arrogant dream of
``civilizing'' Africans.
 &HT;    The year 1963 happens to be the same one when the Kingsolver
family moved to the Congo. Kingsolver seems to have relatively
carefree memories of her time there _ a child's memories of
learning songs in a new language and playing in a strange, lush
forest.
 &HT;    ``The Congo sent an electric shock through my brain. It was so
interesting to live in a place with no electricity, no radio, no
running water, no plumbing. There were just worlds of people living
perfectly satisfying lives, without needing some of the stuff I'd
assumed was necessary. I looked around and thought: 'Wow! I don't
know the half of it.'''
 &HT;    Kingsolver is infuriated when readers and journalists ask her to
elaborate on the parallels between her novels and her life.
 &HT;    ``She gets very upset when she has to do interviews,'' Frances
Goldin says. ``She's fearful of saying something about her family
that will upset them. People are sometimes not sensitive. They're
going to ask her why her father went to Africa, but it's got
nothing to do with her family. They conclude it must be
autobiographical, and she can't get them off their insistence.''
Goldin sounds protective, and upset. ``She's the most polite person
I've ever met. She lives her life by her principles. She gives so
much back. So I hate to see her wounded.''
 &HT;    Still, the fact remains that the fraught theme of most of her
fiction is the same theme that comes up when she talks about her
childhood. Kingsolver assumes that people want to draw vulgar
diagrams of her work _ to find out what real person X and Y
represent.
 &HT;    But she may be underestimating readers who don't want to pry (or
vilify her parents, who sound as if they were extraordinarily
loving and conscientious) so much as they want to know more about
her experience of responsibility: its possibility for good, its
burdens, its danger when carried too far.
 &HT;    There's a palpable fragility about Kingsolver. A mistrust, even.
When we go to a friendly local restaurant, she requests a booth
seat, back against the wall, so as not to be exposed to the rest of
the room.
 &HT;    As we drive out of Tucson one afternoon, across a parched plain
studded with gnarly mesquite, she points out dozens of ostentatious
mansions that rich escapees from California are building high in
the hills. Why would anyone want to live there, she wonders,
exposed for all the world to see? Her own sleek, ecologically
responsible adobe ranch house is built into the side of a hill
outside of Tucson, screened by the trees from the scrutiny of
passers-by.
 &HT;    When she bought it three years ago, Kingsolver was daunted by
its magazine-ready glamour, so with her typical _ modesty?
practical-mindedness? guilt? _ she roughed it up a little to make
it more homey.
 &HT;    She gets much, much happier when the conversation moves from her
personal life to her political views. They seem quite deeply felt,
if occasionally dewy-eyed. She thinks the United States could learn
a thing or two from Denmark's generous social programs. She was
enraged this summer when America bombed the Sudan. She believes
that Mumia Abu Jamal, a former radio journalist and black activist
convicted of killing a policeman in Philadelphia, is being held as
a political prisoner.
 &HT;    (She sent Abu Jamal a draft of ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' and he
wrote back with extensive, helpful comments ``from the point of
view of an African-American,'' she tells me.)
 &HT;    Her capacity for outrage and hope makes me nostalgic for the
thrill I felt as a college freshman discovering the outside world _
and it turns out this is precisely the giddy age at which many of
Kingsolver's views took shape.
 &HT;    In the early 70's she entered DePauw University. She had zoomed
through high school, studying Kant and Hume for a correspondence
course in philosophy, but she had yet to learn the judgmental pop
language of American youth. The adjustment was painful. ``It was
very scary when I first got there, because there were all these
kids who looked alike and they had these clothes and these hairdos.
There was a veneer of knowing things before you know them that I
didn't have.''
 &HT;    She gradually lost her Southern accent because ``they'd hear me
say 'Hi' and they'd think how cute it was that I was wearing shoes
and it wasn't even Sunday.''
 &HT;    Soon she found a comfortable role as a campus activist, reading
``The Feminine Mystique'' (``a book that changed my life'') and
Karl Marx (``the scales fell from my eyes'') and joining sit-ins in
front of the ROTC building. This was the tail end of the Nixon era,
remember.
 &HT;    Before she went to DePauw, Kingsolver says all she knew about
Vietnam was that Kentucky boys were coming home in body bags.
``When I got to college, bang, I saw the rest of the story. Like
everything else in the world, it was rich people somehow protecting
their interests. And I got right out in the streets and protested
against that war. And the war ended, and I felt very empowered. I
felt like I had something to do with it. Whether or not I did is
not the point, you know. I felt like I did.''
 &HT;    I was struck by the thematic resemblance in ``Poisonwood'' to
two books that came out last spring: Jane Smiley's ``The All-True
Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton'' and Russell Banks'
``Cloudsplitter.'' All three novels revisit the actions of white
people living side by side with blacks at a critical period in
history. All three are long, dense and mournful over white
arrogance of the past.
 &HT;    I called Banks to see if he thought these novels constituted a
trend _ a mildly guilt-ridden white sequel to multiculturalism.
Call it the literature of re-examination, if you will.
 &HT;    ``It's inevitable as we come to the end of the century,'' he
answered. ``Fiction writers are going to reflect the culture's
desire to take its own measure. I look around, I see Don DeLillo
doing this, Thomas Pynchon, Jane Smiley. ... these are all books
that are kind of stepping back a little in time and distance to
re-examine what it is to be American. We sort of know what it means
to be on the left side of the hyphen: Italo-American,
Native-American, African-American _ but we don't know much about
what it means to be on the right side.
 &HT;    ``Part of it is the millennial swing, that sense of rhythm or
tide that pulls you. The other part of it is cultural history. When
Americans have been least sure of what it was to be American have
been periods when historical fiction has been most engaged.''
 &HT;    Banks raises an interesting point about uncertainty and the
cyclical nature of fiction. Kingsolver tells me, ``Everything I do,
from writing to raising my kids, is about preparing for the
future.''
 &HT;    Like many novelists right now, Kingsolver is preparing for that
future by atoning for the past. But one could argue, in a way, that
this retrospective mood actually confines her writing to the
present tense. Kingsolver has tended her career like a patient
gardener, weeding out nuisances and watching for predators, making
sure the seeds she's sowing take firm hold.
 &HT;    The question remains: Will the kind of political writing she
hopes to nurture flourish, and if so, for how long? Or does it
represent a corrective moment, a look back as the millennium
approaches _ an anxious pause while the world gets ready for
something new?

 By SARAH KERR  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Barbara Kingsolver has been hospitable beyond the call of duty
ever since I accidentally arrived early at her house in Tucson and
surprised her padding barefoot in a sundress and sipping a beer.
 &HT;    She's been solicitous about jet lag. She has gone out into her
woolly desert garden, plucked giant cucumbers and bright purple
eggplants and cooked up a delicious meal.
 &HT;    But when I ask about her childhood, she says, ``I'm not crazy
about myself,'' and emits a low, edgy chuckle.
 &HT;    Kingsolver, you see, doesn't want to be just another
late-20th-century image for sale. She's no performer, and the
history of her psyche is not in the public domain.
 &HT;    When I suggest that Dickens, Twain and Wilde all happily
embraced fame, she counters: ``Well, they weren't raising kids. And
Oscar Wilde was never shoved onto the noontime news in Denver and a
mike clipped to his lapel and asked, 'In 58 seconds, because that's
what we have, what did you mean when you wrote ``The Importance of
Being Earnest?'' '
 &HT;    What she does want is to be an engaged writer, a responsible
citizen, a positive moral force. Her novels have always been
indirectly political.
 &HT;    ``The Bean Trees,'' ``Animal Dreams'' and ``Pigs in Heaven''
touched, respectively, on the Sanctuary movement to shelter Central
American refugees in Tucson; on idealistic young Americans who went
to work with the Sandinista government and on laws concerning the
adoption of Indian children. But her latest novel moves politics to
the front burner.
 &HT;    ``The Poisonwood Bible'' is set in the Congo in the late 1950s
and early 1960s, just as that republic is winning independence from
Belgium. The novel is Kingsolver's first in five years, and it is a
quantum-leap breakthrough.
 &HT;    Where her earlier books tended to be simple and sweet, the new
one is learned, tragicomic and sprawling. It is also more truly the
work of an activist _ critical, especially, of American involvement
in the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the
installation of the dictator Mobutu.
 &HT;    Not that the politics are always right there on the surface:
``If I were to write a nonfiction book about the brief blossoming
and destruction of the independence of the Congo, and what the CIA
had to do with it, then probably all 85 people who are interested
in the subject would read it. Instead I can write a novel that's
ostensibly about family and culture and an exotic locale. And it's
entertaining, I hope.''
 &HT;    It's not your typical literary chat, this frank admission by
Kingsolver that she deliberately set out to hook people with a good
story, then smuggled in a political lesson. But Kingsolver is
pretty much indifferent to your typical literary chat.
 &HT;    Shy she may be, but she's also an iconoclast. She believes that
much of America's literary elite (``the gatekeepers, the inner
circle,'' she calls them, almost certainly overestimating their
influence) is squeamish and snobby. She believes critics made a
fatal mistake in the 1950s by caving in to McCarthyism and allowing
a gulf to divide art from politics. With some justification, she
points to great writers from George Bernard Shaw to Solzhenitsyn
who weren't afraid to mix literature and advocacy.
 &HT;    And when Kingsolver believes something, she tends to act on it.
With the advance from ``The Poisonwood Bible'' (estimated at close
to $1 million), she is endowing a new literary prize, the
Bellwether, which will award $25,000 to the writer of an
unpublished novel that addresses issues of ``social change.''
 &HT;    The prize, which will be handed out in the spring (on May Day,
to be exact), is, for all its idealism, also stunningly pragmatic _
and this is key to understanding Kingsolver. The typical literary
award entails a backbreaking amount of slogging through
manuscripts, but Kingsolver streamlined the process by asking 25
literary agents to submit one entry each.
 &HT;    Another shrewd idea: She'll team up each year with a different
publisher, who will guarantee a minimum run of 10,000 copies. So
the Bellwether winner won't be just another ``worthy'' book; it
will be a worthy book with a publisher behind it.
 &HT;    ``As much as she wants to encourage younger writers, she wants
publishers scrambling to publish these books,'' Frances Goldin,
Kingsolver's longtime agent, says of her client's aspirations. In
short, Kingsolver wants to change the world _ her way. She wants to
bring politics back into literature. She wants progress, not a chic
cocktail-party discussion of progress.
 &HT;    But she's realistic about what she can do, and careful not to
overextend. Hers is a pared-down radicalism _ a radicalism of
lowered expectations, aware of its limits and selectively
strategic. Kingsolver may object to the commodification of American
life. But in her own way, she's as wily as an entrepreneur.
 &HT;    In private, she considers herself just an average ``working
mom.'' And indeed, dinner with Kingsolver and her husband, Steven
Hopp, an ornithologist, is the same stop-and-go chaos as dinner in
any household with a toddler.
 &HT;    Two-year-old Lily hasn't been fed since lunch and is gearing up
for a protest. Barbara and Steven desperately hunt for the special
``sippy cup'' she likes to drink from, but it's too late. Lily
frets. She starts to cry. And while Lily is unhappy, Kingsolver is
unable to focus on anything else.
 &HT;    In several essays, Kingsolver has agonized about what lessons to
teach her daughters. (Besides Lily, there is Camille, who is 11 and
the child of a previous marriage.) Kingsolver tells me she worries
constantly about her performance as a mother. In fact, she seems to
approach motherhood with such specific ideas _ frequent walks in
the woods to learn about nature; don't outlaw TV but set an example
by curling up on the couch with a good book _ that you wonder if
she is trying to replicate her experience as a little girl or make
up for shortcomings.
 &HT;    For instance: Camille has been allotted a space in the garden
behind the house, where she's expected to grow a crop. When Lily's
a little older, she'll get one too. This, it turns out, was exactly
the practice in a certain household in Carlisle, Ky., the backwater
``one valley away from Appalachia'' where Kingsolver grew up.
 &HT;    Kingsolver sounds nervous when talking about her parents, who
are still alive _ admiring but defensive. She tells me that her
father was a physician who could have made a pile of money
practicing in the city but stayed behind to deliver babies to women
in need; her mother was a homemaker with exceptional strength of
character.
 &HT;    She speaks with gratitude about the sense of responsibility they
instilled in her, the way they gently guided her toward an
appreciation of nature and books. But as soon as she can change the
subject, she does, moving toward some general statement about the
world.
 &HT;    ``My parents always gave me to know I could make a difference _
and I'd better make one.'' Pause, then the move-out: ``In some
sense, I realize it's a luxury to feel the way I do. I know there
are plenty of people who are completely overwhelmed just by
survival.''
 &HT;    It is impossible to know whether Kingsolver is (quite
understandably) trying to protect her parents' feelings or whether
her own feelings about her childhood are simply unresolved. What's
true is that in her fiction, the subject of parents is a loaded
one.
 &HT;    ``Animal Dreams'' told the story of a young woman who feels like
an outsider in her small home town and who struggles in a
relationship with her distant father _ like Kingsolver's own, a
physician.
 &HT;    The parental issue becomes even more awkward when you consider
``The Poisonwood Bible.'' The new novel is told in the voice of
five females _ the wife and four daughters of a Christian
missionary who moves his family to the Congo and sacrifices their
health and safety in order to further his arrogant dream of
``civilizing'' Africans.

running water, no plumbing. There were just worlds of people living

`BELOVED' STAYS TRUE TO MORRISON'S NOVEL ABOUT FREED SLAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Faithful (to a fault) to Toni Morrison's 1987
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Jonathan Demme's shockingly vivid
``Beloved'' shows the devastating physical, emotional and spiritual
scars that slavery left upon newly freed African-American slaves
following the Civil War. The film is far from a historical epoch,
though; in fact, its claustrophobic tone hews closer to the
theatrical works of Ibsen, Chekov and Eugene O'Neill in the way it
intricately probes its characters' damaged psyches. This is a brave
film, accomplished in many aspects, flawed in others, a movie _
whether you like it or not _ that will stay with you long after the
house lights go up.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey easily sheds her icon status to play Sethe, a
middle-aged woman who lives with the all-too-vivid reminders of her
legacy as a slave. Sethe ran away from her Kentucky plantation in
1865 to escape the horrible cruelties inflicted by her owners. But
when we first see her, it's clear that the horror has followed her
to rural Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Sethe's home is haunted by the spirit of her daughter, who was
murdered when she was 2 years old. In scenes straight out of ``The
Exorcist,'' furniture moves violently across the room, plates crash
and the family dog flies along the walls with one eye bulging from
its socket. It's enough to prompt Sethe's two older sons to leave
the house for good and for her neighbors to shun the place
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Staying behind with Sethe is her other daughter, Denver
(Kimberly Elise), a sheltered, fragile young woman who is
understandably disturbed by her home, but, at the same time, afraid
to leave it and venture into the outside world. Sethe is determined
to keep her one remaining child from harm. ``I will never run from
another thing on this Earth,'' she says, even as her haunted home
violently shakes beneath her.
</P>
<P>
   It's an awful way to live, but then Sethe is a woman well beyond
harboring any hope for joy and pleasure from this life. However,
her attitude slowly begins to change when an old friend from
Kentucky, Paul D (Danny Glover), arrives. A kindhearted man who
shared the burden of slavery with Sethe on the planation, Paul D
has been wandering for years and sees an opportunity for stability
with Sethe and her daughter. He soon ingratiates his way into their
lives, and his affections are returned.
</P>
<P>
   The past, though, is never far away, and one day a feral,
teen-age woman who calls herself Beloved (Thandie Newton) turns up
on Sethe's doorstep, drooling, wheezing, croaking and covered with
flies and mud. The mysterious Beloved seems to cast a hypnotic
spell on everyone in the house. It's here that the film takes on an
even darker, more stifling tone as Paul D begins to suspect that
Beloved is the physical manifestation of the ghost of Sethe's
2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Demme, in his first film since 1993's ``Philadelphia,'' weaves
in flashbacks filmed in saturated color that gradually (and quite
painfully) explain Sethe's harrowing past. He has stamped
``Beloved'' with visceral flourishes, appropriate for the magic
realism that so heavily infuses Morrison's novel. The film brims
with insect sounds, images of nature and glimpses of the
supernatural resulting in a work that is as mysterious as its title
character. The disparate elements don't always coalesce, though,
and ``Beloved'' often feels like it's a movie in search of a genre.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Morrison will likely be pleased by Demme's slavish
attention to the novel. But he would have done well to pare some
scenes from the screenplay (adapted, at various times, by Akosua
Busia, Richard LaGravenese and Adam Brooks) because, at nearly
three hours, ``Beloved'' eventually slackens. And though the ending
honestly befits what preceded it, many viewers, having invested so
much time, will be disappointed by its low-key tone.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, from moment one, disappears into her role and allays
any concerns that her image would overwhelm her performance. It's
nice to see Glover again in a dramatic role and his mere presence
gives the story a light of hope and compassion. Newton is inspired
as the bedeviled Beloved; you won't see a braver performance all
year. And Elise convincingly shows Denver's slow transformation,
which serves as an example of the slow, painstaking process that
generations of African-Americans had to endure to erase the
shackles of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Beah Richards also shines as Sethe's mother-in-law, who preaches
that salvation is seeing yourself as you are and loving that
picture. Such a message was radical and nearly impossible to accept
for former slaves trying to experience a new life in the
Reconstruction era. Sadly, more than a century later, it hasn't
become that much easier for many people in America. That is one
reason the story of ``Beloved'' resonates so powerfully with so
many today.

`HAPPINESS' GOES HEAVY ON THE SEX, IRONY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the title of his movie ``Happiness'' on
through every frame of the film, writer-director Todd Solondz
strives so hard to create an atmosphere of irony it's almost
endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the last thing Solondz wants is to be endearing.
``Happiness'' is the celebrated/infamous comedy that won the
International Critics Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and was
abandoned by October Films, its initial American distributor, when
the supposedly independent releasing company was pressured by
corporate parents Seagram and Universal to drop the hot potato.
</P>
<P>
   If such cowardice isn't exactly laudible, it is understandable.
Solondz, who made the edgy, observant coming-of-age comedy
``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' has made a comedy of extreme
sexuality this time around. ``Happiness'' presents obscene phone
callers, elderly adulterers and even a pederast with some degree of
compassion, punctuated by enough bad sex and masturbation scenes to
make ``There's Something About Mary'' seem as innocent as
``Bambi.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though he's obviously out to shock, Solondz also wants
to appear sensitive, to make the pain of his dysfunctional
characters' missed connections and unsatisfying perversities
palpable. But more often than not, Solondz's irony overcomes his
empathy. Even when someone in the movie is at his or her most
vulnerable, the director's attitude toward them is at least as
snide as it is sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of this long film, one sister tells another, ``I
wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing with you,'' to which her
sibling replies, ``But I wasn't laughing.'' Whatever else you want
to say about ``Happiness,'' at least its maker is aware of his own
misanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the movie is at its best when it makes us
laugh and feel queasy about laughing at the same time. Things start
off on a hilariously overwrought note (a more deadpan approach
takes hold later), at a fancy New Jersey restaurant, where Jon
Lovitz's self-pitying loser cries, wheedles and upbraids his date,
a mousy woman named Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), for not feeling what
he wants her to.
</P>
<P>
   He is, we soon learn, the latest in a long line of Mr.
Not-Quite-Rights the 30-year-old bachelorette has let get away.
She's chirpfully, mercilessly reminded of this by her
self-satisfied sister Trish Maplewood (Cynthia Stevenson), snug and
smug in her two-story suburban home, with three kids and a
successful therapist husband, Bill (Dylan Baker).
</P>
<P>
   But Bill, we soon learn, has no amorous feelings for Trish
because he's more interested in the playmates of his pubescent,
sexually neurotic son Billy (Rufus Read). Father and son bond over
oddly explicit, birds-and-bees conversations. Thankfully, Dad's
escapades with Billy's sleep-over friends occur discreetly, but
nonetheless alarmingly, off screen.
</P>
<P>
   A third Jordan sister, Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), is a snooty,
successful pop poetry writer who gets her kicks with glamour boys
and lives next door to the compulsive, introverted Allen (``Boogie
Nights' '' Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a phone freak who confesses
his violent fantasies about Helen to his analyst _ who is none
other than her child-molesting brother-in-law. A third high-rise
resident, Kristina (``The Practice's'' Emmy-winning Camryn
Manheim), is after the otherwise-engaged Allen; we eventually learn
she has quite an intimate secret, too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a retirement village in Boca Raton, the Jordan
girls' parents (Louise Lasser and Ben Gazzara) are finally doing
something, sort of, about their long, loveless marriage. The
message, of course, is that age and experience don't yield any more
clues to where that elusive happiness lies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bleak and not entirely convincing landscape Solondz
creates. Unlike the sex-addled but fully emotional fools in
``Boogie Nights,'' the generally more intelligent ``Happiness''
crowd comes off, for the most part, as abstract, walking obsessions
more than real people with problems.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there's deft comic delivery on every actor's part,
and Adams, Baker and Stevenson succeed best at suggesting their
characters' extra dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, for all of his bad-boy effort to push the taboo
limit, Solondz reveals himself to be a puritan at heart. No urge
that's slaked in ``Happiness'' leads to, well, happiness; it just
triggers recrimination or self-loathing or a bitter lesson that
makes someone a better, more celibate person.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is as repulsed by sex in all of its permutations as
Solondz presumably expects people to be shocked by it. That might
not be precisely the tone he was going for with ``Happiness.'' But
you've got to admit, it's exquisitely ironic. &QL;

REFLECTION ON CORMAN'S B-MOVIES MISSES THE FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Working for Roger Corman's exploitation movie
operation made Odette Springer feel bad, so she decided to make a
documentary about it. The dreary result, ``Some Nudity Required,''
hits the expected feminist notes, reveals the almost-to-be-expected
repressed memories of child abuse and confirms that the guys who
make movies like ``Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers'' can be kind of
crude.
</P>
<P>
   Sleazy and degrading as the B-movie business often is, however,
Springer _ a classically trained composer who co-directed
``Nudity'' with documentary and episodic television director
Johanna Demetrakas _ makes the whole scene seem more demoralizing
than you suspect it actually is. Yes, these often straight-to-video
productions trade on cheap violence and sexuality, but they're
hardly worse than some better-made, soul-deadening Hollywood A
product.
</P>
<P>
   But while composing scores for the cheap, essentially worthless
productions, Springer realized that the guy who gave Francis
Coppola, Martin Scorsese and James Cameron their starts was really
only interested in making a quick buck. Springer's artistic
aspirations, along with her gender politics, were constantly
challenged by the parade of bimbos she encountered at the studio.
The actress' often enhanced physiques made her question her own
attractiveness, too.
</P>
<P>
   So why does she eventually find these awful movies strangely
fascinating?
</P>
<P>
   Springer is so involved with how all of this impacts her, we
never feel we're getting much real insight into these films' wider
cultural meaning. A couple of actresses, the optimistic Julie
Strain and the depressed Maria Ford, make their own, highly
subjective points, while directors like Jim Wynorski are
alternately accommodating and annoyed when badgered to defend
their, um, art.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who directs this stuff, Catherine Cyran, has the most
persuasive take on why, psychologically and socially, these films
have their audience. Corman, who reportedly hates the movie, barely
appears in it.
</P>
<P>
   The thing Springer misses here, of course, is that the real
selling point of exploitation films is their absurdity. There's no
fun allowed in ``Some Nudity Required''; considering the subject
matter, that's a creative miscalculation on a level with anything
you'll see in ``Sorority House Massacre II.''

`PRACTICAL MAGIC' HAS CHARMS, BUT IT ISN'T SPELLBINDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Practical Magic'' tells us that it's important
to accept who you are _ even if you're a witch.
</P>
<P>
   That's basically the goofball moral of this uneven mishmash of a
movie, a film that blends romance, rah-rah sisterhood, family drama
and outlandish supernatural effects into a bland, watered-down
concoction that rarely bubbles into anything appetizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' isn't totally without its charms. Nicole
Kidman and Sandra Bullock make for appealing witches and the film
has fun with some of its abracadabra. But bewitching it isn't;
bothering and bewildering it often is.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman and Bullock play sisters who are continuing their
family's hocus-pocus heritage. For more than 300 years, Owens women
have been casting spells in their quaint New England village, much
to the dismay of the local townsfolk. Only now, their neighbors
just shun them instead of taking them to the gallows. Still it
isn't much of an existence, and you wonder why they just don't move
to a place where they would blend in _ say, New Orleans maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem comes from a curse. Any man who loves an Owens
woman winds up six feet underground. Sally (Bullock) deals with
this by running from love. Gillian (Kidman) copes by using her
witchcraft to seduce an assortment of grungy losers who wouldn't
know true love unless it came from a syringe.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian eventually ends up in a rather abusive relationship and
the sisters have to dust off their dormant powers to cope with the
mess. This leads to more trouble (see what happens when you deny
who you are?) and takes the movie to its ridiculous final act,
which alternates between silly supernatural effects and soppy
romance. It's tough to decide which is more grating.
</P>
<P>
   Director Griffin Dunne and writers Robin Swicord, Akiva Goldsman
and Adam Brooks have some pretty good source material in Alice
Hoffman's novel, but they have blunted the book's edginess into a
feel-good froth. Dunne never settles on a tone, and the unsteady
mix of genres seem to come more from a demographic study taken at
Lilith Fair than any desire to make a good movie.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing are largely wasted as the
elder witches, as is Aidan Quinn as a law enforcement love
interest. And as engaging as Bullock is, it seems like we just saw
her give the same performance in ``Hope Floats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' isn't an awful movie. It has a few good
laughs, but largely wastes its resources. We're still waiting for a
good witch movie to cast its spell on us. This isn't it.

OPRAH'S OBSESSION  _  HOW HER `BELOVED' GOT TO THE SCREEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You'd think that people would have learned by now
that if you tell Oprah Winfrey she can't do something, she's just
going to try all the harder to make it happen. One of her most
telling character flaws, she says, is the way she relishes the
I-told-you-so moment. ``I can't resist,'' Winfrey says. ``I kind of
live for the times when I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those times, most famously, include: I told you I could get a
part in a Steven Spielberg movie (``The Color Purple''), I told you
a cookbook could sell millions of copies (``In the Kitchen With
Rosie''), I told you people will respond to television that's
sincere and dignified, and (this one is a recurring favorite) I
told you I could lose those 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey's biggest I-told-you-so might just be her current
passion, ``Beloved,'' the film adaptation of Toni Morrison's
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that Winfrey calls her ``greatest
achievement.'' Nobody, including Morrison herself, thought this
dense, surreal novel about the horrific emotional effects of
slavery ever could be translated from the page to the screen.
Nobody except Winfrey. And in the end, of course, hers was the only
opinion that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey read the book in fits and starts 11 years ago when it
was published. (She did not finish it in one sitting, as widely
reported. ``You try doing that and get back to me,'' she says,
laughing.) When Winfrey completed the novel, she called Morrison,
not to talk about making it into a movie, but so she could better
articulate her own feelings about the book when talking to viewers
on her then-fledgling talk show.
</P>
<P>
   But as she and Morrison talked and Winfrey confessed how she
identified with Sethe, the book's iron-willed former slave, the
idea to film ``Beloved'' began to take hold. Eventually, Winfrey
bought the rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said _ and this is kind of charming _ `I'm going in my
pocketbook and write a check,''' Morrison remembers. ``I wasn't
talking to a lawyer, but to another human being. It reminded me of
myself. A single black woman who said, `Well, I'm doing this. It's
going to be hard for me, but that's beside the point.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was a decade ago. And Winfrey was right. It was hard _ both
getting the movie made and playing a stoic character who represses
her emotions, a woman the film's director, Jonathan Demme, calls
the ``anti-Oprah,'' alluding to Winfrey's well-known capacity for
empathy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, winning the opportunity to portray Sethe was a victory
in and of itself for Winfrey. Many directors, including Peter Weir,
were interested in the film, but not necessarily with Winfrey in
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could understand that, especially because a lot of the years
I was shopping this around, I weighed 200 or more pounds,'' Winfrey
says. ``They couldn't see me playing the role. And I said, `I'll
lose the weight.' And they'd say, `Well, we can't make any
guarantees.' At one time, I really thought about giving it up
because so many people were telling me I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I thought that would be stupid because I had the
rights to the movie and had fought for so long to get it made. I
should at least be given the opportunity to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Demme, though skeptical, was willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had such admiration for Oprah for a long time,'' says the
director of ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and ``Philadelphia.'' ``I
had dinner at her house, and within half an hour of listening to
her express herself about her connection to the character of Sethe
and the immeasurable importance to her of the themes of the story,
I went from being a little skeptical that we would be able to
separate Oprah Winfrey from Sethe to thinking there's no one else
who can play this part.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that didn't mean there weren't problems. The period
setting _ post-Civil War, rural Ohio _ helped erase the image of
the modern-day talk-show icon. But Morrison, still protective of
her book, cautioned Demme that ``Oprah is emotional; Sethe is
not.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Winfrey a long time to be able to make that distinction.
Demme often had to admonish her during takes to stop sympathizing
with her character and maintain the appropriate impassiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do cry a lot,'' Winfrey admits. ``So, that was a difficulty
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before shooting a scene and often between takes, Winfrey would
go off in a corner and weep into a towel and empty herself of all
her sadness and then morph into Sethe, a former slave and mother
living in denial and haunted by her brutal past. Demme often would
put her through take after take after take, Winfrey crying after
each one and Demme diplomatically telling her, ``Very good,'' and
then, ``Let's try it again.'' Winfrey soon caught on to her
director's code language.
</P>
<P>
   ```Very good' really means `You suck,''' she says, laughing.
``It means, `You're going to be here for a while.' Now, if you get
an `amazing' or a `fantastic' from him, then you know you did OK.
Otherwise, I'd know I was feeling sympathy for Sethe when I
shouldn't have been.''
</P>
<P>
   And more than anything, Winfrey was committed to helping Demme
put Morrison's book on the screen without an inappropriate trace of
sentimentality or sloppy emotionalism. ``Beloved'' was always
intended to be a difficult movie to watch. The goal, Morrison says,
was not to simply show what slavery looked like, but what it felt
like as well.
</P>
<P>
   Says the author: ``They did something I thought they never
could: to make the film represent not the abstraction of slavery
but the individuals, the domestic qualities and consequences of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Record producer Quincy Jones put it a little more colorfully in
an interview with Vogue. ``People are expecting some PG (stuff),''
he said. ``Oprah went for the art, man.''
</P>
<P>
   And the process inspired her. In fact, as filming was winding
down last summer, Winfrey considered ending her talk show after her
contract expired in 2000 and concentrating instead on movies.
Looking back now, she says, she sees that she simply didn't want
the experience to end. She wanted it to go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was almost a postpartum feeling for Winfrey, who
has no children with her long-time companion Stedman Graham, but
certainly honed her motherly instincts while making ``Beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think mothers feel, `It's here; everybody's going to see it.
Feel happy, happy, happy,''' Winfrey says. ``And that's how I feel
for the movie. I can't wait for it to open, but there's a part of
me that feels, `It's over; it's ended.' But like my friends tell
me: You created the movie. You still have the movie. I have to
remind myself, `Oh yeah, that's right.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Winfrey still has her day job as well. She recently extended
her contract through the year 2002, saying that the more she
thought about her experience with ``Beloved,'' the more she felt it
had inspired her to continue the talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're blessed to get one movie like this in a lifetime,''
Winfrey says. ``And I absolutely feel that what I have to do in
television is just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like a revelation, coming out of this movie,''
Winfrey continues. ``I've decided I'm going to use television and
not have television use me. Because who am I kidding? It's not just
a show; it's like a whole big force field in people's homes every
day. And I'm aware of that and intend to use it with a greater
sense of meaning and intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know I'll get asked, `Who do you think you are, trying
to change people's lives?' I hear that all the time. But television
teaches people, whether or not it comes right out and says so. All
you have to do is watch all the shows where people beat each other
up. If a child watches a show where somebody picks up a chair and
throws it because they don't like what was said, that teaches that
there's no such thing as conflict resolution. It teaches: If
someone says something you don't like, slap 'em silly. That's
really what they're saying and what our children are learning.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Winfrey plans to continue popular segments like the Book
Club and the recently added ``Remembering Your Spirit,'' which aims
to soothe viewers' souls. Last year, she launched the Angel
Network, an attempt to encourage her audience to donate time to
community programs.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the talk show, Winfrey continues to take the high
road as well. Winfrey's production company, Harpo films, is in the
middle of a six-picture deal with ABC to produce TV movies, all of
which are based on books that inspired her. The first, ``Before
Women Had Wings,'' told the story of a young girl who was
physically abused by her alcoholic mother. It was one of last
year's highest-rated television movies. Winfrey herself was raped
at age 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a vehicle to provide information for people to
pick and choose and allow themselves to make decisions to improve
their lives,'' Winfrey says. ``Because I think _ and this is just
what I think; if you don't think it, you don't have to watch,
really _ that given the choice, people choose to be better. They
will choose happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her future in the movies, Winfrey isn't ruling anything
out. She's more secure about her abilities than before making
``Beloved'' but says, ``If I wait another 10 years, I'll be
insecure again.'' Demme, for one, would love to work with her
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said to her several times that I want her to do an
incredibly up-to-the-minute, tough, tough comedy,'' he says. ``I
want to see Oprah being just funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Oprah ... just being funny? Winfrey says she would love to try
it. Now all she needs is somebody to tell her she can't. After the
triumph of ``Beloved,'' she might be hard-pressed to find any
takers.

MORISSETTE PUTS PALLADIUM AUDIENCE IN HER POCKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We shoulda known.
</P>
<P>
   The anxious crowd let out a roar when the lights came down and
Morissette's newly expanded band opened with an Eastern-style
rhythm, the perfect foil for the headliner's wide, distinctive
vocal range.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be home,'' Morissette said after the second song,
later adding she was having ``flashbacks to that Dragonfly show I
did a few years ago,'' referring to the local rock dive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most memorable new songs, mostly co-written with
Morissette's co-producer, Glen Ballard, were set-opener ``Baba''; a
powerful ``Are You Still Mad,'' which kept the audience rapt; and
``Uninvited,'' from the ``City of Angels'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The crafty new single ``Thank U,'' already a radio staple, left
the crowd cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette's band, expanded with the addition of keyboardist
Deron Johnson, also boasted a new second guitarist. But the
always-reliable Nick Lashley anchored the proceedings with lashings
of sturdy rhythm and lead guitar work.
</P>
<P>
   The drummer, too, was worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette has retooled some of her best-known material,
including the petulant breakup breakthrough hit ``You Oughta Know''
and the title track of her multimillion-selling Maverick debut.
</P>
<P>
   The new disc, ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,'' is due
Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the spindly Morissette still seems somewhat awkward,
saying little between songs and making strange, jerky movements.
But it's clear that performance and composing act as some type of
therapy for her, with her primary goal being emotional honesty.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the freewheeling singer has such a vast, apparently
loyal audience that touches on nearly all demographic groups. A
song such as ``Hand in My Pocket,'' for example, can be equally
understood by a 4-year-old listening to Radio Disney and a boomer
tuned into KBIG-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Forthcoming tracks such as ``Baba'' and ``Are You Still Mad''
show the onetime child TV star has grown musically in the past two
years, during which she collaborated with Ballard at his Woodland
Hills home.
</P>
<P>
   On first listen, some of the songs have unusual structures with
subtle shifts in mood and tempo. They also have powerful dynamics
that keep the listener interested. Can't wait to hear the entire
album.
</P>
<P>
   The impression above all Wednesday was the strength of
Morissette's piercing delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Infatuation Junkie'' comes out,'' you'll know it, too.

KO K OMO   DID SOUL, R&AMP;B RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ Kokomo.
</P>
<P>
   To many, it's simply the name of a half-forgotten Beach Boys
single from 1988. To others, it's a small city in central Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also one of the greatest '70s soul revues you've
never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Kokomo had two strikes against it right off the
bat. The musicians, a mix of seasoned session players and
newcomers, were white and British _ although they didn't sound like
it.
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to 1982, when this supremely talented band cut three
excellent yet hard-to-find platters for Columbia and toured the
States opening for Average White Band, there just wasn't a huge
demand for danceable funk and r&AMP;b, especially if the group on stage
wasn't Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire, Kool &AMP; the Gang or Tower of Power.
</P>
<P>
   But Kokomo had something special, including a tight, imaginative
rhythm section, several first-rate soloists, world-class vocalists
and an intuitive feel for fun and syncopation that extended to the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Others felt the same way. Pink Floyd's manager, Steve O'Rourke,
took the group under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member Kokomo boasted sophisticated originals like the
gorgeous r&AMP;b ballad ``Anytime,'' penned by guitarist Neil Hubbard,
who would play on a series of well-known records including the Roxy
Music classic ``Avalon'' and several Bryan Ferry solo albums side
by side with his longtime partner in funky rhythm, Kokomo
bassist-leader Alan Spenner.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the band's best material is collected on the anthology
``Kokomo: The Collection'' (Castle), which can be ordered through
the online mail-order shop at NME.com. Perhaps the group's
best-known track, an extended groove-alicious version of Bobby
Womack's ``I Can Understand It,'' turned up on the pub-rock
compilation ``Naughty Rhythms'' a couple of years back.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Kokomo was Spenner, a wry wit and thrilling
musician who acted as stoned master of ceremonies. After a
20-minute jam on an opening instrumental like Herbie Hancock's
``Chameleon'' or Funk Inc.'s ``Sister Jane,'' Spenner would
introduce ``the girls,'' Kokomo's superb vocal trio of Frank
Collins, Dyan Birch and Paddie McHugh.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, perennially late saxophonist Mel Collins, who went
on to record and tour with Eric Clapton, would show up on stage at
tightly packed London venues like the Hope &AMP; Anchor or Dingwall's
just in time to take a wailing tenor solo.
</P>
<P>
   Along with memorable numbers like ``Forever,'' ``It Ain't Cool
to Be Cool No More,'' ``Rise &AMP; Shine'' and ``Feeling This Way,''
Kokomo made covers of Aretha Franklin's ``Angel,'' Joe Tex's ``A
Mother's Prayer'' and the Pointer Sisters' ``Yes We Can Can'' their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Kokomo's secret weapons was guitarist Jim Mullen, a
powerfully built Scotsman who plucked a particularly soulful
Telecaster with his thumb. Years earlier, when he was part of Brian
Auger's Oblivion Express, Mullen was known as ``Jim the Thumb.''
Today, he leads a straight-ahead jazz quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the member of Kokomo to achieve the most recognition
was Boston-born conga player Jody Linscott, who joined up with
Robert Palmer, the Who and many others. She also penned a series of
children's books that did well on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   There were other fine soul-funk outfits on the far side of the
pond during those years _ AWB, FBI, Cado Belle, Gonzalez and Moon,
among them.
</P>
<P>
   But when a Kokomo reunion that had begun turning up in British
clubs in the late '80s grinded to a halt in 1991 when Spenner died,
it was a sad end to one of soul music's most neglected yet
inspirational bands.

GARBAGE DRUMMER GIVES A SAMPLE OF HIS WORK BATHED IN `ELECTRONICA' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many musicians can point to a defining moment when they knew,
absolutely, what they wanted to do with their lives. Butch Vig,
drummer/producer with the group Garbage, remembers his.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in the late '60s when he saw the Who perform live on
the Smothers Brothers television show. The band's drummer, Keith
Moon, wreaked havoc on the set, and a little kid in Wisconsin got
hooked on the anarchic spirit of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had a huge impact on me,'' Vig said. ``My mom was a music
teacher and had been making me play piano since I was like 5 years
old. I went, `Forget this. I want to learn how to play drums.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I never learned to play like Keith Moon,'' he added, laughing.
``I learned to play more like Charlie Watts, straight-ahead, 4/4
rock stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   With Garbage, which will perform a sold-out show Saturday at the
Aerial Theater in Houston, Vig is learning yet another way to play
the drums. When he hits the skins, it triggers electronic
sequencers programmed with samples and sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no acoustic drums,'' he said. ``I play acoustic drums,
but it triggers samples that we used on the records. I'm using a
much bigger drum sampler this time, so I can use sequencers in it.
Besides loops, there's a lot more sound effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vig adds that Garbage remains, fundamentally, a rock 'n'
roll band. He and his old college chums Duke Erikson and Steve
Marker are joined by lead vocalist Shirley Manson, the most
appealingly tempestuous female rock 'n' roll frontwoman since the
Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still really are a rock band, and we write pop songs,'' Vig
said. ``But we love using technology to bring all these different
elements into the music. We use the dance grooves and electronica
and hip-hop and try to have all these different genres colliding
together to make the songs sound fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Garbage's self-titled 1995 debut album spawned several modern
rock hits including ``Queer,'' ``Vow,'' ``Only Happy When It
Rains'' and ``Stupid Girl.'' These songs combined killer melodic
hooks with state-of-the-art studio technology and electronic dance
textures. The album went on to sell more than 4 million copies
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up, ``Version 2.0,'' was released a little more than
five months ago. The first single from the album, ``Push It,''
proudly nodded to influences as disparate as the Beach Boys and
Salt 'n' Pepa. While it has yet to be certified gold in the United
States, ``Version'' has sold 2 million copies internationally. In
England, Garbage is a stadium headliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided from Day One that we wanted to be an international
band,'' Vig said. ``We didn't necessarily want to focus on one
country. And we've done really well all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Vig met Erikson and Marker while attending film school at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison. Erikson later joined Vig in the
band Firetown, which released a couple of critically acclaimed
albums of heartland rock in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   After Firetown's second album failed to live up to record label
expectations, Vig turned to production. Working out of his home
studio in Madison, he developed good relationships with such
indie-rock labels as Mammoth, Touch &AMP; Go, Twin Tone and SubPop.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991, he had produced and/or engineered close to 300 albums,
none of which were major hits. Then he produced the album that
changed the direction of rock music in the '90s, Nirvana's
``Nevermind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I finished it, there was a huge buzz on it, but I
had no idea it would blow up and affect people critically and
commercially the way that it did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to make a good punk record. The difference
is that there were amazing songs on there, so many amazing hooks.
And Kurt had sort of an enigma that was fascinating. You could
hear, coming out of his voice, something that a lot of people don't
have.''
</P>
<P>
   After Nirvana, Vig worked on high-profile albums by Smashing
Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Soul Asylum, L7 and others. He became
fascinated with hip-hop and samplers while working on remix
projects for U2 and Nine Inch Nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we'd do a remix, we'd erase all the tracks except the
vocals and record new music,'' he said. ``That was the first time I
got into playing again. And that was the inspiration that got us to
start Garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   The band was looking for a female singer when Marker saw Manson
on MTV singing with her previous band, Angel Fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell in love with just her singing,'' Vig said. ``There's
not a lot of histrionics, not a lot of screaming or angst. And that
was radically different compared to a lot of the other female
singers at the time, who to me either sounded really girlie or they
screamed all the way through songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea that she was going to turn into this pop diva.
We told her we wanted her to write with us, produce with us, to be
an equal member of this band. She had never had that opportunity
before, and she kind of took the ball and ran with it. She's
totally blossomed as an artist, a frontperson and a singer.''
</P>
<P>
   If one word could be used to describe Manson's no-nonsense stage
presence and sexually-charged lyrics, it would be ``attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the lyrics come directly from her,'' Vig said. ``She's
brutally honest. She didn't make up this character to become a pop
diva in Garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the most real and most complicated people that I
know. She's very emotional and outspoken. She can be extremely
vulnerable and fragile, and then tough as nails 15 minutes later.
It's a roller-coaster ride with her, and it can be sometimes
exasperating, but it's also what keeps it so interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're well aware now that Shirley's become the focal point of
the band. That's a natural thing to happen. If you look at Bono
with U2 or Michael Stipe with R.E.M., they are pretty much a
mouthpiece of the band. Shirley's become the mouthpiece for
Garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Vig adds that the fact all the members are older and have been
in bands before has allowed them to make decisions democratically.
Not everyone gets what he or she wants all the time, but members
sacrifice their individual egos for the good of the band.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the grunge era Vig helped launch with Nirvana is coming
to a close, rock music is waiting for another guiding direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone keeps saying rock is dead, but it's not dead,'' Vig
said. ``It may get a little stagnant, but it always roars back.
Something's going to twist it up and come out and light a torch to
it, but nobody knows what that is and that's what's exciting about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that our first record caught a lot of people
off-guard. Now, I've heard a lot of Garbage clones, trying to do
what we do with all these different elements. But I still think
that, ultimately, you have to be able to write a good song.'' &QL;

DON'T FRET OVER BREAKFAST; FIX FRITTATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN STEINER 
and CICI WILLIAMSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On weekday mornings, it's a bowl of cereal and out the door.
Weekend breakfasts are more leisurely. But even for the joyful
cook, there's no reason to waste precious time in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Making frittate _ Italy's answer to omelets _ takes mere minutes
in the microwave without sacrificing the superior taste of a dish
that takes longer to cook conventionally.
</P>
<P>
   And the results are lush. Creamy eggs hold enticing chunks of
whatever one chooses to add. As with omelets, one usual addition is
cheese, which can be the cook's choice.
</P>
<P>
   A new cheese we like is Snofrisk (``snow fresh''), a goat cheese
for beginners. Those who shy from the somewhat barnyard overtones
of cheese made solely from goat's milk will like this Norwegian
variety from the producers of Jarlsberg. It contains 20 percent
cow's milk.
</P>
<P>
   For those restricting cholesterol, frittate can be made from egg
substitutes. One large fresh egg contains 215 milligrams
cholesterol; Simply Eggs (containing yolks) has 45 milligrams; Egg
Beaters (egg whites) contains none.
</P>
<P>
   Egg substitutes are packaged in cartons like half-pints of milk.
An unopened carton can be stored in the refrigerator several weeks.
For best results, use by the date on the carton. After opening, use
within three days. To substitute Simply Eggs or Egg Beaters for
whole fresh eggs, use \ cup for each large egg in a recipe.

TEXAS WINE &AMP; FOOD CLASSIC GETS OFF TO FINE START 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The woman tugged on my sleeve. ``Have you tried the
Fredericksburg Muscat Hamburg? It's yummy!''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I said, I already had tried it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she said, ``when I heard this was going to be just
Texas wines, I thought, `Eewww ...' But some of these are really
good. I'm very surprised!''
</P>
<P>
   She probably wasn't the only one. Fact is, while some small
Texas wineries continue to produce amateurish efforts, others have
made noticeable strides in upgrading the quality of their wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' was the first Texas Wine &AMP; Food Classic, held at the
Doubletree Hotel in Houston. With the demise of the Houston Club's
annual tribute to Texas wines, there was a void here. Now the
Classic, under the aegis of the Food and Beverage Managers
Association of Houston, appears to be on solid footing, if the
crowds and the enthusiasm at the Doubletree event were any
indication.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic was organized primarily by Randy Fournier of Amerada
Hess Corp. and Guy Stout of Glazer's Wholesale Distributors. Jeff
Graves and Kevin Simon of the University of Houston Hilton College
of Hotel and Restaurant Management provided both a venue and help
for the wine judging preceding the event. Net proceeds of the Texas
Wine &AMP; Food Classic will benefit the UH Hilton Scholarship Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic featured not only more than half of Texas' wineries,
with many principals and winemakers on hand, but also indigenous
Texas foodstuffs, from beef to lamb to ostrich.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the event, I gathered 10 knowledgeable wine
consumers to judge Texas wines at the University of Houston's
Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management.
</P>
<P>
   To make a wine competition successful, three factors come into
play: the participation of the wineries; the knowledge of the
judges; and the efficiency of the back-room staff in pouring the
wines, removing empty glasses, etc. If there's a breakdown in any
of the three areas, disaster beckons.
</P>
<P>
   We had no disaster.
</P>
<P>
   We got a good amount of entries (105), the judges knew their
business (and none had any ties to the Texas wine industry), and
the UH students in the back room did an outstanding job.
</P>
<P>
   I have judged at more than 30 major wine competitions across the
country, but this was the first time I was on the other side of the
table. Fortunately, I had such excellent help that once things got
under way, my main contribution was staying out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, here are the results of the first Texas Wine &AMP;

</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the results, I wasn't surprised that Messina Hof in
Bryan and Llano Estacado in Lubbock took a fair share of the
medals; the wineries do a good job and also send a lot of entries.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I know that at least a couple of winery
owners were disappointed they didn't win anything; in one instance,
I think the owner was right. In the other _ well, perhaps better
wines would have garnered a better response from the judges.

VETERAN NEWSWOMAN SURPRISED AT SUCCESS OF HER BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After 10 months of reporting and analyzing the
White House sex scandal, Cokie Roberts says she feels ``imprisoned
by the story, both literally and figuratively.''
</P>
<P>
   The sordid saga of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky ``has
kept me here and forced me to cancel all kinds of appearances,''
Roberts said from Washington, D.C. ``I've been letting people down
right and left because I couldn't leave town.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though she is pinned down inside the Beltway, Roberts'
reach has extended nationwide with the publication of ``We Are Our
Mothers' Daughters'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co., 197 pages, $19.95.),
her reflection on and celebration of women, now in its 23rd week on
the New York Times best-seller list. She is the chief congressional
correspondent for ABC News and co-anchor of ``This Week With Sam
Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' book has 13 essays. Many are intensely personal _ on
the death of her beloved elder sister, her boundless admiration for
her mother, friendship, sisterhood, child-rearing, marriage,
parenting, her career in journalism; others celebrate women of
unusual pluck and accomplishment, such as civil rights activist
Dorothy Height and consumer advocate Esther Peterson, both alert,
active octogenarians.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the book, her first, was ``terribly surprising _
I had no expectations.'' It is also ``the most exciting thing
that's ever happened professionally to me (because) it's all yours.
It's not committee work.''
</P>
<P>
   A byproduct of the book has been ``the wonderful communication
I've had with women all over the country. It's been absolutely
touching, inspiring _ it's hard to describe how meaningful it's
been. Women my age and older essentially say, `there it is, that's
my life,' and younger women say `that's possible' _ and that's a
great feeling. One woman told me that she hadn't talked to her
sister in five years, and then `I read your book and picked up the
phone and called her.' That's gratifying,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   She is contemplating a second book, on marriage and
relationships, written with her husband Steven Roberts, a former
New York Times reporter who is now a professor at George Washington
University in Washington. They have been married for 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who first won recognition for perceptive enterprise
reporting for National Public Radio, was born with a list of
political sources that most reporters take an entire career to
acquire. Her father Hale Boggs, a New Orleans Democrat, was House
majority leader when he died in a 1972 Alaska plane crash; her
mother Lindy succeeded him and served until her retirement in 1990.
She is now, at age 81, U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican. Presidents
Lyndon B. Johnson and Gerald Ford, Vice President Hubert Humphrey
and House Speaker Sam Rayburn were ``family friends who would come
by for a casual dinner,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Her family connections and celebrity ``have made it easier, if
truth be told,'' to report on national politics, Roberts
acknowledged. But as a practical matter, ``it's more being around
for a long time. Now congressmen will call me back. Twenty years
ago I'd have to go and hunt 'em down.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential scandal, with impeachment hearings looming,
remains Washington's compelling story, and Roberts said the endgame
scenario is murky.
</P>
<P>
   ``In August and September, Democrats were in a total panic
thinking they were going to lose massively'' in the November
elections, she said. ``Now Republicans are in a bit of a stew
thinking they're not going to do very well. ... I've never been in
a period when people were calibrating polls more carefully and
trying to respond to those polls.''
</P>
<P>
   The election ``will make a big difference'' in how the scandal
plays out, Roberts said. If there's a real Republican sweep _
``which at the moment I don't see'' _ congressional Democrats would
deliver the message to Clinton that he's got to go, Roberts said.
``They lose no love for him (Clinton) anyway. If they could
demonstrate that he was being harmful to the party, you'd see a
huge move. But if the Democrats do better than expected, I think
they'll come back and do an instant deal,'' such as censure. And
``if it's status quo, this could drag on for a while,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What with reporting and anchor work for ABC, doing political
analysis for National Public Radio and writing a weekly newspaper
column with her husband and zipping around the country for book
signings and speaking engagements, Roberts' life would seem almost
impossibly busy. Not so, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not filing (news stories) all the time the way I used
to,'' and besides, ``for the first time in my life I have a
full-time assistant at ABC and then a person who helps me at home
with bills and stuff. When I was younger and poorer and had
children at home, that's when I could've used the help,'' she said.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Veteran newswoman that she is, Roberts has no illusions about
the use to which ``This Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts''
is put, and it's not breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in government use these programs for their
self-interest ... to have a forum to make a point and use the forum
to gather American public support. We know that,'' she said. ``Our
challenge is to convince them it's in their self-interest to be
with us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that the shift from straight reporting to TV
punditry hasn't been easy. ``I have a problem with it. It's
confusing for viewers. One thing I can recommend to them is that
they view the (end-of-program) roundtable as the equivalent of the
op-ed page'' in a newspaper, she said.

BY ROB LOWMAN  
 

</HEADLINE>
  LOS ANGELES _ OK, let's do the math.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``The X-Files'' film, ``Fight the Future,'' has made about
$84 million. At, say, an average of $5 a pop, that means some 16.8
million tickets were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ``The X-Files'' series has a viewership of about 20
million, and Fox, the studio behind both the series and the film,
was hoping all 20 million would hit the theaters and make it a $100
million film.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this didn't happen. Some of the fans were holding
out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, hard-core ``X'' fans went, but there were probably a
number of casual viewers who didn't want to pay for something they
could watch on television.
</P>
<P>
   But now the video's being released just in time to bone up on
all the nuances of the hit show (and there are a lot) just before
the season premiere of the series (Nov. 8).
</P>
<P>
   So for all you fans who didn't make it to the theaters, now you
(ITAL) can watch it on TV (END ITAL). And, as a bonus, the video
has a couple of prolonged scenes _ one that explains the fate of
one of the characters, and another that elaborates on the ongoing
conspiracy. Added to the video are interviews with star Gillian
Anderson and series creator Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were mixed about ``The X-Files'' movie, which was
directed by series veteran Rob Bowman, when it came out. Some felt
the film wandered; others thought it was like a series episode
stretched out but with better special effects. While both carps are
true, the film also suffered from expectations that were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the movie works for both the uninitiated and the
hard-core fans. Carter was smart not to throw the baby out with the
bath water, so to speak. What he did is keep the essence of the
show intact while expanding on it. He did this partly by adding
some snazzy effects and turning up the heat on the relationship
between Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Anderson). But
in essence, it is a really big episode _ and that's not bad. In
fact, it's good. For five years, ``The X-Files'' has been light
years ahead of the vast majority of stuff on TV, and as a movie
it's light years ahead of most theatrical releases. Witty and
sophisticated without pointing to itself, the series plays off our
fascination with UFOs and the unexplained along without our
distrust of the government but, instead of merely exploiting it,
``The X-Files'' offers an interesting commentary on our culture
while still being entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's story jumps off from last season's series finale.
FBI agents Mulder and Scully have been reassigned because the
X-Files (cases of unexplained phenomenon) have been shut down
(again). They find themselves searching for a bomb in a federal
building in Dallas. It's not the building that everyone else is
looking for a bomb in, but Mulder has a hunch, which, as they
inevitably do, turns out to be right. The next thing you know, the
pair are back into their paranoid, conspiratorial world.
</P>
<P>
   This includes the mysterious black oil, killer bees, the
syndicate and the cover-up of the existence of extraterrestrials.
Familiar characters also show up _ the Lone Gunmen, the Cigarette
Man, the Well-Manicured Man and Mulder and Scully's boss, Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   What the video does is not only bridge the gap between the last
season and next but give potential series viewers a chance to catch
up.
</P>
<P>
   The video also offers you a chance to answer the real burning
question of the movie, but you'll need a freeze-frame button on
your VCR to do it: Do Mulder's and Scully's lips ever meet? Unless
you were Superman, it was hard to tell in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who are ``X-Files''-philes, you might want to
wait till Nov. 2, when a special ``collector's'' gift set becomes
available in time for the holiday season. The package (at a
suggested price of $79.98) will include a wide-screen video version
of the film, a movie script, five individual frames from the film,
8-by-10 reprints of the three film posters, a video on the making
of the film and a ``behind-the-scenes'' book.
</P>
<P>
   RECOMMENDATIONS: There are a number of other new videos worth
checking out this week. Before there was ``There's Something About
Mary,'' there was ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' (Universal).
Now the ``20th Anniversary Edition'' of this classic gross comedy
is in stores. ... Warner Bros. makes its own knight move into
feature-length animation with ``Quest for Camelot.'' While not
Disney, it nevertheless is solid, enjoyable family entertainment
with songs sung by Bryan White, Celine Dion and LeAnn Rimes
(``Looking Through Your Eyes''). ... And Daily News film critic Bob
Strauss called ``Sonatine'' (Miramax) a ``remarkably controlled and
imaginative work.'' A violent gangster drama full of wonderfully
fresh excursions into comedy and behavioral observation, the movie
is further proof that Takeshi Kitano is one of Japan's finest
filmmakers.

   FILM-BELOVED (Undated) _ Much hoopla hassurrounded the opening
of Oprah Winfrey's ``Beloved,'' but the movie doesn't live up to
it.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-MIGHTY (Undated) _ ``The Mighty,'' is almost
point-for-point the same movie as last month's misfit-buddy movie,
``Simon Birch.'' Mercifully, this latest version of the tale is
less clumsily manipulative and maudlin than its predecessor. Even
so, it's underwhelming to the point that fans of director Peter
Chelsom's more accomplished first two films _ ``Hear My Song'' and
``Funny Bones'' _ could reasonably feel he's been hit by the junior
curse.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SHADRACH (Undated) _ It was surely not intentional, but
Susanna Styron's film version of her father William Stryon's short
story, ``Shadrach,'' plays so uncannily like an episode of the old
'70s TV series, ``The Waltons,'' that it must have been her primary
subconscious influence.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-DEVIL (Undated) _ ``Love is the Devil,'' a gritty film
about painter Francis Bacon, demands patience because it's like
reading excerpts from a naughty diary, written in code. The real
narrative flow is in the film's strong, gorgeous, evocative visual
rendering. It tells us tons about Bacon's art, as well as the man
himself. Better yet, it gives us a glimpse into the macabre vision
of Bacon and his tawdry fascination with the grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-MAGIC (Undated) _ In ``Practical Magic,'' Nicole Kidman and
Sandra Bullock shine as sisters who have a bond so intense it's a
blessing as well as a curse. ``Practical Magic'' needs their
gung-ho talent and charisma to draw us in and they throw themselves
into this cauldron of dark, uncomfortable comedy with gusto,
conjuring more screen magic than the movie itself.

SETTLEMENT PENDING IN LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY JERRY GARCIA'S EX-WIFE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The monetary dispute between the widow of
Grateful Dead leader Jerry Garcia and his former wife is coming to
a rapid close, with both sides reaching an agreement that would pay
Carolyn ``Mountain Girl'' Adams-Garcia about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got tired of fighting,'' Adams-Garcia, the band
leader's former wife, said Wednesday night from her home near
Eugene, Ore. ``I felt like it would be in the best interests of
everyone in the family to put an end to it. It's not healthy to
keep the anxiety and trouble alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The musician's first wife sued the estate after Garcia died in
1995 at the age of 53. She contended that Garcia's widow, Deborah
Koons Garcia, had stopped alimony payments that Jerry Garcia had
been making to Adams-Garcia as part of a 1993 divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A Marin County judge ruled last year that the divorce settlement
between Jerry Garcia and Adams-Garcia was valid and ordered the
late musician's estate to pay nearly $5 million to Adams-Garcia.
Deborah Garcia appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Adams-Garcia said her attorneys negotiated a settlement with the
attorneys for the Garcia estate so that she could end the
litigation and move on. The agreement will go before Marin County
Probate Court for approval on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't concerned about (losing on appeal) as much as I was
concerned about the stress factor of the family,'' Adams-Garcia
said. ``It was just time to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Garcia estate could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Adams-Garcia said there was brief discussion of a settlement
during the trial last year, but it went nowhere. She declined to
disclose the exact figure of the settlement but she said it was
about $1 million.

IMAX GOES TO THE TOP OF MOUNT EVEREST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two-thirds of the way up Mount Everest, the brain
becomes starved for oxygen. The lungs can fill with fluid, the body
begins to break down, and the mind works in slow motion. The human
body wasn't made to operate at this altitude.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, 1996, filmmaker David Breashears and an IMAX film
crew stood on top of the world, only days after the worst climbing
tragedy in the history of Everest. The ascent and the awful drama
unfold in the spectacular documentary ``Everest,'' which opens
today at the California Science Center's IMAX Theater &UR;  &LR; in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX party _ American Ed Viesturs, Jamling Tenzing Norgay of
India, Spain's Araceli Segarra and Sumiyo Tsuzuki of Japan _
followed the route taken by Sir Edmund Hillary on the first
successful ascent of Everest in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Viesturs was a friend of New Zealand climber and guide Rob Hall,
who died with seven others when a storm trapped climbers on the
mountain on May 10, 1996. As temperatures dipped to 100 below zero,
the 23 men and women in that party were blinded by 80 mph gusts
that made a descent impossible. Journalist Jon Krakauer, who was a
member of the Rob Hall-Scott Fischer party, gave a survivor's
account of the tragedy in the best-selling ``Into Thin Air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' doesn't set out to tell the story of the tragedy. It
does, however, include footage of the storm and the miraculous
survival of Beck Weathers, who was given up for dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than turning ``Everest'' into a documentary on the
tragedy itself, Breashears and writer/producer Steve Judson
concentrate on how it directly affected the IMAX team, which was
out of danger at a base camp below.
</P>
<P>
   Breashears and his team, in fact, had decided not to push for
the 29,000-foot summit that day because the camera would have been
too unwieldy in the high winds. As fate would have it, the
Hall-Fischer party passed them.
</P>
<P>
   To the Sherpas and Tibetan monks who live in its mammoth shadow,
Everest demands respect. Failure to treat the mountain with due
reverence can be a fatal mistake, given the hazards of icy cliffs,
deep crevasses and the ever-present danger of avalanche. (If you've
ever wondered what an avalanche looks like just before it buries
you, you'll find out.)
</P>
<P>
   Spirituality was very much a part of the everyday ritual, which
producer/director Greg MacGillivray believes the film reflects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people who go to Tibet, as I have, or to Nepal to visit
the mountains get a sense that there is something more powerful
there than just a massing of rock and ice,'' he said. ``Every day,
Jamling would say prayers for each one of the climbers and for the
success of the day's mission. Before the climbers would move into
the icefall, each one of the ice axes and crampons were blessed
through a Puja ceremony, when the implements were passed through
juniper smoke and blessed by prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' has an existential feel, due mainly to a combination
of incredible scenery and spartan narration. The higher the
climbers go, the more they must conserve their energy. Conversation
is clipped, and there is an economy of words in the rarefied air.
So exhausted was Segarra _ who was trying to become the first
Spanish woman to conquer Everest _ that she wanted to stop and rest
after every step on the climb's final leg.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers also assisted researchers studying the geology of
Everest and earthquakes in the region (northern India and Nepal),
where four quakes of magnitude 8 or more have hit in this century.
By setting up ground stations for the global positioning system
(GPS), more precise ground measurement readings can be taken and
used to study the geologic forces at work. Also, rock samples from
the upper reaches of Everest were carried back for further study.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Everest, in northeast Nepal, is part of the Himalayan
range, a 1,500-mile swath of mountains dividing India from China to
the north. The Himalayas arose 45 million to 50 million years ago
when two land masses collided, causing geologic uplift. Even today,
the movement continues to push Mount Everest 3 to 5 millimeters
higher each year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful IMAX movies ever, ``Everest'' wowed
Southern California audiences in Irvine, Ontario and San Diego
before making its way to the California Science Center in
Exposition Park. It's a piggyback ride to the top of the world
without ever leaving sea level.

`X-FILES' MOVIE COULD DRAW YOU IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ OK, let's do the math.
</P>
<P>
   The ``The X-Files'' film, ``Fight the Future,'' has made about
$84 million. At, say, an average of $5 a pop, that means some 16.8
million tickets were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ``The X-Files'' series has a viewership of about 20
million, and Fox, the studio behind both the series and the film,
was hoping all 20 million would hit the theaters and make it a $100
million film.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this didn't happen. Some of the fans were holding
out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, hard-core ``X'' fans went, but there were probably a
number of casual viewers who didn't want to pay for something they
could watch on television.
</P>
<P>
   But now the video's being released just in time to bone up on
all the nuances of the hit show (and there are a lot) just before
the season premiere of the series (Nov. 8).
</P>
<P>
   So for all you fans who didn't make it to the theaters, now you
(ITAL) can watch it on TV (END ITAL). And, as a bonus, the video
has a couple of prolonged scenes _ one that explains the fate of
one of the characters, and another that elaborates on the ongoing
conspiracy. Added to the video are interviews with star Gillian
Anderson and series creator Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were mixed about ``The X-Files'' movie, which was
directed by series veteran Rob Bowman, when it came out. Some felt
the film wandered; others thought it was like a series episode
stretched out but with better special effects. While both carps are
true, the film also suffered from expectations that were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the movie works for both the uninitiated and the
hard-core fans. Carter was smart not to throw the baby out with the
bath water, so to speak. What he did is keep the essence of the
show intact while expanding on it. He did this partly by adding
some snazzy effects and turning up the heat on the relationship
between Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Anderson). But
in essence, it is a really big episode _ and that's not bad. In
fact, it's good. For five years, ``The X-Files'' has been light
years ahead of the vast majority of stuff on TV, and as a movie
it's light years ahead of most theatrical releases. Witty and
sophisticated without pointing to itself, the series plays off our
fascination with UFOs and the unexplained along without our
distrust of the government but, instead of merely exploiting it,
``The X-Files'' offers an interesting commentary on our culture
while still being entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's story jumps off from last season's series finale.
FBI agents Mulder and Scully have been reassigned because the
X-Files (cases of unexplained phenomenon) have been shut down
(again). They find themselves searching for a bomb in a federal
building in Dallas. It's not the building that everyone else is
looking for a bomb in, but Mulder has a hunch, which, as they
inevitably do, turns out to be right. The next thing you know, the
pair are back into their paranoid, conspiratorial world.
</P>
<P>
   This includes the mysterious black oil, killer bees, the
syndicate and the cover-up of the existence of extraterrestrials.
Familiar characters also show up _ the Lone Gunmen, the Cigarette
Man, the Well-Manicured Man and Mulder and Scully's boss, Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   What the video does is not only bridge the gap between the last
season and next but give potential series viewers a chance to catch
up.
</P>
<P>
   The video also offers you a chance to answer the real burning
question of the movie, but you'll need a freeze-frame button on
your VCR to do it: Do Mulder's and Scully's lips ever meet? Unless
you were Superman, it was hard to tell in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who are ``X-Files''-philes, you might want to
wait till Nov. 2, when a special ``collector's'' gift set becomes
available in time for the holiday season. The package (at a
suggested price of $79.98) will include a wide-screen video version
of the film, a movie script, five individual frames from the film,
8-by-10 reprints of the three film posters, a video on the making
of the film and a ``behind-the-scenes'' book.
</P>
<P>
   RECOMMENDATIONS: There are a number of other new videos worth
checking out this week. Before there was ``There's Something About
Mary,'' there was ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' (Universal).
Now the ``20th Anniversary Edition'' of this classic gross comedy
is in stores. ... Warner Bros. makes its own knight move into
feature-length animation with ``Quest for Camelot.'' While not
Disney, it nevertheless is solid, enjoyable family entertainment
with songs sung by Bryan White, Celine Dion and LeAnn Rimes
(``Looking Through Your Eyes''). ... And Daily News film critic Bob
Strauss called ``Sonatine'' (Miramax) a ``remarkably controlled and
imaginative work.'' A violent gangster drama full of wonderfully
fresh excursions into comedy and behavioral observation, the movie
is further proof that Takeshi Kitano is one of Japan's finest
filmmakers.

`BELOVED' FAILS TO LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So many dedicated people have invested so much time and so many
good intentions into the screen version of Toni Morrison's novel,
``Beloved,'' that it's no fun to have to report that their work has
resulted in considerably less than a classic film.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey's legions of fans are likely to respond to it as a
star vehicle, and devoted readers of Nobel Laureate Morrison will
find it a stubbornly faithful adaptation of her 1987 Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel. With its knee-jerk feminist appeal, this could
be enough to carry the film to its much-predicted multi-Oscar
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But others are likely to be profoundly confused by its
meandering structure and frustrated by the minimal emotional return
to be had from the intense, demanding, near-three-hour investment
it requires.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in rural Ohio just after the Civil War with a
horrific, ``Exorcist''-ish teaser in an (apparently) haunted house
occupied by a family of ex-slaves headed by its middle-aged
matriarch, Sethe (Winfrey). It's a manifestation so violent that it
shakes the walls like an earthquake and pops an eye of the family
dog right out of its socket.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 1873 and the story proper begins with a visit to the
house by Paul D (Danny Glover), another ex-slave who knew Sethe's
family before the war back at ``Sweet Home,'' the plantation to
which they were bound across the river in Kentucky. Paul D quickly
ingratiates himself with the family and into Sethe's bed.
</P>
<P>
   As Sethe brings Paul D up to date on her life, the film flashes
back to tell the story of her unusually humiliating gang rape by a
band of neanderthal whites, her flight from slavery while pregnant
and her escape to this Ohio farm owned by her mother-in-law (Beah
Richards), where Sethe's older children already are ensconced.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul D settles in, the major plot point comes when a
mysterious, mentally handicapped young woman named Beloved (Thandie
Newton) wanders inexplicably onto the farm one day. Taken in by the
family, she becomes the companion of Sethe's teenage daughter,
Denver (Kimberly Elise), but seems to have some malevolent designs
on Sethe.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the story continues to both jump forward to chronicle
Sethe's decline, and flash back to reveal more missing pieces of
her past, until it gradually becomes apparent who Beloved is and
what she represents. The audience gets a devastating whammy _ the
revelation of a secret that Morrison has set up to be the
``Sophie's Choice'' of American Slavery.
</P>
<P>
   To those who love the book, this secret metaphorically
encapsulates the experience of slavery and its horrible
repercussions. According to Winfrey, ``I felt that `Beloved' was
part of the reason I was born, to tell that story on screen. I
wanted to do with a movie what Toni Morrison had done with a book.
She allowed us to feel what slavery felt like ... to understand
what slavery did to (the) soul.''
</P>
<P>
   That soul-destroying horror definitely is communicated here, and
Winfrey's central performance is, if not truly Oscar-worthy, at
least quite respectable _ as are the performances of the rest of
the cast, especially Kimberly Elise. She steals the movie as the
reasonably unscathed daughter who seems to have a shot at rising
above the legacy of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie ``Beloved'' loses much of the emotional impact it
deserves by being a hopelessly muddled piece of basic storytelling.
As it flashes back and forth between the pre- and post-Civil War,
between Kentucky and Ohio, and between characters with
unestablished relationships, it's virtually impossible to stay
oriented in the story unless you've read the book.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is the strange fact that, in many of the
flashback scenes, the young adult version of Sethe is played by
another actress (Lisa Gay Hamilton), who doesn't much resemble
Winfrey. So it's quite possible to follow her through half the
movie thinking she's an entirely different character.
</P>
<P>
   Also confusing is the fact that the bold, Stephen King-like
scene that opens the movie is completely unfulfilled, virtually
forgotten, as the film moves along. A few of Sethe's hallucinations
aside, the occult premise seems to disappear. On the evidence of
the movie, it's not at all clear exactly what the metaphysical
scheme of this film is.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat daunting running time also is an obstacle. Even
with its visual sweep, Director Steven Spielberg kept ``The Color
Purple'' at 152 minutes. ``Beloved'' is 20 minutes longer, and it's
framed mostly in tight, claustrophobic settings and at a Eugene
O'Neill intensity. The experience of sitting through it just wears
you out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of these complaints are the direct result of the
fact that producer-star Winfrey, her writers and her hand-picked
director, Jonathan Demme, (``The Silence of the Lambs'') have gone
to enormous lengths to be true to the novel. Morrison is such a
current cultural icon, and Winfrey is so worshipful of her, that
anything else would have been unconscionable.
</P>
<P>
   But movie history tells us that film adaptations, even those
that seem to be most faithful to their great novel sources _ `Gone
With the Wind,'' ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``The Color Purple'' _
invariably required massive changes, new scenes, new structure, new
ideas. ``Beloved'' could have used a little less reverence, a
little more creative initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Beloved. Directed by Jonathan Demme. Screenplay by Richard
LaGravenese and Adam Brooks. Cast: Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover,
Thandie Newton, Kimberly Elise, Beah Richards. Disney/Touchstone.
172 minutes. Rated R for violent images, sexuality and nudity.

`THE MIGHTY' IS MOSTLY UNDERWHELMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood's penchant for releasing two films on roughly the same
subject at roughly the same time has become a true phenomenon of
our time. Can good ideas be in such short supply, or is this some
calculated scheme to share publicity costs?
</P>
<P>
   Much already has been made of the fact that this fall will see
two computer-animated insect movies, two Elizabethan England movies
(both starring Joseph Fiennes), two Robin William-as-a-doctor
movies and two effects-of-slavery sagas (both with Jonathan Demme
behind the camera).
</P>
<P>
   But here's yet another match in the '98 fall line-up that went
unnoticed from the studio hand-out plot descriptions: this week's
misfit-buddy movie, ``The Mighty,'' is almost point-for-point the
same movie as last month's misfit-buddy movie, ``Simon Birch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, this latest version of the tale is less clumsily
manipulative and maudlin than its predecessor. Even so, it's
underwhelming to the point that fans of director Peter Chelsom's
more accomplished first two films _ ``Hear My Song'' and ``Funny
Bones'' _ could reasonably feel he's been hit by the junior curse.
</P>
<P>
   The larger and healthier of this film's high school duo is the
film's narrator, Max (Elden Henson), a big, withdrawn, socially
backward kid who lives with his grandparents (Gena Rowlands and
Harry Dean Stanton) and is traumatized by a mysterious event in his
past involving his imprisoned father.
</P>
<P>
   His more vulnerable pal is Kevin (Kieran Culkin, 15 year-old
brother Macaulay), a severely handicapped but very smart and brave
boy who suffers from a degenerative, ultimately terminal disease in
which his body organs keep growing while his bones do not.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculed by their impossibly cruel Cincinnati schoolmates, the
two strike back by combining their assets _ Kevin's brain and Max's
brawn _ to become, in effect, a single unit: little Kevin sits on
Max's shoulders as if riding a horse, and they storm around their
inner-city neighborhood like an Arthurian Knight, fighting bullies,
righting wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   In its best moments, ``The Mighty'' manages to be sporadically
touching. Its ensemble of lower-middle class characters seem, for
the most part, believable, and its two teenage leads are admirably
devoid of the child-star cutsies _ especially Henson, who's been
well cast for his air of anti-social awkwardness.
</P>
<P>
   The film also provides a nice change-of-pace role for Sharon
Stone, who's surprisingly poignant in her handful of scenes as
Kevin's hard-pressed single mom. And it offers an even greater
stretch for Gillian Anderson (``The X-Files''), who is less
effective as the gang moll with a heart of gold who helps the boys
in their time of greatest need.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if you can forgive and forget its glaring similarity
to ``Simon Birch,'' the film doesn't come together to be anything
half as magical as it obviously wants to be. Its third-act
kidnapping subplot is particularly heavy-handed, its King Arthur
analogy always seems forced and too many of Chelsom's scenes simply
ring amazingly false.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty. Directed by Peter Chelsom. Screenplay by Charles
Leavitt. Cast: Sharon Stone, Elden Henson, Kieran Culkin, Gena
Rowlands, Gillian Anderson. Miramax. 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
elements of violence and peril.

`SHADRACH' IS TV-SCALE MORALITY TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was surely not intentional, but Susanna Styron's film version
of her father William Stryon's short story, ``Shadrach,'' plays so
uncannily like an episode of the old '70s TV series, ``The
Waltons,'' that it must have been her primary subconscious
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Her film is set in rural Virginia during the depth of the
Depression; it involves a large, close-knit, economically
struggling family; and it's narrated by a grown-up version of the
boy hero _ in an aristocratic voice that could well pass for Earl
Hamner Jr.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a small-scale, not-terribly-ambitious morality tale
that resolves itself rather neatly, TV-style, by the end, yet _
very much in ``The Waltons'' tradition _ leaves us with a certain
wistful, bittersweet poignancy. Goodnight, John Boy.
</P>
<P>
   We see the story from the point-of-view of Paul (Scott Tera) a
pre-teen who, when his parents go to Baltimore for a funeral, gets
to stay with the neighboring Dabney family: father Vernon (Harvey
Keitel), mother Trixie (Andie MacDowell) and their brood of kids.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his visit, a 99-year-old ex-slave named Shadrach (John
Franklin Sawyer) wanders onto the property very near death. He
tells the Dabneys he once belonged to their ancestors and wants to
die on the old Dabney plantation _ an overgrown ruin some distance
away, which Vernon still owns, and where he makes his illegal
moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon packs up Paul, the ailing Shadrach and the whole Dabney
family and makes the journey to the old home. But complications
ensue when the county sheriff tells Vernon the law now forbids
burials on private property. Thus, he will have to hire an
undertaker and have Shadrach buried in an authorized graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dabneys have no money, this is a big problem _ and,
ultimately, a moral dilemma for Vernon. It's as if fate has
conspired to make him face up to the lingering evil of his
ancestor's slave-owning past _ even though his own poverty and
white-trash social status make him as much a victim of slavery as
Shadrach.
</P>
<P>
   As he struggles to sort out the mess, the film ingratiates
itself with an incorrigibly sweet spirit; some engaging, down-home
comic situations; and winning performances by Keitel as a
frustrated man in a strange conflict with his destiny, and
MacDowell as his beer-guzzling but ultra-patient, very controlled

   The downside is that director Styron never makes us ``feel'' the
important karmic kinship of Vernon and Shadrach, Vernon's moral
dilemma is resolved by a cop-out ending, and _ enjoyable as they
are in most of their scenes _ Keitel and MacDowell are never, for
one minute, believable as Depression-era Southern farmers.

   Shadrach. Directed by Susanna Styron. Written by Susanna Styron

`LOVE IS THE DEVIL' SHINES SPOTLIGHT ON DARK WORLD OF FRANCIS
BACON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a strong stomach to wade through the demonic dysphoria
of Francis Bacon's world. The British painter was lauded for his
excessive, even hellish, paintings of humanity. Few know that many
were modeled upon his longtime lover, a low-class ``rent boy'' and
thief named George Dyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon achieved fame in the '60s and '70s. He was heralded as the
greatest living painter by the French in 1971, but privately his
life was like ``a bomb exploding in reverse.'' A carouser, drinker,
wit and openly gay artist who suffered from painter's block,
Bacon's motto _ ``pleasure is impossible to define; horror is of
much the same nature'' _ extended to his claustrophobic, bloody,
hallucinogenic work, as well as his passion for rough trade and
rougher sex.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, brawny Dyer (Daniel Craig) fits the bill. But
Bacon's (Derek Jacobi) razor tongue soon slashes Dyer to bloody
shreds. He so eclipses his lover in both brains and talent that the
young man erodes into an obsessive mess of suicidal tendencies and
frightening dreams that foretell his own destruction. He relies
upon pills and booze to ease his growing fright and weariness with
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon calls him ``a compulsive joke which no one knew was
funny.'' But one night Dyer stops being a bad joke and becomes
Bacon's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   English director John Maybury began his career in music videos
and graduated to featurettes like ``Man to Man,'' which starred the
late Derek Jarman's favorite actor, Tilda Swinton. Maybury received
some of his film and art training from Jarman, and Jarman's
stylized, and very personal work, strongly influenced him. But
Maybury has surpassed his master with ``Love is the Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   The film certainly isn't a linear biography. It demands patience
because it's like reading excerpts from a naughty diary, written in
code. The real narrative flow is in the film's strong, gorgeous,
evocative visual rendering. It tells us tons about Bacon's art
(though his paintings were not allowed to be used in the film), as
well as the man himself. Better yet, it gives us a glimpse into the
macabre vision of Bacon and his tawdry fascination with the
grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Is the Devil'' is reminiscent of the Stephen Frears film,
``Prick Up Your Ears,'' which also was about a gay artist
(playwright Joe Orton) with a doomed lover. Yet, it's more
compelling because of its visual style and gritty realism.
Ultimately, this, plus the performances, make ``Love is the Devil''
more sympathetic and eerily moving.
</P>
<P>
   While Sir Derek Jacobi is riveting as Bacon, stage actor Daniel
Craig works miracles by supplying its heart and finding something
extraordinary in the very ordinary, sadly haunted, Dyer.
</P>
<P>
   Love is the Devil. Directed by John Maybury. Written by John
Maybury. Cast: Derek Jacobi, Daniel Craig, Tilda Swinton, Anne
Lambton. Strand Releasing. 90 minutes. Unrated, with nudity,
language.

 PREACHING TO THE CONVERTED 
 By JONATHAN LEAR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I find myself waiting for a New Yorker cocktail-party cartoon in
which the hostess says to a guest, ``Come meet Jason, he's the one
who hasn't written about the Lewinsky affair.'' Few events in
American history, at the time of their occurrences, have caused a
wider group of journalists, commentators, academics and politicians
to try to capture its significance. Indeed, part of what it is to
be a citizen today is to have had a conversation with one's
friends, colleagues and neighbors about what, in this whole mess,
matters. For though a federal judge said the Paula Jones lawsuit is
without merit, the case has functioned like the shot at Sarajevo in
1914: it brought to the cultural battlefield so many moral,
political, legal, sexual and esthetic issues that one has to
perform triage just to formulate a point of view.
</P>
<P>
   According to James Carville, ``it's the prosecutor, stupid!''
The fundamental evil is Kenneth W. Starr's abuse of a bad law to
subvert our democratic institutions and upend a presidential
election. ``...And the Horse He Rode In On'' doesn't pretend to be
anything other than it is: a full-throttle partisan critique, a
loud cry of ``foul play!'' For those who enjoy an occasional fix of
tabloid reading, this is what it would be like to read The New York
Post if it were owned by a billionaire Friend, rather than Enemy,
of Bill. Tabloid journalism tends, by its very nature, to preach to
the converted. But it tries to give them reasons for thinking that
their outlook is the right one. Since many Americans think that the
independent counsel exceeded his proper bounds, and many also
suspect that he has a vendetta on his mind, this is a piece of
tabloid writing for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Carvillean world looks something like this: First, there is
a right-wing conspiracy out to get Clinton. Among the most
prominent manifestations: Richard Mellon Scaife, the conservative
fourth-generation heir to a banking fortune, gave $1.7 million to
an ``Arkansas Project'' to dredge for dirt on President Clinton,
and actually ended up subsidizing scurrilous rumors. This money
found its way into the pockets of various unsavory characters,
among them David L. Hale, the only person willing to testify to
financial wrongdoing on Clinton's part in Whitewater. Another
manifestation: Judge David B. Sentelle conspired with Senators
Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth to remove Robert B. Fiske Jr. as
independent counsel and replace him with Kenneth W. Starr, a
right-wing Clinton-hater with blatant conflicts of interest willing
to take a poorly thought out statute to excess. After four years
and over $40 million, Carville notes, the only thing he produced
was a pornographic book and film with the president a reluctant
star. From bankruptcy to ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Carville argues, there has been a corrupt, and somewhat
unwitting, alliance between the press and the office of the
independent counsel. For the press, the ideal of Watergate
degenerated over a quarter-century into a competitive and
irresponsible scramble to uncover scandal. This led, in the first
instance, to confused reporting and the enhancement of rumors. More
important, Carville asserts, the press collaborated in trial by
leaks and rumors. To take one of the 24 examples he puts forward, a
``top official with the investigation'' told a journalist from The
New Yorker there was a 50-50 chance that the First Lady would be
indicted; this bounced its way around the world, defaming Hillary
Rodham Clinton and leading to nothing, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Carville's central thesis is breathtakingly simple: Ken
Starr is a creep. Carville begins with an unsettling vignette. In
October 1993, before he was appointed independent counsel, Starr,
then a perfect stranger, approached Carville (who is still an
adviser to Clinton) at Washington National Airport and started
haranguing him. ``Your boy's getting rolled,'' he said. Carville
buttresses his litany with the familiar and the less so, including
agents of Starr's office going to subpoena the 16-year-old son of a
Whitewater defendant at his school.
</P>
<P>
   Carville writes with the voice of Huckleberry Finn. Imagine that
Huck spent his early 20s on a plantation that Margaret Thatcher
bought for her retirement. She took him under her wing, and though
none of her views rubbed off on him, her in-your-face political
style did. ``I don't like Ken Starr,'' Carville says. ``I don't
like one damn thing about him.'' This book makes virtually no
mention of the many legitimate grounds for complaint one might have
about Clinton's behavior; it makes no mention of mitigating
circumstances or alternative explanations of Starr's methods.
Nevertheless, by the end of the book, I was convinced that there is
one certain good that has emerged from the Lewinsky affair: Kenneth
Starr will never serve on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, David Maraniss's book, ``The Clinton Enigma,'' does
pretend to be something it is not. The subtitle suggests
intriguingly that ``A Four-and-a-Half-Minute Speech Reveals This
President's Entire Life.'' Perhaps the president's Aug. 17 speech
does, but you won't find that out in this book. Indeed, the
strategy Maraniss uses is almost precisely the reverse: as
Clinton's biographer, he uses what he knows about Clinton's life
and personality to try to illuminate the speech. But even read that
way, the book is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about the narrative is how staged it is. It
begins with Maraniss placing himself at the edge of the drama: ``I
suppose it had to come to this, I thought to myself as I sat in the
darkness of the NBC studio.'' And on to Chapter 2: ``Memories of
other encounters with Clinton came back to me as I waited in the
studio for him to deliver his fateful speech.'' What an
accommodating inner life Maraniss has, flowing along in just the
right way to begin his next book. I was reminded of a B movie in
which a reporter is waiting in the audience, the camera closes in
on his head, on his eye, and suddenly you are inside a flashback.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-CLINTON-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; (UNDATED: flashback.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the argument that it is somehow psychologically
revealing that Clinton ducked being interviewed by Maraniss. After
his biography, ``First in His Class,'' came out, Maraniss had heard
that Clinton ``hated the half of it that was critical of him and
that had revealed the patterns of his duplicity.'' Dick Morris told
him that ``the few portions of the book that examined his sex life
upset the First Lady so much that she had turned 'frosty' on the
President for several weeks.'' Yet it strikes Maraniss as
``peculiar'' that Clinton doesn't want to see him. After all, his
account was ``mild'' compared with some of the salacious stories
being printed and, anyway, ``Mrs. Clinton had been dealing with her
husband's waywardness for more than two decades -- why would my
book trigger such a fierce reaction?'' Is this a man you want to
turn to for psychological insight? (As for the ``fierce reaction,''
it seems just a simple interview-evasion technique, straight out of
Political Survival 101.)
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss is hurt that Clinton won't see him. In a ``final
memory,'' Clinton does come up to Maraniss to congratulate him on
winning an award and has little more to say than ``nice tie.''
Later, when George Stephanopoulos tells him the obscenity ``nice
tie'' is code for, Maraniss doesn't pause to wonder what
Stephanopoulos is doing; he simply joins the club of rejected,
angry men impelled to write about their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   When we purportedly get to the speech, in Chapter 5, what we
really get is a rambling association of family-history cliches and
psychobabble: ``For every shadow of darkness in Hot Springs, there
was a corresponding ray of light''; ``The men had a way of
compartmentalizing their lives''; ``Clinton's tendency toward
denial''; ``He might have a sexual addiction''; ``There is ample
evidence of powerful men whose political ambitions seemed matched
only by their sexual appetites''; ``Hillary's role as defender and
perhaps enabler''; ``his razor-sharp ambition''; ``The need to
rationalize was always there with Clinton,'' and so on. The
banality comes to feel like an assault. The only moment of relief
comes toward the end of the book, when, trying to explain the deep
animosity some people have for Clinton, Maraniss says, ``My answers
have never fully satisfied me.''

  The Secret Case Against Bill Gates 
 By Wendy Goldman Rohm 
 Illustrated. 313 pp. New York: Times Business/Random House. $25.95 
 ------ 
 THEY DO WINDOWS 
 By JOHN MARKOFF 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Bill Gates. Not so long ago, the world's richest man was
almost universally acclaimed as a computer hacker turned
information-age visionary. But now that image is coming under
increasing attack. The comparisons are no longer to contemporaries
like Steven P. Jobs but to John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   In the revised view of Gates and his empire, the Microsoft
Corporation's business practices are predicated not on innovation
but on the leverage the company maintains through its control of
the Windows operating system, the software that serves as the
traffic cop for the overwhelming majority of the world's personal
computers. A growing chorus of critics asserts that the operating
system has given Microsoft extraordinary power over its
competitors. The blame is placed squarely on Gates's shoulders for
creating a corporate culture that has systematically imitated
technological innovation and then destroyed industry pioneers with
slash-and-burn business dealings. The critics say that by
arbitrarily redefining what is part of the operating system, by
tying new services and software applications to the program and by
attempting to extend Windows into new markets like cable
television, Microsoft has violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The darker side of Gates and Microsoft is explored in ``The
Microsoft File,'' by Wendy Goldman Rohm, who has reported on the
computer industry for many years. She sets out to draw an
unflattering portrait of Gates and his company based in part on
documents from the antitrust suits that are now swirling around
Microsoft. To her credit, she has unearthed new documents and
incidents, largely dating back to the early 1990's, when Microsoft
was concerned about a competing operating system, DR-DOS, designed
by Digital Research.
</P>
<P>
   There are intriguing parallels in the tactics she describes that
appear to foreshadow events in the more recent war between
Microsoft and the Netscape Communi ncations Corporation. In both
cases, Microsoft was threatened by a company that attacked its
operating-system monopoly. In each case, Microsoft used its
licensing power over personal computer makers to freeze out a
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, for example, Vobis Microcomputer was a major
personal computer maker that in the early 1990's sold its machines
with DR-DOS rather than Microsoft's MS-DOS. According to Rohm,
Microsoft first undercut the DR-DOS price and then insisted that
Vobis sign a per-processor licensing agreement. By linking its
operating-systems license to the availability of its Word and Excel
word-processing and spreadsheet programs, Microsoft's German sales
manager was able to persuade Vobis to stop offering DR-DOS.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, years later Microsoft sent a letter to the Compaq
Computer Corporation threatening to end its license for Windows if
it continued to include Netscape's Navigator Web browser. It was
that action that led Netscape's president, James Barksdale, to
approach the Justice Department about antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   But while ``The Microsoft File'' uncovers previously unknown
though largely dated evidence documenting Microsoft's predatory
business practices, the book fails in its broader attempt to take
the reader inside Gates's mind. Hanging much of the narrative on a
romantic triangle involving a former female Microsoft executive,
Gates and his head attorney, William Neukom, Rohm attempts to tell
us what Gates was thinking. It doesn't work. The reader is given no
hint of how Rohm, who apparently spent no time interviewing Gates
about personal subjects, would have found out about such details.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the stories may have emerged from pillow
talk by participants that she hints she has had access to. But if
that is the case, why revert to more perfunctory attribution with
the standard ``according to an insider present at the time''?
Unfortunately, what the reader is left with is a one-dimensional
picture of the man who has defined the industry for more than two
decades.

SWEET CHARITY?
</HEADLINE>
  Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement 
 By Janet Poppendieck 
 354 pp. New York: Viking. $26.95 
 ------ 
 SPARE A DIME? 
 By DANA MILBANK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each Wednesday morning I get up early to volunteer at a local
soup kitchen. I pour the juice, clean the tables and, with a bit of
luck, get to scramble the eggs or stir the oatmeal. I often wonder
whether it does much good. The place is not terribly efficient, and
it has more volunteers than it can use. But, hey, I'm trying. It
eases the guilt when I pass a panhandler on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, comes Janet Poppendieck, a sociology professor at
Hunter College, to say that I am part of the problem. As a
volunteer, I have unwittingly joined a nefarious plot to undermine
and replace the government safety net with an inadequate private
network of food pantries and soup kitchens. ``The proliferation of
charity contributes to our society's failure to grapple in
meaningful ways with poverty,'' Poppendieck says in her book,
``Sweet Charity?'' Soup kitchens have created a moral safety valve
that lets government off the hook for the nation's poor, writes
Poppendieck, who sees a right-wing conspiracy that uses soup
kitchens and food pantries to justify destroying the welfare
system: ``In short, by engaging the contributions of millions of
donors and volunteers, emergency food has 'proven' the conservative
contention that voluntary sector programs are 'cheaper' than public
sector efforts.'' Feeding programs meant by their organizers to
offset the decline of public benefits are being used instead to
justify further cuts.
</P>
<P>
   This raises an important point that Congress, which overhauled
the welfare system in 1996, still has not addressed. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other proponents of that reform hope the
legislation will spark a charitable revival, because nonprofit
organizations, Gingrich says, get more done at less cost. That's
true enough, but the nation's charities simply aren't big or strong
enough to take on the role supporters of the welfare reform measure
want for them. The government, by some estimates, spends 10 times
as much as charities spend on the poor, and charities get about a
quarter of their own funds from the government. Churches and other
charities would need to double or even triple their budgets just to
offset the cuts that are allowed under the welfare reform law. And
Americans, who give under 2 percent of their income to charity,
clearly aren't going to pick up the slack on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Poppendieck sullies this timely argument by
pairing it with an unworkable solution. She wants the government to
raise taxes, spend more money and rebuild a welfare state. And she
wants charities to spend less time being charitable and more time
lobbying the government to put them out of business. The act of
feeding the hungry, she says, ``could probably be accomplished far
more simply by raising the food stamp allotment, or the minimum
wage.'' Volunteers, in essence, should drop their oatmeal ladles
and call their representatives. ``Because food programs are
logistically demanding, their maintenance absorbs the attention and
energy of many of the people most concerned about the poor,
distracting them from the larger issues of distributional
politics,'' she writes. Her argument amounts to cursing the
darkness instead of lighting a candle -- or, more accurately,
lobbying Congress about the darkness so the government can turn on
the lights.
</P>
<P>
   We have been down this road before. Poppendieck, admirably,
wants to ``unite and integrate people'' instead of ``separating and
segregating them.'' But the very government programs Poppendieck
wishes to revive with vast new financing have proved powerless to
stop increases in inequality. Worse, they have encouraged
dependency and the sort of permanent, segregated underclass that
she rightfully deplores. Poppendieck herself notes that inequality
has grown to its worst in half a century -- this despite all the
government's poverty programs. The debate has moved from cash
handouts to jobs and ways to help the poor help themselves. But
Poppendieck takes us through a time warp back to the rhetoric of
the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   She began her project seven years ago, and changing times have
made holes in her argument. We hear about how rampant unemployment
spurs demand for emergency food. ``Our overall rate in the United
States averaged 4.6 percent in the 1968-73 period and 7.2 percent
in the 1980-89 period,'' she writes. Fine, but this is 1998, and
the latest jobless figures are at 4.6 percent, yet demand for
emergency food continues to soar. Indeed, Poppendieck barely
mentions some of the most significant reasons people land in soup
kitchens: mental illness and drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Charity?'' is far more convincing as a sociological
study than as a political action plan. Author of ``Breadlines Knee
Deep in Wheat: Food Assistance in the Great Depression'' (1986),
Poppendieck tells the interesting story of the rise of emergency
food distributed through food pantries as groceries and through
soup kitchens as meals. Their rise began in the early 1980's when
the federal government, sitting on vast surpluses of dairy
products, began a cheese give-away, thus creating a need for the
pantries and kitchens to distribute the food. This became
institutionalized in 1983 when Congress created the Temporary
Emergency Food Assistance Program, which was not, as it turns out,
temporary. The increased supply fed the demand, and everyone --
corporations, politicians, celebrities -- had selfish motives to
continue the program. Eventually, the program switched from being a
temporary surplus disposal program to a permanent food procurement
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Charity?'' demonstrates, convincingly, that the growing
emphasis on emergency food for the hungry is a Band-Aid that
distracts from the fundamental goal of solving poverty. But it does
not entertain the idea that charitable work is as much a part of
the solution as government intervention. Poppendieck rightly senses
reluctance among charities and volunteers to turn themselves into
lobbyists, as she proposes. ``Volunteers are often less
enthusiastic about advocacy than about direct service,'' she
writes. ``Preparing a meal with a group of other people and serving
it is fun; writing to your representative is work.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe these volunteers believe that the government is not the
only answer. Indeed, many charities are working on substantive
solutions to poverty, though the notion gets scant mention in the
book. Many soup kitchens, including the one at which I volunteer,
offer a whole range of rehabilitative services: job search
programs, job training, alcohol and drug treatment, care for the
mentally ill, community organizing. Government, of course, must do
its part. It cannot abandon its responsibility for the poor. But,
rather than supplanting charities, government can --and should --
do more to strengthen them.
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas have already been floated. A group of lawmakers, for
example, is promoting a charity tax credit that would give each
taxpayer a $500 credit for donations to charities dealing with the
poor; this would bring billions to nonprofits. The states, under
the new welfare law, are also boosting charities in new ways. In
Michigan, for example, the state has financed a group of churches
that offer mentoring for welfare recipients, providing help with
child care, car payments and groceries. But the church volunteers
also offer friendship and encouragement to build self-esteem. That
is the sort of thing the government cannot provide -- at any price.

   Michael Massing has been writing about drug issues in the United
States for a decade. He believes the central problem to be the
hard-core users of heroin and cocaine, who are ``disproportionately
poor, unemployed and members of minority groups.'' Although
hard-core users are only a fifth of total users, they consume
three-fourths of the cocaine and heroin used in this country and
are responsible for most of the pathological behavior that elicits
public and governmental responses. If we could provide appropriate
treatment to anyone in this population who wanted it, Massing
maintains, the whole drug problem would diminish, as would the
illness and crime associated with it. The result of Massing's
investigation is ``The Fix,'' a balanced and significant analysis
of the American drug problem that carries specific, practical
recommendations for reform.
</P>
<P>
   He separates himself from the ``legalization/harm-reduction
camp'' that asserts that drug-related diseases and social pathology
are the fault of drug-control laws themselves. Having spent long
periods observing drug treatment centers, roaming the streets of
Harlem and hanging out with drug users, he has experienced a
``real-life rebuttal to the rosy accounts of addiction offered by
the revisionists.'' Regardless of the drug laws, addiction and drug
use create terrible conditions: child abuse reports in New York
rose from 36,000 in 1985 to 59,000 in 1989 when the crack epidemic
hit the city. Massing's approach contrasts with recent books like
Mike Gray's ``Drug Crazy,'' which calls for a radical revision of
our drug laws. Gray describes a golden age of drug use prior to the
Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, when ``the country had looked upon
addicts as unfortunate citizens with a medical problem.'' To right
current wrongs, he recommends that we put the provision of drugs
``back in the hands of doctors and pharmacists.''
</P>
<P>
   Massing also distances his position from apostles of draconian
penalties and those who put their faith in interdiction. His middle
way has one clear emphasis, and that is comprehensive treatment. He
knows this would work because we had such a program once; it
succeeded wonderfully, but we let it slip away. We were therefore
unable to mount a powerful defense against cocaine and crack in the
mid-1980's, and now we have 10 times as many hard-core users as we
faced during the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's strategy aimed directly at reducing crime in
anticipation of the 1972 election. Treatment was part of a broad
program that included foreign policy to shut down the
Turkish-French connection; the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement
to attack street crime; the Internal Revenue Service to go after
illicit profits. That crime reduction held first place among
Nixon's priorities -- not the care of addicts -- is illustrated by
the administration's surprising willingness to adopt methadone, a
synthetic opiate, as its preferred treatment for heroin users. At
the time, a high-ranking official in the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs told me that the bureau would hand out heroin if it
thought that would cut crime. This attitude was surprising because
the substitution of one addiction by another contradicted the
previously adamant stand by Nixon's adherents against any drug use.
</P>
<P>
   How did Nixon come to approve the financing of methadone
treatment for tens of thousands of addicts? Massing draws on
interviews with key actors and internal government documents to
provide an answer. The most persuasive element was the methadone
program developed in Washington by Robert DuPont, later the
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Heroin use was
skyrocketing; crime was rampant. In his 1968 campaign Nixon had
declared that ``D. C. should not stand for disorder and crime.''
Washington became the laboratory for national drug policies. In
1970 DuPont, with support from the White House, established the
Narcotics Treatment Administration, which was soon flooded with
applicants. Although nondrug treatment was also offered, methadone
appeared to cut the crime rate quickly, and that impressed the
President and his aides. By the 1972 election crime had fallen by
50 percent in the District of Columbia, an achievement that was
widely broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the methadone program was only one of the actions
taken to reduce crime in Washington. Even Egil Krogh, the Nixon
aide most responsible for creating the political will for this
ambitious national treatment program, did not know if the program
was responsible for the drop in crime, but he knew that from a
political perspective, ``it was a slam-dunk great success.''
</P>
<P>
   Massing has no doubts about the success of the treatment
program. His conviction comes from his encounter with Nixon's drug
expert, Jerome Jaffe, a psychopharmacologist and psychiatrist
plucked in 1970 from the University of Chicago, where he had
established a treatment program that employed a range of options,
including drug-free therapy. He was asked first to head a committee
of experts from outside the government to come up with a response
to drug addiction. His report was practical rather than theoretical
and named methadone as the best treatment for heroin addiction (the
major addiction at that time) and the best way to reduce crime.
Following the adoption of what was basically his proposal, Jaffe
entered government service.
</P>
<P>
   His first big administrative assignment was to deal with
addicted Army personnel coming back from Vietnam. This he did with
ingenuity and dispatch, and then began work as the ``drug czar,''
the first head of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Policy.
Jaffe was neither a good administrator nor an adept politician --
he was a scientist. Many of his psychiatric and scientific
colleagues distrusted him for working with Nixon. Some critics
lambasted him in the most vitriolic terms for advocating methadone;
they described the program as an enslavement of minorities. In
Massing he has found a vindicator.
</P>
<P>
   Massing advocates Jaffe's ``code,'' a set of principles that
summed up his approach to drug use: ``Chronic drug users are at the
heart of the nation's drug problem; a diverse array of services is
required; government must assure their availability and efficacy;
law enforcement is an adjunct to rehabilitation and, always,
reducing demand for drugs through education and treatment must take
precedence over law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of
drugs. Massing says the Nixon administration, following the Jaffe
prescription, managed to bring a ``serious heroin epidemic'' under
control ``in a few short years.''
</P>
<P>
   Massing recommends setting up an organization like the Special
Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention that would engage only in
reducing demand for illicit drugs, to be headed by a ``C. Everett
Koop-type figure'' and backed in the White House by a facsimile of
Egil Krogh -- that is, a high-ranking White House official whose
special province would be drug abuse. A comprehensive national
treatment program for drug and alcohol abuse should be established.
In Massing's view, the most unfortunate mistake in the recent
history of drug programs was the government's shift of emphasis
from heroin to marijuana, in response to increased complaints by
parents, during the latter half of the Carter administration.
Treatment for the hard core shriveled. During the Reagan
administration the amount spent for treatment in real dollars fell
to less than a quarter of what had been provided in the Nixon
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Massing's powerful arguments for more treatment programs,
especially methadone, must be put into a larger historical context.
The 1970's witnessed the climax of a long-simmering reaction
against law enforcement as the chief tool against drug abuse. That
era of toleration, however, peaked about 1980, and since then we
have been on a slope leading toward intolerance of drug use. Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani's attack on methadone maintenance is a recent
example of opposition to any drug use by former users. As valuable
as methadone may be for some (and I believe it can be helpful), it
is an uphill battle to justify it to those who have zero tolerance
for drugs. Can a national policy that was feasible in 1970 be
resurrected three decades later in a less friendly climate?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remarkable claims for treatment in the early 1970s must
be tempered by the knowledge that most people in trouble with drugs
were taking heroin, for which methadone is a stabilizing
replacement. Today, cocaine users are the vast majority of the
hard-core population, a problem for which methadone is useless.
Massing's recommendations are too valuable to be oversold.

THE LOST TOMB
</HEADLINE>
  By Kent R. Weeks 
 Illustrated. 330 pp. New York: William Morrow &AMP; Company. $27.50

 SPLENDID DIGS 
 By JOHN RAY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time there were two brothers. Contrary to the usual
pattern, the younger, whose name was Decimus Burton, worked hard
for a living and went on to be a distinguished architect. The
elder, James, was a wastrel. A Cambridge graduate, he turned up in
Egypt looking for coal mines, but he soon found more interesting
things. In the slave market in Cairo he acquired a Greek woman,
whom he later married, and in 1835 he returned to England with an
entourage consisting of his wife, other redeemed slaves and a
troupe of performing animals. These were not the virtues that had
triumphed at Waterloo, and his father disowned him. Not that this
deterred James; he simply sold his large collection of Pharaonic
antiquities and lived well enough off the proceeds until his death
at 73.
</P>
<P>
   In 1825, James Burton had found himself in the Valley of the
Kings, which was then scarcely explored. At some point he decided
to rummage inside a tomb near the entrance to the valley. It was in
a very poor state, and so dangerous that further exploration seemed
pointless. Burton drew a quick sketch plan, and left his name in
lampblack on the ceiling of the main chamber. There were other
things for him to do in the valley. The sketch of the tomb, which
is now known as KV 5, passed together with the rest of his papers
to the British Museum. These papers have scarcely been studied,
even by other Egyptologists.
</P>
<P>
   With the confidence of hindsight we can say that Burton's quick
map, incomplete as it is, is enough to show that there is something
strange about KV 5. The entrance bears the name of Ramses II, a
character familiar to every visitor to Egypt, and one of the great
monomaniacs of history. One school of thought makes him the Pharaoh
of the Exodus, and his essential odiousness was captured by Yul
Brynner in the 1956 film ``The Ten Commandments.'' Perhaps KV 5 was
a false start by one of the Pharaoh's architects, something quite
likely in a reign devoted to ceaseless building and ever more
grandiose plans.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's strange tomb is now famous, so much so that it has been
given the indispensable feature of celebrity, its own Web site.
Since 1989 it has been partly explored and cleared by a team headed
by Kent R. Weeks, an Egyptologist with the American University in
Cairo, who gives us the story in ``The Lost Tomb.'' KV 5 is to the
ordinary tomb in the Valley of the Kings, like Tutankhamen's, what
a supermarket is to the corner shop. Unfortunately, it contains
hardly anything of its original contents, but at last count the
number of its chambers totaled 108, and there are certainly more to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside this tomb means coming to terms with rock falls,
malodorous dust and faulty electrical supplies. A modern sewage
pipe runs through part of it, and it leaks. But painstaking
clearance can recover things. One of the original decorators, in
about 1270 B.C., kicked over a dish of blue pigment in a dark
corner, perhaps at the end of a shift (ancient lamp wicks were
timed to last four hours). The paint was still there, after more
than 32 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It may never have been the tidiest tomb in the valley, but KV 5
was certainly the biggest. Little was known about it before Weeks
began his work, though the Egyptologist Elizabeth Thomas had
guessed that it could be the tomb of the royal children of Ramses
II, which is mentioned in an official report about tomb robberies
prepared by a commission of government inspectors a couple of
centuries after KV 5 was built. Another court transcript, written
about 50 years after the death of Ramses, describes how a workman
named Kenena, son of Ruta, was caught stripping stone from above
the tomb, either because he liked the stone in that particular spot
or because he was looking for a way in.
</P>
<P>
   KV 5 may have remained intact for centuries, but the eventual
breakdown of administration allowed a later generation of tomb
robbers to go about its work in peace. However, enough fragments of
inscriptions and broken statuettes remained to show that Elizabeth
Thomas was right. Ramses, like any Mafia boss, had great plans for
his family, and why should these plans not extend to the afterlife
as well? His sons were going to join the gods. Ramses boasted about
50 sons, and there may have been others he did not boast about. The
seeds of future anarchy were already in place, in a country where
Ramses' monumental ambitions may well have helped to bankrupt the
government.
</P>
<P>
   He was succeeded by his 13th son, Merenptah, a 60-year-old of
proven mediocrity. The fourth son, on the other hand, was
Khaemwese, an intellectual who deserves to be known as the first
Egyptologist in history. His inscriptions show deep piety,
scholarship and an acute historical sense. Perhaps Khaemwese took
after his mother. Neither of these princes was buried in KV 5, but
others must have been. So far the names of four sons have been
found in the tomb, and four skulls have been identified. This is
presumably a coincidence, given the size of the monument and its
complexity. However, the chambers of KV 5 are on the small side for
conventional royal burials, and its true history is not yet clear.
Perhaps enough remains farther inside the tomb to fill out the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks tells his account readably, though at the expense of a
little repetition and loose organization. He is generous toward
colleagues, and he has an obvious affection for his Egyptian
workmen, together with the ordinary inhabitants of Luxor, whose
livelihoods in tourism have been damaged by recent terrorist
actions. This affection extends to their ancestors, whose lives as
masons, painters and quarrymen he is good at picturing.
</P>
<P>
   He seems sanguine in the face of a discovery that has
interrupted all his schedules and that promises decades of work to
come. He reconstructs Ramses' motive as an attempt to deify himself
in his own lifetime, an idea that involves him in resurrecting a
theory about the heretic Pharaoh Akhenaten occupying the throne at
the same time as his own father. Most Egyptologists had been hoping
that this theory was dead and gone, since it appears to raise more
problems than it solves. But we are still far from understanding
how ancient Egypt worked, and there is little doubt that KV 5 has
yet to tell us all its secrets.

 THE WANDERER
</HEADLINE>
 
 THE WHEREABOUTS OF ENEAS McNULTY 
 By Sebastian Barry 
 308 pp. New York: Viking. $23.95  By AOIBHEANN SWEENEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The happy childhood is hardly worth your while,'' Frank
McCourt writes in ``Angela's Ashes,'' his memoir of a miserable
Irish childhood, and it seems true enough. These days, nothing
really goes down without a good dose of irony. ``No happy
stories,'' a friend of mine tells his writing classes at the
beginning of each semester, and he means it. After all, who's going
to read them?
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Barry's novel ``The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty''
opens with an unabashedly joyous account of Eneas McNulty's
childhood in Sligo. It is full of ``the utter merriment of
mornings,'' ``gangs of wallflowers'' and a ``thrumming of crickets
to beat the band.'' Eneas has a Pappy who plays the piccolo and a
Mam who dances a jig by the hearth. Though misery closes in on
Eneas with satisfactory swiftness, Barry's sweet, lyrical pitch
never falters; the novel has a bold measure of old-fashioned
blessedness.
</P>
<P>
   The author of three collections of poems, three books of prose
and several plays about the history of Ireland (including ``The
Steward of Christendom''), Barry affords himself a little
sentimentality by assiduously pinning his hero's fate to its
historical context. The opening of the book describes Ireland's
childhood as well as Eneas's: these are the days just before ``your
man Pearse and the rest'' make history with the Easter Rising --
Ireland has not yet seized independence.
</P>
<P>
   As Eneas reaches his 20's and World War I comes to an end, he
finds himself out of work among the returning veterans. In a muddle
of innocence and despair, ``Eneas looks at it all with simple eyes
and having no desire to loiter the rest of his days, joins at the
hint of his Pappy the Royal Irish Constabulary,'' the English-led
police force. ``Ferocious events are afoot in the sacred web of
fields and rainy towns'': Ireland has awakened, and as his father
gently puts it, ``It's a bad sort of time to have your head up, you
know, in any class of political matter.'' In his ``bright peaked
cap and shining boots,'' Eneas quickly ends up on the Irish
Republican Army's blacklist. His boyhood friend Jonno Lynch has
become one of the I.R.A.'s enforcers and delivers his death
sentence just as the Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed. Eneas flees the
Irish Free State to spend the rest of his days in fear and exile,
while Ireland spends the ensuing years in civil war and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Eneas is as long-suffering and piously devoted to his homeland
as his classical namesake, but unlike Virgil's hero, he is no
nation-builder. Though he ``weeps mightily'' at the sight of the
land whenever he dares return, his ``childhood singing in him,'' he
has nothing but scorn for the ``murdering likes'' of the
self-important men who are ``driving the pony and trap of
Ireland.'' In exile, ``fierce, close work'' becomes his only
directive. He humbly fishes, bearded and tired, the waters of
Greenland; he binds the vines of France with ``the same stooping,
the same peering and care''; he drives his spade into 200 miles of
Nigerian soil, digging a canal to bring water to the ``numbed
countryside'' of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what makes Eneas McNulty a hero is the very ``fire
of concern and regard'' that glows so cozily in the hearth of his
youth. Barry vividly creates Eneas's warm humanity. Whether he is
standing deaf on the beaches of Dunkirk, watching the moon
``blowing like a flag'' or sitting up ``in the ragged dark''
listening to his friend Harcourt ``breathing lightly in the mercy
of sleep,'' Eneas's tenderness is powerfully apparent and casts a
gentle, clarifying light on the hardship around him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is easy to find virtue in a lonely man, much the way
it might be to find joy in childhood -- but in the murk of war it
seems all the more necessary to do so. Eneas McNulty's happy
childhood provides a momentary glimpse at the stark, troubling
contours of Ireland's somber history.

 THE BOYS: 
 The Untold Story of 732 Young Concentration Camp Survivors 
 By Martin Gilbert. Owl/Holt, $16.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A seasoned custodian of the memory of the Holocaust puts a human
face on the catastrophe by letting a remarkable group of mostly
Polish Jews recall their childhood ordeals. Last year our reviewer,
Michael R. Marrus, called this a ``remarkable volume . . . about
survival and painful, vivid, individual memories of surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BELIEVERS: &QL; 
 &UR; A Novella and Stories &QL; 
 &UR; By Charles Baxter &QL; 
 &UR; Vintage Contemporaries, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These psychologically dense tales track the unpredictable
destinies of ordinary Midwesterners, often focusing on the internal
struggle between the forces of love and violence. ``It's the
eloquence of the language -- the quirky intelligence, the humor,
the lively rhythmic assurance of sentences and paragraphs -- along
with the surprising plots, that makes these stories such a pleasure
to read,'' Francine Prose said here last year. The same publisher
has reissued an earlier collection by the author,  &UR; ``Through the
Safety Net: Stories'' &LR;  ($13), which features many middle-class
characters estranged from life -- a couple paralyzed by the death
of their child, for example, or a perpetual graduate student dazed
by the real world. In 1985 in the Book Review, Ron Hansen called
these 11 stories ``original, gracefully written, always moving,
frequently funny and -- that rarest of compliments -- wise.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEARER, MY GOD: &QL; 
 &UR; An Autobiography of Faith &QL; 
 &UR; By William F. Buckley Jr. &QL; 
 &UR; Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The author may be an imposing public intellectual but he's also
a devout Christian, and this unusually personal essay is both a
celebration of his lifelong Roman Catholicism and a doctrinal
apologia for the church. ``It is certain to provide many insights
into the mind of a polished writer . . . and it will do much to
explain how the hopefully changeless faith of a Catholic jibes with
the politics of a late-20th-century American political
conservative,'' William R. Everdell wrote here in 1997. In
 &UR; ``Living Faith,'' &LR;  by Jimmy Carter (Times Books/Random House, $13),
the former president laces his spiritual self-portrait with poems,
Scripture and frank revelations about his personal and political
lives. The book, which includes a new preface by Carter, is ``an
appealing, straightforward account of a life marked, as many are,
by unexpected successes and crushing failures,'' Michael Wright
said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LUCKY YOU &QL; 
 &UR; By Carl Hiaasen &QL; 
 &UR; Warner Vision, $7.50 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JoLayne Lucks doesn't have much good fortune in the romance
department, but things look up when she wins half of a $28 million
prize in the Florida lottery: the trouble is, the other winners are
two dirtball white supremacists who aim to rip her off. ``Hiaasen
writes witty dialogue that crackles, and his characters are
eccentrically colorful,'' Charles Salzberg said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Goldwyn: A Biography &QL; 
 &UR; By A. Scott Berg &QL; 
 &UR; Riverhead, $16 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The legendary mogul who set Hollywood in motion was an inspired
ruffian whose outsize ambitions and appetites make for terrific
reading. ``This story of a grabby but imaginative man would make a
more telling movie about America . . . than Goldwyn ever produced
himself,'' Mordecai Richler wrote here in 1989. On a smaller stage,
 &UR; ``How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a
Dime,'' &LR;  by Roger Corman with Jim Jerome (Da Capo, $14.95),
explains how the schlockmeister responsible for fare like ``Bloody
Mama'' was able to become a major independent force in filmmaking
while running an absurdly tight ship. ``Corman comes across as
likable, admirable and, in his ability to survive in Hollywood with
his integrity intact, even awe-inspiring,'' Barry Gewen wrote here
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BYRNE &QL; 
 &UR; By Anthony Burgess &QL; 
 &UR; Carroll &AMP; Graf, $10.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The author's final novel is an audacious hybrid even for a
lifelong experimentalist: the story of a minor modern composer
whose real skills are in the bedroom unfolds in novelistic fashion
but entirely in rhymed verse. Last year our reviewer, Dana Gioia,
called this ``genuinely astonishing -- a complex dark comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PLATYPUS AND THE MERMAID: &QL; 
 &UR; And Other Figments of the Classifying Imagination &QL; 
 &UR; By Harriet Ritvo &QR; 
 &UR; Harvard University, $15.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A history professor chronicles the Victorian obsession with
classifying and categorizing God's creatures, particularly as they
relate to man and the dinner table. Last year in the Book Review,
Stefan Collini called this an ``entertaining and informative tour
of both the highroads and the hedgerows of natural history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TEEN ANGEL: &QL; 
 &UR; And Other Stories of Wayward Love &QL; 
 &UR; By Marianne Gingher &QL; 
 &UR; Zuckerman Cannon, $14 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The adolescent characters who populate these inventive tales
somehow manage to be both quirky and down to earth despite the
broken adult relationships around them. ``Gingher possesses a
stylistic deftness and a flair for comic detail,'' W. L. Taitte
said here in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT &QL; 
 &UR; By Ann Patchett &QL; 
 &UR; Harvest, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a gay Los Angeles magician named Parsifal dies suddenly, he
leaves behind his heartbroken assistant, Sabine, and a secret past
that leads her to Nebraska and a family she never knew he had. Last
year our reviewer, Suzanne Berne, called the author ``an adroit,
graceful writer.''

MY YEAR OFF

 COMMOTION IN THE BRAIN 
 By ABRAHAM VERGHESE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a trick to ordinary living that has to do with pushing
far from the mind all thoughts of the maladies that befall hundreds
of people every day. Resolutely, we ignore newspaper headlines that
remind us of the dangers lurking in the workplace, on the freeway
and even (thanks to radon) in the basement. And we ignore the
annoying paradox that when we are having the most fun we are often
doing things that might be bad for us.
</P>
<P>
   This is why illness comes most often as a shock, as if the veil
has been stripped away to show us how vulnerable we really are.
Coleridge noted that it is the convalescent who sees the world in
its true colors. Indeed, illness has stimulated many a writer to
look back: one thinks immediately of Harold Brodkey's AIDS memoir,
``This Wild Darkness: The Story of My Death,'' and Anatole
Broyard's ``Intoxicated by My Illness.'' What makes Robert McCrum's
story distinctive is that the stroke that felled him affected the
very part of the body that must recall the illness and find the
language to describe what happened, even as language and speech
themselves are disrupted. This quality of the brain observing
itself is what gives ``My Year Off'' its particular poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   When his stroke occurred, Robert McCrum was just 42 years old;
he was the editor in chief of Faber &AMP; Faber, the London publishing
house, and also an acclaimed writer. He had been married a mere two
months (to Sarah Lyall, a journalist who writes for The New York
Times) when he awoke one morning unable to get out of bed. His wife
was away in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to drive to Cambridge that morning to visit my
parents. So, time to get up. But there it was -- I could not move.
More accurately, I could not move my left side. Overnight, my body
had become a dead weight.'' In attempting to get off the bed, he
fell to the floor and then half-fell, half-crawled down the stairs.
It took him all day, slipping in and out of consciousness, to get
to the downstairs phone and make the call for help. At the
hospital, it was clear that he had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage,
for which no obvious cause (such as raised blood pressure or an
aneurysm) was apparent.
</P>
<P>
   During his convalescence, McCrum found ``the enforced leisure
and opportunity to explore myself, to analyze what made me tick and
to discover what mattered to me. Alone in my room, with only my
right arm functioning properly (my right leg, though intact, was of
no real use to me in this state), and with the demons of physical
exhaustion constantly at hand, I began to keep a diary.'' His wife
also kept one, and excerpts from both serve to reconstruct much of
what patient and spouse were feeling and thinking during these
difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two weeks after his stroke, McCrum copied out a passage
from Marcus Aurelius' ``Meditations'': ``In the life of a man, his
time is but a moment, his being an incessant flux, his senses a dim
rushlight, his body a prey of worms, his soul an unquiet eddy, his
fortune dark and his fame doubtful. In short, all that is of the
body is as coursing waters, all that is of the soul as dreams and
vapors; life a warfare, a brief sojourning in an alien land; and
after repute, oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrum tells us that he ``read this through a veil of tears with
a shock of recognition, as if spoken to across a vast abyss of time
and history.'' A few days later, his wife wrote: ``Everyone keeps
asking me if he is going through personality changes. Quite a scary
question, because the truth is I'm not sure: is he impatient and
peremptory because of the combination of his normal self (before I
came along) and the frustration of his condition, or because of a
neurological problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Once the life-threatening possibility of a fresh stroke
subsided; McCrum's efforts revolved around rehabilitation, trying
to restore function to his paralyzed left arm and leg. Six weeks
after the stroke, ``when Sarah was taking off my socks in the
evening, we suddenly saw independent movement. There they were --
my left toes moving! It was like finding life on Mars.'' McCrum's
recovery was arduous, painful and complicated by depression, shame
and self-doubt. But gradually he learned to walk again, his speech
returned to almost normal and by the end of the book, a year and a
half after his stroke, he and his wife celebrated the arrival of a
baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
   With its lucid, heartfelt prose, ``My Year Off'' gives voice to
the millions of people who suffer from strokes, a quarter of whom
are under the age of 65 and most of whom have some residual
weakness or dysfunction for the rest of their lives. More
important, this book is a testament to the parallel trials and the
courage of the family members of stroke victims.
</P>
<P>
   It is human nature to want to seek both causation (beyond the
obvious anatomical one) and meaning for an illness. McCrum believes
his stroke came about because ``I'd reached a point in my
professional life when I could almost literally not see my way
forward. So it came as a physical punctuation mark, a reminder from
my body to pause and to take stock. What I needed was a season of
vulnerability. In the language of psychobabble, I needed to get in
touch with myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   The meaning McCrum finds in his ordeal is astonishingly similar
to what others who suffer a catastrophic illness also discover: ``I
have learned, in short, that I am not immortal (the fantasy of
youth) and yet, strangely, in the process I have been renewed in my
understanding of family and, finally, of the only thing that really
matters: love.''

THE HUNDRED DAYS
</HEADLINE>
  By Patrick O'Brian 
 281 pp. New York: W. W. Norton &AMP; Company. $24 
 ------ 
 NAVAL GAZING 
 By PAUL KENNEDY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the early spring of 1815, and two elderly English naval
lieutenants are high up on the southern slopes of Gibraltar,
observing and commenting on a squadron of Royal Navy vessels under
Commodore Jack Aubrey coming steadily closer to the harbor:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderfully beautiful day, with a slight and varying
but reasonably favorable breeze at last: the sun blazed on the
various kinds of broom in flower, upon the Rock, upon the cistuses
and giant heath, while an uninterrupted stream of migrant birds,
honey buzzards, black kites, all the European vultures, storks both
black and white, bee eaters, hoopoes and countless hirundines
flowed across the sky amidst a general indifference; for all eyes
were fixed upon the middle distance, where the squadron had come
about on the starboard tack.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins the 19th of what are now popularly referred to as
the Aubrey-Maturin novels, about naval warfare, by Patrick O'Brian.
They are part of that genre of naval historical fiction that
stretches back to Frederick Marryat and C. S. Forester and reaches
forward to such contemporaries of O'Brian as Alexander Fullerton
and Alexander Kent -- a genre that seems to be booming in recent
years, and capturing male and female readers alike.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a reading of only the first few pages of any book in
the Aubrey-Maturin series would tell the readers that they were
being presented with something different from, and more than,
fictional accounts of naval actions and storms at sea. Battles
there are aplenty, and O'Brian matches Forester in the excitement,
detail and bloody realism of his reconstructions. But these naval
tales are blended into a larger panorama of Georgian society and
politics, science, medicine, botany and the whole conspectus of
contemporary Enlightenment knowledge about the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider simply the above quotation, taken from the second
paragraph of ``The Hundred Days.'' The overall scene is about
British warships coming into Gibraltar; but only O'Brian among the
naval writers would think to slip into that long sentence on the
migrating birds, and detail specific types. How many other naval
authors, one wonders, would actually have known that the Strait of
Gibraltar is one of the great crossing points for the northward and
southward avian migrations, or even cared? By contrast, O'Brian's
works abound with captivating descriptions of fauna and flora all
over the globe, of classical concerts (with a Locatelli or Haydn
piece being expertly described), of gossip about the changing fate
of the Whigs and Tories at Westminster, all forming a rich and
varied complement to sections about naval rigging and life below
deck.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian's brilliant device for making his works into more than
naval history is, of course, his invention of dual heroes, the
bluff and ultracompetent Aubrey being always accompanied by his
eccentric ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin -- a naval surgeon, yes,
but also a highly regarded British intelligence agent, a former
Irish radical, a multilingual polymath, a natural philosopher with
a passion for beetles, sea creatures, birds and animals that often
tempts him to linger on strange shores when the impatient Aubrey is
urgent for the next battle. This character mix works so well, and
all is written so beautifully, that O'Brian's worldwide fans have
come to expect a new novel every year. ``The Hundred Days'' is this
season's offering, and there is no doubt the fans will like it.
</P>
<P>
   THE novel is set in the ``hundred days'' between Napoleon's
escape from Elba and his final defeat at Waterloo in mid-1815, and
our heroes must thwart dastardly efforts by Balkan mercenaries and
North African potentates to assist a Bonapartist victory. Naval
actions off the Adriatic coast, strenuous secret journeys into the
interior North African wastes by Maturin and a decisive battle to
seize a gold convoy attempting to run the Strait of Gibraltar are
typical high points of this tale, though always interspersed with
those special O'Brian features. As the creators of other paired
characters like Holmes and Watson or Spencer and Hawk long ago
discovered, once you have found a good fictional recipe, it doesn't
pay to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Is this, then, the end of the line for the O'Brian series?
Napoleon, against whom Aubrey and Maturin have waged an almost
personal battle through 19 works, is now en route -- on a Royal
Navy frigate -- to lasting exile on St. Helena; and the ``Great
War'' (as 19th-century Britons called it) is over. Yet, in the last
paragraph, as Aubrey's warship casts off from Gibraltar on its
passage home, he is urged to ``liberate Chile.'' Since the
real-life character whom it is thought Aubrey most resembles, the
great frigate captain Thomas Cochrane, left the Royal Navy in 1814
and went on to fight for Chile and Peru against Spanish rule in
South America, it seems a fair guess that our famous duo will
shortly reappear in that very hemisphere for further adventures.

 ------ 
 By JAMES HYNES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apart from scholars of Romanticism and students of genre
fiction, does anyone past the age of 18 ever read Mary Shelley's
``Frankenstein''? A number of books we read when we were young --
``The Lord of the Rings,'' ``The Red Badge of Courage'' -- have a
fighting chance of appealing when we're older, but ``Frankenstein''
is probably a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Let's face it: when
you're 11, ``Frankenstein'' is a disappointment. Even if a young
reader hasn't seen the 1931 James Whale film, the director's Gothic
imagery is deeply ingrained in our collective lizard brain. The
chief result of wading through Shelley's 19th-century prose in
one's youth is the sinking feeling of discovering that there's no
castle, no villagers with torches and pitchforks, no Igor. There
are no lightning rods or crackling sparks or humming machines; in
the novel, the creature's birth is treated offhandedly, in a
paragraph. And there's no Boris Karloff with neck bolts, lurching
gait and bad haircut; Shelley's monster is described only vaguely,
as huge, misshapen and hideous (the one consistency through all the
versions is Victor Frankenstein's clumsy workmanship).
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a shame, because, as this middle-aged reader is
happy to report, the novel ``Frankenstein'' is quite a read. It may
be the best prose work ever written by an 18-year-old. It's highly
Romantic, in the literary sense; there are pages of landscape
description, pages of passionate declarations and a good deal of
attractive torment and self-doubt, from both Victor Frankenstein
and his creation. In fact, the monster is a wonderfully appealing
character, likely to have a visceral appeal (so to speak) for an
adolescent: he's ungainly, misunderstood and often self-loathing.
He craves approval from others, hates the way he looks and thinks
all his problems would be solved if he only had a mate. In other
words, Frankenstein's monster is just another lonely teen-ager in
love.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading a youngster who's probably already reading Stephen
King or Anne Rice to give it a whirl, though, is still a problem.
The prose is very much of its period, and for a generation of
children who grow up watching Freddy Krueger, all of the offstage
murders here are going to seem a letdown. If ever a book needed to
be placed in context, it's ``Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Viking's handsome unabridged edition in their ``Whole Story''
series is an admirable solution. Based on a French edition by
Editions Gallimard, it features annotations and period artwork on
nearly every page, keyed to the text: when Victor is tried for
murder, the margins display pictures of late-18th-century
courtrooms, prisons and some very uncomfortable-looking iron
restraints. There are plenty of cultural references as well,
especially asides about Mary Shelley's family (husband Percy) and
the larger circle of Romantic poets (Coleridge and Wordsworth).
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, during the passages where not much is going on,
there are too many old paintings of Alpine glaciers, peasants in
colorful costumes and views of Lake Geneva from every imaginable
angle, but otherwise the annotations are always informative, and
often surprising and fun. There are also several two-page sidebars,
including one about the Romantics and the famous ghost story
competition that led to the novel, and another about the various
film versions, from Boris Karloff to Mel Brooks. Best of all,
though, are the finely detailed colored illustrations by Philippe
Munch. He is especially good at the large-scale illustrations of
landscape -- the Alpine mountain dells, the bleak Orkney Islands,
the Arctic desert -- that reinforce the impression that this novel
is best approached as an epic. My only quibble is the monster
himself; for a character regularly described as hideous, he's
awfully handsome, and often downright hunky.
</P>
<P>
   For younger readers, there is a new retelling of the story in
attractively cartoony pictures by the British artist Chris Mould,
who has written his own adaptation. Both Victor and the monster are
appealingly goofy, with bug eyes, long faces and prominent jaws.
There's a spirit of cheery, Halloweenish fun to the drawings,
dominated by autumnal orange or a deep, macabre green. Too much of
the story is crowded into the narration, with a number of moments
that might better have been dramatized -- the monster recoiling
from his own image in a pool, for example -- and one scene is
understandably softened for younger readers when the monster's
murder of a child is changed into an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But even Mould's chipper retelling achieves some of the pathos
of the novel's final pages, as Frankenstein and his monster head
for their ultimate encounter on the Arctic ice. His final picture
is haunting, as the creature, silhouetted against a blaze in the
midst of a frozen waste, reaches imploringly for the sky. It's an
image to send chills of terror and pity up the spine of any kid, no
matter how old he is.

   Before the glow of this year's slugfest completely fades, or
perhaps to burnish it during the off-season, here, told in lushly
romantic full-page paintings, mostly of the subject himself, and in
data-filled old-style bubble-gum baseball cards, is the story of
the Babe. His record of 60 home runs stood for 34 years.

   A full day of adventures for one little girl and her feet. From

   In the fifth in the popular ``notebooks,'' the adventurous

   Nell, who is 12, spends August in Modine, N.Y., a community that

   This lush, complex, nearly abstract setting of the well-known
hymn is something of a homage to the work of Paul Klee. It involves
a cat and some familiar creatures, including a squirrel, a rabbit
and a blue jay. It is perhaps most appealing to school-age children
who can hum the tune while puzzling out the illustrations.

   Sarah and her wicked red cat, Rotten Ralph, are back. In their
ninth adventure, Sarah is old enough to go to school, and Ralph is
so frantic about remaining her best friend that he goes too. His
extravagant naughtiness is so silly he's hardly bibliotherapeutic.
Of course a young reader doesn't need to be having trouble settling

   The author was born in Wenzhou, near the China coast, on Nov. 3,

   Percy's father is a civil engineer and his current floodgate
project involves taking the family to Venice for the summer. In the
most exotic and romantic of all Italian cities, the American

IN BRIEF: CHILDREN'S BOOKS 
 THE GINGERBREAD MAN
</HEADLINE>
  Retold by Jim Aylesworth 
 Illustrated by Barbara McClintock 
 Scholastic, $15.95 (All ages)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The anthropomorphizing of food has had a long history in
children's stories. Occasionally the food in question actually
wants to be eaten, and feels hurt when it/he/she is overlooked or
rejected by a hungry child, adult or animal. But usually _ and this
seems to make a lot more sense _ the food doesn't want to be eaten
but would rather be spared and allowed to live life fully, or at
least until spoilage sets in. The age-old tale of ``The Gingerbread
Man'' is of the latter variety. In Jim Aylesworth and Barbara
McClintock's extremely appealing version, a little old man and a
little old woman lovingly fashion a cookie and then bake it in the
oven, anticipating the gustatory pleasure that will soon be theirs.
But as soon as the oven door is opened, ``out popped the
Gingerbread Man, and he ran across the floor.'' And here the
excitement begins.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock's spirited, memorable illustrations feature fully
clothed animals and are greatly influenced, according to the
illustrator's note, by the 19th-century French illustrator
Grandville. But McClintock's depiction of the Gingerbread Man
himself feels contemporary, providing an interesting counterpoint
between the hero of the story and his adversaries. Children will
respond to the sassy, boastful facial expressions and exclamations
of the Gingerbread Man. (Actually, he bears a resemblance to the
Pillsbury Doughboy.) And they will quickly be drawn into the story,
familiar though it is, following the sure-footed cookie as he
confronts a variety of creatures who wish to gobble him up,
including a butcher, a cow, a sow and a fox. As the story proceeds
and tensions mount, Aylesworth's words demand to be read aloud in
an increasingly feverish, fast-paced manner. As if to emphasize
this to readers, the hero's final speech in the story is printed in
large type.
</P>
<P>
   As a character, the Gingerbread Man is full of himself and
immensely cocksure, and perhaps this is why children hardly ever
seem upset at his inevitable ``death'' at the end of the story. In
fact, children seem to understand that all cookies -- even those in
literature -- are meant to be eaten. With this in mind, a recipe
for gingerbread cookies appears on the back of the book jacket. _

   &UR; I DID IT, I'M SORRY &QL; 
 &UR; Written and illustrated by Caralyn Buehner and Mark Buehner &QL; 
 &UR; Dial, $15.99. (Ages 5 to 9) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Caralyn and Mark Buehner's 1995 book, ``It's a Spoon, Not a
Shovel,'' is an imaginative, involving picture book designed to
teach manners -- primarily table manners -- to young children. ``I
Did It, I'm Sorry'' is about ethics and is nearly identical in
format: an unruly cast of animal characters faces human choices; a
simple quiz with zany wrong answers follows each example; brightly
colored, somewhat outlandish illustrations depict the scenes; and
hidden animal figures and letters (denoting the correct answers to
the quiz questions) pose a challenge for young readers. But
although their new book bears a strong resemblance to ``It's a
Spoon, Not a Shovel,'' this time the Buehners seem to pitch both
the text and the illustrations to an older, more sophisticated
audience, and the result is a confused and sometimes troublesome
book. Pola Bear swears and tells dirty jokes. Sheila the sheep
fends off the peer pressure of her friends who are dyeing their
wool purple and sporting tattoos. More worrisome, three bored
camels, portrayed grotesquely in stylized fashion, search for fun,
and Cory the camel suggests, ``Let's stomp on that nomad, and chew
up his tent!'' The intended humor of some situations -- the McFly

   &UR; THE HATMAKER'S SIGN: &QL; 
 &UR; A Story by Benjamin Franklin &QL; 
 &UR; By Candace Fleming &QL; 
 &UR; Illustrated by Robert Andrew Parker &QL; 
 &UR; Orchard, $15.95 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   They're the last words any writer wants to hear: ``May I make a
suggestion?'' But you'll hear them a lot if you want to write,
because revision is part of the game, as Benjamin Franklin knew.
The Hatmaker's Sign: A Story by Benjamin Franklin (Orchard, $15.95;
ages 5 to 9) is a true tale of writerly frustration, written by
Candace Fleming and illustrated by Robert Andrew Parker. As the
story-within-a-story begins, it's July 1776, and Thomas Jefferson
is writhing in pain as the Continental Congress debates changes (he
calls them ``mutilations'') in his draft of the Declaration of
Independence, which he believes to be perfect as it is. The
delegates noisily argue over every treasured syllable, striking
out, adding, inserting, toning down, beefing up, rewording,
rephrasing and reordering. On the sidelines, meanwhile, the
distraught Jefferson is consoled by his friend Ben Franklin.
``Tom,'' he says, ``this puts me in mind of a story.'' The story he
tells (one that Jefferson later recalled in his memoirs) is about a
Boston hatmaker who's on his way to the sign shop with a plan for a
new sign. On his parchment are the words ``John Thompson, Hatmaker.
Fashionable Hats Sold Inside for Ready Money,'' and below them a
drawing of a hat. Along the way, he meets a few people who have
suggestions to offer. Each one seems to have a good idea: The
hatmaker's name is irrelevant, isn't it? And why say ``inside''?
Where else would the hats be sold? One by one and two by two, the
carefully chosen words are struck out, and finally even the picture
of the hat disappears (after all, there are hats in the shop
window, aren't there?). By the time he arrives at the sign shop,
his parchment is empty. But the sign maker has an idea too. ``May I
make a suggestion?'' he says. ``How about: 'John Thompson,
Hatmaker. Fashionable Hats Sold Inside for Ready Money.' '' Under
them, he'll draw a hat. ``It's perfect!'' says the hatmaker.
Fleming's retelling captures the humor of Franklin's tale and adds
charming period detail, while Parker's richly colored
ink-and-watercolor paintings are the perfect accompaniment. I
wouldn't change a thing. _ PATRICIA T. O'CONNER

   &UR; YOU NEVER KNOW &QL; 
 &UR; A Legend of the Lamed-vavniks &QL; 
 &UR; By Francine Prose &QL; 
 &UR; Illustrated by Mark Podwal &QL; 
 &UR; Greenwillow, $15. (Ages 5 to 8) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to an ancient Jewish legend, there are always 36 holy
people in the world. They are known as Lamed-vavniks (from the
Hebrew for 36). These people are so righteous and just that their
prayers are always answered. Yet they live in secret, disguised as
ordinary people, humble and often poor. Stories involving secret
identities are greatly appealing to children, and Francine Prose
has written a lovely tale around this intriguing legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Never Know'' is the story of a Lamed-vavnik named Schmuel,
a poor cobbler who is so kind and generous that the townsfolk think
he must be stupid. When Schmuel's prayers save the town, they
wonder why God listens to poor stupid Schmuel. They ask the rabbi,
who has a dream in which Schmuel's true identity is revealed. The
next morning the rabbi tells the townsfolk, but when they go to
find Schmuel he has already moved on. A few months later, a new
cobbler comes to town, and even though he's poor, the people treat
him with respect, thinking that he too could be a Lamed-vavnik.
``After all,'' they reason, ``you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Prose delivers her moral gently, offering children a new way to
look at the poor and the homeless. Without preaching, she
encourages us to remember that beggars and ditchdiggers may not be
what they seem, and suggests that we treat everyone with respect --
just in case. Mark Podwal's pictures are strongly atmospheric, and
go well with the text. The Lamed-vavniks, though faceless, somehow
appear peaceful and content as they go about their daily business.
Children and adults will linger on the pictures of these holy men
and women, studying them as though allowed a privileged glimpse at
the secret lives of these wonderful, mysterious people. _ ROBIN

THE LION'S PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
  Theodore Roosevelt and His Family in Peace and War 
 By Edward J. Renehan Jr. 
 Illustrated. 289 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $27.50 
 ------ 
 CHARGE! 
 By ROBERT W. MERRY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the presidents, none glorified the arts and lore of
battle quite like Theodore Roosevelt. From youth to dotage, he
reveled in tales of derring-do, celebrating the patriotism of the
citizen-warrior and the sacrifice of blood on the hallowed field of
combat. His martial idealism poses a question: Was he an American
patriot in the truest sense of the word, or was he a warmonger,
driven simply by a conviction that battle purified the manly soul?
</P>
<P>
   The historian and biographer Edward J. Renehan Jr.'s beguiling
book ``The Lion's Pride,'' which chronicles the Roosevelt family's
participation in the Spanish-American War and the European
conflagration two decades later, doesn't purport to answer that
question. But it does provide a revealing portrait of the old
Anglo-Saxon elite that once dominated American society. No family
personified that elite quite like the Roosevelts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you afraid to stand up when I am on horseback?'' Teddy
Roosevelt admonished his infantry troops before his famous charge
up San Juan Hill in 1898. The 39-year-old colonel then galloped
toward the enemy as his troops rallied behind him. The war
correspondent Richard Harding Davis said it was the bravest thing
he'd ever seen _ and the most foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the remainder of his days, Roosevelt viewed this
``crowded hour'' as his finest moment, the defining act of his
life. Later, he agitated for America's entry into World War I, and
when it came sent his four sons off in search of glory _ causing
some discomfort at the departure pier when he speculated aloud, and
with apparent satisfaction, that one of his boys might well be
wounded or even killed in the righteous cause of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, two suffered serious wounds. And young Quentin,
an aviator barely past his 20th birthday, was killed, shot down
over German territory. ``Poor Quinikins! Poor Quinikins,'' the
former president, now nearly 60 and infirm, was heard to mutter as
he rocked back and forth in a chair once used to soothe the
agitations of the infant Quentin. When his friend Edith Wharton
suggested he write a book about his fallen son, Roosevelt replied
that he couldn't, ``for I should break down.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet he never manifested a particle of doubt about the
worthiness of Quentin's destruction. ``For nothing under heaven,''
he wrote to a colleague from his own days of military heroism,
``would I have had my sons act otherwise than as they acted.'' With
fatherly satisfaction, he added: ``They have done pretty well,
haven't they? Quentin killed, dying as a war hawk should. . . .
Archie crippled, and given the French war cross for gallantry; Ted
gassed once . . . and cited for 'conspicuous gallantry'; Kermit
with the British military cross, and now under Pershing.''
</P>
<P>
   How could an American father relish so philosophically the
demise of one son and the mortal dangers faced by three others in a
distant war that had almost nothing to do with American security?
Renehan suggests that the reason lies in Roosevelt's time and
class. By the turn of the century, America had pushed to the
Pacific and fulfilled its continental destiny. Now the mind of the
Northeastern elite danced with visions of a global alliance with
Britain to insure peace and stability throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Roosevelt chafed in frustration at his inability
to make this dream a reality. That grand task fell to his cousin
and nephew-in-law, Franklin, who idolized his older relative and
steeped himself in the writings of Teddy Roosevelt's close friend,
the naval historian Alfred Thayer Mahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``F.D.R.,'' Renehan writes, ``was sympathetic to Mahan's
arguments for a strategic Anglo-American imperium . . . through
which the United States would . . . assume an inevitable task, an
appointed lot in the work of upholding the common interests of
civilization.'' Ultimately, that was the cause for which Theodore
fought and young Quentin died.

TORN FROM THE NEST
</HEADLINE>
  By Clorinda Matto de Turner 
 Translated by John H. R. Polt 
 174 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $30 
 ------ 
 BANNED IN LIMA 
 By JOANNA O'CONNELL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Torn From the Nest'' first appeared in Lima in 1889, it
was a sensation. Clorinda Matto de Turner brought her passionate
demands for social reform to the center of national attention. The
president of Peru wrote her that he was one of many readers moved
by her forthright denunciation of abuse of the indigenous majority
at the hands of the Creole minority. At the same time, because the
novel advocated an end to celibacy for priests, it was banned by
the church; Matto was excommunicated and burned in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   This new and engaging translation by John H. R. Polt is part of
Oxford University Press's wonderful Library of Latin America
series. For most of this century, ``Torn From the Nest'' was one of
very few works by a woman in the Latin American literary canon,
both as an early example of literary naturalism and, more
significant, because it anticipated one of 20th-century Latin
American literature's major tendencies, the indigenista novel _
writing by non-Indians denouncing the exploitation of indigenous
people as the unresolved legacy of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   In her preface, Matto echoes the credo of realism when she says
she wants the novel to be a ``photograph'' of Peruvian life. But it
is also a romance; as in many other 19th-century Latin American
novels, a love story displays the symptoms of deep-seated national
contradictions. Antonio Cornejo Polar's introduction places Matto's
work in the context of Latin American intellectual life and of
national debates in Peru. He helps us understand how the realist
elements of Matto's narrative _ the detailed representations of
landscape and custom, the emphasis on social corruption _ showed
her contemporaries a new way to understand relations between
Creoles and Indians and challenged them to identify with her
strongly ethical vision.
</P>
<P>
   Lucia and Fernando Marin, an educated Creole couple from Lima,
have come to live in the Andean provincial town of Killac. Lucia
tries to help Marcela Yupanqui, an Indian woman whose family is in
a desperate situation because of the corrupt practices of the local
priest, politicians and gentry. Lucia's well-intentioned efforts
precipitate a violent reaction that results in the death of Marcela
and her husband, leaving their two daughters orphans; the Marins
are forced to return to Lima, taking the girls with them.
Meanwhile, the Governor's son has fallen in love with one of the
girls, but (of course) their love is doomed by a terrible secret.
</P>
<P>
   The women in the novel are the moral center of Matto's
alternative vision. Because they cannot participate in public life,
their influence on men is their only means of pursuing change.
Matto pushed to the limit the sphere of public action allowed women
in her society. She was one of an extraordinary group of female
intellectuals in Latin America engaged in redefining women's
citizenship. She wrote and published widely before her husband's
death in 1881, but it was as a widow that she embarked on her
career as a professional intellectual. In addition to writing
novels and articles, she edited a major newspaper in Arequipa as
well as Lima's weekly literary review, El Peru Ilustrado, and
founded a feminist press.
</P>
<P>
   If in many respects her ideas were typical of liberal
intellectual circles, her critique of church corruption, her
feminism and her energetic engagement with politics were radical.
In 1895 she was forced to flee Peru, leaving her manuscripts behind
in a house and publishing office ransacked by mobs. She enjoyed
success in Buenos Aires, but died in exile in 1909. When we read
``Torn From the Nest,'' we may see her vision of redeeming the
downtrodden Indians through enlightened Christian charity and
education as paternalistic, but in her day her views were a
courageous attack on the colonial underpinnings of Peruvian
society.

GOD OF THE RODEO
</HEADLINE>
  The Search for Hope, Faith, and a Six-Second Ride in Louisiana's
Angola Prison 
 By Daniel Bergner 
 295 pp. New York: Crown Publishers. $24 
 ------ 
 SECONDS OF FREEDOM 
 By PETER APPLEBOME 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no accident that the South's prisons are some of its most
mythic, darkly resonant places. There is the Walls Unit prison in
Huntsville, Texas, the execution capital of America, where people
still speak fondly of ``Old Sparky,'' the electric chair that was
finally put out to pasture when lethal injection was adopted in
1977. There is the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, as
much an inspiration for classic blues as cheap liquor or busted
love. And there is Angola, La., where the winding two-lane road to
nowhere ends in an utterly isolated purgatory for society's
outcasts, bordered on three sides by the levees of the Mississippi
and on the fourth by a dense no man's land of vines, undergrowth
and snakes so daunting there's no need for a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Angola covers 18,000 acres, larger than the island of Manhattan.
Because of Louisiana's unusually stringent sentencing laws, about
80 percent of Angola's inmates -- mostly murderers, rapists and
armed robbers -- have no-parole sentences or sentences so long they
might as well be. It's impossible to visit the place and not feel
that a prisoner could disappear off the face of the earth and no
one would ever know or care.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Bergner, a New York-based journalist and novelist, gives
voice to the forgotten in ``God of the Rodeo,'' a vivid, ambitious
(sometimes too ambitious) and ferociously reported book that reads
like a novel. Bergner tells us he was looking for both a story and
something close to a revelation -- an affirmation of what he
describes as his own tenuous faith in God. He finds more than one
story -- chilling and heartbreaking tales of violence, penance and
sometimes redemption. But the personal revelation is harder to come
by. The closer the book sticks to hard-edged reporting the better
it is. When it strays into a search for the transcendent, it runs
the risk of strained overreaching.
</P>
<P>
   Bergner's book grew out of reporting he did for Harper's
Magazine on Angola's annual prison rodeo, where inmates, many of
them with as much background in rodeo as they have in quantum
mechanics, risk their lives each fall in a gaudy, gladiatorial
spectacle. Bergner uses the rodeo contestants as a window into
Angola, a way to make sense of the people who find their way there.
In doing so, he faced numerous inherent risks, most of which he
handled with skill and insight. The prison rodeo is one of those
stories that are at once wildly exotic and perhaps overly familiar,
and it's not unique to Angola. (Huntsville had an even more famous
rodeo until it was phased out in 1988.) The utter desolation of the
prisoners' lives and the barbarity of their surroundings can lead a
sympathetic observer to forget why the prisoners are there. And the
Old South plantation vapors and inescapable racial context (77
percent of the inmates are black, two-thirds of the guards are
white, as is all the top leadership) make a place like Angola a
lightning rod for every stereotypical view of the South.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bergner navigates those hazards with admirable
dexterity and sophistication. Even people who know something about
prison rodeos will find it hard not to be caught up in the richly
etched lives he discovers behind the ghoulish pageantry of events
like ``convict poker,'' in which four inmates sit in folding chairs
around a bright red table as a 2,000-pound bull is let loose in the
arena. The last one sitting wins $100. And Bergner is no censorious
Yankee naif adrift in the South. He has a nuanced, probing take on
almost everything he encounters, right down to the rodeo itself.
And while he deals with the prisoners as real individuals with the
capacity to grow and sometimes reform, he takes pains to remind us
that most are in Angola for the kind of unspeakable crimes that
deserve exile from what passes for a civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   ``God of the Rodeo'' is really three books. The first and best
is riveting reportage on prison life that uses the rodeo as both
gateway and metaphor for life at Angola. The second is Bergner's
uneasy, increasingly contentious dance with Angola's warden, Burl
Cain, who in the course of the narrative goes from being the soul
of Christian charity to a grasping shakedown artist. And the final
one is a spiritual journey trying to extract meaning from the dark
tales playing out inside Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Bergner is a terrific reporter with a novelist's eye. When we
first meet Cain, he's entering the rodeo arena in the closest thing
he can find to a chariot -- ``a wooden cart, lacquered and
polished, with big white-spoked wheels, pulled by his inmate-tended
team of Percheron horses.'' When we first meet a prisoner named
Littell Harris, we're given a snapshot of him mixing a cocktail of
his own feces, mashed and stirred to a consistency useful for
dousing an offending fellow inmate through a bottle with a squirt
top. We learn how to make a prison tattoo, first burning a plastic
canister, usually of Speed Stick, then mixing the soot with
toothpaste and water to make the ink. Then a steel guitar string is
threaded through an empty pen shaft and hooked up to a tiny motor
(taken from a cassette player) and jabbed thousands of times into
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you wonder if the reporting is a bit too vivid.
Bergner and his publisher sought jacket blurbs with unusual
aggressiveness from the best-selling authors of what at the moment
seems to go by the name of literary non-fiction, like Sebastian
Junger and John Berendt. And while there's no reason to think that
Bergner emulated Berendt, who has acknowledged that he invented
dialogue in ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' one wishes
that Bergner had provided a note on his methodology. When he
recounts both sides of a phone conversation, did he tape the call
or rely on a prisoner's reconstruction? And if, as is evident, he
reconstructed a scene with Littell Harris and a woman in a motel
room after Harris was released from prison, did he reconstruct
others as well? Bergner clearly did exhaustive reporting and
expended enormous energy to get his story. But the rules of what's
real and what's massaged are so murky in nonfiction these days it
would have been helpful to know just how to take the reporting,
especially since nearly all the principals in the book are lost in
Angola's time warp.
</P>
<P>
   Bergner's depiction of his relationship with Cain is also
problematic. Berg-
</P>
<P>
   ner began the book with full access to the prison and an
admiring view of Cain as a benevolent figure intent on uplifting
the fallen at Angola. That view changed entirely when Cain tried to
hit him up for editorial control and a portion of the book's
proceeds in return for continued access to the prisoners. Bergner
turned him down and then successfully sued to continue his
interviews. It was a gutsy move and a worthy one. But it makes you
wonder how much of his subsequent reporting is colored by personal
animus and why he was so taken with Cain's unctuous posturing in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the book overreaches a bit in its search for
transcendent meaning. Near the end of the book, Terry Hawkins, who
is serving a life sentence for hacking his boss to death with a
meat ax, wins another of the horrors of the rodeo, a contest called
``guts and glory,'' in which some 30 inmates attempt to pluck a red
chip worth $100 strung between a bull's horns without getting gored
or kicked in the process. ``For one thing was clear,'' Bergner
writes of Hawkins, ``that in these desires he wanted what anyone,
anywhere did: money, a better life, a clear conscience, and
oblivion.'' Really? Oblivion? Bergner's story is so powerful in the
telling, it really didn't need to grasp so hard for profundity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is an eloquent and valuable book. Bergner deserves
credit for bringing such passion and intelligence to this story,
and for fighting a legal battle to tell it at a time when 1.7
million people are behind bars in the United States and prisons
exercise almost total control over what outsiders get to see of
their lives. There's not much cachet to prison reporting these
days. Bergner's rich, probing and compassionate book is a rare look
at both the physical and spiritual world on the other side of the
bars.

VISIONS OF JAZZ
</HEADLINE>
  The First Century 
 By Gary Giddins 
 690 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $35 
 ------ 
 ALL THAT YOU-KNOW-WHAT 
 By ALFRED APPEL JR. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publication of ``Visions of Jazz: The First Century'' is a
major event because Gary Giddins is our best jazz critic. This
enormous book contains 79 essays, many of which originally appeared
in different form in The Village Voice. ``Need I add,'' he
rhetorically asks in his acknowledgments, ``that at no time in this
work's long gestation was it conceived as a conventional critique
or history?'' He insistently tells us at the outset that he has
failed to discuss several important musicians. As it turns out,
``Visions of Jazz'' is the finest unconventional history of jazz
ever written _ a brilliant, indispensable book, comprehensive
enough given the certainty that a total history of jazz at this
point, the century mark, invites a shallow inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, Giddins writes out of admiration and love. (His
characterization of the estimable pianist Tommy Flanagan holds true
for him as well: ``a deep lyricism that eschewed sentimentality.'')
The traps and temptations of such a tack are obvious, but his
temperament seems to insulate him against blind enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The essays do indeed cover jazz's first century, ranging from W.
C. Handy to Cassandra Wilson. Giddins writes at some length about
each subject, his essays falling into two types: a life-and-works
retrospective survey of an older or deceased musician, or a less
ambitious review of performances and recent recordings. Divided
into eight parts, the book is roughly chronological, though Giddins
is too wise to hold to any strict time line, especially since his
history of jazz is the story of the most talented performers, their
recordings the subject of the closest musical scrutiny; his book's
index of songs and selected albums runs to 20 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Giddins' opening section, ``Precursors,'' begins with an essay
on Bert Williams and Al Jolson, two blackface comedians. Purists
and progressives alike may find this puzzling, but that reinforces
Giddins' point: jazz has to be understood in the context of its
origins
</P>
<P>
   as popular entertainment, 19th-century minstrelsy in particular.
Louis Armstrong, one of the heroes of ``Visions of Jazz,'' is a
case in point. Many racially sensitive people still see Armstrong
as an Uncle Tom, a buffoon, rather than as the daring, signifying
minstrel-trickster who deconstructed and dispatched the racism of
demeaning ol'-time songs like ``Shine'' and ``Carry Me Back to Old
Virginny'' _ a great man, really, and Giddins writes about him
superbly, as he did in his ``Satchmo'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   The opening section also includes the ragtime-to-riches saga of
Irving Berlin, the Tin Pan Alley story incarnate: songs that at
first tapped into black sources, then came to life independently,
and, like George Gershwin's, would become part of American culture.
The almost-forgotten singer and actress Ethel Waters is presented
as no less a pivotal figure in the evolution of American song than
Bing Crosby and Armstrong _ a versatile crossover artist who could
bring perfect intonation and articulation to vernacular material,
influencing black and white singers alike.
</P>
<P>
   The second section, ``A New Music,'' discusses the classic
figures, from Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver and Duke Ellington to
Coleman Hawkins, Chick Webb and Fats Waller. Giddins violates
chronology sensibly enough by grouping sui generis
instrumentalists, like Art Tatum, John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor and
Ornette Coleman. This sequence of names suggests that he has an
unusually wide range of musical interests and open-ended curiosity
_ unusual because jazz critics, like everyone else, often settle on
a favorite period or handful of musicians. Not surprisingly,
Giddins' ears are open to post-modernists like Henry Threadgill,
Don Pullen, David Murray, Joe Lovano and, in the final essay, Don
Byron, the black jazzman who plays Webern and Jewish klezmer music.
When Giddins considers the way another black musician, Dexter
Gordon, the first great bebop tenor saxophonist, weaves musical
quotations from other songs into his improvisations, he is
describing the pan-racial, multicultural and even utopian essence
of so-called modern jazz: ``They fold into his solos like spectral
glimpses of an alternative universe in which all of Tin Pan Alley
is one infinite song.''
</P>
<P>
   The section titled ``A Modern Music'' addresses bebop mainly,
though an essay about the parodist Spike Jones fits in nicely, if
loosely. Giddins does not push the importance of parody in jazz and
modernism (a pairing explicit throughout ``Visions of Jazz''),
especially the wittiness of bebop quotations of pop songs effected
by the likes of Gordon and Charlie Parker, comparable as they are
to the allusiveness of literary modernism. The frequent use of the
words ``modern'' and ``post-modern'' throughout ``Visions of Jazz''
seems to assume that readers share a definition and understanding
of these widely applied terms, which isn't necessarily so. Brief,
working definitions would help us all, and Giddins almost supplies
one himself in his discussion of Armstrong's singing: ``Implicit in
the liberties Armstrong took, and in the rise of jazz itself, is
the assumption that musicians are superior to the songs they
perform _ a radical stance by classical principles, where a
performance is evaluated by its fidelity to the text. In jazz,
performance is the text.'' This sounds exactly right, and is one
step away from a comparison with collage. A majestic Armstrong
transformation of a stupid song (like ``Sweethearts on Parade'') is
analogous to the modernist art of collage, assemblage and the metal
and raw wood sculpture of Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Vernacular, or demotic, modernism is the feat of creating more
out of less or almost nothing at all; Giddins explains this art of
musical rescue and reassemblage through singers of genius, in his
explications of Billie Holiday's version of ``A Sailboat in the
Moonlight'' (a 1937 Guy Lombardo hit) and Sarah Vaughan's
``Thinking of You'' (a winner for Eddie Fisher and Don Cherry in
1950). ``Make it new,'' Ezra Pound urged in 1914, and these jazz
modernists do so by revivifying trite lyrics and melodies. ''
'Tain't what you do, it's the way that you do it,'' as Trummy Young
sang with Jimmie Lunceford's band in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington is different from such collagists because he composed
his own material. Ironically, serious discussion of Ellington is
now vexed by the promotion of him as the greatest American or
20th-century composer, classical music included. It is therefore
good to remember, in this prestige-conscious and very politicized
time, that Ellington's reputation was enhanced as early as 1927 by
highbrow praise of his miniatures alone, recordings that are, at
most, three minutes long. Ellington's reputation, Giddins contends,
does not depend on his extended compositions. Ellington's music, he
concludes, is ``Shakespearean in its reach, wisdom and generosity''
_ an uncharacteristically Miltonic chord. This said, Giddins can
still ignore Ellington's current status as an unassailable classic.
His perusal of Ellington's ambitious ``Black, Brown and Beige''
(1943-46) finds the ``Black'' section overlong and ``The Blues''
strangely ``un-Ellingtonian'' and eclectic, with its echoes of
Debussy. He calls the very verbal ``Second Sacred Concert'' (1968)
``outright proselytizing'': ``Some of the choral sections are
reminiscent of school pageants.'' In the current jazz orthodoxy,
this is apostasy, but such frank appraisal instead of hagiography
only makes Giddins more credible and persuasive. When he turns to
the most esteemed Ellington orchestra, the so-called
Blanton-Webster band of 1940-42, he discovers that its most famous
recordings have been analyzed so often that, lest he become a bore,
he must discuss the seemingly marginal disks long overlooked by
writers. His close attention to ``I Don't Know What Kind of Blues
I've Got,'' ``Jumpin' Punkins'' and ``John Hardy's Wife'' unveils
them as small new masterpieces, reinforcing the composer's
greatness and also our sense that his extended works do not have to
be deemed better than (say) Aaron Copland's for Ellington to remain
``beyond category,'' to use the highest praise Ellington himself
could bestow. Ellington's phrase should allow us to step fairly
around the problematic tag ``greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   The section ``A Popular Music'' covers the swing era (1935-45),
extraordinary as a period when popular music was highly musical as
well as popular _ a time when the likes of Berlin, Gershwin, Cole
Porter and Jerome Kern were composing for Fred Astaire-Ginger
Rogers movies. Giddins writes not altogether uncritical
celebrations of Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Jimmie Lunceford,
Roy Eldridge, Count Basie, Lester Young, Benny Goodman and Artie
Shaw. He can flatly say that ``Goodman, like Elvis 20 years later,
adapted black music for white tastes. He toned it down, cleaned it
up'' _ and that's that. Giddins is not going to dwell, as cultural
critics inevitably do, on Goodman as yet another white poacher and
prospector on the vast African-American mother lode. He simply
won't let the race issue obscure the clarinetist's great
musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   The essay on Count Basie and Lester Young gives almost equal
time to Young, the star tenor saxophone soloist of Basie's 1936-40
band and one of jazz's supreme improvisers. Giddins argues against
the long-prevailing opinion that Young's talent was diminished
after 1945 because of his traumatic Army court-martial and stay in
a detention barracks (hence the title of his subsequent record,
``D.B. Blues''). By pinpointing shifts in Young's style in pre-Army
recordings from 1943, he shows that Young's postwar style had
evolved naturally as a choice of expression. Only the jazz initiate
may appreciate the radicalness of this point and how it defines
Giddins' independence and immense value as a critic. Giddins pays
proper due to the Basie-Young classics of the '30s, but again goes
against received opinion by praising Basie's post-1950 bands, which
are often denigrated as cold, impersonal swing machines. They
``kept the game alive,'' says Giddins, who reminds us that the
swing era did not entirely die around 1945 but persisted in the
glorious post-1950 music of other enduring swing-era figures like
Ellington, Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Artie Shaw briefly (his 1954 small
group) and the less well-known Jimmy Rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Giddins opens his heart when discussing singers. Rushing, he
writes of a great reissue, ``Rushing Lullabies,'' sings a certain
blues ``at a slow, bleeding tempo.'' Of the first recordings of
Billie Holiday and Lester Young, he writes how ``Holiday's voice
and Young's tenor entwined like ivy around the trellises of 'This
Year's Kisses' and 'I Must Have That Man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A magnum opus that could serve as a textbook, ``Visions of
Jazz'' sorely needs a discography. Because Giddins' retrospective
surveys are rarely specific about an artist's best available
recordings, a relative newcomer to jazz needs some shopping advice.
However, Giddins has brilliantly edited a compact disk as a
companion to the book. Also titled ``Visions of Jazz,'' and issued
by Blue Note Records, the CD contains 38 selections programmed
along lines traced by the book, with surprising, delightful twists,
including its very generous running time of 151 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The CD includes certain well-known recordings by Thelonious
Monk, Bud Powell, and Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, because
they are discussed in detail in the book. But Giddins also seems to
assume that his readers already own many of the most famous
recordings of artists like Armstrong, Ellington and Basie, and
therefore omits anthology chestnuts. His listeners are instead
treated to relatively uncelebrated masterpieces like Coleman
Hawkins's rapturous ``Out of Nowhere'' (1937); Bobby Hackett's
stately, heart-stopping ``Pennies From Heaven'' (1945); Lester
Young's almost defiant ``D.B. Blues'' (1945); Ellington's
deliberate and tender piano trio rendition of ``Passion Flower''
(1953); and Sinatra's lilting ``Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams''
(1954), probably selected because Sinatra lets three jazz soloists
loose as in no other session from the tightly arranged '50s.
Giddins is unfailingly fresh in his selections. Instead of drawing
on music by Jelly Roll Morton to accompany the essay about him, he
slips in Art Hodes's obscure 1945 version of Morton's ``Mr. Jelly
Lord.'' The book's Irving Berlin essay is complemented by the
totally unexpected appearance on CD of Kay Starr splendidly singing
``You're Just in Love'' _ retrieved from a long-out-of-print 1960
LP. This is inspired archeology.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiring, too, is the return of another '50s singer, Rosemary
Clooney. One of Giddins' final and finest essays in ``Visions of
Jazz'' is devoted to Clooney's winning story, and it is a story _
years of despair and obscurity followed by recovery as a person and
as an improved performer and recording artist. Giddins reviews her
more recent work for the Concord Jazz label, singling out the CD's
titled ``For the Duration'' (1991), where the accompaniment of the
tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton and the cornetist Warren Vache
recalls the Billie Holiday-Teddy Wilson sessions of the 30's;
``Girl Singer'' (1992); and ``Do You Miss New York?'' (1993).
Giddins has ``big ears,'' as jazz musicians used to say, and his
jazz vision, his tireless listening habits, are in the public
interest. If you follow up on his Rosemary Clooney recommendations,
Gary Giddins will simply bring you pleasure and joy. Who could ask
for anything more?

WHEN ANGELS REST

 ------ 
 RETURN OF THE STAY MORONS 
 By SCOTT BRADFIELD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Harington is the sort of regional writer who keeps
American fiction honest. Instead of recycling the same old genre
junk (thrill killers on a tear, noble housewives saving dimes in a
jam jar, and so on), he concentrates on the people and
neighborhoods of his own experience, embroidering the life he knows
rather than fabricating a life he doesn't. And while the
post-trendy post-moderns continue playing with the fantasy of
closure and the unreliability of narrators, Harington keeps his eye
on the narrative ball, sacrificing neither believability nor
composure. Which is to say that Donald Harington's books are both
unclassifiable and a genuine pleasure to read. There aren't enough
writers like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Angels Rest,'' like most of Harington's novels, is set in
the backwoods Ozarks hamlet of Stay More, Ark., an appropriately
named pocket-sized Yoknapatawpha where few residents ever work up
enough ambition to leave. At the top of the social ladder are the
Ingledews, an oddly reticent founding family whose members brought
banks, commerce and backroom politics in their wake. At the bottom
are the Dingletoons, a Snopes-like breed of scroungers who move
into every abandoned space they find and don't seem very shy at all
-- at least not when it comes to reproducing. With so many odd
people living so close together, morality has become something of a
slipshod concept in Stay More. Everybody is circuitously related to
everybody else, and this includes (according to rumor, anyway) the
antithetical Dingletoons and Ingledews.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Angels Rest'' concerns the coming of age of a 12-year-old
reporter named Dawny. Inspired by his hero, Ernie Pyle, Dawny
produces the town's only halfway reliable newspaper, composing all
the stories himself and hand-delivering each issue to every
out-of-the-way customer who can't be reached through the post
office. Published weekly and printed by means of a mail-order
gelatin board, The Stay Morning Star doesn't just disseminate news;
its aim is to follow Pyle by making ``heroes out of common men.''
And in Stay More, as it turns out, there are plenty of common men.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Stay More is located so far off the conventional map
that its residents don't mind taking their own personal liberties
with history. So while World War II rages many thousands of miles
away, the children of Dawny's generation battle one another on the
field of make-believe:
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the student body had been divided, for going on four
years, practically since the war started, into two factions, rival
camps who opposed each other not only in baseball but in war games
such as Dirt War and Dare Base and all-out Capture the Flag. . . .
These two factions occupied opposing sides of the schoolroom with
the aisle as a divider, a demilitarized zone across which spitballs
flew.''
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the aisle sit the Allies, all the most popular
boys and girls in the area. On the other sit Dawny and his fellow
Axis members, the class's most miserable-looking geeks and dweebs.
Even imagination, it seems, has its class system.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, the games of children give way to the
world's grubby, often brutal authenticity. And when armed American
training forces are secretly dropped into the hills to act out
possible battle plans for the taking of the Pacific, real war comes
to Stay More -- and it looks as if it will never leave. If history
was once simply ``a subject in school that bored most of us to
death,'' Dawny recalls, it now ``thundered into our own little
world of make-believe warfare and snatched us up.'' In other words,
the town's guardian angels have decided to take a little nap.
</P>
<P>
   There is something Edenic about the benign simplicity of Stay
Morons, those backwoods children of Harington's fiction who refuse
to grow up. And in many ways, the failure of Harington's latest
novel is that it doesn't manage to grow up either. For while the
opening chapters describing childhood during the war are both
charming and funny, the intrusion of the real world in the second
half of the novel often feels stagy, preachy and false.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking an introduction to Harington's excellent fiction
would be better off with the brilliant bug-eye view of things in
his 1989 novel, ``The Cockroaches of Stay More.'' No matter how
much we want this latest installment to work, in the end it simply
doesn't.

  A Memoir 
 By Homer H. Hickam Jr. 
 368 pp. New York: Delacorte Press. $23.95 
 ------ 
 LIFTOFF IN COALWOOD 
 By JAMES R. GAINES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In autobiography as in life, so much depends on how we
understand what happened to us. The facts are secondary, sometimes
even misleading: a benign world may signal alienation to a
neurotic, just as a harsh world may give the sanguine person a
sense of triumph. Interpretation is almost everything, which helps
explain wildly divergent siblings (the Unabomber and his
social-worker brother) and how the sexually abused child of a
teen-age welfare mother can become a worldbeater (Oprah Winfrey).
So much depends on how we tell ourselves the story of our lives, in
dreams and daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   Homer H. Hickam Jr. might have followed his father into the coal
mines of Appalachia. Happily for him, he is a very adept
storyteller. ``Rocket Boys'' is his story of growing up in
Coalwood, W.Va., at a time in America (1957 to 1960) when all
telephones were black, all bathtubs white and very little was gray:
when the world was Ike versus Khrushchev and the theater of the
cold war was moving into outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Coalwood was a company town in the original sense; the company
owned everything in it, and its anthem was Tennessee Ernie Ford's
rendition of a popular dirge, ``Sixteen Tons'' (``St. Peter don't
you call me 'cause I can't go / I owe my soul to the company
store''). Coalwood had no widows to remind it of the constant
threat of explosions and cave-ins; the company made them move out
of their company-owned homes.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Hickam Sr. was the boss of the mine, so the author grew up
in its dust: ``Throughout my childhood, when I raised my blanket in
the morning, I saw a black, sparkling powder float off it. My socks
were always black with coal dirt when I took off my shoes at
night.'' Life in the Hickam household, at least for Homer Jr.,
shared Coalwood's desolation. His workaholic father, wracked by
coughing fits from the black lung disease that would eventually
kill him, was mostly absent, and his mother, who hated everything
about the town and the mine, escaped into the mural of a seashore
scene that she painted ceaselessly on a kitchen wall.
</P>
<P>
   The author was too slight for football and half blind, and his
older brother, Jim, was a star of the high school team, in a town
where all that mattered besides coal was football. ``I was watching
television in the living room one night,'' he writes, ``when Mom
suggested to Dad, after he had spent some minutes . . . boasting
about Jim to one of his foremen, that it might be a good thing if
he bragged on me every once in a while. Even though he knew I was
in the same room, Dad thought for a moment and then wondered aloud,
quite honestly, 'What about?' '' Mrs. Hickam wanted only that her
second son not follow other Coalwood boys into the mines. When his
grandfather remarked one day that he, at 3, was ``just like Homer''
Sr., his mother ``carried me out onto the front porch, stroking my
hair. . . . 'No, you're not,' she crooned just loud enough so only
she and I could hear. 'No, you're not.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed when he was 14; on Oct. 5, 1957, Russia beat
America into space with Sputnik. He and his mother inferred his
future from that seismic event: he would build a rocket! Lots of
American boys got rocket-minded after Sputnik, but for the Hickams
it was more than a phase. For his mother, the idea represented a
way to prove to his father that Homer Jr., an indifferent student,
had the aptitude for college. For him, standing vigil in his yard
at night for a glimpse of Sputnik, it was a connection to the
larger world. ``All my life, everything important that had ever
happened had always happened somewhere else. But Sputnik was right
there in front of my eyes in my backyard. . . . I felt that if I
stretched out enough, I could touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born the Big Creek Missile Agency (B.C.M.A.), named for
his high school, manned by his pals, led by Homer Hickam Jr. and
dedicated to the proposition that Coalwood boys could do anything,
including helping America play catch-up to the Commies. He credits
his mother with pushing him on, but his father, while publicly
berating him for foolishness and theft of company property to build
his rockets, eventually conspired to get him everything he needed,
without acknowledging to his son that he was doing so. Both parents
showed forbearance as the B.C.M.A.'s early experiments made scrap
of the Hickam fence, toaster, bathroom scale and water heater. But
in time Homer vindicated his mother's belief in him, managing to
teach himself trigonometry and calculus, as well as how to
machine-tool a rocket nozzle that would draw the praise of his
greatest hero, Wernher von Braun.
</P>
<P>
   The ``rocket boys'' of Coalwood named their missiles for an
extinct, flightless bird, the auk. Their humility stopped there. As
they progressed from their first vehicle, a flashlight body filled
with cherry-bomb powder, through Auk XXV, a zinc-and-sulfur-powered
five-foot rocket that reached 15,000 feet, the last in a series
that won the local, county and, unthinkably, the 1960 National
Science Fair, their audacious flights inspired a dying region's
imagination and hope, and a pride that even Hickam's father could
not contain. On the day the boys shot off their last series of
rockets, Homer Hickam Sr. showed up at ``Cape Coalwood'' for the
first time. The author asked his father to turn the ignition switch
for the final launch: ``Auk XXXI erupted, blowing huge chunks of
concrete loose from the pad. The crowd took a step backward, and
some of them started to run. Auk XXXI seemed to split the air that
filled the narrow valley, a shock wave rippling across the slack.
Women screamed and men clapped their hands to their ears . . .
mouths agape, eyes wide, their cheers stuck in their throats. . . .
I became aware of movement beside me, and I was astonished to see
Dad prancing along the slack, waving his old hat in his hand. He
was exulting to the sky. 'Beautiful! Beautiful!' ''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected of a book that is ``soon to be a major
motion picture,'' the story is too perfect: 30-year-old dialogue is
reproduced verbatim, the plot is a stacked deck, the victory seems
pat (the teen-age protagonist even tells the Presidential candidate
John F. Kennedy that he should aim America's space program at the
moon, a moment so farfetched it must be true). Hickam admits taking
``certain liberties'' in telling it. But whatever its flaws, it's a
good bet this is the story as he told it to himself. It is a lovely
one, and in the career of Homer H. Hickam Jr., who prevailed over
the facts of his life to become a NASA engineer training astronauts
for space walks, that made all the difference.

TRIP SHEETS
</HEADLINE>
  By Ellen Hawley 
 227 pp. Minneapolis: Milkweed Editions. Paper, $13.95 
 ------ 
 HACK WORK 
 By DWIGHT GARNER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ellen Hawley's earnest, amiable first novel takes its title from
the logbooks that cabdrivers keep _ a collection of addresses that
tells them where they've been that day (everywhere, nowhere) and
how much money they've made (peanuts). ``Trip Sheets'' reads like
its own kind of scattered logbook. It's a series of barely
sequential vignettes about a streetwise 28-year-old woman and her
attempts to rid her life of two things: (a) her job as a hack and
(b) sex with men.
</P>
<P>
   Ditching men is the easy part. Hawley's protagonist, Cath
Rahven, has always ignored her mother's strictures to cut out her
tomboy act (``If you'd only try, Cathy. You're not bad- looking''),
and by the time we meet her, she's already dropped in on a lesbian
poetry reading and started puzzling over her life's new sexual
geometry: ``What she can't imagine is ... how two women go from
vertical and dressed to horizontal and panting.'' Cath quickly
solves this equation. Before long, she's gathered so many lovers
that Hawley is reduced to issuing summary statements like
``Experience accumulates. Women accumulate.'' You'll be tempted to
pencil the words ``You go, girl!'' in the margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trip Sheets'' is set in Minnesota, and Hawley _ who lives in
Minneapolis _ writes about the lesbian scene there with a mixture
of fondness and satirical whimsy. At that poetry reading, for
example, the only words Cath can seem to decipher are ``blood,
moon, tree, goddess, earth.'' Cath often verges on becoming a
lesbian cliche herself (she takes karate lessons, has a degree in
social work and aspires to be a writer), but her good humor and
distaste for ``New Age hoo-rah'' rescue her _ and us _ from that
fate.
</P>
<P>
   The best writing in ``Trip Sheets'' isn't about sex or goddess
worship, however, but about Cath's improvised career as a cabby.
``You don't choose your company'' when you drive a cab, she notes,
and we're both horrified and delighted by the misfits and
miscreants she scoops up off the streets. Cath frequently feels
like a miscreant, too. She works for a company that is ``so cheap
it has to glue down a $5 calculator'' _ an object she often feels
like prying up herself. ``Not because she wants a calculator, but
because it's the company's. And because it's glued down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cab driving, like the Midwest's gay and lesbian subculture,
offers Cath something she's never received from her family _ a
sturdy sense of belonging. As she debates quitting her job, she
realizes she'll miss ``belonging to a secret elite that owns
nothing and controls nothing but knows every bar, every
supermarket, every business that's gone belly up, everything that
moves down a city street, and how to pry a living from all of it.''
Leaving won't be easy, a fellow driver warns. ``Love doesn't last
forever,'' he says. ``There's only one thing lasts forever, and
that's cab driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawley relates Cath's wandering tale in prose that's spare to
the point of self-denial; her sentences rarely break into metaphor
or poke you awake with sudden flashes of insight. At times, this
spareness resonates with meaning. At other times, ``Trip Sheets''
merely seems flat and banal. When Cath makes a list of what's good
about being single, women's-magazine platitudes are all she can
come up with: ``It makes us take friendships more seriously; it
turns us toward a larger world instead of to one other person all
the time; it makes us self-reliant.'' Worse, there's little here in
the way of momentum or drama. Whenever ``Trip Sheets'' threatens
seriously to snag your interest, Hawley cuts away to another
vignette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trip Sheets'' lacks the lusty, wild-eyed comedy of Blanche
McCrary Boyd's lesbian love story ``Terminal Velocity,'' as well as
the starkly rendered emotion of Dorothy Allison's strongest work.
But Hawley's novel sneaks up on you. Toward the close of the book,
as the pieces of Cath's life begin to fall into place _ she finds a
better job and a secure relationship _ ``Trip Sheets'' becomes
unaccountably moving.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving her apartment one evening, Cath checks the mirror
``to see if she's gotten any thinner, stronger, more graceful or
more likable.'' Nah, she tells herself. In our minds, however,
she's been quite lovely _ and quite likable _ all along.

MOMMY DRESSING
</HEADLINE>
  A Love Story, After a Fashion 
 By Lois Gould 
 Illustrated. 261 pp. New York: Anchor Books/Doubleday. $DESIGNING
WOMAN 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a woman whose mother died giving birth to her, whose
stepmother cared not a whit for her and who so dreaded bearing
children that she had three abortions and would have had more if
her father had not declared on his deathbed that since God had
spared her life she could no longer flout His will. (There was also
a husband determined to keep getting her pregnant.)
</P>
<P>
   Then take this woman's daughter, the second of the two children
she bore unwillingly. That daughter was confined to her room as if
to servant's quarters for long periods of time, rarely spoken to
except in passing, left in the care of sometimes ghoulishly cruel
nannies and viewed largely as an object of questionable esthetic
worth. (``Don't perspire in this dress. I never perspire. Why must
you?'' her mother complained regularly. ``Is that a pimple?'' ``Why
do you let your hair frizz up?'')
</P>
<P>
   Who would not sympathize with the child? Compared with their
parents, children are always helpless and innocent. But what is so
extraordinary about Lois Gould's memoir, ``Mommy Dressing: A Love
Story, After a Fashion,'' is that she, the child in question, makes
us feel the helplessness, the awful emotional ignorance and
deprivation that made her mother who she was, as a parent and as a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's mother was Jo Copeland, a successful and glamorous dress
designer. Movie stars and society ladies wore her clothes with
pride. The young Pauline Trigere once saw her whirling across a
dance floor in Paris and asked who she was. She is a young fashion
designer, Trigere's companion answered. ``Really?'' Trigere
exclaimed. ``Then that's what I want to be.'' During World War II,
when Paris was off limits and fabrics were rationed like food,
American designers had to turn deprivation into inspiration.
Separates and sportswear flourished; clothes started to display
less fuss and more wit. Gould writes, ``Jo Copeland would create
the classic tailored daytime ensemble that could turn into a
sparkling dinner dress with the flick of a collarless jacket.'' And
she would always be considered one whose ready-to-wear designs were
of couture quality.
</P>
<P>
   She wore her own clothes wonderfully, and she was never without
admirers, sycophants or escorts. Unfortunately, her daughter was
expected to be just as worshipful and undemanding. She should have
been content to stand quietly in her mother's room, watching as she
dressed or sat on her black velvet pouf, gazing into a vast mirror
framed by silver columns, like ``an ark of some covenant, with
hidden doors that swung open to reveal fragrant jars and beautiful
bottles, each of which held other secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parents were like haughty deities who held their children
in thrall. Belief was shot through with desperation (how can young
children afford not to believe, or try to believe, in their
parents?); rebellions brought swift and terrible punishment.
Gould's father, who owned a cigar business and was always told he
looked just like Cary Grant, left the family when Lois was 3 years
old. When her mother moved into a new apartment on Park Avenue, she
summoned the two children, the governess, the housekeeper and the
housekeeper's son into the foyer, which had a diamond-patterned
black-and-white floor. There, Gould recalls, ``we stood in a circle
and promised never to set foot on the white diamonds while
traversing the foyer to reach our rooms, or when crossing in the
opposite direction toward the kitchen. It was understood that we
had little or no business in the dining or living rooms except to
practice the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to her parents' marriage, that trusty old
Astaire-Rogers formula had broken down. She wanted class, he wanted
sex, and neither wanted a compromise. So Lois's father continued
his longstanding affair with Red, the wife of his best friend,
Charlie, from the haven of a bachelor apartment. Lois often spent
her weekly paternal visit with the three of them, naively basking
in the attention his mistress gave her. (Which certainly gives
added resonance to the title of Gould's novel ``Such Good
Friends.'')
</P>
<P>
   And just as she was hypnotized by her mother's elegance and
solipsism, she was seduced by her father's virility and cruelty.
Whenever he was summoned to their apartment to discipline her
brother, she begged him to hit her instead. ``All I ever wished
then was for my sins to count, my failures to deserve the belt, the
hairbrush, the closed door, the howling screams. The whistling
sound of the descending weapon, and the other sound, the sickening
smack as buckle sliced into flesh. How I had begged my father for
it, hit me, not him! Me! And how they misunderstood, all of them.
They thought I meant to defend my brother. I only wanted my
father's wrath, which I mistook for love.''
</P>
<P>
   How does Gould manage not to get stranded between self-pity and
self-loathing, not to lurch from unmodulated rage to those
unconvincing pretenses of absolution that usually read something
like: ``It was monstrous of course. I could never do that to a
child of my own. But I now see . . .''?
</P>
<P>
   She has constructed her book so that her parents' lives, with
and without her, come to us in many ways: as psychological
revelations, as social and sexual history, as tales of New York
life. One tale starts in Brooklyn, where a blouse peddler decides
to train his daughter for a job in the fashion industry, partly
because she is talented, partly because her earnings can help put
her brother through law school. Another takes place in Manhattan,
where rich women's housekeepers investigate the financial assets of
gentlemen callers. If George is really a Greek millionaire, then
Sally will plant open boxes of Kotex in Jo's bathroom. That way he
will know, without having to ask, that she is young enough to bear
children.
</P>
<P>
   When Gould was about 10, she visited her mother's workplace on
Seventh Avenue in the garment district. There was Jo Copeland on
her knees, pulling, draping and pinning fabric onto a model,
sketching, selecting fabrics and accessories, shaping it all into a
whole. That is how Gould writes; she even uses the language of
fashion, with its mingling of rules and ambiguities, to frame her
stories: ``Models,'' ``Mix &AMP; Match,'' ``Separates.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-DRESSING-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; (UNDATED: Match,'' ``Separates.'')
</P>
<P>
   A chapter called ``Diamonds II'' gives us Jo's triumphant
description of how she brought herself diamond-and-ruby bracelets
during the Depression. ``How dare you?'' her husband shouted.
``I've earned them. I want them. I'm keeping them,'' she replied.
But years later, when her daughter asked if she was proud to have
been the only one of her friends to buy her own jewelry, she
answered: ``Proud? Every other woman's jewels came from a man who
loved her. Only I was cursed with talent instead.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jo Copeland, the great Cinderella of modern times was Wallis
Warfield Simpson, who certainly never bought her own jewels.
Copeland was one of a handful of designers asked to send the best
of her collection to the royal hotel suite when the Duchess of
Windsor visited New York. For weeks she carried the Duchess's
crested thank-you note around with her, displaying it to anyone who
would look. She earned her daughter's embarrassed disdain. But
after describing her mother's eager, childish snobbery, Gould's
tone changes, and she writes: ``Until I learned how Jo's mother
died giving birth to her, I never understood why, for Jo, a great
love story had to be one that didn't end with babies, a home and
family. Wasn't that what 'happily ever after' meant? Yet to her,
not having babies was literally life and death. How could I know it
wasn't just her vanity, her consummate self-absorption?''
</P>
<P>
   Dispassionate compassion is a very moving quality, and it marks
``Mommy Dressing'' from beginning to end. It is also a hard-won
quality when we enter that private, even claustrophobic, territory
that mothers and children inhabit. Like other recent books I
admire, Gould's fuses this intimate material with social, national
or political history. (I am thinking of Helen Epstein's ``Where She
Came From,'' Honor Moore's ``White Blackbird,'' Wendy Gimbel's
``Havana Dreams'' and Beth Kephart's ``Slant of Sun.'') The result
is to free, not burden, the narrator's voice. The memoir's future
depends on this new kind of ``I,'' one as fluid and potent as
``Once upon a time.''

THE POISONWOOD BIBLE
</HEADLINE>
  By Barbara Kingsolver 
 546 pp. New York: Harper Flamingo. $26 
 ------ 
 GOING NATIVE 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phrase ``heart of darkness'' occurs only once, as far as I
can tell, in Barbara Kingsolver's haunting new novel, ``The
Poisonwood Bible.'' When it does, it falls from the mouth of
Orleanna Price, a Baptist missionary's wife who uses it to describe
not the Belgian Congo, where she, her husband and their four
daughters were posted in 1959, but the state of her marriage in
those days and the condition of what she calls ``the country once
known as Orleanna Wharton,'' wholly occupied back then by Nathan
Price, aforesaid husband and man of God. Joseph Conrad's great
novella flickers behind her use of that phrase, and yet it doesn't.
Orleanna is not a quoting woman, and for the quoting man in the
family, her strident husband, there can be only one source _ the
Bible, unambiguous and entire, even in a land that demonstrates
daily the suppleness of language. ``Tata Jesus is bangala!'' he
shouts during his African sermons. It never occurs to him that in
Kikongo, a language in which meaning hangs on intonation, bangala
may mean '''precious and dear,'' but it also means the poisonwood
tree _ a virulent local plant _ when spoken in the flat accent of
an American zealot.
</P>
<P>
   The Prices are Nathan and Orleanna and their daughters: Ruth
May, the youngest; Rachel, the oldest, a pale blond Mrs. Malaprop
of a teen-ager; and the twins, Leah and Adah. Both twins are
gifted, but Adah suffers from hemiplegia, which leaves her limping
and nearly speechless. The female members of the family narrate
``The Poisonwood Bible'' in turn. Orleanna does so in retrospect,
from her later years on Sanderling Island, off the coast of
Georgia. The girls, however, tell their story from the Congo as it
happens, on the precipice of events, like an epistolary novel
written from a place with no postal service and no hope of pen
pals.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Price narrates nothing. And yet his certitude _ and the
literal-minded ferocity with which he expresses it _ is the altar
around which these women arrange themselves. We already know his
story, Kingsolver implies. Most of what we have always heard, she
suggests, are stories told by men like him. ``The Poisonwood
Bible'' thus belongs to the women, and it is a story about the loss
of one faith and the discovery of another, for each woman according
to her kind. As Adah, so bright, so willing to torque the mother
tongue, puts it, ``One god draws in the breath of life and rises;
another god expires.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prices travel from Bethlehem, Ga., to a village called
Kilanga on the Kwilu River in the summer of 1959, just a few months
before Patrice Lumumba becomes Prime Minister of the newly
independent Republic of the Congo _ not long, therefore, before he
is arrested and murdered with the complicity of the United States
and its President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose photograph Orleanna
hangs in the kitchen hut behind their mud house: ``I'd cut it out
of a magazine and nailed it over the plank counter where I kneaded
the bread. . . . I remember every detail of him: the clear-rimmed
glasses and spotted tie, the broad smile, the grandfatherly bald
head like a warm, bright light bulb. He looked so trustworthy and
kind. A beacon from home, reminding me of our purpose.'' The irony
in Orleanna's words is the same irony she uses to describe the
early days of her marriage, when there was still room for laughter
in her husband's evangelical calling, before her pregnancies
embarrassed him, before he returned from World War II a different
man _ a man who planned ``to save more souls than had perished on
the road from Bataan.'' Nathan Price escaped that road by sheer
luck, and knowing it curled his heart ``like a piece of hard shoe
leather.''
</P>
<P>
   In Conrad's novella, the heart of darkness is both Kurtz's
despoiled purpose and the terrain in which that purpose is worked.
In Kingsolver's novel, the heart of darkness belongs only to men
like Nathan Price and a local pilot named Eeben Axelroot, a figure
from Graham Greene who shuttles spooklike in and out of Kilanga.
The Congo is a hard place for the Price women, and its people are
unfathomable at first, but Kilanga contains no Conradian darkness.
Army ants, drought, hookworm, hunger, pestilential rain, diseases
and still more diseases and green mamba snakes, yes, but no
darkness. What all the Price women discover _ all except Rachel,
``whose only hopes for the year were a sweet-16 party and a pink
mohair twin set'' _ is the near-perfect adaptation of the Congolese
to the harsh conditions of their existence, a fittedness that is
beautiful in itself. With that knowledge comes the discovery of the
Prices' own profound ignorance. Once the comedy of colliding
cultures ends, the tragedy begins. As Leah says: ``Everything
you're sure is right can be wrong in another place. Especially
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congo permeates ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' and yet this is a
novel that is just as much about America, a portrait, in absentia,
of the nation that sent the Prices to save the souls of a people
for whom it felt only contempt, people who already, in the words of
a more experienced missionary, ``have a world of God's grace in
their lives, along with a dose of hardship that can kill a person
entirely.'' The Congolese are not savages who need saving, the
Price women find, and there is nothing passive in their tolerance
of missionaries. They take the Americans' message literally _
elections are good, Jesus too _ and expose its contradictions by
holding an election in church to decide whether or not Jesus shall
be the personal god of Kilanga. Jesus loses.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all its portraiture of place, its reflexive
political vitriol, its passionate condemnation of Nathan Price,
``The Poisonwood Bible'' is ultimately a novel of character, a
narrative shaped by keen-eyed women contemplating themselves and
one another and a village whose familiarity it takes a tragedy to
discover. Rachel is the epitome of America's material culture, a
cunning, brainless girl who parodies television commercials and
says of Eeben Axelroot, ``I'm willing to be a philanderist for
peace, but a lady can only go so far where perspiration odor is
concerned.'' Ruth May, the baby, is the innocent whose words betray
the guilty; she is the catalyst that splits the Price family apart.
When Orleanna speaks of the Congo, many years later, she does so by
addressing Ruth May, whose questioning eyes watch over Orleanna's
life with more compassion than ever fell from the burning gaze of
her husband's God.
</P>
<P>
   These are precious creatures, but none are as precious to the
reader as Leah and Adah, the twin and the niwt, as Adah calls
herself, referring to her backward condition. Limping, nearly
silent, Adah is a verbal gymnast, a dedicated diarist, a profound
skeptic. Her father, she reports, probably interpreted her twisted
newborn state ``as God's Christmas bonus to one of His worthier
employees.'' Adah's wit bristles throughout this novel; it is wit
of a kind that Leah, a tomboy who eagerly seeks her father's
approval, would never use. Leah's, instead, is an entirely ethical
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Poisonwood Bible'' turns on several axes, and one of them
is Leah's struggle to rebalance herself morally when she finally
realizes exactly who her father is. Once she had said, ``My father
wears his faith like the bronze breastplate of God's foot soldiers,
while our mother's is more like a good cloth coat with a secondhand
fit.'' But when the armor fell, she saw that Nathan Price's ``blue
eyes with their left-sided squint, weakened by the war, had a
vacant look. His large reddish ears repelled me. My father was a
simple, ugly man.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Prices adapt to the Congo, in their way, but Adah and
Leah are carried farthest in their adaptation. Rachel accomplishes
this by not adaptingat all. ``The way I see Africa,'' she says,
``you don't have to like it but you sure have to admit it's out
there. You have your way of thinking and it has its, and never the
train ye shall meet!'' For Adah, adaptation comes in the form of
unforgiving self-discovery, the realization that ``even the crooked
girl believed her own life was precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah, the conscience of this striking novel, is forever
measuring the distance she must travel before her adaptation is
made perfect. It was so when her father owned her, in her mother's
words, ``like a plot of land,'' and it is still so in her maturity
_ wed, so to speak, to the continent. In the end, she explains: ``I
am the un-missionary, as Adah would say, beginning each day on my
knees, asking to be converted. Forgive me, Africa, according to the
multitudes of thy mercies.''

IN BRIEF: FICTION 
 FLIGHTS OF ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
  By Ellen Gilchrist 
 Little, Brown, $24  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her 16th book, Ellen Gilchrist returns once again to the
decadent, arty, emotionally indulgent Southern women who have
appeared in so many of her previous works. Characters like Rhoda
and Crystal are now middle-aged, observing life from the perimeter.
In ``The Carnival of the Stoned Children,'' when Rhoda discovers
LSD in her young son's pants pocket, she is horrified: ``I fished
it out and laid it down upon Jimmy's bed, right in the middle of
his University of Mississippi victory quilt that my brother had
given him for Christmas.'' It isn't clear why Gilchrist is
interested in keeping up with these women -- like the writing,
they're dull and predictable. What was clever and sharp in her
award-winning 1984 collection, ``Victory Over Japan,'' is now
simply quaint. So it's a relief to meet fresh characters like
16-year-old Aurora Harris, who is truly hilarious. Especially
amusing is the ironic eye Aurora casts on the feverish antics of
her born-again younger sister, who's preparing to entertain her
church group in ``Witness to the Crucifixion.'' Both girls are
struggling with the death of their older brother, a fact that
Gilchrist keeps nicely in the background. But within these 19
stories such control is the exception. Instead, a lazy kind of
shorthand permeates the collection: men are philanderers, Jews have
a talent for making money and blacks are gorgeous. Points of view
swing from speaker to speaker and many of the stories end abruptly.
Perhaps Gilchrist should be more concerned with honing new material
and less with reporting on the old. _ ERICA SANDERS

   &UR; BELONG TO ME &QL; 
 &UR; By Kai Maristed &QL; 
 &UR; Random House, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The language of the horse world, so brusque and unromantic it's
almost combative, sets the rhythm for this admirably unconventional
collection of stories. Maristed's characters are dedicated horse
people, but her depiction of their feelings for these animals is
refreshingly free of predictable symbolism. In one story, an
ungainly woman does a melancholy striptease in a cornfield in
exchange for a trailerful of old nags bound for the knacker. In
another, a little girl impulsively dumps her toy horses into the
ocean, unaware that her trainer father, miles away at a racetrack,
is at that very moment watching his best hope for the future break
down. The equestrian jargon in ``Belong to Me'' is so perfectly
rendered it's hard to imagine what a reader who's never spent time
in the saddle will make of it; even for the initiated, the prose
may at times seem too laconic. But if winning a reader's complicity
is a writer's biggest obstacle, Maristed clears it with style. _

   &UR; SURVEYOR &QL; 
 &UR; By G. W. Hawkes &QL; 
 &UR; MacMurray &AMP; Beck, $20 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul and John have spent over 30 years living in the New Mexico
desert, surveying the land for a foundation that has never made its
reasons for hiring them entirely clear. Now, as a team of
paleontologists, a beautiful young filmmaker and various other
interlopers suddenly appear in their lonely outpost, their lifework
begins to look fragile and their friendship -- perhaps their very
reason for living -- is challenged. In this spare yet vibrant
novel, G. W. Hawkes often pleases the reader with his sharp, terse
dialogue and his knack for imbuing a potentially monotonous setting
with color and meaning. The subtle permutations of his central
characters' shifting relationship are also interesting to follow.
It's in the novel's larger thematic statements -- its investigation
of human responses to mortality in the face of nature's seeming
permanence -- that ``Surveyor'' can appear arch and unconvincing.
Here what Hawkes may have meant to be suggestive seems
frustratingly vague or uncertain -- or, on the other hand, far too
predictable. Despite its small successes, ``Surveyor'' demonstrates
that its author has yet to learn how to shift such a delicate story
into a wider context. _ PATRICK GILES

<P>
   &UR; THE CATCH &QL; 
 &UR; By Kim Wozencraft &QL; 
 &UR; Doubleday, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too close to its beginning, Kim Wozencraft's latest novel starts
to telegraph its ending. It quickly becomes obvious, for instance,
that Kurt the drug smuggler will find it difficult to give up the
thrills and income of the game, despite frequent promises to his
wife, Annie. For her part, Annie will have an even more difficult
time reconciling her role as a responsible parent of their two
young sons with her love for Kurt. And Joseph Kessler, a narcotics
agent with a heart, will himself fall for Annie, making his dogged
pursuit of Kurt a much more complicated affair. Most predictable of
all is the finale: from early on, it's clear that ``The Catch'' is
heading toward a confrontation that will involve all three main
characters -- and their deepest hopes and deepest fears -- and will
probably end in violence. But surprisingly, the foreshadowing
detracts less than one might think from the novel's force. This is
probably because Wozencraft (the author of the well-received novel
``Rush,'' and herself a former undercover narcotics officer) has
some pertinent things to say about the seductive qualities of a
life lived outside the law and the nature of the addictive
personality -- not only among those who supply an illegal market
but among those who try to stop them. It's also because she
cleverly portrays Kurt and Annie as typical middle-class parents
with typical middle-class concerns -- bringing up the boys in a
healthy environment, spending quality time together and dealing
with the everyday stresses of a marriage in which one partner must
spend considerable time away from home. Just don't ask what Dad's
doing while Mom's at the Little League game. _ JAMES POLK

<P>
   &UR; THE FOREIGN STUDENT &QL; 
 &UR; By Susan Choi &QL; 
 &UR; Harper Flamingo, $23 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susan Choi's first novel is a richly detailed exploration of a
young man's escape from the nightmare of a country torn by war.
During a stint as a translator for the American information
services in Seoul, a young Korean named Chang Ahn is caught up in
the political turmoil and forced into a life on the run. By August
1955, two years after the cease-fire has ended the war, Chang has
managed to emigrate to the United States, where he attempts to
settle into the life of a scholarship student in the university
town of Sewanee, Tenn. Yet he is unprepared for the smallest shocks
of a vastly different world: even the realization that people in
Sewanee go to sleep at night without locking their doors is
unnerving. Choi (herself the daughter of a Korean immigrant father)
catches such moments under a very clear glass, wisely resisting the
urge to embellish. Instead, she allows the story to blossom slowly
after Chang (renamed Chuck) makes his first real friend in America:
Katherine Monroe, his 28-year-old neighbor. Caught in a poisonous
relationship with a popular professor, begun while she was only 14,
Katherine is nearly as wounded as Chuck. Together they begin to
heal, not with the dreamy pleasure of romantic young lovers but
tentatively and painfully, mindful of all that has gone wrong in
their lives -- and all that might still go wrong. Moving from the
present to the past, from America to Korea, Choi brings hundreds of
small scenes to life, then uses them to construct an intricate
portrait of lovers who must also prove (to themselves and others)
that they are survivors. _ KIMBERLY B. MARLOWE

AFRICANS IN AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  America's Journey Through Slavery 
 By Charles Johnson, Patricia Smith and the WGBH Series Research
Team 
 Harcourt Brace, $30  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until 1639, when the colony of Maryland declared that heathen
slaves could no longer gain freedom through baptism, enslavement
had little to do with skin color. Settlers most often referred to
themselves as Christians or Englishmen, not whites. But shortly
after Maryland's grave pronouncement, color became the chief
determinant of fate, with black equaling slavery and white equaling
freedom. In ``Africans in America,'' the companion volume to a
public television documentary on slavery, Patricia Smith, the
former Boston Globe columnist who was forced to resign last summer,
and Charles Johnson, the novelist who won the National Book Award
in 1990 for ``Middle Passage,'' tell the story of American slavery
by drawing on firsthand accounts and historical documents. While
Smith provides excellent in-depth coverage of the complicated role
played by blacks in the Revolutionary War, and of the politically
powerful Philadelphia black community, her writing lacks a
distinctive voice or critical vantage point. She gives insufficient
attention to the Civil War, and her decision to conclude with that
event without even briefly discussing Reconstruction or the civil
rights movement, seems rather short-sighted. Johnson's 12 highly
detailed short historical fictions, which are interspersed
throughout the narrative, bring to life this most shameful period
in our nation's history. _ JOHANNA BERKMAN

   &UR; CYRIL CONNOLLY: A Life &QL; 
 &UR; By Jeremy Lewis &QL; 
 &UR; Jonathan Cape/Trafalgar Square, $50 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the distinguished English critic and editor Cyril
Connolly played a leading role in English literary life from the
1930's until his death in 1974, he seldom lived up to his own
uncompromising standards. In fact, to judge by Jeremy Lewis's
surprisingly candid authorized biography, Connolly was accurate
when he described himself as a ``lazy, irresolute person, over-vain
and over-modest, unsure in my judgments and unable to finish what I
have begun.'' Born in 1903 and educated at Eton and Oxford,
Connolly was a perfectionist who provided in his best-known book,
the semiautobiographical ``Enemies of Promise,'' not only a
portrait of his early years but an apologia for his own failure to
produce great literature. An elegant curmudgeon with expensive
taste and a stinging wit, Connolly was as ambivalent about his
career as a literary journalist as he was uncompromising in his
critical pronouncements. He tended to look down on the highly
polished essays, reviews and satires at which he excelled and which
make up the bulk of his writings. Yet he managed to complete only
one novel, and, perhaps fearful of not fulfilling his own promise,
he abandoned any number of ambitious literary projects. Further,
despite his complaints about the drudgery of journalistic work, he
clearly enjoyed the power he wielded as a prominent literary editor
and reviewer for The New Statesman, The Observer and The Sunday
Times of London and, from 1939 to 1950, as the founder and editor
of Horizon. In Lewis' detailed and gossip-filled portrait, Connolly
comes across as a brilliant but difficult and often downright
distasteful man. It is left to the reader to wonder how Connolly
nonetheless managed to befriend so many luminaries and charm his
way into the hearts of three wives and several lovers. _ DIANE COLE

   &UR; WHY SINATRA MATTERS &QL; 
 &UR; By Pete Hamill &QL; 
 &UR; Little, Brown, $18 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra's death in May was the occasion for a flood of
overripe, unilluminating prose, most of it obviously prepared well
in advance of the long-anticipated event. Now Pete Hamill, who has
written intelligently about Sinatra in the past, weighs in with a
book that does much to make up for the treacly obituaries and
self-serving memoirs of the last few months. A graceful
reminiscence of Sinatra after hours serves as the frame for shrewd
reflections on the singer's art (``as an artist, Sinatra had only
one basic subject: loneliness''), his personality, his audience and
_ most interesting _ his ethnicity, a subject about which Hamill,
against all odds, contrives to say fresh and persuasive things.
Outside of a few fleeting spasms of vinous sentimentality, the only
thing wrong with this brief but penetrating essay is that it is far
too short. It seems Sinatra once wanted Hamill to ghostwrite his
autobiography; judging by ``Why Sinatra Matters,'' it is a pity
that he did not encourage him to write a full-length biography
instead. _ TERRY TEACHOUT

   &UR; A SEASON IN HELL &QL; 
 &UR; A Memoir &QL; 
 &UR; By Marilyn French &QL; 
 &UR; Knopf, $23 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn French compares the five years she spent negotiating
with death to the torment described by Rimbaud, who used
intoxicants to write as ``a soul condemned to hell.'' In 1992, when
she was 61 years old, Ms. French was told she had esophageal
cancer. The malignancy was cured by simultaneous radiation and
chemotherapy, a treatment that possibly precipitated six weeks in a
coma and a series of other medical crises.Subsequent
life-threatening kidney infections, pneumonia, agonizing
compression fractures and a permanently disabling heart attack soon
made her an invalid. An impatient patient, French, the author of
the novel ``The Women's Room,'' vowed she would ``remain a human
being, a thinker and a writer who was temporarily ill'' rather than
accept a life of debilitating illness.It was a vow that would
become impossible to keep.From grief and paralyzing depression to
fury and fleeting optimism, French obsessively documents her every
reaction, even asking ``the reader's indulgence'' for her ``long
recital of personal ills.'' Written ``to lay the past to rest,''
this memoir is flawed but fascinating.French tends to lecture. Her
frequent digressions into feminist dialectic and descriptions of
book tours are distracting and irritating.Her angry diatribes at
the medical establishment, when juxtaposed with a 46-year,
pack-a-day cigarette habit, seem misdirected, even petulant. ``My
illness shriveled the future up and blew it away,'' French
concludes, adding with some wonder that being ``stuck in the
present'' is the best thing that ever happened to her.Rarely
thinking beyond the next day, she has learned to savor the joy of
small moments, moving ``from pleasure to pleasure like a woman
walking through the halls of a great art gallery.'' _ LESLIE CHESS

   &UR; THE STORY OF OPERA &QL; 
 &UR; By Richard Somerset-Ward &QL; 
 &UR; Abrams, $49.50 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opera is an art form that has always required the collaboration
of many different kinds of people, all of them, to judge by THE
STORY OF OPERA (Abrams, $49.50), at least a little neurotic. About
Mlle. de Maupin (1673?-1707), a famous French contralto, for
example, Richard Somerset-Ward, a former head of music and arts
programming for BBC Television, writes, ``She made her debut as a
22-year-old in one of Lully's operas at the Academie, but by then
she had (in no particular order) married, run away with a fencing
master, taken vows as a nun in order to get into a nunnery to
seduce a girl with whom she had fallen in love, and been condemned
by a court in Avignon to be burned alive.'' This book, with a
fascinating and handsome picture or two on every page, is a serious
and lively history. The story begins in the late 16th century and
continues up to the present, tracing the swervings toward and away
from drama that are the form's essence. Plenty of mediocre operas
have been composed for famous castrati and prima donnas, but the
most important opera composers have always sought to involve the
audience in a human drama by creating music that powerfully
expresses the text. ``What changed in the 20th century was that
opera finally became a genuine branch of theater,'' Somerset-Ward
writes. ``The drama got on equal terms with the music.'' This book
persuasively describes opera as a thriving, complex art that has
never been more appealing than it is right now. _ RICK WHITAKER

THIS CHARACTER-DRIVEN FAMILY TALE A `CELEBRATION'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Funny, fiercely well-acted but hardly as
revolutionary as it wants to be, ``The Celebration'' (``Festen'')
is one of those family-secret exposes that doesn't reveal anything
too surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish film, which won a special jury prize at the Cannes
Film Festival, is about members of a far-flung clan reuniting at a
family-owned country lodge to honor their successful patriarch,
Helge (Henning Moritzen), on his 60th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   His three surviving adult children arrive with all their
problems in tow. Youngest, wildest Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen) comes
equipped with angry wife, misbehaving kids and drinking problem.
Blowzy sister Helene (Paprika Steen) has the latest in a long line
of boyfriends certain not to meet with her relatives' approval.
Self-contained Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), devastated by his twin
sister's recent suicide, has some kind of trouble in his
deceptively placid mind.
</P>
<P>
   As an elaborate banquet unfolds, accusations erupt. Siblings
take stands, then shift allegiances, all the while making a mockery
of Danish decorum. I won't reveal what ghastliness respectable
Helge may or may not have committed, but if you've seen any movie
about a dysfunctional family during the last two years, you won't
have much trouble guessing.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that saves ``Celebration'' from by-the-book
pseudo-outrageousness is the highly detailed, specific and
emotionally credible behavior of its participants. The movie was
directed and co-written by Thomas Vinterberg according to the
tenets of something called Dogme 95, a severe, Scandinavian list of
filmmaking do's and don'ts that emphasizes character honesty over
all other cinematic virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Including, evidently, such niceties as decent lighting. The
picture was shot with a $2,000 digital mini-videocam under strictly
available light conditions. This makes for unnecessarily degraded
images as the long day that ``Celebration'' covers journeys into
night. It's distracting and annoying and, worst of all,
self-consciously showy _ which, I think, is something Dogme dogma
theoretically considers sinful.

BELLE &AMP; SEBASTIAN/``The Boy With the Arab Strap'' (Matador)
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fragile left-field music of this enigmatic dream-pop octet
from scotland named for a French novel garners the kind of
superlatives rarely seen in this era of one-hit wonderdom. The
band's 1997 debut, ``If You're Feeling Sinister,'' was more
immediately lovable, so if ``The Boy With the Arab Strap'' is your
introduction to the darkly romantic songs of Belle's primary
singer-songwriter Stuart Murdoch, expect to spend some time with
the album. The production here is expansive, with muted horns and
overdubbed guitars weaving a spell around painterly songs that deal
with 20-something stroke victims (``It Could Have Been a Brilliant
Career''), wasted time (``A Summer Wasting''), promises of fame
(``Seymour Stein'') and a reflective walk in the park (``Sleep the
Clock Around''). A quiet beauty. {

SOUL COUGHING/``El Oso'' (Slash/Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Beck and the Beastie Boys, New York's Soul Coughing has
always been inspired by the beats and wordplay of hip-hop but for
the first time, the quartet has cooked up the grooves to match. On
this third album, singer-guitarist M. Doughty and company have
clearly been soaking up Euro drum 'n' bass rhythms as well, as
evidenced by the cyber-production skills of Brit dance-music
maestro Optical on two doomy tracks. As always, though, it's down
to Doughty's wry lyrics and sardonic delivery on such winners as
``So Far I Have Not Found the Science'' and ``Circles'' that put
this quirky noise across.

BOB DYLAN/``Live 1966: The `Royal Albert Hall' Concert (Bootleg
Series Vol. 4)'' (Columbia Legacy)
</P>
<P>
   The goon who shouted ``Judas!'' at the newly electrified Dylan
at a British venue more than 30 years ago didn't know it then, but
he was making rock history. That moment, replete with the angry
boos and hisses of hostile folk purists who couldn't stomach their
hero embracing an electric guitar and rock band, is captured here
along with Dylan's caustic retort: ``I don't believe you. You're a
liar.'' For more than a quarter-century, bootlegs of this
extraordinary gig have circulated, misnamed the Albert Hall concert
when it actually took place at Manchester's Free Trade Hall. In any
case, this superb two-CD document captures Dylan at the peak of his
powers, opening with a stirring solo acoustic set that includes
``She Belongs to Me,'' ``Fourth Time Around,'' ``Visions of
Johanna'' and a beautiful ``Desolation Row.'' The second disc
reveals Dylan and his backup group (later known as the Band)
scorching through ``Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,'' ``Leopard-Skin
Pill-Box Hat,'' ``Ballad of a Thin Man'' and ``Like a Rolling
Stone,'' which comes after the angry exchange with the audience.
Terrific stuff that recalls a time when rock music had the power to
divide.

SON VOLT/``Wide Swing Tremelo'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   Alt-country mainstays Son Volt seem to have embarked on a new
beginning with their third album. While the group's previous
release was mostly disappointing, ``Wide Swing Tremelo'' harkens
back to the quartet's eye-opening debut, ``Trace,'' with its weepy
pedal-steel, sagebrush-swaying acoustic guitars, well-crafted tunes
and leader Jay Farrar's rough, world-weary baritone. This time
around, the downbeat midtempo rockers are even more convincing and
hook-filled. At the heart of the matter, as always, are Farrar's
sublime vocals.

ARETHA FRANKLIN/``You Grow Closer'' (Peacock/MCA)

<P>
   At the tender age of 16, the Queen of Soul was already a force
of nature. Here are Aretha's first gospel recordings, made as a
teen in the '50s at her father's church in Detroit. The strength in
her voice, the jaw-dropping delivery, her intuitive feel for the
blues on such standout cuts as ``While the Blood Runs Warm,''
``Yield Not to Temptation'' and ``Never Grow Old'' immediately
brings the listener to the Aretha of today.

</P>
<P>
   Showcasing the intimacy and spontaneity of Santa Monica, Calif.,
public-radio KCRW-FM's studio, the latest volume in this popular
series highlights the familiar mix of established artists and
underground faves. Some of the best of the new crop includes the
six-minute opening track ``Cut Chemist Suite'' from popular club
act Ozomatli, a lovely ``Subterranean Homesick Alien'' by two
members of Radiohead, and a five-minute blast of vocal fireworks on
``So Real'' from the late Jeff Buckley.

THE BAND/``Jubilation'' (River North Records)
</P>
<P>
   With just three orginal members left, the Band marks the 30th
anniversary of the release of their groundbreaking debut, ``Music
From Big Pink,'' by recording 11 new songs, plus cameos from Eric
Clapton and John Hiatt, in a converted Woodstock, N.Y., barn. Still
able to put across warm folk-rock sounds and ragged rhythms, the
Band manages to create a vibe that's both familiar and fresh.
Clapton's solo on ``Last Train to Memphis'' is relaxed in the
front-porch style of J.J. Cale while Hiatt shares the microphone
with Rick Danko on the sturdy ``Bound by Love'' In the end,
``Jubilation'' is so good you almost don't miss Robbie Robertson.

CAKE/``Prolonging the Magic'' (Capricorn)
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll, stripped of fashion, can still be engaging _ the
proof is in a slice of Sacramento's Cake. The catchy songs, crisp
yet raw production, clever and absurdist lyrics come mainly from
John McRea who delivers the best ironic, monotone vocals since
Flash &AMP; the Pan. Following the band's brilliant 1996 breakthrough
disc ``Fashion Nugget,'' this album's standouts include ``Mexico,''
``Sheep Go to Heaven'' and ``Never There'' _ as fine a rock tune as
you'll never hear on radio. If you're among the lucky few to have
tickets to Cake's sold-out Troubadour show Oct. 26, feel free to
gloat. {

JACK SHELDON &AMP; RUSS TOMPKINS/ ``Class Act'' (Jadi)

<P>
   This recording pairs world-class musicians Sheldon (maybe best
known for his vocals on the animated ABC-TV Saturday morning
``Schoolhouse Rock'' shorts) on vocals and trumpet and Tompkins (a
20-year veteran of the ``Tonight Show'' orchestra) on piano.
Sheldon's voice brings a quiet resignation to the forlorn torch
songs here and Tompkins' tasty chops counterpoint delightfully. As
a duo, it's hard to tear into some of the standards here, so the
arrangements are suitably solemn. Although a heart-pounding swing
arrangement would improve the pace, the pure craftsmanship and
flourish are plenty.

 PREACHING TO THE CONVERTED 
 By JONATHAN LEAR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I find myself waiting for a New Yorker cocktail-party cartoon in
which the hostess says to a guest, ``Come meet Jason, he's the one
who hasn't written about the Lewinsky affair.'' Few events in
American history, at the time of their occurrences, have caused a
wider group of journalists, commentators, academics and politicians
to try to capture its significance. Indeed, part of what it is to
be a citizen today is to have had a conversation with one's
friends, colleagues and neighbors about what, in this whole mess,
matters. For though a federal judge said the Paula Jones lawsuit is
without merit, the case has functioned like the shot at Sarajevo in
1914: it brought to the cultural battlefield so many moral,
political, legal, sexual and esthetic issues that one has to
perform triage just to formulate a point of view.
</P>
<P>
   According to James Carville, ``it's the prosecutor, stupid!''
The fundamental evil is Kenneth W. Starr's abuse of a bad law to
subvert our democratic institutions and upend a presidential
election. ``...And the Horse He Rode In On'' doesn't pretend to be
anything other than it is: a full-throttle partisan critique, a
loud cry of ``foul play!'' For those who enjoy an occasional fix of
tabloid reading, this is what it would be like to read The New York
Post if it were owned by a billionaire Friend, rather than Enemy,
of Bill. Tabloid journalism tends, by its very nature, to preach to
the converted. But it tries to give them reasons for thinking that
their outlook is the right one. Since many Americans think that the
independent counsel exceeded his proper bounds, and many also
suspect that he has a vendetta on his mind, this is a piece of
tabloid writing for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Carvillean world looks something like this: First, there is
a right-wing conspiracy out to get Clinton. Among the most
prominent manifestations: Richard Mellon Scaife, the conservative
fourth-generation heir to a banking fortune, gave $1.7 million to
an ``Arkansas Project'' to dredge for dirt on President Clinton,
and actually ended up subsidizing scurrilous rumors. This money
found its way into the pockets of various unsavory characters,
among them David L. Hale, the only person willing to testify to
financial wrongdoing on Clinton's part in Whitewater. Another
manifestation: Judge David B. Sentelle conspired with Senators
Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth to remove Robert B. Fiske Jr. as
independent counsel and replace him with Kenneth W. Starr, a
right-wing Clinton-hater with blatant conflicts of interest willing
to take a poorly thought out statute to excess. After four years
and over $40 million, Carville notes, the only thing he produced
was a pornographic book and film with the president a reluctant
star. From bankruptcy to ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Carville argues, there has been a corrupt, and somewhat
unwitting, alliance between the press and the office of the
independent counsel. For the press, the ideal of Watergate
degenerated over a quarter-century into a competitive and
irresponsible scramble to uncover scandal. This led, in the first
instance, to confused reporting and the enhancement of rumors. More
important, Carville asserts, the press collaborated in trial by
leaks and rumors. To take one of the 24 examples he puts forward, a
``top official with the investigation'' told a journalist from The
New Yorker there was a 50-50 chance that the First Lady would be
indicted; this bounced its way around the world, defaming Hillary
Rodham Clinton and leading to nothing, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Carville's central thesis is breathtakingly simple: Ken
Starr is a creep. Carville begins with an unsettling vignette. In
October 1993, before he was appointed independent counsel, Starr,
then a perfect stranger, approached Carville (who is still an
adviser to Clinton) at Washington National Airport and started
haranguing him. ``Your boy's getting rolled,'' he said. Carville
buttresses his litany with the familiar and the less so, including
agents of Starr's office going to subpoena the 16-year-old son of a
Whitewater defendant at his school.
</P>
<P>
   Carville writes with the voice of Huckleberry Finn. Imagine that
Huck spent his early 20s on a plantation that Margaret Thatcher
bought for her retirement. She took him under her wing, and though
none of her views rubbed off on him, her in-your-face political
style did. ``I don't like Ken Starr,'' Carville says. ``I don't
like one damn thing about him.'' This book makes virtually no
mention of the many legitimate grounds for complaint one might have
about Clinton's behavior; it makes no mention of mitigating
circumstances or alternative explanations of Starr's methods.
Nevertheless, by the end of the book, I was convinced that there is
one certain good that has emerged from the Lewinsky affair: Kenneth
Starr will never serve on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, David Maraniss's book, ``The Clinton Enigma,'' does
pretend to be something it is not. The subtitle suggests
intriguingly that ``A Four-and-a-Half-Minute Speech Reveals This
President's Entire Life.'' Perhaps the president's Aug. 17 speech
does, but you won't find that out in this book. Indeed, the
strategy Maraniss uses is almost precisely the reverse: as
Clinton's biographer, he uses what he knows about Clinton's life
and personality to try to illuminate the speech. But even read that
way, the book is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about the narrative is how staged it is. It
begins with Maraniss placing himself at the edge of the drama: ``I
suppose it had to come to this, I thought to myself as I sat in the
darkness of the NBC studio.'' And on to Chapter 2: ``Memories of
other encounters with Clinton came back to me as I waited in the
studio for him to deliver his fateful speech.'' What an
accommodating inner life Maraniss has, flowing along in just the
right way to begin his next book. I was reminded of a B movie in
which a reporter is waiting in the audience, the camera closes in
on his head, on his eye, and suddenly you are inside a flashback.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-CLINTON-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; (UNDATED: flashback.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the argument that it is somehow psychologically
revealing that Clinton ducked being interviewed by Maraniss. After
his biography, ``First in His Class,'' came out, Maraniss had heard
that Clinton ``hated the half of it that was critical of him and
that had revealed the patterns of his duplicity.'' Dick Morris told
him that ``the few portions of the book that examined his sex life
upset the First Lady so much that she had turned 'frosty' on the
President for several weeks.'' Yet it strikes Maraniss as
``peculiar'' that Clinton doesn't want to see him. After all, his
account was ``mild'' compared with some of the salacious stories
being printed and, anyway, ``Mrs. Clinton had been dealing with her
husband's waywardness for more than two decades -- why would my
book trigger such a fierce reaction?'' Is this a man you want to
turn to for psychological insight? (As for the ``fierce reaction,''
it seems just a simple interview-evasion technique, straight out of
Political Survival 101.)
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss is hurt that Clinton won't see him. In a ``final
memory,'' Clinton does come up to Maraniss to congratulate him on
winning an award and has little more to say than ``nice tie.''
Later, when George Stephanopoulos tells him the obscenity ``nice
tie'' is code for, Maraniss doesn't pause to wonder what
Stephanopoulos is doing; he simply joins the club of rejected,
angry men impelled to write about their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   When we purportedly get to the speech, in Chapter 5, what we
really get is a rambling association of family-history cliches and
psychobabble: ``For every shadow of darkness in Hot Springs, there
was a corresponding ray of light''; ``The men had a way of
compartmentalizing their lives''; ``Clinton's tendency toward
denial''; ``He might have a sexual addiction''; ``There is ample
evidence of powerful men whose political ambitions seemed matched
only by their sexual appetites''; ``Hillary's role as defender and
perhaps enabler''; ``his razor-sharp ambition''; ``The need to
rationalize was always there with Clinton,'' and so on. The
banality comes to feel like an assault. The only moment of relief
comes toward the end of the book, when, trying to explain the deep
animosity some people have for Clinton, Maraniss says, ``My answers
have never fully satisfied me.''

  The Secret Case Against Bill Gates 
 By Wendy Goldman Rohm 
 Illustrated. 313 pp. New York: Times Business/Random House. $25.95 
 ------ 
 THEY DO WINDOWS 
 By JOHN MARKOFF 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Bill Gates. Not so long ago, the world's richest man was
almost universally acclaimed as a computer hacker turned
information-age visionary. But now that image is coming under
increasing attack. The comparisons are no longer to contemporaries
like Steven P. Jobs but to John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   In the revised view of Gates and his empire, the Microsoft
Corporation's business practices are predicated not on innovation
but on the leverage the company maintains through its control of
the Windows operating system, the software that serves as the
traffic cop for the overwhelming majority of the world's personal
computers. A growing chorus of critics asserts that the operating
system has given Microsoft extraordinary power over its
competitors. The blame is placed squarely on Gates's shoulders for
creating a corporate culture that has systematically imitated
technological innovation and then destroyed industry pioneers with
slash-and-burn business dealings. The critics say that by
arbitrarily redefining what is part of the operating system, by
tying new services and software applications to the program and by
attempting to extend Windows into new markets like cable
television, Microsoft has violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The darker side of Gates and Microsoft is explored in ``The
Microsoft File,'' by Wendy Goldman Rohm, who has reported on the
computer industry for many years. She sets out to draw an
unflattering portrait of Gates and his company based in part on
documents from the antitrust suits that are now swirling around
Microsoft. To her credit, she has unearthed new documents and
incidents, largely dating back to the early 1990's, when Microsoft
was concerned about a competing operating system, DR-DOS, designed
by Digital Research.
</P>
<P>
   There are intriguing parallels in the tactics she describes that
appear to foreshadow events in the more recent war between
Microsoft and the Netscape Communi ncations Corporation. In both
cases, Microsoft was threatened by a company that attacked its
operating-system monopoly. In each case, Microsoft used its
licensing power over personal computer makers to freeze out a
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, for example, Vobis Microcomputer was a major
personal computer maker that in the early 1990's sold its machines
with DR-DOS rather than Microsoft's MS-DOS. According to Rohm,
Microsoft first undercut the DR-DOS price and then insisted that
Vobis sign a per-processor licensing agreement. By linking its
operating-systems license to the availability of its Word and Excel
word-processing and spreadsheet programs, Microsoft's German sales
manager was able to persuade Vobis to stop offering DR-DOS.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, years later Microsoft sent a letter to the Compaq
Computer Corporation threatening to end its license for Windows if
it continued to include Netscape's Navigator Web browser. It was
that action that led Netscape's president, James Barksdale, to
approach the Justice Department about antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   But while ``The Microsoft File'' uncovers previously unknown
though largely dated evidence documenting Microsoft's predatory
business practices, the book fails in its broader attempt to take
the reader inside Gates's mind. Hanging much of the narrative on a
romantic triangle involving a former female Microsoft executive,
Gates and his head attorney, William Neukom, Rohm attempts to tell
us what Gates was thinking. It doesn't work. The reader is given no
hint of how Rohm, who apparently spent no time interviewing Gates
about personal subjects, would have found out about such details.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the stories may have emerged from pillow
talk by participants that she hints she has had access to. But if
that is the case, why revert to more perfunctory attribution with
the standard ``according to an insider present at the time''?
Unfortunately, what the reader is left with is a one-dimensional
picture of the man who has defined the industry for more than two
decades.

SWEET CHARITY?
</HEADLINE>
  Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement 
 By Janet Poppendieck 
 354 pp. New York: Viking. $26.95

 SPARE A DIME? 
 By DANA MILBANK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each Wednesday morning I get up early to volunteer at a local
soup kitchen. I pour the juice, clean the tables and, with a bit of
luck, get to scramble the eggs or stir the oatmeal. I often wonder
whether it does much good. The place is not terribly efficient, and
it has more volunteers than it can use. But, hey, I'm trying. It
eases the guilt when I pass a panhandler on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, comes Janet Poppendieck, a sociology professor at
Hunter College, to say that I am part of the problem. As a
volunteer, I have unwittingly joined a nefarious plot to undermine
and replace the government safety net with an inadequate private
network of food pantries and soup kitchens. ``The proliferation of
charity contributes to our society's failure to grapple in
meaningful ways with poverty,'' Poppendieck says in her book,
``Sweet Charity?'' Soup kitchens have created a moral safety valve
that lets government off the hook for the nation's poor, writes
Poppendieck, who sees a right-wing conspiracy that uses soup
kitchens and food pantries to justify destroying the welfare
system: ``In short, by engaging the contributions of millions of
donors and volunteers, emergency food has 'proven' the conservative
contention that voluntary sector programs are 'cheaper' than public
sector efforts.'' Feeding programs meant by their organizers to
offset the decline of public benefits are being used instead to
justify further cuts.
</P>
<P>
   This raises an important point that Congress, which overhauled
the welfare system in 1996, still has not addressed. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other proponents of that reform hope the
legislation will spark a charitable revival, because nonprofit
organizations, Gingrich says, get more done at less cost. That's
true enough, but the nation's charities simply aren't big or strong
enough to take on the role supporters of the welfare reform measure
want for them. The government, by some estimates, spends 10 times
as much as charities spend on the poor, and charities get about a
quarter of their own funds from the government. Churches and other
charities would need to double or even triple their budgets just to
offset the cuts that are allowed under the welfare reform law. And
Americans, who give under 2 percent of their income to charity,
clearly aren't going to pick up the slack on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Poppendieck sullies this timely argument by
pairing it with an unworkable solution. She wants the government to
raise taxes, spend more money and rebuild a welfare state. And she
wants charities to spend less time being charitable and more time
lobbying the government to put them out of business. The act of
feeding the hungry, she says, ``could probably be accomplished far
more simply by raising the food stamp allotment, or the minimum
wage.'' Volunteers, in essence, should drop their oatmeal ladles
and call their representatives. ``Because food programs are
logistically demanding, their maintenance absorbs the attention and
energy of many of the people most concerned about the poor,
distracting them from the larger issues of distributional
politics,'' she writes. Her argument amounts to cursing the
darkness instead of lighting a candle -- or, more accurately,
lobbying Congress about the darkness so the government can turn on
the lights.
</P>
<P>
   We have been down this road before. Poppendieck, admirably,
wants to ``unite and integrate people'' instead of ``separating and
segregating them.'' But the very government programs Poppendieck
wishes to revive with vast new financing have proved powerless to
stop increases in inequality. Worse, they have encouraged
dependency and the sort of permanent, segregated underclass that
she rightfully deplores. Poppendieck herself notes that inequality
has grown to its worst in half a century -- this despite all the
government's poverty programs. The debate has moved from cash
handouts to jobs and ways to help the poor help themselves. But
Poppendieck takes us through a time warp back to the rhetoric of
the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   She began her project seven years ago, and changing times have
made holes in her argument. We hear about how rampant unemployment
spurs demand for emergency food. ``Our overall rate in the United
States averaged 4.6 percent in the 1968-73 period and 7.2 percent
in the 1980-89 period,'' she writes. Fine, but this is 1998, and
the latest jobless figures are at 4.6 percent, yet demand for
emergency food continues to soar. Indeed, Poppendieck barely
mentions some of the most significant reasons people land in soup
kitchens: mental illness and drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Charity?'' is far more convincing as a sociological
study than as a political action plan. Author of ``Breadlines Knee
Deep in Wheat: Food Assistance in the Great Depression'' (1986),
Poppendieck tells the interesting story of the rise of emergency
food distributed through food pantries as groceries and through
soup kitchens as meals. Their rise began in the early 1980's when
the federal government, sitting on vast surpluses of dairy
products, began a cheese give-away, thus creating a need for the
pantries and kitchens to distribute the food. This became
institutionalized in 1983 when Congress created the Temporary
Emergency Food Assistance Program, which was not, as it turns out,
temporary. The increased supply fed the demand, and everyone --
corporations, politicians, celebrities -- had selfish motives to
continue the program. Eventually, the program switched from being a
temporary surplus disposal program to a permanent food procurement
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Charity?'' demonstrates, convincingly, that the growing
emphasis on emergency food for the hungry is a Band-Aid that
distracts from the fundamental goal of solving poverty. But it does
not entertain the idea that charitable work is as much a part of
the solution as government intervention. Poppendieck rightly senses
reluctance among charities and volunteers to turn themselves into
lobbyists, as she proposes. ``Volunteers are often less
enthusiastic about advocacy than about direct service,'' she
writes. ``Preparing a meal with a group of other people and serving
it is fun; writing to your representative is work.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe these volunteers believe that the government is not the
only answer. Indeed, many charities are working on substantive
solutions to poverty, though the notion gets scant mention in the
book. Many soup kitchens, including the one at which I volunteer,
offer a whole range of rehabilitative services: job search
programs, job training, alcohol and drug treatment, care for the
mentally ill, community organizing. Government, of course, must do
its part. It cannot abandon its responsibility for the poor. But,
rather than supplanting charities, government can --and should --
do more to strengthen them.
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas have already been floated. A group of lawmakers, for
example, is promoting a charity tax credit that would give each
taxpayer a $500 credit for donations to charities dealing with the
poor; this would bring billions to nonprofits. The states, under
the new welfare law, are also boosting charities in new ways. In
Michigan, for example, the state has financed a group of churches
that offer mentoring for welfare recipients, providing help with
child care, car payments and groceries. But the church volunteers
also offer friendship and encouragement to build self-esteem. That
is the sort of thing the government cannot provide -- at any price.

THE FIX
</HEADLINE>
  By Michael Massing 
 335 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $25 
 ------ 
 JUST SAYING 'NO' IS NOT ENOUGH 
 By DAVID F. MUSTO 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Massing has been writing about drug issues in the United
States for a decade. He believes the central problem to be the
hard-core users of heroin and cocaine, who are ``disproportionately
poor, unemployed and members of minority groups.'' Although
hard-core users are only a fifth of total users, they consume
three-fourths of the cocaine and heroin used in this country and
are responsible for most of the pathological behavior that elicits
public and governmental responses. If we could provide appropriate
treatment to anyone in this population who wanted it, Massing
maintains, the whole drug problem would diminish, as would the
illness and crime associated with it. The result of Massing's
investigation is ``The Fix,'' a balanced and significant analysis
of the American drug problem that carries specific, practical
recommendations for reform.
</P>
<P>
   He separates himself from the ``legalization/harm-reduction
camp'' that asserts that drug-related diseases and social pathology
are the fault of drug-control laws themselves. Having spent long
periods observing drug treatment centers, roaming the streets of
Harlem and hanging out with drug users, he has experienced a
``real-life rebuttal to the rosy accounts of addiction offered by
the revisionists.'' Regardless of the drug laws, addiction and drug
use create terrible conditions: child abuse reports in New York
rose from 36,000 in 1985 to 59,000 in 1989 when the crack epidemic
hit the city. Massing's approach contrasts with recent books like
Mike Gray's ``Drug Crazy,'' which calls for a radical revision of
our drug laws. Gray describes a golden age of drug use prior to the
Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, when ``the country had looked upon
addicts as unfortunate citizens with a medical problem.'' To right
current wrongs, he recommends that we put the provision of drugs
``back in the hands of doctors and pharmacists.''
</P>
<P>
   Massing also distances his position from apostles of draconian
penalties and those who put their faith in interdiction. His middle
way has one clear emphasis, and that is comprehensive treatment. He
knows this would work because we had such a program once; it
succeeded wonderfully, but we let it slip away. We were therefore
unable to mount a powerful defense against cocaine and crack in the
mid-1980's, and now we have 10 times as many hard-core users as we
faced during the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's strategy aimed directly at reducing crime in
anticipation of the 1972 election. Treatment was part of a broad
program that included foreign policy to shut down the
Turkish-French connection; the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement
to attack street crime; the Internal Revenue Service to go after
illicit profits. That crime reduction held first place among
Nixon's priorities -- not the care of addicts -- is illustrated by
the administration's surprising willingness to adopt methadone, a
synthetic opiate, as its preferred treatment for heroin users. At
the time, a high-ranking official in the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs told me that the bureau would hand out heroin if it
thought that would cut crime. This attitude was surprising because
the substitution of one addiction by another contradicted the
previously adamant stand by Nixon's adherents against any drug use.
</P>
<P>
   How did Nixon come to approve the financing of methadone
treatment for tens of thousands of addicts? Massing draws on
interviews with key actors and internal government documents to
provide an answer. The most persuasive element was the methadone
program developed in Washington by Robert DuPont, later the
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Heroin use was
skyrocketing; crime was rampant. In his 1968 campaign Nixon had
declared that ``D. C. should not stand for disorder and crime.''
Washington became the laboratory for national drug policies. In
1970 DuPont, with support from the White House, established the
Narcotics Treatment Administration, which was soon flooded with
applicants. Although nondrug treatment was also offered, methadone
appeared to cut the crime rate quickly, and that impressed the
President and his aides. By the 1972 election crime had fallen by
50 percent in the District of Columbia, an achievement that was
widely broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the methadone program was only one of the actions
taken to reduce crime in Washington. Even Egil Krogh, the Nixon
aide most responsible for creating the political will for this
ambitious national treatment program, did not know if the program
was responsible for the drop in crime, but he knew that from a
political perspective, ``it was a slam-dunk great success.''
</P>
<P>
   Massing has no doubts about the success of the treatment
program. His conviction comes from his encounter with Nixon's drug
expert, Jerome Jaffe, a psychopharmacologist and psychiatrist
plucked in 1970 from the University of Chicago, where he had
established a treatment program that employed a range of options,
including drug-free therapy. He was asked first to head a committee
of experts from outside the government to come up with a response
to drug addiction. His report was practical rather than theoretical
and named methadone as the best treatment for heroin addiction (the
major addiction at that time) and the best way to reduce crime.
Following the adoption of what was basically his proposal, Jaffe
entered government service.
</P>
<P>
   His first big administrative assignment was to deal with
addicted Army personnel coming back from Vietnam. This he did with
ingenuity and dispatch, and then began work as the ``drug czar,''
the first head of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Policy.
Jaffe was neither a good administrator nor an adept politician --
he was a scientist. Many of his psychiatric and scientific
colleagues distrusted him for working with Nixon. Some critics
lambasted him in the most vitriolic terms for advocating methadone;
they described the program as an enslavement of minorities. In
Massing he has found a vindicator.
</P>
<P>
   Massing advocates Jaffe's ``code,'' a set of principles that
summed up his approach to drug use: ``Chronic drug users are at the
heart of the nation's drug problem; a diverse array of services is
required; government must assure their availability and efficacy;
law enforcement is an adjunct to rehabilitation and, always,
reducing demand for drugs through education and treatment must take
precedence over law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of
drugs. Massing says the Nixon administration, following the Jaffe
prescription, managed to bring a ``serious heroin epidemic'' under
control ``in a few short years.''
</P>
<P>
   Massing recommends setting up an organization like the Special
Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention that would engage only in
reducing demand for illicit drugs, to be headed by a ``C. Everett
Koop-type figure'' and backed in the White House by a facsimile of
Egil Krogh -- that is, a high-ranking White House official whose
special province would be drug abuse. A comprehensive national
treatment program for drug and alcohol abuse should be established.
In Massing's view, the most unfortunate mistake in the recent
history of drug programs was the government's shift of emphasis
from heroin to marijuana, in response to increased complaints by
parents, during the latter half of the Carter administration.
Treatment for the hard core shriveled. During the Reagan
administration the amount spent for treatment in real dollars fell
to less than a quarter of what had been provided in the Nixon
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Massing's powerful arguments for more treatment programs,
especially methadone, must be put into a larger historical context.
The 1970's witnessed the climax of a long-simmering reaction
against law enforcement as the chief tool against drug abuse. That
era of toleration, however, peaked about 1980, and since then we
have been on a slope leading toward intolerance of drug use. Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani's attack on methadone maintenance is a recent
example of opposition to any drug use by former users. As valuable
as methadone may be for some (and I believe it can be helpful), it
is an uphill battle to justify it to those who have zero tolerance
for drugs. Can a national policy that was feasible in 1970 be
resurrected three decades later in a less friendly climate?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remarkable claims for treatment in the early 1970s must
be tempered by the knowledge that most people in trouble with drugs
were taking heroin, for which methadone is a stabilizing
replacement. Today, cocaine users are the vast majority of the
hard-core population, a problem for which methadone is useless.
Massing's recommendations are too valuable to be oversold.

THE LOST TOMB

 SPLENDID DIGS 
 By JOHN RAY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time there were two brothers. Contrary to the usual
pattern, the younger, whose name was Decimus Burton, worked hard
for a living and went on to be a distinguished architect. The
elder, James, was a wastrel. A Cambridge graduate, he turned up in
Egypt looking for coal mines, but he soon found more interesting
things. In the slave market in Cairo he acquired a Greek woman,
whom he later married, and in 1835 he returned to England with an
entourage consisting of his wife, other redeemed slaves and a
troupe of performing animals. These were not the virtues that had
triumphed at Waterloo, and his father disowned him. Not that this
deterred James; he simply sold his large collection of Pharaonic
antiquities and lived well enough off the proceeds until his death
at 73.
</P>
<P>
   In 1825, James Burton had found himself in the Valley of the
Kings, which was then scarcely explored. At some point he decided
to rummage inside a tomb near the entrance to the valley. It was in
a very poor state, and so dangerous that further exploration seemed
pointless. Burton drew a quick sketch plan, and left his name in
lampblack on the ceiling of the main chamber. There were other
things for him to do in the valley. The sketch of the tomb, which
is now known as KV 5, passed together with the rest of his papers
to the British Museum. These papers have scarcely been studied,
even by other Egyptologists.
</P>
<P>
   With the confidence of hindsight we can say that Burton's quick
map, incomplete as it is, is enough to show that there is something
strange about KV 5. The entrance bears the name of Ramses II, a
character familiar to every visitor to Egypt, and one of the great
monomaniacs of history. One school of thought makes him the Pharaoh
of the Exodus, and his essential odiousness was captured by Yul
Brynner in the 1956 film ``The Ten Commandments.'' Perhaps KV 5 was
a false start by one of the Pharaoh's architects, something quite
likely in a reign devoted to ceaseless building and ever more
grandiose plans.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's strange tomb is now famous, so much so that it has been
given the indispensable feature of celebrity, its own Web site.
Since 1989 it has been partly explored and cleared by a team headed
by Kent R. Weeks, an Egyptologist with the American University in
Cairo, who gives us the story in ``The Lost Tomb.'' KV 5 is to the
ordinary tomb in the Valley of the Kings, like Tutankhamen's, what
a supermarket is to the corner shop. Unfortunately, it contains
hardly anything of its original contents, but at last count the
number of its chambers totaled 108, and there are certainly more to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside this tomb means coming to terms with rock falls,
malodorous dust and faulty electrical supplies. A modern sewage
pipe runs through part of it, and it leaks. But painstaking
clearance can recover things. One of the original decorators, in
about 1270 B.C., kicked over a dish of blue pigment in a dark
corner, perhaps at the end of a shift (ancient lamp wicks were
timed to last four hours). The paint was still there, after more
than 32 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It may never have been the tidiest tomb in the valley, but KV 5
was certainly the biggest. Little was known about it before Weeks
began his work, though the Egyptologist Elizabeth Thomas had
guessed that it could be the tomb of the royal children of Ramses
II, which is mentioned in an official report about tomb robberies
prepared by a commission of government inspectors a couple of
centuries after KV 5 was built. Another court transcript, written
about 50 years after the death of Ramses, describes how a workman
named Kenena, son of Ruta, was caught stripping stone from above
the tomb, either because he liked the stone in that particular spot
or because he was looking for a way in.
</P>
<P>
   KV 5 may have remained intact for centuries, but the eventual
breakdown of administration allowed a later generation of tomb
robbers to go about its work in peace. However, enough fragments of
inscriptions and broken statuettes remained to show that Elizabeth
Thomas was right. Ramses, like any Mafia boss, had great plans for
his family, and why should these plans not extend to the afterlife
as well? His sons were going to join the gods. Ramses boasted about
50 sons, and there may have been others he did not boast about. The
seeds of future anarchy were already in place, in a country where
Ramses' monumental ambitions may well have helped to bankrupt the
government.
</P>
<P>
   He was succeeded by his 13th son, Merenptah, a 60-year-old of
proven mediocrity. The fourth son, on the other hand, was
Khaemwese, an intellectual who deserves to be known as the first
Egyptologist in history. His inscriptions show deep piety,
scholarship and an acute historical sense. Perhaps Khaemwese took
after his mother. Neither of these princes was buried in KV 5, but
others must have been. So far the names of four sons have been
found in the tomb, and four skulls have been identified. This is
presumably a coincidence, given the size of the monument and its
complexity. However, the chambers of KV 5 are on the small side for
conventional royal burials, and its true history is not yet clear.
Perhaps enough remains farther inside the tomb to fill out the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks tells his account readably, though at the expense of a
little repetition and loose organization. He is generous toward
colleagues, and he has an obvious affection for his Egyptian
workmen, together with the ordinary inhabitants of Luxor, whose
livelihoods in tourism have been damaged by recent terrorist
actions. This affection extends to their ancestors, whose lives as
masons, painters and quarrymen he is good at picturing.
</P>
<P>
   He seems sanguine in the face of a discovery that has
interrupted all his schedules and that promises decades of work to
come. He reconstructs Ramses' motive as an attempt to deify himself
in his own lifetime, an idea that involves him in resurrecting a
theory about the heretic Pharaoh Akhenaten occupying the throne at
the same time as his own father. Most Egyptologists had been hoping
that this theory was dead and gone, since it appears to raise more
problems than it solves. But we are still far from understanding
how ancient Egypt worked, and there is little doubt that KV 5 has
yet to tell us all its secrets.

 THE WHEREABOUTS OF ENEAS McNULTY 
 By Sebastian Barry 
 308 pp. New York: Viking. $23.95  By AOIBHEANN SWEENEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The happy childhood is hardly worth your while,'' Frank
McCourt writes in ``Angela's Ashes,'' his memoir of a miserable
Irish childhood, and it seems true enough. These days, nothing
really goes down without a good dose of irony. ``No happy
stories,'' a friend of mine tells his writing classes at the
beginning of each semester, and he means it. After all, who's going
to read them?
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Barry's novel ``The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty''
opens with an unabashedly joyous account of Eneas McNulty's
childhood in Sligo. It is full of ``the utter merriment of
mornings,'' ``gangs of wallflowers'' and a ``thrumming of crickets
to beat the band.'' Eneas has a Pappy who plays the piccolo and a
Mam who dances a jig by the hearth. Though misery closes in on
Eneas with satisfactory swiftness, Barry's sweet, lyrical pitch
never falters; the novel has a bold measure of old-fashioned
blessedness.
</P>
<P>
   The author of three collections of poems, three books of prose
and several plays about the history of Ireland (including ``The
Steward of Christendom''), Barry affords himself a little
sentimentality by assiduously pinning his hero's fate to its
historical context. The opening of the book describes Ireland's
childhood as well as Eneas's: these are the days just before ``your
man Pearse and the rest'' make history with the Easter Rising --
Ireland has not yet seized independence.
</P>
<P>
   As Eneas reaches his 20's and World War I comes to an end, he
finds himself out of work among the returning veterans. In a muddle
of innocence and despair, ``Eneas looks at it all with simple eyes
and having no desire to loiter the rest of his days, joins at the
hint of his Pappy the Royal Irish Constabulary,'' the English-led
police force. ``Ferocious events are afoot in the sacred web of
fields and rainy towns'': Ireland has awakened, and as his father
gently puts it, ``It's a bad sort of time to have your head up, you
know, in any class of political matter.'' In his ``bright peaked
cap and shining boots,'' Eneas quickly ends up on the Irish
Republican Army's blacklist. His boyhood friend Jonno Lynch has
become one of the I.R.A.'s enforcers and delivers his death
sentence just as the Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed. Eneas flees the
Irish Free State to spend the rest of his days in fear and exile,
while Ireland spends the ensuing years in civil war and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Eneas is as long-suffering and piously devoted to his homeland
as his classical namesake, but unlike Virgil's hero, he is no
nation-builder. Though he ``weeps mightily'' at the sight of the
land whenever he dares return, his ``childhood singing in him,'' he
has nothing but scorn for the ``murdering likes'' of the
self-important men who are ``driving the pony and trap of
Ireland.'' In exile, ``fierce, close work'' becomes his only
directive. He humbly fishes, bearded and tired, the waters of
Greenland; he binds the vines of France with ``the same stooping,
the same peering and care''; he drives his spade into 200 miles of
Nigerian soil, digging a canal to bring water to the ``numbed
countryside'' of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what makes Eneas McNulty a hero is the very ``fire
of concern and regard'' that glows so cozily in the hearth of his
youth. Barry vividly creates Eneas's warm humanity. Whether he is
standing deaf on the beaches of Dunkirk, watching the moon
``blowing like a flag'' or sitting up ``in the ragged dark''
listening to his friend Harcourt ``breathing lightly in the mercy
of sleep,'' Eneas's tenderness is powerfully apparent and casts a
gentle, clarifying light on the hardship around him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is easy to find virtue in a lonely man, much the way
it might be to find joy in childhood -- but in the murk of war it
seems all the more necessary to do so. Eneas McNulty's happy
childhood provides a momentary glimpse at the stark, troubling
contours of Ireland's somber history.

 THE BOYS: 
 The Untold Story of 732 Young Concentration Camp Survivors 
 By Martin Gilbert. Owl/Holt, $16.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A seasoned custodian of the memory of the Holocaust puts a human
face on the catastrophe by letting a remarkable group of mostly
Polish Jews recall their childhood ordeals. Last year our reviewer,
Michael R. Marrus, called this a ``remarkable volume . . . about
survival and painful, vivid, individual memories of surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BELIEVERS: &QL; 
 &UR; A Novella and Stories &QL; 
 &UR; By Charles Baxter &QL; 
 &UR; Vintage Contemporaries, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These psychologically dense tales track the unpredictable
destinies of ordinary Midwesterners, often focusing on the internal
struggle between the forces of love and violence. ``It's the
eloquence of the language -- the quirky intelligence, the humor,
the lively rhythmic assurance of sentences and paragraphs -- along
with the surprising plots, that makes these stories such a pleasure
to read,'' Francine Prose said here last year. The same publisher
has reissued an earlier collection by the author,  &UR; ``Through the
Safety Net: Stories'' &LR;  ($13), which features many middle-class
characters estranged from life -- a couple paralyzed by the death
of their child, for example, or a perpetual graduate student dazed
by the real world. In 1985 in the Book Review, Ron Hansen called
these 11 stories ``original, gracefully written, always moving,
frequently funny and -- that rarest of compliments -- wise.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEARER, MY GOD: &QL; 
 &UR; An Autobiography of Faith &QL; 
 &UR; By William F. Buckley Jr. &QL; 
 &UR; Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The author may be an imposing public intellectual but he's also
a devout Christian, and this unusually personal essay is both a
celebration of his lifelong Roman Catholicism and a doctrinal
apologia for the church. ``It is certain to provide many insights
into the mind of a polished writer . . . and it will do much to
explain how the hopefully changeless faith of a Catholic jibes with
the politics of a late-20th-century American political
conservative,'' William R. Everdell wrote here in 1997. In
 &UR; ``Living Faith,'' &LR;  by Jimmy Carter (Times Books/Random House, $13),
the former president laces his spiritual self-portrait with poems,
Scripture and frank revelations about his personal and political
lives. The book, which includes a new preface by Carter, is ``an
appealing, straightforward account of a life marked, as many are,
by unexpected successes and crushing failures,'' Michael Wright
said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LUCKY YOU &QL; 
 &UR; By Carl Hiaasen &QL; 
 &UR; Warner Vision, $7.50 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JoLayne Lucks doesn't have much good fortune in the romance
department, but things look up when she wins half of a $28 million
prize in the Florida lottery: the trouble is, the other winners are
two dirtball white supremacists who aim to rip her off. ``Hiaasen
writes witty dialogue that crackles, and his characters are
eccentrically colorful,'' Charles Salzberg said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Goldwyn: A Biography &QL; 
 &UR; By A. Scott Berg &QL; 
 &UR; Riverhead, $16 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The legendary mogul who set Hollywood in motion was an inspired
ruffian whose outsize ambitions and appetites make for terrific
reading. ``This story of a grabby but imaginative man would make a
more telling movie about America . . . than Goldwyn ever produced
himself,'' Mordecai Richler wrote here in 1989. On a smaller stage,
 &UR; ``How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a
Dime,'' &LR;  by Roger Corman with Jim Jerome (Da Capo, $14.95),
explains how the schlockmeister responsible for fare like ``Bloody
Mama'' was able to become a major independent force in filmmaking
while running an absurdly tight ship. ``Corman comes across as
likable, admirable and, in his ability to survive in Hollywood with
his integrity intact, even awe-inspiring,'' Barry Gewen wrote here
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BYRNE &QL; 
 &UR; By Anthony Burgess &QL; 
 &UR; Carroll &AMP; Graf, $10.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The author's final novel is an audacious hybrid even for a
lifelong experimentalist: the story of a minor modern composer
whose real skills are in the bedroom unfolds in novelistic fashion
but entirely in rhymed verse. Last year our reviewer, Dana Gioia,
called this ``genuinely astonishing -- a complex dark comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PLATYPUS AND THE MERMAID: &QL; 
 &UR; And Other Figments of the Classifying Imagination &QL; 
 &UR; By Harriet Ritvo &QR; 
 &UR; Harvard University, $15.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A history professor chronicles the Victorian obsession with
classifying and categorizing God's creatures, particularly as they
relate to man and the dinner table. Last year in the Book Review,
Stefan Collini called this an ``entertaining and informative tour
of both the highroads and the hedgerows of natural history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TEEN ANGEL: &QL; 
 &UR; And Other Stories of Wayward Love &QL; 
 &UR; By Marianne Gingher &QL; 
 &UR; Zuckerman Cannon, $14 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The adolescent characters who populate these inventive tales
somehow manage to be both quirky and down to earth despite the
broken adult relationships around them. ``Gingher possesses a
stylistic deftness and a flair for comic detail,'' W. L. Taitte
said here in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT &QL; 
 &UR; By Ann Patchett &QL; 
 &UR; Harvest, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a gay Los Angeles magician named Parsifal dies suddenly, he
leaves behind his heartbroken assistant, Sabine, and a secret past
that leads her to Nebraska and a family she never knew he had. Last
year our reviewer, Suzanne Berne, called the author ``an adroit,
graceful writer.''

MY YEAR OFF

 COMMOTION IN THE BRAIN 
 By ABRAHAM VERGHESE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a trick to ordinary living that has to do with pushing
far from the mind all thoughts of the maladies that befall hundreds
of people every day. Resolutely, we ignore newspaper headlines that
remind us of the dangers lurking in the workplace, on the freeway
and even (thanks to radon) in the basement. And we ignore the
annoying paradox that when we are having the most fun we are often
doing things that might be bad for us.
</P>
<P>
   This is why illness comes most often as a shock, as if the veil
has been stripped away to show us how vulnerable we really are.
Coleridge noted that it is the convalescent who sees the world in
its true colors. Indeed, illness has stimulated many a writer to
look back: one thinks immediately of Harold Brodkey's AIDS memoir,
``This Wild Darkness: The Story of My Death,'' and Anatole
Broyard's ``Intoxicated by My Illness.'' What makes Robert McCrum's
story distinctive is that the stroke that felled him affected the
very part of the body that must recall the illness and find the
language to describe what happened, even as language and speech
themselves are disrupted. This quality of the brain observing
itself is what gives ``My Year Off'' its particular poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   When his stroke occurred, Robert McCrum was just 42 years old;
he was the editor in chief of Faber &AMP; Faber, the London publishing
house, and also an acclaimed writer. He had been married a mere two
months (to Sarah Lyall, a journalist who writes for The New York
Times) when he awoke one morning unable to get out of bed. His wife
was away in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to drive to Cambridge that morning to visit my
parents. So, time to get up. But there it was -- I could not move.
More accurately, I could not move my left side. Overnight, my body
had become a dead weight.'' In attempting to get off the bed, he
fell to the floor and then half-fell, half-crawled down the stairs.
It took him all day, slipping in and out of consciousness, to get
to the downstairs phone and make the call for help. At the
hospital, it was clear that he had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage,
for which no obvious cause (such as raised blood pressure or an
aneurysm) was apparent.
</P>
<P>
   During his convalescence, McCrum found ``the enforced leisure
and opportunity to explore myself, to analyze what made me tick and
to discover what mattered to me. Alone in my room, with only my
right arm functioning properly (my right leg, though intact, was of
no real use to me in this state), and with the demons of physical
exhaustion constantly at hand, I began to keep a diary.'' His wife
also kept one, and excerpts from both serve to reconstruct much of
what patient and spouse were feeling and thinking during these
difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two weeks after his stroke, McCrum copied out a passage
from Marcus Aurelius' ``Meditations'': ``In the life of a man, his
time is but a moment, his being an incessant flux, his senses a dim
rushlight, his body a prey of worms, his soul an unquiet eddy, his
fortune dark and his fame doubtful. In short, all that is of the
body is as coursing waters, all that is of the soul as dreams and
vapors; life a warfare, a brief sojourning in an alien land; and
after repute, oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrum tells us that he ``read this through a veil of tears with
a shock of recognition, as if spoken to across a vast abyss of time
and history.'' A few days later, his wife wrote: ``Everyone keeps
asking me if he is going through personality changes. Quite a scary
question, because the truth is I'm not sure: is he impatient and
peremptory because of the combination of his normal self (before I
came along) and the frustration of his condition, or because of a
neurological problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Once the life-threatening possibility of a fresh stroke
subsided; McCrum's efforts revolved around rehabilitation, trying
to restore function to his paralyzed left arm and leg. Six weeks
after the stroke, ``when Sarah was taking off my socks in the
evening, we suddenly saw independent movement. There they were --
my left toes moving! It was like finding life on Mars.'' McCrum's
recovery was arduous, painful and complicated by depression, shame
and self-doubt. But gradually he learned to walk again, his speech
returned to almost normal and by the end of the book, a year and a
half after his stroke, he and his wife celebrated the arrival of a
baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
   With its lucid, heartfelt prose, ``My Year Off'' gives voice to
the millions of people who suffer from strokes, a quarter of whom
are under the age of 65 and most of whom have some residual
weakness or dysfunction for the rest of their lives. More
important, this book is a testament to the parallel trials and the
courage of the family members of stroke victims.
</P>
<P>
   It is human nature to want to seek both causation (beyond the
obvious anatomical one) and meaning for an illness. McCrum believes
his stroke came about because ``I'd reached a point in my
professional life when I could almost literally not see my way
forward. So it came as a physical punctuation mark, a reminder from
my body to pause and to take stock. What I needed was a season of
vulnerability. In the language of psychobabble, I needed to get in
touch with myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   The meaning McCrum finds in his ordeal is astonishingly similar
to what others who suffer a catastrophic illness also discover: ``I
have learned, in short, that I am not immortal (the fantasy of
youth) and yet, strangely, in the process I have been renewed in my
understanding of family and, finally, of the only thing that really
matters: love.''

THE HUNDRED DAYS
</HEADLINE>
  By Patrick O'Brian 
 281 pp. New York: W. W. Norton &AMP; Company. $24 
 ------ 
 NAVAL GAZING 
 By PAUL KENNEDY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the early spring of 1815, and two elderly English naval
lieutenants are high up on the southern slopes of Gibraltar,
observing and commenting on a squadron of Royal Navy vessels under
Commodore Jack Aubrey coming steadily closer to the harbor:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderfully beautiful day, with a slight and varying
but reasonably favorable breeze at last: the sun blazed on the
various kinds of broom in flower, upon the Rock, upon the cistuses
and giant heath, while an uninterrupted stream of migrant birds,
honey buzzards, black kites, all the European vultures, storks both
black and white, bee eaters, hoopoes and countless hirundines
flowed across the sky amidst a general indifference; for all eyes
were fixed upon the middle distance, where the squadron had come
about on the starboard tack.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins the 19th of what are now popularly referred to as
the Aubrey-Maturin novels, about naval warfare, by Patrick O'Brian.
They are part of that genre of naval historical fiction that
stretches back to Frederick Marryat and C. S. Forester and reaches
forward to such contemporaries of O'Brian as Alexander Fullerton
and Alexander Kent -- a genre that seems to be booming in recent
years, and capturing male and female readers alike.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a reading of only the first few pages of any book in
the Aubrey-Maturin series would tell the readers that they were
being presented with something different from, and more than,
fictional accounts of naval actions and storms at sea. Battles
there are aplenty, and O'Brian matches Forester in the excitement,
detail and bloody realism of his reconstructions. But these naval
tales are blended into a larger panorama of Georgian society and
politics, science, medicine, botany and the whole conspectus of
contemporary Enlightenment knowledge about the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider simply the above quotation, taken from the second
paragraph of ``The Hundred Days.'' The overall scene is about
British warships coming into Gibraltar; but only O'Brian among the
naval writers would think to slip into that long sentence on the
migrating birds, and detail specific types. How many other naval
authors, one wonders, would actually have known that the Strait of
Gibraltar is one of the great crossing points for the northward and
southward avian migrations, or even cared? By contrast, O'Brian's
works abound with captivating descriptions of fauna and flora all
over the globe, of classical concerts (with a Locatelli or Haydn
piece being expertly described), of gossip about the changing fate
of the Whigs and Tories at Westminster, all forming a rich and
varied complement to sections about naval rigging and life below
deck.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian's brilliant device for making his works into more than
naval history is, of course, his invention of dual heroes, the
bluff and ultracompetent Aubrey being always accompanied by his
eccentric ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin -- a naval surgeon, yes,
but also a highly regarded British intelligence agent, a former
Irish radical, a multilingual polymath, a natural philosopher with
a passion for beetles, sea creatures, birds and animals that often
tempts him to linger on strange shores when the impatient Aubrey is
urgent for the next battle. This character mix works so well, and
all is written so beautifully, that O'Brian's worldwide fans have
come to expect a new novel every year. ``The Hundred Days'' is this
season's offering, and there is no doubt the fans will like it.
</P>
<P>
   THE novel is set in the ``hundred days'' between Napoleon's
escape from Elba and his final defeat at Waterloo in mid-1815, and
our heroes must thwart dastardly efforts by Balkan mercenaries and
North African potentates to assist a Bonapartist victory. Naval
actions off the Adriatic coast, strenuous secret journeys into the
interior North African wastes by Maturin and a decisive battle to
seize a gold convoy attempting to run the Strait of Gibraltar are
typical high points of this tale, though always interspersed with
those special O'Brian features. As the creators of other paired
characters like Holmes and Watson or Spencer and Hawk long ago
discovered, once you have found a good fictional recipe, it doesn't
pay to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Is this, then, the end of the line for the O'Brian series?
Napoleon, against whom Aubrey and Maturin have waged an almost
personal battle through 19 works, is now en route -- on a Royal
Navy frigate -- to lasting exile on St. Helena; and the ``Great
War'' (as 19th-century Britons called it) is over. Yet, in the last
paragraph, as Aubrey's warship casts off from Gibraltar on its
passage home, he is urged to ``liberate Chile.'' Since the
real-life character whom it is thought Aubrey most resembles, the
great frigate captain Thomas Cochrane, left the Royal Navy in 1814
and went on to fight for Chile and Peru against Spanish rule in
South America, it seems a fair guess that our famous duo will
shortly reappear in that very hemisphere for further adventures.

 By JAMES HYNES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apart from scholars of Romanticism and students of genre
fiction, does anyone past the age of 18 ever read Mary Shelley's
``Frankenstein''? A number of books we read when we were young --
``The Lord of the Rings,'' ``The Red Badge of Courage'' -- have a
fighting chance of appealing when we're older, but ``Frankenstein''
is probably a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Let's face it: when
you're 11, ``Frankenstein'' is a disappointment. Even if a young
reader hasn't seen the 1931 James Whale film, the director's Gothic
imagery is deeply ingrained in our collective lizard brain. The
chief result of wading through Shelley's 19th-century prose in
one's youth is the sinking feeling of discovering that there's no
castle, no villagers with torches and pitchforks, no Igor. There
are no lightning rods or crackling sparks or humming machines; in
the novel, the creature's birth is treated offhandedly, in a
paragraph. And there's no Boris Karloff with neck bolts, lurching
gait and bad haircut; Shelley's monster is described only vaguely,
as huge, misshapen and hideous (the one consistency through all the
versions is Victor Frankenstein's clumsy workmanship).
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a shame, because, as this middle-aged reader is
happy to report, the novel ``Frankenstein'' is quite a read. It may
be the best prose work ever written by an 18-year-old. It's highly
Romantic, in the literary sense; there are pages of landscape
description, pages of passionate declarations and a good deal of
attractive torment and self-doubt, from both Victor Frankenstein
and his creation. In fact, the monster is a wonderfully appealing
character, likely to have a visceral appeal (so to speak) for an
adolescent: he's ungainly, misunderstood and often self-loathing.
He craves approval from others, hates the way he looks and thinks
all his problems would be solved if he only had a mate. In other
words, Frankenstein's monster is just another lonely teen-ager in
love.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading a youngster who's probably already reading Stephen
King or Anne Rice to give it a whirl, though, is still a problem.
The prose is very much of its period, and for a generation of
children who grow up watching Freddy Krueger, all of the offstage
murders here are going to seem a letdown. If ever a book needed to
be placed in context, it's ``Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Viking's handsome unabridged edition in their ``Whole Story''
series is an admirable solution. Based on a French edition by
Editions Gallimard, it features annotations and period artwork on
nearly every page, keyed to the text: when Victor is tried for
murder, the margins display pictures of late-18th-century
courtrooms, prisons and some very uncomfortable-looking iron
restraints. There are plenty of cultural references as well,
especially asides about Mary Shelley's family (husband Percy) and
the larger circle of Romantic poets (Coleridge and Wordsworth).
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, during the passages where not much is going on,
there are too many old paintings of Alpine glaciers, peasants in
colorful costumes and views of Lake Geneva from every imaginable
angle, but otherwise the annotations are always informative, and
often surprising and fun. There are also several two-page sidebars,
including one about the Romantics and the famous ghost story
competition that led to the novel, and another about the various
film versions, from Boris Karloff to Mel Brooks. Best of all,
though, are the finely detailed colored illustrations by Philippe
Munch. He is especially good at the large-scale illustrations of
landscape -- the Alpine mountain dells, the bleak Orkney Islands,
the Arctic desert -- that reinforce the impression that this novel
is best approached as an epic. My only quibble is the monster
himself; for a character regularly described as hideous, he's
awfully handsome, and often downright hunky.
</P>
<P>
   For younger readers, there is a new retelling of the story in
attractively cartoony pictures by the British artist Chris Mould,
who has written his own adaptation. Both Victor and the monster are
appealingly goofy, with bug eyes, long faces and prominent jaws.
There's a spirit of cheery, Halloweenish fun to the drawings,
dominated by autumnal orange or a deep, macabre green. Too much of
the story is crowded into the narration, with a number of moments
that might better have been dramatized -- the monster recoiling
from his own image in a pool, for example -- and one scene is
understandably softened for younger readers when the monster's
murder of a child is changed into an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But even Mould's chipper retelling achieves some of the pathos
of the novel's final pages, as Frankenstein and his monster head
for their ultimate encounter on the Arctic ice. His final picture
is haunting, as the creature, silhouetted against a blaze in the
midst of a frozen waste, reaches imploringly for the sky. It's an
image to send chills of terror and pity up the spine of any kid, no
matter how old he is.

   Before the glow of this year's slugfest completely fades, or
perhaps to burnish it during the off-season, here, told in lushly
romantic full-page paintings, mostly of the subject himself, and in
data-filled old-style bubble-gum baseball cards, is the story of
the Babe. His record of 60 home runs stood for 34 years.

   A full day of adventures for one little girl and her feet. From
first touching the floor to kicking the stairs, jumping from rock

   In the fifth in the popular ``notebooks,'' the adventurous
Amelia has returned from space camp to address the challenges of
fifth grade. Part of the fun of the series is that the books look
like the lined notebooks with black-and-white marbleized covers
that children use for journal writing all over the country.

<P>
   Nell, who is 12, spends August in Modine, N.Y., a community that
was originally settled by freed slaves after the Civil War. She
stays with Aunt Ursa Grady, who raised Nell's father, but this
summer there is a crisis of conscience involving an illicit favor
her cousin Foley asks. Engrossing.

</P>
<P>
   This lush, complex, nearly abstract setting of the well-known
hymn is something of a homage to the work of Paul Klee. It involves
a cat and some familiar creatures, including a squirrel, a rabbit
and a blue jay. It is perhaps most appealing to school-age children
who can hum the tune while puzzling out the illustrations.

<P>
   Sarah and her wicked red cat, Rotten Ralph, are back. In their
ninth adventure, Sarah is old enough to go to school, and Ralph is
so frantic about remaining her best friend that he goes too. His
extravagant naughtiness is so silly he's hardly bibliotherapeutic.
Of course a young reader doesn't need to be having trouble settling
into a classroom to laugh.

</P>
<P>
   The author was born in Wenzhou, near the China coast, on Nov. 3,
1914, and was nicknamed Mei Fuh, meaning ``beautiful happiness.''
This memoir of her first five years has an exotic sweetness, as

IN BRIEF: CHILDREN'S BOOKS 
 THE GINGERBREAD MAN
</HEADLINE>
  Retold by Jim Aylesworth 
 Illustrated by Barbara McClintock 
 Scholastic, $15.95 (All ages)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The anthropomorphizing of food has had a long history in
children's stories. Occasionally the food in question actually
wants to be eaten, and feels hurt when it/he/she is overlooked or
rejected by a hungry child, adult or animal. But usually _ and this
seems to make a lot more sense _ the food doesn't want to be eaten
but would rather be spared and allowed to live life fully, or at
least until spoilage sets in. The age-old tale of ``The Gingerbread
Man'' is of the latter variety. In Jim Aylesworth and Barbara
McClintock's extremely appealing version, a little old man and a
little old woman lovingly fashion a cookie and then bake it in the
oven, anticipating the gustatory pleasure that will soon be theirs.
But as soon as the oven door is opened, ``out popped the
Gingerbread Man, and he ran across the floor.'' And here the
excitement begins.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock's spirited, memorable illustrations feature fully
clothed animals and are greatly influenced, according to the
illustrator's note, by the 19th-century French illustrator
Grandville. But McClintock's depiction of the Gingerbread Man
himself feels contemporary, providing an interesting counterpoint
between the hero of the story and his adversaries. Children will
respond to the sassy, boastful facial expressions and exclamations
of the Gingerbread Man. (Actually, he bears a resemblance to the
Pillsbury Doughboy.) And they will quickly be drawn into the story,
familiar though it is, following the sure-footed cookie as he
confronts a variety of creatures who wish to gobble him up,
including a butcher, a cow, a sow and a fox. As the story proceeds
and tensions mount, Aylesworth's words demand to be read aloud in
an increasingly feverish, fast-paced manner. As if to emphasize
this to readers, the hero's final speech in the story is printed in
large type.
</P>
<P>
   As a character, the Gingerbread Man is full of himself and
immensely cocksure, and perhaps this is why children hardly ever
seem upset at his inevitable ``death'' at the end of the story. In
fact, children seem to understand that all cookies -- even those in
literature -- are meant to be eaten. With this in mind, a recipe
for gingerbread cookies appears on the back of the book jacket. _

   &UR; I DID IT, I'M SORRY &QL; 
 &UR; Written and illustrated by Caralyn Buehner and Mark Buehner &QL; 
 &UR; Dial, $15.99. (Ages 5 to 9) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Caralyn and Mark Buehner's 1995 book, ``It's a Spoon, Not a
Shovel,'' is an imaginative, involving picture book designed to
teach manners -- primarily table manners -- to young children. ``I
Did It, I'm Sorry'' is about ethics and is nearly identical in
format: an unruly cast of animal characters faces human choices; a
simple quiz with zany wrong answers follows each example; brightly
colored, somewhat outlandish illustrations depict the scenes; and
hidden animal figures and letters (denoting the correct answers to
the quiz questions) pose a challenge for young readers. But
although their new book bears a strong resemblance to ``It's a
Spoon, Not a Shovel,'' this time the Buehners seem to pitch both
the text and the illustrations to an older, more sophisticated
audience, and the result is a confused and sometimes troublesome
book. Pola Bear swears and tells dirty jokes. Sheila the sheep
fends off the peer pressure of her friends who are dyeing their
wool purple and sporting tattoos. More worrisome, three bored
camels, portrayed grotesquely in stylized fashion, search for fun,
and Cory the camel suggests, ``Let's stomp on that nomad, and chew
up his tent!'' The intended humor of some situations -- the McFly
family frequents an all-you-can-eat buffet called Frontier Cow Pies
-- will be lost on most youngsters, and the tastelessness
undermines the book's central message: the importance of good
morals and manners. _ CONSTANCE DECKER THOMPSON

   &UR; THE HATMAKER'S SIGN: &QL; 
 &UR; A Story by Benjamin Franklin &QL; 
 &UR; By Candace Fleming &QL; 
 &UR; Illustrated by Robert Andrew Parker &QL; 
 &UR; Orchard, $15.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They're the last words any writer wants to hear: ``May I make a
suggestion?'' But you'll hear them a lot if you want to write,
because revision is part of the game, as Benjamin Franklin knew.
The Hatmaker's Sign: A Story by Benjamin Franklin (Orchard, $15.95;
ages 5 to 9) is a true tale of writerly frustration, written by
Candace Fleming and illustrated by Robert Andrew Parker. As the
story-within-a-story begins, it's July 1776, and Thomas Jefferson
is writhing in pain as the Continental Congress debates changes (he
calls them ``mutilations'') in his draft of the Declaration of
Independence, which he believes to be perfect as it is. The
delegates noisily argue over every treasured syllable, striking
out, adding, inserting, toning down, beefing up, rewording,
rephrasing and reordering. On the sidelines, meanwhile, the
distraught Jefferson is consoled by his friend Ben Franklin.
``Tom,'' he says, ``this puts me in mind of a story.'' The story he
tells (one that Jefferson later recalled in his memoirs) is about a
Boston hatmaker who's on his way to the sign shop with a plan for a
new sign. On his parchment are the words ``John Thompson, Hatmaker.
Fashionable Hats Sold Inside for Ready Money,'' and below them a
drawing of a hat. Along the way, he meets a few people who have
suggestions to offer. Each one seems to have a good idea: The
hatmaker's name is irrelevant, isn't it? And why say ``inside''?
Where else would the hats be sold? One by one and two by two, the
carefully chosen words are struck out, and finally even the picture
of the hat disappears (after all, there are hats in the shop
window, aren't there?). By the time he arrives at the sign shop,
his parchment is empty. But the sign maker has an idea too. ``May I
make a suggestion?'' he says. ``How about: 'John Thompson,
Hatmaker. Fashionable Hats Sold Inside for Ready Money.' '' Under
them, he'll draw a hat. ``It's perfect!'' says the hatmaker.
Fleming's retelling captures the humor of Franklin's tale and adds
charming period detail, while Parker's richly colored
ink-and-watercolor paintings are the perfect accompaniment. I
wouldn't change a thing. _ PATRICIA T. O'CONNER

   &UR; YOU NEVER KNOW &QL; 
 &UR; A Legend of the Lamed-vavniks &QL; 
 &UR; By Francine Prose &QL; 
 &UR; Illustrated by Mark Podwal &QL; 
 &UR; Greenwillow, $15. (Ages 5 to 8) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to an ancient Jewish legend, there are always 36 holy
people in the world. They are known as Lamed-vavniks (from the
Hebrew for 36). These people are so righteous and just that their
prayers are always answered. Yet they live in secret, disguised as
ordinary people, humble and often poor. Stories involving secret
identities are greatly appealing to children, and Francine Prose
has written a lovely tale around this intriguing legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Never Know'' is the story of a Lamed-vavnik named Schmuel,
a poor cobbler who is so kind and generous that the townsfolk think
he must be stupid. When Schmuel's prayers save the town, they
wonder why God listens to poor stupid Schmuel. They ask the rabbi,
who has a dream in which Schmuel's true identity is revealed. The
next morning the rabbi tells the townsfolk, but when they go to
find Schmuel he has already moved on. A few months later, a new
cobbler comes to town, and even though he's poor, the people treat
him with respect, thinking that he too could be a Lamed-vavnik.
``After all,'' they reason, ``you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Prose delivers her moral gently, offering children a new way to
look at the poor and the homeless. Without preaching, she
encourages us to remember that beggars and ditchdiggers may not be
what they seem, and suggests that we treat everyone with respect --
just in case. Mark Podwal's pictures are strongly atmospheric, and
go well with the text. The Lamed-vavniks, though faceless, somehow
appear peaceful and content as they go about their daily business.
Children and adults will linger on the pictures of these holy men
and women, studying them as though allowed a privileged glimpse at
the secret lives of these wonderful, mysterious people. _ ROBIN

THE LION'S PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
  Theodore Roosevelt and His Family in Peace and War 
 By Edward J. Renehan Jr. 
 Illustrated. 289 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $27.50 
 ------ 
 CHARGE! 
 By ROBERT W. MERRY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the presidents, none glorified the arts and lore of
battle quite like Theodore Roosevelt. From youth to dotage, he
reveled in tales of derring-do, celebrating the patriotism of the
citizen-warrior and the sacrifice of blood on the hallowed field of
combat. His martial idealism poses a question: Was he an American
patriot in the truest sense of the word, or was he a warmonger,
driven simply by a conviction that battle purified the manly soul?
</P>
<P>
   The historian and biographer Edward J. Renehan Jr.'s beguiling
book ``The Lion's Pride,'' which chronicles the Roosevelt family's
participation in the Spanish-American War and the European
conflagration two decades later, doesn't purport to answer that
question. But it does provide a revealing portrait of the old
Anglo-Saxon elite that once dominated American society. No family
personified that elite quite like the Roosevelts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you afraid to stand up when I am on horseback?'' Teddy
Roosevelt admonished his infantry troops before his famous charge
up San Juan Hill in 1898. The 39-year-old colonel then galloped
toward the enemy as his troops rallied behind him. The war
correspondent Richard Harding Davis said it was the bravest thing
he'd ever seen _ and the most foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the remainder of his days, Roosevelt viewed this
``crowded hour'' as his finest moment, the defining act of his
life. Later, he agitated for America's entry into World War I, and
when it came sent his four sons off in search of glory _ causing
some discomfort at the departure pier when he speculated aloud, and
with apparent satisfaction, that one of his boys might well be
wounded or even killed in the righteous cause of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, two suffered serious wounds. And young Quentin,
an aviator barely past his 20th birthday, was killed, shot down
over German territory. ``Poor Quinikins! Poor Quinikins,'' the
former president, now nearly 60 and infirm, was heard to mutter as
he rocked back and forth in a chair once used to soothe the
agitations of the infant Quentin. When his friend Edith Wharton
suggested he write a book about his fallen son, Roosevelt replied
that he couldn't, ``for I should break down.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet he never manifested a particle of doubt about the
worthiness of Quentin's destruction. ``For nothing under heaven,''
he wrote to a colleague from his own days of military heroism,
``would I have had my sons act otherwise than as they acted.'' With
fatherly satisfaction, he added: ``They have done pretty well,
haven't they? Quentin killed, dying as a war hawk should. . . .
Archie crippled, and given the French war cross for gallantry; Ted
gassed once . . . and cited for 'conspicuous gallantry'; Kermit
with the British military cross, and now under Pershing.''
</P>
<P>
   How could an American father relish so philosophically the
demise of one son and the mortal dangers faced by three others in a
distant war that had almost nothing to do with American security?
Renehan suggests that the reason lies in Roosevelt's time and
class. By the turn of the century, America had pushed to the
Pacific and fulfilled its continental destiny. Now the mind of the
Northeastern elite danced with visions of a global alliance with
Britain to insure peace and stability throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Roosevelt chafed in frustration at his inability
to make this dream a reality. That grand task fell to his cousin
and nephew-in-law, Franklin, who idolized his older relative and
steeped himself in the writings of Teddy Roosevelt's close friend,
the naval historian Alfred Thayer Mahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``F.D.R.,'' Renehan writes, ``was sympathetic to Mahan's
arguments for a strategic Anglo-American imperium . . . through
which the United States would . . . assume an inevitable task, an
appointed lot in the work of upholding the common interests of
civilization.'' Ultimately, that was the cause for which Theodore
fought and young Quentin died.

TORN FROM THE NEST
</HEADLINE>
  By Clorinda Matto de Turner 
 Translated by John H. R. Polt 
 174 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $30 
 ------ 
 BANNED IN LIMA 
 By JOANNA O'CONNELL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Torn From the Nest'' first appeared in Lima in 1889, it
was a sensation. Clorinda Matto de Turner brought her passionate
demands for social reform to the center of national attention. The
president of Peru wrote her that he was one of many readers moved
by her forthright denunciation of abuse of the indigenous majority
at the hands of the Creole minority. At the same time, because the
novel advocated an end to celibacy for priests, it was banned by
the church; Matto was excommunicated and burned in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   This new and engaging translation by John H. R. Polt is part of
Oxford University Press's wonderful Library of Latin America
series. For most of this century, ``Torn From the Nest'' was one of
very few works by a woman in the Latin American literary canon,
both as an early example of literary naturalism and, more
significant, because it anticipated one of 20th-century Latin
American literature's major tendencies, the indigenista novel _
writing by non-Indians denouncing the exploitation of indigenous
people as the unresolved legacy of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   In her preface, Matto echoes the credo of realism when she says
she wants the novel to be a ``photograph'' of Peruvian life. But it
is also a romance; as in many other 19th-century Latin American
novels, a love story displays the symptoms of deep-seated national
contradictions. Antonio Cornejo Polar's introduction places Matto's
work in the context of Latin American intellectual life and of
national debates in Peru. He helps us understand how the realist
elements of Matto's narrative _ the detailed representations of
landscape and custom, the emphasis on social corruption _ showed
her contemporaries a new way to understand relations between
Creoles and Indians and challenged them to identify with her
strongly ethical vision.
</P>
<P>
   Lucia and Fernando Marin, an educated Creole couple from Lima,
have come to live in the Andean provincial town of Killac. Lucia
tries to help Marcela Yupanqui, an Indian woman whose family is in
a desperate situation because of the corrupt practices of the local
priest, politicians and gentry. Lucia's well-intentioned efforts
precipitate a violent reaction that results in the death of Marcela
and her husband, leaving their two daughters orphans; the Marins
are forced to return to Lima, taking the girls with them.
Meanwhile, the Governor's son has fallen in love with one of the
girls, but (of course) their love is doomed by a terrible secret.
</P>
<P>
   The women in the novel are the moral center of Matto's
alternative vision. Because they cannot participate in public life,
their influence on men is their only means of pursuing change.
Matto pushed to the limit the sphere of public action allowed women
in her society. She was one of an extraordinary group of female
intellectuals in Latin America engaged in redefining women's
citizenship. She wrote and published widely before her husband's
death in 1881, but it was as a widow that she embarked on her
career as a professional intellectual. In addition to writing
novels and articles, she edited a major newspaper in Arequipa as
well as Lima's weekly literary review, El Peru Ilustrado, and
founded a feminist press.
</P>
<P>
   If in many respects her ideas were typical of liberal
intellectual circles, her critique of church corruption, her
feminism and her energetic engagement with politics were radical.
In 1895 she was forced to flee Peru, leaving her manuscripts behind
in a house and publishing office ransacked by mobs. She enjoyed
success in Buenos Aires, but died in exile in 1909. When we read
``Torn From the Nest,'' we may see her vision of redeeming the
downtrodden Indians through enlightened Christian charity and
education as paternalistic, but in her day her views were a
courageous attack on the colonial underpinnings of Peruvian
society.

GOD OF THE RODEO

  The Search for Hope, Faith, and a Six-Second Ride in Louisiana's
Angola Prison 
 By Daniel Bergner 
 295 pp. New York: Crown Publishers. $24 
 ------ 
 SECONDS OF FREEDOM 
 By PETER APPLEBOME 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no accident that the South's prisons are some of its most
mythic, darkly resonant places. There is the Walls Unit prison in
Huntsville, Texas, the execution capital of America, where people
still speak fondly of ``Old Sparky,'' the electric chair that was
finally put out to pasture when lethal injection was adopted in
1977. There is the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, as
much an inspiration for classic blues as cheap liquor or busted
love. And there is Angola, La., where the winding two-lane road to
nowhere ends in an utterly isolated purgatory for society's
outcasts, bordered on three sides by the levees of the Mississippi
and on the fourth by a dense no man's land of vines, undergrowth
and snakes so daunting there's no need for a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Angola covers 18,000 acres, larger than the island of Manhattan.
Because of Louisiana's unusually stringent sentencing laws, about
80 percent of Angola's inmates -- mostly murderers, rapists and
armed robbers -- have no-parole sentences or sentences so long they
might as well be. It's impossible to visit the place and not feel
that a prisoner could disappear off the face of the earth and no
one would ever know or care.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Bergner, a New York-based journalist and novelist, gives
voice to the forgotten in ``God of the Rodeo,'' a vivid, ambitious
(sometimes too ambitious) and ferociously reported book that reads
like a novel. Bergner tells us he was looking for both a story and
something close to a revelation -- an affirmation of what he
describes as his own tenuous faith in God. He finds more than one
story -- chilling and heartbreaking tales of violence, penance and
sometimes redemption. But the personal revelation is harder to come
by. The closer the book sticks to hard-edged reporting the better
it is. When it strays into a search for the transcendent, it runs
the risk of strained overreaching.
</P>
<P>
   Bergner's book grew out of reporting he did for Harper's
Magazine on Angola's annual prison rodeo, where inmates, many of
them with as much background in rodeo as they have in quantum
mechanics, risk their lives each fall in a gaudy, gladiatorial
spectacle. Bergner uses the rodeo contestants as a window into
Angola, a way to make sense of the people who find their way there.
In doing so, he faced numerous inherent risks, most of which he
handled with skill and insight. The prison rodeo is one of those
stories that are at once wildly exotic and perhaps overly familiar,
and it's not unique to Angola. (Huntsville had an even more famous
rodeo until it was phased out in 1988.) The utter desolation of the
prisoners' lives and the barbarity of their surroundings can lead a
sympathetic observer to forget why the prisoners are there. And the
Old South plantation vapors and inescapable racial context (77
percent of the inmates are black, two-thirds of the guards are
white, as is all the top leadership) make a place like Angola a
lightning rod for every stereotypical view of the South.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bergner navigates those hazards with admirable
dexterity and sophistication. Even people who know something about
prison rodeos will find it hard not to be caught up in the richly
etched lives he discovers behind the ghoulish pageantry of events
like ``convict poker,'' in which four inmates sit in folding chairs
around a bright red table as a 2,000-pound bull is let loose in the
arena. The last one sitting wins $100. And Bergner is no censorious
Yankee naif adrift in the South. He has a nuanced, probing take on
almost everything he encounters, right down to the rodeo itself.
And while he deals with the prisoners as real individuals with the
capacity to grow and sometimes reform, he takes pains to remind us
that most are in Angola for the kind of unspeakable crimes that
deserve exile from what passes for a civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   ``God of the Rodeo'' is really three books. The first and best
is riveting reportage on prison life that uses the rodeo as both
gateway and metaphor for life at Angola. The second is Bergner's
uneasy, increasingly contentious dance with Angola's warden, Burl
Cain, who in the course of the narrative goes from being the soul
of Christian charity to a grasping shakedown artist. And the final
one is a spiritual journey trying to extract meaning from the dark
tales playing out inside Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Bergner is a terrific reporter with a novelist's eye. When we
first meet Cain, he's entering the rodeo arena in the closest thing
he can find to a chariot -- ``a wooden cart, lacquered and
polished, with big white-spoked wheels, pulled by his inmate-tended
team of Percheron horses.'' When we first meet a prisoner named
Littell Harris, we're given a snapshot of him mixing a cocktail of
his own feces, mashed and stirred to a consistency useful for
dousing an offending fellow inmate through a bottle with a squirt
top. We learn how to make a prison tattoo, first burning a plastic
canister, usually of Speed Stick, then mixing the soot with
toothpaste and water to make the ink. Then a steel guitar string is
threaded through an empty pen shaft and hooked up to a tiny motor
(taken from a cassette player) and jabbed thousands of times into
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you wonder if the reporting is a bit too vivid.
Bergner and his publisher sought jacket blurbs with unusual
aggressiveness from the best-selling authors of what at the moment
seems to go by the name of literary non-fiction, like Sebastian
Junger and John Berendt. And while there's no reason to think that
Bergner emulated Berendt, who has acknowledged that he invented
dialogue in ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' one wishes
that Bergner had provided a note on his methodology. When he
recounts both sides of a phone conversation, did he tape the call
or rely on a prisoner's reconstruction? And if, as is evident, he
reconstructed a scene with Littell Harris and a woman in a motel
room after Harris was released from prison, did he reconstruct
others as well? Bergner clearly did exhaustive reporting and
expended enormous energy to get his story. But the rules of what's
real and what's massaged are so murky in nonfiction these days it
would have been helpful to know just how to take the reporting,
especially since nearly all the principals in the book are lost in
Angola's time warp.
</P>
<P>
   Bergner's depiction of his relationship with Cain is also
problematic. Berg-
</P>
<P>
   ner began the book with full access to the prison and an
admiring view of Cain as a benevolent figure intent on uplifting
the fallen at Angola. That view changed entirely when Cain tried to
hit him up for editorial control and a portion of the book's
proceeds in return for continued access to the prisoners. Bergner
turned him down and then successfully sued to continue his
interviews. It was a gutsy move and a worthy one. But it makes you
wonder how much of his subsequent reporting is colored by personal
animus and why he was so taken with Cain's unctuous posturing in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the book overreaches a bit in its search for
transcendent meaning. Near the end of the book, Terry Hawkins, who
is serving a life sentence for hacking his boss to death with a
meat ax, wins another of the horrors of the rodeo, a contest called
``guts and glory,'' in which some 30 inmates attempt to pluck a red
chip worth $100 strung between a bull's horns without getting gored
or kicked in the process. ``For one thing was clear,'' Bergner
writes of Hawkins, ``that in these desires he wanted what anyone,
anywhere did: money, a better life, a clear conscience, and
oblivion.'' Really? Oblivion? Bergner's story is so powerful in the
telling, it really didn't need to grasp so hard for profundity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is an eloquent and valuable book. Bergner deserves
credit for bringing such passion and intelligence to this story,
and for fighting a legal battle to tell it at a time when 1.7
million people are behind bars in the United States and prisons
exercise almost total control over what outsiders get to see of
their lives. There's not much cachet to prison reporting these
days. Bergner's rich, probing and compassionate book is a rare look
at both the physical and spiritual world on the other side of the
bars.

VISIONS OF JAZZ
</HEADLINE>
  The First Century 
 By Gary Giddins 
 690 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $35 
 ------ 
 ALL THAT YOU-KNOW-WHAT 
 By ALFRED APPEL JR. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publication of ``Visions of Jazz: The First Century'' is a
major event because Gary Giddins is our best jazz critic. This
enormous book contains 79 essays, many of which originally appeared
in different form in The Village Voice. ``Need I add,'' he
rhetorically asks in his acknowledgments, ``that at no time in this
work's long gestation was it conceived as a conventional critique
or history?'' He insistently tells us at the outset that he has
failed to discuss several important musicians. As it turns out,
``Visions of Jazz'' is the finest unconventional history of jazz
ever written _ a brilliant, indispensable book, comprehensive
enough given the certainty that a total history of jazz at this
point, the century mark, invites a shallow inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, Giddins writes out of admiration and love. (His
characterization of the estimable pianist Tommy Flanagan holds true
for him as well: ``a deep lyricism that eschewed sentimentality.'')
The traps and temptations of such a tack are obvious, but his
temperament seems to insulate him against blind enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The essays do indeed cover jazz's first century, ranging from W.
C. Handy to Cassandra Wilson. Giddins writes at some length about
each subject, his essays falling into two types: a life-and-works
retrospective survey of an older or deceased musician, or a less
ambitious review of performances and recent recordings. Divided
into eight parts, the book is roughly chronological, though Giddins
is too wise to hold to any strict time line, especially since his
history of jazz is the story of the most talented performers, their
recordings the subject of the closest musical scrutiny; his book's
index of songs and selected albums runs to 20 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Giddins' opening section, ``Precursors,'' begins with an essay
on Bert Williams and Al Jolson, two blackface comedians. Purists
and progressives alike may find this puzzling, but that reinforces
Giddins' point: jazz has to be understood in the context of its
origins
</P>
<P>
   as popular entertainment, 19th-century minstrelsy in particular.
Louis Armstrong, one of the heroes of ``Visions of Jazz,'' is a
case in point. Many racially sensitive people still see Armstrong
as an Uncle Tom, a buffoon, rather than as the daring, signifying
minstrel-trickster who deconstructed and dispatched the racism of
demeaning ol'-time songs like ``Shine'' and ``Carry Me Back to Old
Virginny'' _ a great man, really, and Giddins writes about him
superbly, as he did in his ``Satchmo'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   The opening section also includes the ragtime-to-riches saga of
Irving Berlin, the Tin Pan Alley story incarnate: songs that at
first tapped into black sources, then came to life independently,
and, like George Gershwin's, would become part of American culture.
The almost-forgotten singer and actress Ethel Waters is presented
as no less a pivotal figure in the evolution of American song than
Bing Crosby and Armstrong _ a versatile crossover artist who could
bring perfect intonation and articulation to vernacular material,
influencing black and white singers alike.
</P>
<P>
   The second section, ``A New Music,'' discusses the classic
figures, from Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver and Duke Ellington to
Coleman Hawkins, Chick Webb and Fats Waller. Giddins violates
chronology sensibly enough by grouping sui generis
instrumentalists, like Art Tatum, John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor and
Ornette Coleman. This sequence of names suggests that he has an
unusually wide range of musical interests and open-ended curiosity
_ unusual because jazz critics, like everyone else, often settle on
a favorite period or handful of musicians. Not surprisingly,
Giddins' ears are open to post-modernists like Henry Threadgill,
Don Pullen, David Murray, Joe Lovano and, in the final essay, Don
Byron, the black jazzman who plays Webern and Jewish klezmer music.
When Giddins considers the way another black musician, Dexter
Gordon, the first great bebop tenor saxophonist, weaves musical
quotations from other songs into his improvisations, he is
describing the pan-racial, multicultural and even utopian essence
of so-called modern jazz: ``They fold into his solos like spectral
glimpses of an alternative universe in which all of Tin Pan Alley
is one infinite song.''
</P>
<P>
   The section titled ``A Modern Music'' addresses bebop mainly,
though an essay about the parodist Spike Jones fits in nicely, if
loosely. Giddins does not push the importance of parody in jazz and
modernism (a pairing explicit throughout ``Visions of Jazz''),
especially the wittiness of bebop quotations of pop songs effected
by the likes of Gordon and Charlie Parker, comparable as they are
to the allusiveness of literary modernism. The frequent use of the
words ``modern'' and ``post-modern'' throughout ``Visions of Jazz''
seems to assume that readers share a definition and understanding
of these widely applied terms, which isn't necessarily so. Brief,
working definitions would help us all, and Giddins almost supplies
one himself in his discussion of Armstrong's singing: ``Implicit in
the liberties Armstrong took, and in the rise of jazz itself, is
the assumption that musicians are superior to the songs they
perform _ a radical stance by classical principles, where a
performance is evaluated by its fidelity to the text. In jazz,
performance is the text.'' This sounds exactly right, and is one
step away from a comparison with collage. A majestic Armstrong
transformation of a stupid song (like ``Sweethearts on Parade'') is
analogous to the modernist art of collage, assemblage and the metal
and raw wood sculpture of Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Vernacular, or demotic, modernism is the feat of creating more
out of less or almost nothing at all; Giddins explains this art of
musical rescue and reassemblage through singers of genius, in his
explications of Billie Holiday's version of ``A Sailboat in the
Moonlight'' (a 1937 Guy Lombardo hit) and Sarah Vaughan's
``Thinking of You'' (a winner for Eddie Fisher and Don Cherry in
1950). ``Make it new,'' Ezra Pound urged in 1914, and these jazz
modernists do so by revivifying trite lyrics and melodies. ''
'Tain't what you do, it's the way that you do it,'' as Trummy Young
sang with Jimmie Lunceford's band in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington is different from such collagists because he composed
his own material. Ironically, serious discussion of Ellington is
now vexed by the promotion of him as the greatest American or
20th-century composer, classical music included. It is therefore
good to remember, in this prestige-conscious and very politicized
time, that Ellington's reputation was enhanced as early as 1927 by
highbrow praise of his miniatures alone, recordings that are, at
most, three minutes long. Ellington's reputation, Giddins contends,
does not depend on his extended compositions. Ellington's music, he
concludes, is ``Shakespearean in its reach, wisdom and generosity''
_ an uncharacteristically Miltonic chord. This said, Giddins can
still ignore Ellington's current status as an unassailable classic.
His perusal of Ellington's ambitious ``Black, Brown and Beige''
(1943-46) finds the ``Black'' section overlong and ``The Blues''
strangely ``un-Ellingtonian'' and eclectic, with its echoes of
Debussy. He calls the very verbal ``Second Sacred Concert'' (1968)
``outright proselytizing'': ``Some of the choral sections are
reminiscent of school pageants.'' In the current jazz orthodoxy,
this is apostasy, but such frank appraisal instead of hagiography
only makes Giddins more credible and persuasive. When he turns to
the most esteemed Ellington orchestra, the so-called
Blanton-Webster band of 1940-42, he discovers that its most famous
recordings have been analyzed so often that, lest he become a bore,
he must discuss the seemingly marginal disks long overlooked by
writers. His close attention to ``I Don't Know What Kind of Blues
I've Got,'' ``Jumpin' Punkins'' and ``John Hardy's Wife'' unveils
them as small new masterpieces, reinforcing the composer's
greatness and also our sense that his extended works do not have to
be deemed better than (say) Aaron Copland's for Ellington to remain
``beyond category,'' to use the highest praise Ellington himself
could bestow. Ellington's phrase should allow us to step fairly
around the problematic tag ``greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   The section ``A Popular Music'' covers the swing era (1935-45),
extraordinary as a period when popular music was highly musical as
well as popular _ a time when the likes of Berlin, Gershwin, Cole
Porter and Jerome Kern were composing for Fred Astaire-Ginger
Rogers movies. Giddins writes not altogether uncritical
celebrations of Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Jimmie Lunceford,
Roy Eldridge, Count Basie, Lester Young, Benny Goodman and Artie
Shaw. He can flatly say that ``Goodman, like Elvis 20 years later,
adapted black music for white tastes. He toned it down, cleaned it
up'' _ and that's that. Giddins is not going to dwell, as cultural
critics inevitably do, on Goodman as yet another white poacher and
prospector on the vast African-American mother lode. He simply
won't let the race issue obscure the clarinetist's great
musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   The essay on Count Basie and Lester Young gives almost equal
time to Young, the star tenor saxophone soloist of Basie's 1936-40
band and one of jazz's supreme improvisers. Giddins argues against
the long-prevailing opinion that Young's talent was diminished
after 1945 because of his traumatic Army court-martial and stay in
a detention barracks (hence the title of his subsequent record,
``D.B. Blues''). By pinpointing shifts in Young's style in pre-Army
recordings from 1943, he shows that Young's postwar style had
evolved naturally as a choice of expression. Only the jazz initiate
may appreciate the radicalness of this point and how it defines
Giddins' independence and immense value as a critic. Giddins pays
proper due to the Basie-Young classics of the '30s, but again goes
against received opinion by praising Basie's post-1950 bands, which
are often denigrated as cold, impersonal swing machines. They
``kept the game alive,'' says Giddins, who reminds us that the
swing era did not entirely die around 1945 but persisted in the
glorious post-1950 music of other enduring swing-era figures like
Ellington, Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Artie Shaw briefly (his 1954 small
group) and the less well-known Jimmy Rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Giddins opens his heart when discussing singers. Rushing, he
writes of a great reissue, ``Rushing Lullabies,'' sings a certain
blues ``at a slow, bleeding tempo.'' Of the first recordings of
Billie Holiday and Lester Young, he writes how ``Holiday's voice
and Young's tenor entwined like ivy around the trellises of 'This
Year's Kisses' and 'I Must Have That Man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A magnum opus that could serve as a textbook, ``Visions of
Jazz'' sorely needs a discography. Because Giddins' retrospective
surveys are rarely specific about an artist's best available
recordings, a relative newcomer to jazz needs some shopping advice.
However, Giddins has brilliantly edited a compact disk as a
companion to the book. Also titled ``Visions of Jazz,'' and issued
by Blue Note Records, the CD contains 38 selections programmed
along lines traced by the book, with surprising, delightful twists,
including its very generous running time of 151 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The CD includes certain well-known recordings by Thelonious
Monk, Bud Powell, and Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, because
they are discussed in detail in the book. But Giddins also seems to
assume that his readers already own many of the most famous
recordings of artists like Armstrong, Ellington and Basie, and
therefore omits anthology chestnuts. His listeners are instead
treated to relatively uncelebrated masterpieces like Coleman
Hawkins's rapturous ``Out of Nowhere'' (1937); Bobby Hackett's
stately, heart-stopping ``Pennies From Heaven'' (1945); Lester
Young's almost defiant ``D.B. Blues'' (1945); Ellington's
deliberate and tender piano trio rendition of ``Passion Flower''
(1953); and Sinatra's lilting ``Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams''
(1954), probably selected because Sinatra lets three jazz soloists
loose as in no other session from the tightly arranged '50s.
Giddins is unfailingly fresh in his selections. Instead of drawing
on music by Jelly Roll Morton to accompany the essay about him, he
slips in Art Hodes's obscure 1945 version of Morton's ``Mr. Jelly
Lord.'' The book's Irving Berlin essay is complemented by the
totally unexpected appearance on CD of Kay Starr splendidly singing
``You're Just in Love'' _ retrieved from a long-out-of-print 1960
LP. This is inspired archeology.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiring, too, is the return of another '50s singer, Rosemary
Clooney. One of Giddins' final and finest essays in ``Visions of
Jazz'' is devoted to Clooney's winning story, and it is a story _
years of despair and obscurity followed by recovery as a person and
as an improved performer and recording artist. Giddins reviews her
more recent work for the Concord Jazz label, singling out the CD's
titled ``For the Duration'' (1991), where the accompaniment of the
tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton and the cornetist Warren Vache
recalls the Billie Holiday-Teddy Wilson sessions of the 30's;
``Girl Singer'' (1992); and ``Do You Miss New York?'' (1993).
Giddins has ``big ears,'' as jazz musicians used to say, and his
jazz vision, his tireless listening habits, are in the public
interest. If you follow up on his Rosemary Clooney recommendations,
Gary Giddins will simply bring you pleasure and joy. Who could ask
for anything more?

WHEN ANGELS REST
</HEADLINE>
  By Donald Harington 
 250 pp. Washington: Counterpoint. $24 
 ------ 
 RETURN OF THE STAY MORONS 
 By SCOTT BRADFIELD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Harington is the sort of regional writer who keeps
American fiction honest. Instead of recycling the same old genre
junk (thrill killers on a tear, noble housewives saving dimes in a
jam jar, and so on), he concentrates on the people and
neighborhoods of his own experience, embroidering the life he knows
rather than fabricating a life he doesn't. And while the
post-trendy post-moderns continue playing with the fantasy of
closure and the unreliability of narrators, Harington keeps his eye
on the narrative ball, sacrificing neither believability nor
composure. Which is to say that Donald Harington's books are both
unclassifiable and a genuine pleasure to read. There aren't enough
writers like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Angels Rest,'' like most of Harington's novels, is set in
the backwoods Ozarks hamlet of Stay More, Ark., an appropriately
named pocket-sized Yoknapatawpha where few residents ever work up
enough ambition to leave. At the top of the social ladder are the
Ingledews, an oddly reticent founding family whose members brought
banks, commerce and backroom politics in their wake. At the bottom
are the Dingletoons, a Snopes-like breed of scroungers who move
into every abandoned space they find and don't seem very shy at all
-- at least not when it comes to reproducing. With so many odd
people living so close together, morality has become something of a
slipshod concept in Stay More. Everybody is circuitously related to
everybody else, and this includes (according to rumor, anyway) the
antithetical Dingletoons and Ingledews.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Angels Rest'' concerns the coming of age of a 12-year-old
reporter named Dawny. Inspired by his hero, Ernie Pyle, Dawny
produces the town's only halfway reliable newspaper, composing all
the stories himself and hand-delivering each issue to every
out-of-the-way customer who can't be reached through the post
office. Published weekly and printed by means of a mail-order
gelatin board, The Stay Morning Star doesn't just disseminate news;
its aim is to follow Pyle by making ``heroes out of common men.''
And in Stay More, as it turns out, there are plenty of common men.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Stay More is located so far off the conventional map
that its residents don't mind taking their own personal liberties
with history. So while World War II rages many thousands of miles
away, the children of Dawny's generation battle one another on the
field of make-believe:
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the student body had been divided, for going on four
years, practically since the war started, into two factions, rival
camps who opposed each other not only in baseball but in war games
such as Dirt War and Dare Base and all-out Capture the Flag. . . .
These two factions occupied opposing sides of the schoolroom with
the aisle as a divider, a demilitarized zone across which spitballs
flew.''
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the aisle sit the Allies, all the most popular
boys and girls in the area. On the other sit Dawny and his fellow
Axis members, the class's most miserable-looking geeks and dweebs.
Even imagination, it seems, has its class system.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, the games of children give way to the
world's grubby, often brutal authenticity. And when armed American
training forces are secretly dropped into the hills to act out
possible battle plans for the taking of the Pacific, real war comes
to Stay More -- and it looks as if it will never leave. If history
was once simply ``a subject in school that bored most of us to
death,'' Dawny recalls, it now ``thundered into our own little
world of make-believe warfare and snatched us up.'' In other words,
the town's guardian angels have decided to take a little nap.
</P>
<P>
   There is something Edenic about the benign simplicity of Stay
Morons, those backwoods children of Harington's fiction who refuse
to grow up. And in many ways, the failure of Harington's latest
novel is that it doesn't manage to grow up either. For while the
opening chapters describing childhood during the war are both
charming and funny, the intrusion of the real world in the second
half of the novel often feels stagy, preachy and false.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking an introduction to Harington's excellent fiction
would be better off with the brilliant bug-eye view of things in
his 1989 novel, ``The Cockroaches of Stay More.'' No matter how
much we want this latest installment to work, in the end it simply
doesn't.

  A Memoir 
 By Homer H. Hickam Jr. 
 368 pp. New York: Delacorte Press. $23.95 
 ------ 
 LIFTOFF IN COALWOOD 
 By JAMES R. GAINES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In autobiography as in life, so much depends on how we
understand what happened to us. The facts are secondary, sometimes
even misleading: a benign world may signal alienation to a
neurotic, just as a harsh world may give the sanguine person a
sense of triumph. Interpretation is almost everything, which helps
explain wildly divergent siblings (the Unabomber and his
social-worker brother) and how the sexually abused child of a
teen-age welfare mother can become a worldbeater (Oprah Winfrey).
So much depends on how we tell ourselves the story of our lives, in
dreams and daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   Homer H. Hickam Jr. might have followed his father into the coal
mines of Appalachia. Happily for him, he is a very adept
storyteller. ``Rocket Boys'' is his story of growing up in
Coalwood, W.Va., at a time in America (1957 to 1960) when all
telephones were black, all bathtubs white and very little was gray:
when the world was Ike versus Khrushchev and the theater of the
cold war was moving into outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Coalwood was a company town in the original sense; the company
owned everything in it, and its anthem was Tennessee Ernie Ford's
rendition of a popular dirge, ``Sixteen Tons'' (``St. Peter don't
you call me 'cause I can't go / I owe my soul to the company
store''). Coalwood had no widows to remind it of the constant
threat of explosions and cave-ins; the company made them move out
of their company-owned homes.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Hickam Sr. was the boss of the mine, so the author grew up
in its dust: ``Throughout my childhood, when I raised my blanket in
the morning, I saw a black, sparkling powder float off it. My socks
were always black with coal dirt when I took off my shoes at
night.'' Life in the Hickam household, at least for Homer Jr.,
shared Coalwood's desolation. His workaholic father, wracked by
coughing fits from the black lung disease that would eventually
kill him, was mostly absent, and his mother, who hated everything
about the town and the mine, escaped into the mural of a seashore
scene that she painted ceaselessly on a kitchen wall.
</P>
<P>
   The author was too slight for football and half blind, and his
older brother, Jim, was a star of the high school team, in a town
where all that mattered besides coal was football. ``I was watching
television in the living room one night,'' he writes, ``when Mom
suggested to Dad, after he had spent some minutes . . . boasting
about Jim to one of his foremen, that it might be a good thing if
he bragged on me every once in a while. Even though he knew I was
in the same room, Dad thought for a moment and then wondered aloud,
quite honestly, 'What about?' '' Mrs. Hickam wanted only that her
second son not follow other Coalwood boys into the mines. When his
grandfather remarked one day that he, at 3, was ``just like Homer''
Sr., his mother ``carried me out onto the front porch, stroking my
hair. . . . 'No, you're not,' she crooned just loud enough so only
she and I could hear. 'No, you're not.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed when he was 14; on Oct. 5, 1957, Russia beat
America into space with Sputnik. He and his mother inferred his
future from that seismic event: he would build a rocket! Lots of
American boys got rocket-minded after Sputnik, but for the Hickams
it was more than a phase. For his mother, the idea represented a
way to prove to his father that Homer Jr., an indifferent student,
had the aptitude for college. For him, standing vigil in his yard
at night for a glimpse of Sputnik, it was a connection to the
larger world. ``All my life, everything important that had ever
happened had always happened somewhere else. But Sputnik was right
there in front of my eyes in my backyard. . . . I felt that if I
stretched out enough, I could touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born the Big Creek Missile Agency (B.C.M.A.), named for
his high school, manned by his pals, led by Homer Hickam Jr. and
dedicated to the proposition that Coalwood boys could do anything,
including helping America play catch-up to the Commies. He credits
his mother with pushing him on, but his father, while publicly
berating him for foolishness and theft of company property to build
his rockets, eventually conspired to get him everything he needed,
without acknowledging to his son that he was doing so. Both parents
showed forbearance as the B.C.M.A.'s early experiments made scrap
of the Hickam fence, toaster, bathroom scale and water heater. But
in time Homer vindicated his mother's belief in him, managing to
teach himself trigonometry and calculus, as well as how to
machine-tool a rocket nozzle that would draw the praise of his
greatest hero, Wernher von Braun.
</P>
<P>
   The ``rocket boys'' of Coalwood named their missiles for an
extinct, flightless bird, the auk. Their humility stopped there. As
they progressed from their first vehicle, a flashlight body filled
with cherry-bomb powder, through Auk XXV, a zinc-and-sulfur-powered
five-foot rocket that reached 15,000 feet, the last in a series
that won the local, county and, unthinkably, the 1960 National
Science Fair, their audacious flights inspired a dying region's
imagination and hope, and a pride that even Hickam's father could
not contain. On the day the boys shot off their last series of
rockets, Homer Hickam Sr. showed up at ``Cape Coalwood'' for the
first time. The author asked his father to turn the ignition switch
for the final launch: ``Auk XXXI erupted, blowing huge chunks of
concrete loose from the pad. The crowd took a step backward, and
some of them started to run. Auk XXXI seemed to split the air that
filled the narrow valley, a shock wave rippling across the slack.
Women screamed and men clapped their hands to their ears . . .
mouths agape, eyes wide, their cheers stuck in their throats. . . .
I became aware of movement beside me, and I was astonished to see
Dad prancing along the slack, waving his old hat in his hand. He
was exulting to the sky. 'Beautiful! Beautiful!' ''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected of a book that is ``soon to be a major
motion picture,'' the story is too perfect: 30-year-old dialogue is
reproduced verbatim, the plot is a stacked deck, the victory seems
pat (the teen-age protagonist even tells the Presidential candidate
John F. Kennedy that he should aim America's space program at the
moon, a moment so farfetched it must be true). Hickam admits taking
``certain liberties'' in telling it. But whatever its flaws, it's a
good bet this is the story as he told it to himself. It is a lovely
one, and in the career of Homer H. Hickam Jr., who prevailed over
the facts of his life to become a NASA engineer training astronauts
for space walks, that made all the difference.

TRIP SHEETS
</HEADLINE>
  By Ellen Hawley 
 227 pp. Minneapolis: Milkweed Editions. Paper, $13.95 
 ------ 
 HACK WORK 
 By DWIGHT GARNER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ellen Hawley's earnest, amiable first novel takes its title from
the logbooks that cabdrivers keep _ a collection of addresses that
tells them where they've been that day (everywhere, nowhere) and
how much money they've made (peanuts). ``Trip Sheets'' reads like
its own kind of scattered logbook. It's a series of barely
sequential vignettes about a streetwise 28-year-old woman and her
attempts to rid her life of two things: (a) her job as a hack and
(b) sex with men.
</P>
<P>
   Ditching men is the easy part. Hawley's protagonist, Cath
Rahven, has always ignored her mother's strictures to cut out her
tomboy act (``If you'd only try, Cathy. You're not bad- looking''),
and by the time we meet her, she's already dropped in on a lesbian
poetry reading and started puzzling over her life's new sexual
geometry: ``What she can't imagine is ... how two women go from
vertical and dressed to horizontal and panting.'' Cath quickly
solves this equation. Before long, she's gathered so many lovers
that Hawley is reduced to issuing summary statements like
``Experience accumulates. Women accumulate.'' You'll be tempted to
pencil the words ``You go, girl!'' in the margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trip Sheets'' is set in Minnesota, and Hawley _ who lives in
Minneapolis _ writes about the lesbian scene there with a mixture
of fondness and satirical whimsy. At that poetry reading, for
example, the only words Cath can seem to decipher are ``blood,
moon, tree, goddess, earth.'' Cath often verges on becoming a
lesbiancliche herself (she takes karate lessons, has a degree in
social work and aspires to be a writer), but her good humor and
distaste for ``New Age hoo-rah'' rescue her _ and us _ from that
fate.
</P>
<P>
   The best writing in ``Trip Sheets'' isn't about sex or goddess
worship, however, but about Cath's improvised career as a cabby.
``You don't choose your company'' when you drive a cab, she notes,
and we're both horrified and delighted by the misfits and
miscreants she scoops up off the streets. Cath frequently feels
like a miscreant, too. She works for a company that is ``so cheap
it has to glue down a $5 calculator'' _ an object she often feels
like prying up herself. ``Not because she wants a calculator, but
because it's the company's. And because it's glued down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cab driving, like the Midwest's gay and lesbian subculture,
offers Cath something she's never received from her family _ a
sturdy sense of belonging. As she debates quitting her job, she
realizes she'll miss ``belonging to a secret elite that owns
nothing and controls nothing but knows every bar, every
supermarket, every business that's gone belly up, everything that
moves down a city street, and how to pry a living from all of it.''
Leaving won't be easy, a fellow driver warns. ``Love doesn't last
forever,'' he says. ``There's only one thing lasts forever, and
that's cab driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawley relates Cath's wandering tale in prose that's spare to
the point of self-denial; her sentences rarely break into metaphor
or poke you awake with sudden flashes of insight. At times, this
spareness resonates with meaning. At other times, ``Trip Sheets''
merely seems flat and banal. When Cath makes a list of what's good
about being single, women's-magazine platitudes are all she can
come up with: ``It makes us take friendships more seriously; it
turns us toward a larger world instead of to one other person all
the time; it makes us self-reliant.'' Worse, there's little here in
the way of momentum or drama. Whenever ``Trip Sheets'' threatens
seriously to snag your interest, Hawley cuts away to another
vignette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trip Sheets'' lacks the lusty, wild-eyed comedy of Blanche
McCrary Boyd's lesbian love story ``Terminal Velocity,'' as well as
the starkly rendered emotion of Dorothy Allison's strongest work.
But Hawley's novel sneaks up on you. Toward the close of the book,
as the pieces of Cath's life begin to fall into place _ she finds a
better job and a secure relationship _ ``Trip Sheets'' becomes
unaccountably moving.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving her apartment one evening, Cath checks the mirror
``to see if she's gotten any thinner, stronger, more graceful or
more likable.'' Nah, she tells herself. In our minds, however,
she's been quite lovely _ and quite likable _ all along.

MOMMY DRESSING
</HEADLINE>
  A Love Story, After a Fashion 
 By Lois Gould 
 Illustrated. 261 pp. New York: Anchor Books/Doubleday. $DESIGNING
WOMAN 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a woman whose mother died giving birth to her, whose
stepmother cared not a whit for her and who so dreaded bearing
children that she had three abortions and would have had more if
her father had not declared on his deathbed that since God had
spared her life she could no longer flout His will. (There was also
a husband determined to keep getting her pregnant.)
</P>
<P>
   Then take this woman's daughter, the second of the two children
she bore unwillingly. That daughter was confined to her room as if
to servant's quarters for long periods of time, rarely spoken to
except in passing, left in the care of sometimes ghoulishly cruel
nannies and viewed largely as an object of questionable esthetic
worth. (``Don't perspire in this dress. I never perspire. Why must
you?'' her mother complained regularly. ``Is that a pimple?'' ``Why
do you let your hair frizz up?'')
</P>
<P>
   Who would not sympathize with the child? Compared with their
parents, children are always helpless and innocent. But what is so
extraordinary about Lois Gould's memoir, ``Mommy Dressing: A Love
Story, After a Fashion,'' is that she, the child in question, makes
us feel the helplessness, the awful emotional ignorance and
deprivation that made her mother who she was, as a parent and as a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's mother was Jo Copeland, a successful and glamorous dress
designer. Movie stars and society ladies wore her clothes with
pride. The young Pauline Trigere once saw her whirling across a
dance floor in Paris and asked who she was. She is a young fashion
designer, Trigere's companion answered. ``Really?'' Trigere
exclaimed. ``Then that's what I want to be.'' During World War II,
when Paris was off limits and fabrics were rationed like food,
American designers had to turn deprivation into inspiration.
Separates and sportswear flourished; clothes started to display
less fuss and more wit. Gould writes, ``Jo Copeland would create
the classic tailored daytime ensemble that could turn into a
sparkling dinner dress with the flick of a collarless jacket.'' And
she would always be considered one whose ready-to-wear designs were
of couture quality.
</P>
<P>
   She wore her own clothes wonderfully, and she was never without
admirers, sycophants or escorts. Unfortunately, her daughter was
expected to be just as worshipful and undemanding. She should have
been content to stand quietly in her mother's room, watching as she
dressed or sat on her black velvet pouf, gazing into a vast mirror
framed by silver columns, like ``an ark of some covenant, with
hidden doors that swung open to reveal fragrant jars and beautiful
bottles, each of which held other secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parents were like haughty deities who held their children
in thrall. Belief was shot through with desperation (how can young
children afford not to believe, or try to believe, in their
parents?); rebellions brought swift and terrible punishment.
Gould's father, who owned a cigar business and was always told he
looked just like Cary Grant, left the family when Lois was 3 years
old. When her mother moved into a new apartment on Park Avenue, she
summoned the two children, the governess, the housekeeper and the
housekeeper's son into the foyer, which had a diamond-patterned
black-and-white floor. There, Gould recalls, ``we stood in a circle
and promised never to set foot on the white diamonds while
traversing the foyer to reach our rooms, or when crossing in the
opposite direction toward the kitchen. It was understood that we
had little or no business in the dining or living rooms except to
practice the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to her parents' marriage, that trusty old
Astaire-Rogers formula had broken down. She wanted class, he wanted
sex, and neither wanted a compromise. So Lois's father continued
his longstanding affair with Red, the wife of his best friend,
Charlie, from the haven of a bachelor apartment. Lois often spent
her weekly paternal visit with the three of them, naively basking
in the attention his mistress gave her. (Which certainly gives
added resonance to the title of Gould's novel ``Such Good
Friends.'')
</P>
<P>
   And just as she was hypnotized by her mother's elegance and
solipsism, she was seduced by her father's virility and cruelty.
Whenever he was summoned to their apartment to discipline her
brother, she begged him to hit her instead. ``All I ever wished
then was for my sins to count, my failures to deserve the belt, the
hairbrush, the closed door, the howling screams. The whistling
sound of the descending weapon, and the other sound, the sickening
smack as buckle sliced into flesh. How I had begged my father for
it, hit me, not him! Me! And how they misunderstood, all of them.
They thought I meant to defend my brother. I only wanted my
father's wrath, which I mistook for love.''
</P>
<P>
   How does Gould manage not to get stranded between self-pity and
self-loathing, not to lurch from unmodulated rage to those
unconvincing pretenses of absolution that usually read something
like: ``It was monstrous of course. I could never do that to a
child of my own. But I now see . . .''?
</P>
<P>
   She has constructed her book so that her parents' lives, with
and without her, come to us in many ways: as psychological
revelations, as social and sexual history, as tales of New York
life. One tale starts in Brooklyn, where a blouse peddler decides
to train his daughter for a job in the fashion industry, partly
because she is talented, partly because her earnings can help put
her brother through law school. Another takes place in Manhattan,
where rich women's housekeepers investigate the financial assets of
gentlemen callers. If George is really a Greek millionaire, then
Sally will plant open boxes of Kotex in Jo's bathroom. That way he
will know, without having to ask, that she is young enough to bear
children.
</P>
<P>
   When Gould was about 10, she visited her mother's workplace on
Seventh Avenue in the garment district. There was Jo Copeland on
her knees, pulling, draping and pinning fabric onto a model,
sketching, selecting fabrics and accessories, shaping it all into a
whole. That is how Gould writes; she even uses the language of
fashion, with its mingling of rules and ambiguities, to frame her
stories: ``Models,'' ``Mix &AMP; Match,'' ``Separates.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-DRESSING-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; (UNDATED: Match,'' ``Separates.'')
</P>
<P>
   A chapter called ``Diamonds II'' gives us Jo's triumphant
description of how she brought herself diamond-and-ruby bracelets
during the Depression. ``How dare you?'' her husband shouted.
``I've earned them. I want them. I'm keeping them,'' she replied.
But years later, when her daughter asked if she was proud to have
been the only one of her friends to buy her own jewelry, she
answered: ``Proud? Every other woman's jewels came from a man who
loved her. Only I was cursed with talent instead.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jo Copeland, the great Cinderella of modern times was Wallis
Warfield Simpson, who certainly never bought her own jewels.
Copeland was one of a handful of designers asked to send the best
of her collection to the royal hotel suite when the Duchess of
Windsor visited New York. For weeks she carried the Duchess's
crested thank-you note around with her, displaying it to anyone who
would look. She earned her daughter's embarrassed disdain. But
after describing her mother's eager, childish snobbery, Gould's
tone changes, and she writes: ``Until I learned how Jo's mother
died giving birth to her, I never understood why, for Jo, a great
love story had to be one that didn't end with babies, a home and
family. Wasn't that what 'happily ever after' meant? Yet to her,
not having babies was literally life and death. How could I know it
wasn't just her vanity, her consummate self-absorption?''
</P>
<P>
   Dispassionate compassion is a very moving quality, and it marks
``Mommy Dressing'' from beginning to end. It is also a hard-won
quality when we enter that private, even claustrophobic, territory
that mothers and children inhabit. Like other recent books I
admire, Gould's fuses this intimate material with social, national
or political history. (I am thinking of Helen Epstein's ``Where She
Came From,'' Honor Moore's ``White Blackbird,'' Wendy Gimbel's
``Havana Dreams'' and Beth Kephart's ``Slant of Sun.'') The result
is to free, not burden, the narrator's voice. The memoir's future
depends on this new kind of ``I,'' one as fluid and potent as
``Once upon a time.''

THE POISONWOOD BIBLE
</HEADLINE>
  By Barbara Kingsolver 
 546 pp. New York: Harper Flamingo. $26 
 ------ 
 GOING NATIVE 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phrase ``heart of darkness'' occurs only once, as far as I
can tell, in Barbara Kingsolver's haunting new novel, ``The
Poisonwood Bible.'' When it does, it falls from the mouth of
Orleanna Price, a Baptist missionary's wife who uses it to describe
not the Belgian Congo, where she, her husband and their four
daughters were posted in 1959, but the state of her marriage in
those days and the condition of what she calls ``the country once
known as Orleanna Wharton,'' wholly occupied back then by Nathan
Price, aforesaid husband and man of God. Joseph Conrad's great
novella flickers behind her use of that phrase, and yet it doesn't.
Orleanna is not a quoting woman, and for the quoting man in the
family, her strident husband, there can be only one source _ the
Bible, unambiguous and entire, even in a land that demonstrates
daily the suppleness of language. ``Tata Jesus is bangala!'' he
shouts during his African sermons. It never occurs to him that in
Kikongo, a language in which meaning hangs on intonation, bangala
may mean '''precious and dear,'' but it also means the poisonwood
tree _ a virulent local plant _ when spoken in the flat accent of
an American zealot.
</P>
<P>
   The Prices are Nathan and Orleanna and their daughters: Ruth
May, the youngest; Rachel, the oldest, a pale blond Mrs. Malaprop
of a teen-ager; and the twins, Leah and Adah. Both twins are
gifted, but Adah suffers from hemiplegia, which leaves her limping
and nearly speechless. The female members of the family narrate
``The Poisonwood Bible'' in turn. Orleanna does so in retrospect,
from her later years on Sanderling Island, off the coast of
Georgia. The girls, however, tell their story from the Congo as it
happens, on the precipice of events, like an epistolary novel
written from a place with no postal service and no hope of pen
pals.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Price narrates nothing. And yet his certitude _ and the
literal-minded ferocity with which he expresses it _ is the altar
around which these women arrange themselves. We already know his
story, Kingsolver implies. Most of what we have always heard, she
suggests, are stories told by men like him. ``The Poisonwood
Bible'' thus belongs to the women, and it is a story about the loss
of one faith and the discovery of another, for each woman according
to her kind. As Adah, so bright, so willing to torque the mother
tongue, puts it, ``One god draws in the breath of life and rises;
another god expires.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prices travel from Bethlehem, Ga., to a village called
Kilanga on the Kwilu River in the summer of 1959, just a few months
before Patrice Lumumba becomes Prime Minister of the newly
independent Republic of the Congo _ not long, therefore, before he
is arrested and murdered with the complicity of the United States
and its President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose photograph Orleanna
hangs in the kitchen hut behind their mud house: ``I'd cut it out
of a magazine and nailed it over the plank counter where I kneaded
the bread. . . . I remember every detail of him: the clear-rimmed
glasses and spotted tie, the broad smile, the grandfatherly bald
head like a warm, bright light bulb. He looked so trustworthy and
kind. A beacon from home, reminding me of our purpose.'' The irony
in Orleanna's words is the same irony she uses to describe the
early days of her marriage, when there was still room for laughter
in her husband's evangelical calling, before her pregnancies
embarrassed him, before he returned from World War II a different
man _ a man who planned ``to save more souls than had perished on
the road from Bataan.'' Nathan Price escaped that road by sheer
luck, and knowing it curled his heart ``like a piece of hard shoe
leather.''
</P>
<P>
   In Conrad's novella, the heart of darkness is both Kurtz's
despoiled purpose and the terrain in which that purpose is worked.
In Kingsolver's novel, the heart of darkness belongs only to men
like Nathan Price and a local pilot named Eeben Axelroot, a figure
from Graham Greene who shuttles spooklike in and out of Kilanga.
The Congo is a hard place for the Price women, and its people are
unfathomable at first, but Kilanga contains no Conradian darkness.
Army ants, drought, hookworm, hunger, pestilential rain, diseases
and still more diseases and green mamba snakes, yes, but no
darkness. What all the Price women discover _ all except Rachel,
``whose only hopes for the year were a sweet-16 party and a pink
mohair twin set'' _ is the near-perfect adaptation of the Congolese
to the harsh conditions of their existence, a fittedness that is
beautiful in itself. With that knowledge comes the discovery of the
Prices' own profound ignorance. Once the comedy of colliding
cultures ends, the tragedy begins. As Leah says: ``Everything
you're sure is right can be wrong in another place. Especially
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congo permeates ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' and yet this is a
novel that is just as much about America, a portrait, in absentia,
of the nation that sent the Prices to save the souls of a people
for whom it felt only contempt, people who already, in the words of
a more experienced missionary, ``have a world of God's grace in
their lives, along with a dose of hardship that can kill a person
entirely.'' The Congolese are not savages who need saving, the
Price women find, and there is nothing passive in their tolerance
of missionaries. They take the Americans' message literally _
elections are good, Jesus too _ and expose its contradictions by
holding an election in church to decide whether or not Jesus shall
be the personal god of Kilanga. Jesus loses.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all its portraiture of place, its reflexive
political vitriol, its passionate condemnation of Nathan Price,
``The Poisonwood Bible'' is ultimately a novel of character, a
narrative shaped by keen-eyed women contemplating themselves and
one another and a village whose familiarity it takes a tragedy to
discover. Rachel is the epitome of America's material culture, a
cunning, brainless girl who parodies television commercials and
says of Eeben Axelroot, ``I'm willing to be a philanderist for
peace, but a lady can only go so far where perspiration odor is
concerned.'' Ruth May, the baby, is the innocent whose words betray
the guilty; she is the catalyst that splits the Price family apart.
When Orleanna speaks of the Congo, many years later, she does so by
addressing Ruth May, whose questioning eyes watch over Orleanna's
life with more compassion than ever fell from the burning gaze of
her husband's God.
</P>
<P>
   These are precious creatures, but none are as precious to the
reader as Leah and Adah, the twin and the niwt, as Adah calls
herself, referring to her backward condition. Limping, nearly
silent, Adah is a verbal gymnast, a dedicated diarist, a profound
skeptic. Her father, she reports, probably interpreted her twisted
newborn state ``as God's Christmas bonus to one of His worthier
employees.'' Adah's wit bristles throughout this novel; it is wit
of a kind that Leah, a tomboy who eagerly seeks her father's
approval, would never use. Leah's, instead, is an entirely ethical
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Poisonwood Bible'' turns on several axes, and one of them
is Leah's struggle to rebalance herself morally when she finally
realizes exactly who her father is. Once she had said, ``My father
wears his faith like the bronze breastplate of God's foot soldiers,
while our mother's is more like a good cloth coat with a secondhand
fit.'' But when the armor fell, she saw that Nathan Price's ``blue
eyes with their left-sided squint, weakened by the war, had a
vacant look. His large reddish ears repelled me. My father was a
simple, ugly man.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Prices adapt to the Congo, in their way, but Adah and
Leah are carried farthest in their adaptation. Rachel accomplishes
this by not adapting at all. ``The way I see Africa,'' she says,
``you don't have to like it but you sure have to admit it's out
there. You have your way of thinking and it has its, and never the
train ye shall meet!'' For Adah, adaptation comes in the form of
unforgiving self-discovery, the realization that ``even the crooked
girl believed her own life was precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah, the conscience of this striking novel, is forever
measuring the distance she must travel before her adaptation is
made perfect. It was so when her father owned her, in her mother's
words, ``like a plot of land,'' and it is still so in her maturity
_ wed, so to speak, to the continent. In the end, she explains: ``I
am the un-missionary, as Adah would say, beginning each day on my
knees, asking to be converted. Forgive me, Africa, according to the
multitudes of thy mercies.''

IN BRIEF: FICTION 
 FLIGHTS OF ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
  By Ellen Gilchrist 
 Little, Brown, $24  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her 16th book, Ellen Gilchrist returns once again to the
decadent, arty, emotionally indulgent Southern women who have
appeared in so many of her previous works. Characters like Rhoda
and Crystal are now middle-aged, observing life from the perimeter.
In ``The Carnival of the Stoned Children,'' when Rhoda discovers
LSD in her young son's pants pocket, she is horrified: ``I fished
it out and laid it down upon Jimmy's bed, right in the middle of
his University of Mississippi victory quilt that my brother had
given him for Christmas.'' It isn't clear why Gilchrist is
interested in keeping up with these women -- like the writing,
they're dull and predictable. What was clever and sharp in her
award-winning 1984 collection, ``Victory Over Japan,'' is now
simply quaint. So it's a relief to meet fresh characters like
16-year-old Aurora Harris, who is truly hilarious. Especially
amusing is the ironic eye Aurora casts on the feverish antics of
her born-again younger sister, who's preparing to entertain her
church group in ``Witness to the Crucifixion.'' Both girls are
struggling with the death of their older brother, a fact that
Gilchrist keeps nicely in the background. But within these 19
stories such control is the exception. Instead, a lazy kind of
shorthand permeates the collection: men are philanderers, Jews have
a talent for making money and blacks are gorgeous. Points of view
swing from speaker to speaker and many of the stories end abruptly.
Perhaps Gilchrist should be more concerned with honing new material
and less with reporting on the old. _ ERICA SANDERS

   &UR; BELONG TO ME &QL; 
 &UR; By Kai Maristed &QL; 
 &UR; Random House, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The language of the horse world, so brusque and unromantic it's
almost combative, sets the rhythm for this admirably unconventional
collection of stories. Maristed's characters are dedicated horse
people, but her depiction of their feelings for these animals is
refreshingly free of predictable symbolism. In one story, an
ungainly woman does a melancholy striptease in a cornfield in
exchange for a trailerful of old nags bound for the knacker. In
another, a little girl impulsively dumps her toy horses into the
ocean, unaware that her trainer father, miles away at a racetrack,
is at that very moment watching his best hope for the future break
down. The equestrian jargon in ``Belong to Me'' is so perfectly
rendered it's hard to imagine what a reader who's never spent time
in the saddle will make of it; even for the initiated, the prose
may at times seem too laconic. But if winning a reader's complicity
is a writer's biggest obstacle, Maristed clears it with style. _

   &UR; SURVEYOR &QL; 
 &UR; By G. W. Hawkes &QL; 
 &UR; MacMurray &AMP; Beck, $20 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul and John have spent over 30 years living in the New Mexico
desert, surveying the land for a foundation that has never made its
reasons for hiring them entirely clear. Now, as a team of
paleontologists, a beautiful young filmmaker and various other
interlopers suddenly appear in their lonely outpost, their lifework
begins to look fragile and their friendship -- perhaps their very
reason for living -- is challenged. In this spare yet vibrant
novel, G. W. Hawkes often pleases the reader with his sharp, terse
dialogue and his knack for imbuing a potentially monotonous setting
with color and meaning. The subtle permutations of his central
characters' shifting relationship are also interesting to follow.
It's in the novel's larger thematic statements -- its investigation
of human responses to mortality in the face of nature's seeming
permanence -- that ``Surveyor'' can appear arch and unconvincing.
Here what Hawkes may have meant to be suggestive seems
frustratingly vague or uncertain -- or, on the other hand, far too
predictable. Despite its small successes, ``Surveyor'' demonstrates
that its author has yet to learn how to shift such a delicate story
into a wider context. _ PATRICK GILES

<P>
   &UR; THE CATCH &QL; 
 &UR; By Kim Wozencraft &QL; 
 &UR; Doubleday, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too close to its beginning, Kim Wozencraft's latest novel starts
to telegraph its ending. It quickly becomes obvious, for instance,
that Kurt the drug smuggler will find it difficult to give up the
thrills and income of the game, despite frequent promises to his
wife, Annie. For her part, Annie will have an even more difficult
time reconciling her role as a responsible parent of their two
young sons with her love for Kurt. And Joseph Kessler, a narcotics
agent with a heart, will himself fall for Annie, making his dogged
pursuit of Kurt a much more complicated affair. Most predictable of
all is the finale: from early on, it's clear that ``The Catch'' is
heading toward a confrontation that will involve all three main
characters -- and their deepest hopes and deepest fears -- and will
probably end in violence. But surprisingly, the foreshadowing
detracts less than one might think from the novel's force. This is
probably because Wozencraft (the author of the well-received novel
``Rush,'' and herself a former undercover narcotics officer) has
some pertinent things to say about the seductive qualities of a
life lived outside the law and the nature of the addictive
personality -- not only among those who supply an illegal market
but among those who try to stop them. It's also because she
cleverly portrays Kurt and Annie as typical middle-class parents
with typical middle-class concerns -- bringing up the boys in a
healthy environment, spending quality time together and dealing
with the everyday stresses of a marriage in which one partner must
spend considerable time away from home. Just don't ask what Dad's
doing while Mom's at the Little League game. _ JAMES POLK

   &UR; THE FOREIGN STUDENT &QL; 
 &UR; By Susan Choi &QL; 
 &UR; Harper Flamingo, $23 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susan Choi's first novel is a richly detailed exploration of a
young man's escape from the nightmare of a country torn by war.
During a stint as a translator for the American information
services in Seoul, a young Korean named Chang Ahn is caught up in
the political turmoil and forced into a life on the run. By August
1955, two years after the cease-fire has ended the war, Chang has
managed to emigrate to the United States, where he attempts to
settle into the life of a scholarship student in the university
town of Sewanee, Tenn. Yet he is unprepared for the smallest shocks
of a vastly different world: even the realization that people in
Sewanee go to sleep at night without locking their doors is
unnerving. Choi (herself the daughter of a Korean immigrant father)
catches such moments under a very clear glass, wisely resisting the
urge to embellish. Instead, she allows the story to blossom slowly
after Chang (renamed Chuck) makes his first real friend in America:
Katherine Monroe, his 28-year-old neighbor. Caught in a poisonous
relationship with a popular professor, begun while she was only 14,
Katherine is nearly as wounded as Chuck. Together they begin to
heal, not with the dreamy pleasure of romantic young lovers but
tentatively and painfully, mindful of all that has gone wrong in
their lives -- and all that might still go wrong. Moving from the
present to the past, from America to Korea, Choi brings hundreds of
small scenes to life, then uses them to construct an intricate
portrait of lovers who must also prove (to themselves and others)
that they are survivors. _ KIMBERLY B. MARLOWE

EMPLOYERS NEED TO RECONSIDER SICK-LEAVE POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Part of me wishes that all the workers on Earth
would call in sick tomorrow and keep calling in sick every day
until they use up all the sick days their employers offer.
</P>
<P>
   I can't honestly recommend that because it would cause so much
chaos, but at least it would wake up all those companies that have
antiquated sick leave policies _ policies that essentially
discriminate against dedicated workers.
</P>
<P>
   Unscheduled absenteeism is up 25 percent nationwide from a year
ago, according to a recent study by CCH Inc., an Illinois provider
of information on human resources and employment law. The survey
also found that the absenteeism was the highest it has been in
seven years, and employers expect the situation to get worse over
the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the last decade, that shouldn't be a surprise.
Companies laid off people, leaving more work and more stress for
those who remained. Long-term loyalty pretty much disappeared.
Job-hunting gurus advised workers to constantly build their skills
_ on their own time _ to stay competitive. Many employees were
afraid to miss work because of the fear of more layoffs, adding
still more stress. Then a lot of the fear disappeared because so
many employers became so desperate for workers.
</P>
<P>
   If that makes your head spin, good. Call in sick.
</P>
<P>
   About one-fourth of the unscheduled absences are because of
family issues, with the rest divided among illness, personal needs,
stress and ``entitlement mentality'' _ the feeling of workers that
they are entitled to take every day off they can get, including all
their sick days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional `sick days' often encourage unscheduled absences
because employees have to call in `sick' at the last minute when
they may really be taking the day for personal or family matters
that they've known about well in advance,'' says Paul Gibson, a CCH
attorney and human resources analyst. ``However, they're supposed
to be sick, so they have to wait until the last minute to notify
their employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can further raise stress for an employee who needs the
time off, but is uncomfortable lying to the employer. It's also
difficult for the employer who has to scramble to figure out how to
cover for the absent employee.''
</P>
<P>
   And often the ``cover'' is provided by putting extra strain on
the most dedicated workers _ those who seldom call in sick. Even if
they understand why their colleagues are absent, it can lead to
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional sick leave policies, giving each employee 10 days or
so a year, have become out of date for at least a couple of
reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ More families have both parents working, meaning that one has
to miss work if a child is sick or child-care plans fall through.
If the employer doesn't consider that a legitimate reason for
calling in sick, the parent will either resent the employer or lie
about it and call in sick anyway. And if the employer does consider
it legitimate, people without children can resent it if they aren't
granted similar leniency when they need time off for personal
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ People used to build up sick days by not calling in sick for
years, partly out of loyalty and partly as protection in case a
serious illness hit. But as loyalty and job security have faded,
those reasons aren't as compelling as they used to be. Take it from
one who's been there: Having 80 sick days in the bank doesn't do
you a whole lot of good if your company goes out of business.
</P>
<P>
   What has worked well for many companies, the survey says, is to
offer paid time-off programs. Instead of having, say, 10 vacation
days and 10 sick days a year, an employee would get 20 days of paid
time off. That way many people could schedule most of their days
off, except for those times when they are really sick, allowing
managers and co-workers to prepare for it. And the dedicated
employees wouldn't feel slighted.
</P>
<P>
   My two cents: If a company now offers 10 vacation days and 10
sick days, give workers 15 days of paid time off and have other
policies regarding funeral leave, jury duty and serious illnesses.
Let them save up a few days a year if they want, with the
understanding that they will be paid for those days if they are
laid off, quit or retire.
</P>
<P>
   The survey says other effective methods of reducing unscheduled
absences have included flexible scheduling, emergency child care, a
compressed workweek and letting parents have time off to attend
school functions. About half the companies surveyed do allow
flexible scheduling, but fewer than one-fourth use any of the other
methods, including paid time off.
</P>
<P>
   In professional sports, when a player misses a regular-season
game with a relatively minor injury, he'll often say, ``If it was a
playoff game, I would have played.''
</P>
<P>
   In the workplace these days, though, there aren't as many
playoff games as there used to be. Employers need to recognize
that.

AVOIDING LAWSUITS IS MUCH EASIER THAN WINNING THEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be careful what you say around the office, or you could wind up
in court.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for what you write, too: What you assumed was
long-erased e-mail may come back to haunt you.
</P>
<P>
   American businesses are spending a lot of time in court these
days, according to St.Louis-based attorney Thomas Schweich. And
thousands of cases are being built on seemingly chance
communications, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: It's costing a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical large company has over 450 lawsuits going on at any
given time,'' Schweich writes in his new book. ``Thanks to the
litigation explosion, legal costs are now running at 5 to 10
percent of earnings for some of the nation's biggest
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a small company can easily be forced into bankruptcy
over a single case, Schweich adds.
</P>
<P>
   An insider's description of the legal mania occurring in the
business world, and some solid suggestions of how to prevent your
company from wallowing in the mire, are in Schweich's book,
``Protect Yourself From Business Lawsuits (... and Lawyers Like
Me)'' (Scribner, 223 pages, $24).
</P>
<P>
   Armed with degrees from Yale and Harvard and 13 years of legal
experience as a trial lawyer, Schweich takes an interesting
approach to the massive problems in the U.S. legal system. He
blames neither judges nor lawmakers for the problems, instead
narrowing it down to one issue: caseload.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 cases were filed in federal court in 1996,
which translates to 471 cases per federal judge, added to a docket
already crowded with pending cases. Each judge completed 27 trials
in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics speak for themselves: The judge simply does not
have time for your case,'' Schweich writes. ``Most judges are
conscientious and honest. The problem is that they will exhibit
these qualities only during the two minutes that they have to
address your case. That means that trying to obtain justice these
days is always a very big gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Schweich estimates that the very best cases have an 80 percent
chance of winning, something he calls the ``arbitrary factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of larger dockets, broadening causes of action,
liberal rules of discovery, unscrupulous lawyers, and unpredictable
juries is what I call the `arbitrary factor,' '' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   That means a case that is merely good has just a 60 percent
change of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with those odds, Schweich says, the only responsible
action is to be proactive in avoiding lawsuits _ an interesting
twist from someone who is a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Schweich then goes on to the meat of his book, which is to
discuss what he terms eight big mistakes made in companies that
often lead to lawsuits, and then four ``shields'' to help protect
companies from being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mistakes that need to be avoided:
</P>
<P>
   Watch what you write. Complaints against your boss, gossip or
irreverent comments, whether in internal memos, meeting notes or
even e-mail, can be obtained and scrutinized by opposing lawyers in
trail. A marking of ``confidential'' won't protect you, and hitting
the delete button on your e-mail won't erase it, Schweich warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you contemplate writing something down, assume that
it will be read by twelve jurors who do not know you and who do not
know your company,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Watch what you say. Speculation on areas you know nothing about,
even to your closest office mates, can be used against you in court
if the opposing attorney finds out about it. Example: A design
engineer said a new computer was not on schedule because
manufacturing was having quality problems. In fact, the customers
had not provided information about their needs in a timely fashion.
But in court, the engineer was called on to restate his uninformed
opinion. The result was a bad settlement for his company.
</P>
<P>
   Watch whom you hire and do business with. Many companies do not
do even the most basic background checks on people they hire or
companies they work with. Resume fraud is rampant, Schweich warns.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the book provides excellent and practical advice on how
to avoid walking into the litigation trap.

   ``Trinity's'' sleek look, richly layered story lines and
multiple-lead character structure is the same route to riches taken
by John Wells' perennial hit ``ER.'' But judging from Friday
night's pilot, the producer may have trouble striking gold this
time.
</P>
<P>
   This new dramatic series about a large, working-class,
Irish-Catholic family in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen is not only
surprisingly contrived, but it even has the nerve to strut in a
high-minded manner while giving us secondhand characters and
battle-scarred subplots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinity'' (8 p.m. CDT Friday night, NBC) centers on the
McCallisters, five adult siblings covering all the common Irish
bases: Brothers include Bobby (Justin Louis), a police detective
with a frustrated wife (Kim Raver); Liam (Sam Trammell), a union
worker with ties to the lowlifes Bobby is trying to lock up; and
Kevin (Tate Donovan), a parish priest who shoots hoops and is on a
first-name basis with the local barflys.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters include Fiona (Charlotte Ross), a thriving
stockbroker in the dumps because her lover is going on vacation
with his wife and kids (''He said this would be the month he'd
leave!'' she says, weeping), and Amanda (Bonnie Root), a wild,
self-destructive sort who, judging by her perpetual hangover, is
the ignored baby of the clan who has seriously gone astray.
</P>
<P>
   Story lines hinted at include how another McCallister brother
was killed at 15, whether Amanda is pregnant, and just how involved
Liam was with Bobby's wife, who has her own insecurities. (''Is she
cute?'' Bobby's wife wants to know after learning that his new
partner is a woman. At least they end this discussion by slinging
dinner off the table and going at it right there.)
</P>
<P>
   The way ``Trinity'' is structured, characters will trip over one
another, generating conflict and the usual family angst. In Friday
night's pilot, Bobby finds himself at odds (this promises to be an
ongoing fight) with Liam over a murder case, while Kevin is brought
into the melee to set Bobby up for a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin is in another story line in which a friend wants his
counsel on leaving his wife and kid for a man.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers are the parents, Simon and Eileen, played by
John Spencer, whom you might remember from the dying days of ``L.A.
Law,'' and film actress Jill Clayburgh in a thanklessly frazzled,
dutiful mother/wife/superwoman role.
</P>
<P>
   We don't see much of them in the pilot pilot, except at the
beginning and end when the clan sits down for family dinner,
laughing and chatting like any fun-loving tribe. Let's hope they'll
be more than simply stock characters who turn up only as sounding
boards of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for Friday nights, ``Trinity'' will be in the same
boat as ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' which understands a thing
or two about luring viewers on the week's least-watched night.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to offer something decidedly different. Let's see
what happens in future episodes with ``Trinity.'' So far, we've
been there and done that.

`TRINITY' THE BETTER OF TWO NEW NBC DRAMAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is fitting, in this the season of the Irish theme, that two
of the final shows to debut focus on close-knit clans of Irish
descent.
</P>
<P>
   There are the McCallisters of ``Trinity,'' the follow-up series
for ``ER'' executive producer John Wells, and the Connollys of
``Wind on Water,'' which is likely the worst new series of the
season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SHOW: TRINITY
</P>
<P>
   The first scene of ``Trinity'' looks a lot like the opening
scene from any episode of ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some kids are playing in a Manhattan landfill when one of them
happens upon a pair of decaying hands.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent scenes of ``Trinity,'' however, lack the punch
and drama of even the worst hour of ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some dreadfully boring scenes in this family drama,
which includes several Irish stereotypes played by an outstanding
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   One son, Bobby, is a police officer, who is married to a drunk
and jealous flirt; another, Liam, is an up-and-comer in the crooked
rackets who has fooled around with the drunk, jealous flirt; and
the third boy in the family is a rebellious priest.
</P>
<P>
   The women in the family have their own problems _ a boozer who's
pregnant and a stockbroker who's having an affair with a married
man.
</P>
<P>
   They all meet once a week for dinner and, of course, beers at
the folks'.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are likable caricatures, and the show has a
classy look, but its dramatic themes are too contrived _ for
instance Bobby (played by Justin Louis, the show's potential
breakout star) is investigating a murder in which Liam (Sam
Trammell) is tangentially involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinity'' is a tough sell for NBC on Friday nights. Even the
network's ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' which is an infinitely
better program, has had to battle back from near-cancellation on
several occasions. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Trinity.'' &QL; 
WHAT &UR; : &LR;  A close-knit Irish family lives in manhattan. among the
group is a cop, a union operative and a priest. Beers are downed,
and problems are manufactured for the sole purpose of being
solved. &QL; 
THE STARS &UR; : &LR;  Jill Clayburgh, Tate Donovan, Justin Louis, Kim Raver,
Bonnie Root, Charlotte Ross, John Spencer, Sam Trammell. &QL; 
WHERE &UR; : &LR; !off! NBC &QL; 
WHEN &UR; : &LR;  9 p.m. Fridays. &QL; 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEW SHOW: WIND ON WATER
</P>
<P>
   This laughable NBC drama can be summed up in one word: bad.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Derek makes her debut as a television-series regular in this
hideous program. She plays Ciel Connolly, the matriarch of a big
and beautiful family of hard-bodied athletes who run a cattle ranch
in Hawaii. Early in the show, her husband dies, and she has to
fight back the family rival, land developer Gardner Poole (Lee
Horsley). She will not, for the sake of her husband's memory, sell
the land.
</P>
<P>
   Her two daredevil sons _ Cole (William Gregory Lee) and Kelly
(Brian Gross) _ hit the extreme-sports circuit in an attempt to win
contests to save the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The show looks like a seventh-grader edited it; cuts from actual
surfers to the actors trying to look like they are on 900-foot
waves wouldn't fool a blind man. The stories are stupid and acting
is poor. The only thing that looks good in the show is the cast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE  &LR; SHOW &UR; : &LR;  ``Wind on Water.'' &QL; 
WHAT &UR; : &LR;  A family of Hawaiian cattle ranchers needs two of its brood
to make money by using their skills at extreme sports to keep the
farm alive. &QL; 
THE STARS &UR; : &LR;  Bo Derek, Lee Horsley, William Gregory Lee, Brian
Gross, Jacinda Barrett, Shawn Christian, Matt George, Matthew
Stephen Liu. &QL; 
WHERE &UR; : &LR; !off! NBC. &QL; 
WHEN &UR; : &LR;  8 p.m. Saturdays. &QL;

   POPE-ANNIVERSARY _ VATICAN CITY _ Pope John Paul II, Superstar.
The leader of the billion-strong Roman Catholic Church marks his
20th year on St. Peter's throne on Friday (Oct. 16). He has brought
a new vitality and graciousness to the papacy during two momentous
decades, though now at 78 he is fragile and fading. But in his
prime, John Paul II helped hasten the collapse of communism and
energized his church by traveling to almost every country on earth
except China and Russia. In the age of TV and the Web, he humanized
what for centuries was a unapproachable, authoritarian job. It will
be a hard act to follow. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   CARTER-NOBEL _ The rife speculation over who will get this
year's coveted Nobel Peace Prize will end early Friday morning when
the five-member selection committee announces the winner in Oslo,
Norway. Former President Jimmy Carter is among the record 139
nominations that were considered this year. He is not considered to
be a front-runner, according to the Norwegian press, which has
reported that the favorites for this year's prize are Czech
President Vaclav Havel, the parties in the Northern Ireland peace
agreement, the aid group Medicins Sans Frontieres and U.N. human
rights workers. In keeping with its strong tradition of secrecy,
the committee says nothing about the winner until the announcement.
Nor do members divulge the names of nominees. Those details are
sealed for 50 years, in accordance with the wishes of Alfred Nobel,
who endowed the Nobel prizes in his 1895 will. In an unusual breach
of secrecy, a non-voting official with the Norwegian Nobel
committee confirmed last week that Carter was denied the Nobel
Peace Prize 20 years ago because of a technicality: he had not been
nominated by the deadline. (Kurylo, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

to have a candlelight vigil for Shepherd. GLOBES, a UGA
organization for Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Employees and their
Supporters, are sponsoring the rally in Athens, a candlelight vigil
at 8 p.m. at the UGA Arch. In addition, Atlanta City Councilwoman
Cathy Woolard plans to introduce legislation at Monday's council
meeting asking the General Assembly to pass hate crimes legislation
when it reconvenes in January. (McCarthy/Visser, Atlanta

   EDDIE _ NEW ORLEANS _ Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who earned his
nickname ``Fast Eddie'' the same way President Clinton earned the
nickname ``Slick Willie'' _ by escaping scandals that would have
de- stroyed lesser politicians _ could see his good luck run dry
this week. A two-year federal investigation that involved
wiretapping, searches, and seizures of large amounts of cash from
Edwards' home and office, as well as hundreds of hours of secret
grand jury testimony, is coming to a close. And the noose could be
tightening around the neck of the once-invincible, always colorful
four-time governor. He could be indicted this week. (Rochell,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

SOME GUN MAKERS NOT INSTALLING CHILD-SAFETY DEVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last October, President Clinton stood in the Rose
Garden with a group of gun manufacturers at his side, hailing the
industry's voluntary agreement with the White House to put
child-safety devices on guns.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, it appears that the promises of that ceremony
have not been realized. Sixteen out of 20 of the firearms
manufacturers that signed on to the agreement are not selling
child-safety devices with their handguns, according to a national
survey by the Violence Policy Center in Washington and two other
handgun-control groups.
</P>
<P>
   The center released its findings Wednesday. Clinton on Thursday
hosted a White House conference on school safety and the need to
find new ways to protect children from violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Policy Center report conducted three surveys of six
major firearms distributors, seven retail firearm outlets, and 45
gun retail gun dealers in 25 states. Four of the 20 manufacturers
were complying with the voluntary agreement, and of the four, three
already sold safety devices with their guns before the agreement
was reached, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives criticized the findings, saying the
line of questioning used by the center was misleading and that its
findings were not reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the survey accurately shows the extent to
which manufacturers are packing safety devices with their guns,''
said Bob Delfay, president of the Connecticut-based National
Shooting Sports Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R 1817 Inc., a Gardner, Mass., gun manufacturer cited for not
selling guns with child-safety mechanisms, said it was in fact
complying because it sold its handguns with a ``lockable'' case for
the gun and a $5 coupon for a lock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is important that every person have a choice to
store their gun in whatever way they see fit and we feel a lockable
case is more important than a trigger lock,'' said Jim Garrison,
H&AMP;R president.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Feldman, who brokered the deal with the White House,
agreed with Delfay, adding that most major handgun manufacturers
were in the process of deciding which safety devices best suited
their guns. The industry had until the end of this year to comply
with the agreement, said Feldman, executive director of the
American Shooting Sports Council, a trade group representing the
gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rose Garden ceremony a year ago, Feldman said, ``Within
the coming year, most major handgun manufacturers will institute
company policies of providing safety devices with all handguns
shipped in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Policy Center said Feldman had not lived up to his
statements from last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those devices are not out there now, and for Richard Feldman
to create the impression that any other than a handful of
manufacturers are systematically using safety devices is completely
and utterly misleading,'' said Kristin Rand, director of federal
policy at the Violence Policy Center.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reached last year's agreement with gun
manufacturers as gun-control legislators on Capitol Hill were
stepping up efforts to pass a bill requiring that guns be sold with
safety devices such as trigger locks. Those efforts were abandoned
after the deal was struck, according to congressional staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased to announce that eight of the largest handgun
manufacturers will now provide child-safety devices with every new
handgun they sell,'' said Clinton as he announced the agreement at
the White House. ``This will now affect eight of 10 handguns made
in America, and it will save many young lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was followed by advertisements in Washington papers
celebrating the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Policy Center attacked the entire agreement because
it is voluntary, which means not all manufacturers have to use
safety locks, and because neither party ever produced a written
version of the agreement, making it impossible to ensure the
industry complies.
</P>
<P>
   The center also said _ and Feldman agreed _ that the quality of
safety devices ranges from the high-quality to the cheap and
ineffective, including plastic boxes that are easy to cut through
and trigger locks that can be broken off guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree, if it's a poorly designed lock, it won't work, which
is why it makes sense to have the manufacturer decide what lock is
best ... and have the industry set the standard,'' said Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   The White House referred inquiries on the issue to the Justice
Department. ``We haven't seen the report but we'd like to look
closely at it and review it,'' said Gregory King, a Justice
Department spokesman.

 &HT;    JOHN PAUL II, SUPERSTAR: THE POPE MARKS 20 MOMENTOUS YEARS
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.

<P>
   VATICAN CITY _ History occasionally hands the world a leader who
so seamlessly fits the job and his times that it is difficult to
imagine anyone else in the role.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Pope John Paul II marks 20 years at the head of the
billion-strong Roman Catholic Church, a job he has redefined with
tenacious energy and unprecedented globe-trotting during two
momentous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now at 78, he is fragile and fading. Yet he continues to enliven
his church while staunchly defending its traditional -- and to
some, controversial -- doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The step is slower,'' said Archbishop John Foley, a Vatican
spokesman, ``but the will is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prime, John Paul II helped hasten the collapse of
Communism and the end of the Cold War. He has more than any pope
before him taken steps to reconcile Christianity and Judaism,
issuing a formal apology recently for the Catholic church's silence
during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning a third decade at the Vatican, his reign is longer
than any other pope this century. His mind remains strong, even if
he must fight his ailing body. In 1999, he plans trips to Mexico,
the United States (St. Louis) and to his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As pope, John Paul II has traveled 670,878 miles to 117
countries to deliver his message to many millions in person,
billions on television -- making him among the most recognizable
figures on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   He has been called by a recent biographer ``the last of the
giants on the global stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceremonies at the Vatican and in Poland will observe the papal
anniversary Friday. On Sunday, a special high Mass will be
celebrated in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, despite his sometimes visible pain and slurred
speech (reportedly the result of Parkinson's disease, though the
Vatican has never confirmed it), is looking beyond Friday's
milestone to the approaching millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to be present for the Holy Year 2000 Jubilee, being
planned as a celebration of the church's history and a
reaffirmation of its dogma. On Thursday, he released his 13th papal
encyclical, a 154-page intellectual and theological letter to the
faithful reminding them not to lose their way ``in the shifting
sands of widespread skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the pope's health has led to speculation inside the
Vatican and out about his possible successor and the future course
of Catholic theology.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, theologians and historians have begun the debate over
his legacy. The greatest pope this century? The greatest pope since
St. Peter and St. Paul?
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a tough act to follow,'' said Monsignor Timothy
Dolan, rector of the Pontifical North American College of Rome, a
seminary near the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to think of the papacy as returning to
the former model of leadership -- just the CEO of the church. It is
that, of course, but he has shifted it to a new paradigm -- to a
dimension as a world leader, a towering moral figure and a
universal pastor. He will be
</P>
<P>
   the model for future popes,'' Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enigmatic internal politics of the Vatican, the
numbers suggest that the pope's legacy will continue after his
death. All but 14 of the 115 cardinals eligible to elect a new
pontiff were appointed by John Paul II. More than half of the
church's 4,200 bishops advanced during this pope's reign.
</P>
<P>
   If the deck is stacked, consider also the influence on a
generation of young Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan points out that the new priests being graduated from his
seminary and others grew up with no other role model. ``They think
it normal for the pope to travel, to be accessible, to speak with
people and not at people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1978, the Berlin Wall was still up. Star Wars was
just a movie, not a defense strategy. The Internet was sheer
fantasy and few homes had a computer. Iran was still America's
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Karol Wojtyla, the multilingual, 58-year-old archbishop of
Krakow, was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years and the first
Polish pope ever, elected as change was beginning to sweep
throughout his homeland and the rest of Communist-ruled Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Still wearing the starched vestments and grand robes of the
papacy, he made the job of pope a sometimes gritty business.
</P>
<P>
   Living through the ravages of Nazi- and Soviet-era rule in
Poland, he put his personal stamp on the Solidarity movement in
Poland and threw the full moral weight of the church behind the
relatively bloodless revolution throughout Eastern Europe. He
traveled to Nicaragua in 1983 and stared down the Marxist
Sandinistas over their human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In traveling the world, he brought a common touch and a finesse
of the cameras as no other 20th century pope before him. He
survived an assassination attempt in 1981, but continued his
frequent travel, albeit behind bulletproof glass and tighter
security.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of television and the World Wide Web, he humanized
what for centuries was a unapproachable, authoritarian job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is charming. He is intellectual. He has a sense of humor.
If he weren't genuine, it wouldn't work. The world is full of
examples of leaders who have tried and failed to use the media to
their advantage,'' said Frederigo Argentieri, a political science
professor at John Cabot University in Rome. ``People feel he is a
man of quality, and he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his modernity, he has remained a staunch
traditionalist defending controversial church doctrine and
resisting change -- opposing birth control, abortion, a role for
women in the priesthood, suggestions that priests should be
permitted to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals within the church have branded him as a dinosaur who is
alienating segments of society by failing to face the realities of
the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps if he had been more flexible on these issues the
popularity of the church would have increased in Europe and
America. But he stood firm with the understanding that one cannot
be pope and be swayed by opinion polls,'' said Domenico del Rio, a
veteran Vatican correspondent for the Italian daily La Stampa.
</P>
<P>
   His charisma and intellectual appeal have allowed him to
maintain his authoritarian convictions without deep schisms
resulting in the church, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican aides say he wishes to go three places that politics and
diplomacy have denied him: Russia, China and the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   And his main aim in his waning years is to cut through the
confusion of a changing global economy and spiritual indifference
with his post-Cold War message of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a capitalism with a conscience,'' said the
Vatican spokesman, Foley, ``working for social responsibility and
not just the survival of the fittest.''

   LOS ANGELES _ You don't have to be a cook to enjoy the Junior
League of Pasadena's new cookbook, ``Dining by Design _ Stylish
Recipes, Savory Settings'' (Favorite Recipes Press; $24.95).
Compiled with the help of the American Society of Interior
Designers (ASID), Pasadena Chapter, the hard-cover book is a feast
for the eyes as well as the palate.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-page hard-back book is filled with 40 lavish color
photographs of beautiful, decorative interior settings and
landscapes _ including kitchens, dining rooms, libraries, offices,
patios, pools, family rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms and butler's
pantries along with more than 250 recipes. ``Americans now eat in
every room in the house including the bathroom (i.e. champagne in
the Jacuzzi),'' pointed out Pasadena-based interior designer Ann
Fletcher, with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The tempting-sounding recipes make you want to run into the
kitchen and try them. And the stunning photographs make you want to
rush to the telephone, call one of the decorators and start redoing
your home (of course, that's if your budget will allow such an
extravagance.)
</P>
<P>
   The book _ the league's sixth _ came about when the Pasadena
Chapter of ASID, which had been talking about doing a cookbook,
approached the league. ``We figured it was time to do another, as
our last cookbook, `California Sizzles,' which came out in 1992 and
sold 40,000 copies, was so successful,'' said Amy Lamb, Pasadena
Junior League president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about this partnership,'' said ASID Pasadena
chapter member Fletcher, ``is that it showcases our members' work
(each designer is credited) within the book _ and it was a natural
tie-in with our annual kitchen tour.'' The designers in the
Pasadena chapter submitted photos of their works in more than 150
settings; 40 were chosen in a blind selection process by a Junior
League committee. While most of the settings were photographed in
color especially for the book, a few, created for special design
projects _ such as design houses _ were photographed previously.
The food included in the photographs is incidental and does not
include any of the dishes in the cookbook. However, that doesn't
detract from the glory of this volume.
</P>
<P>
   The book's recipes, culled from more than 1,000 submitted by
league members, friends, relatives, co-workers and designers, were
tested and tasted by a cookbook committee made up of league
members. ``We received a good variety of recipes and very few
duplicates,'' said Mary Snider, who was in charge of the pasta and
appetizer sections, ``and we tested more than 500 recipes in nine
months to come up with those that made it into the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Each recipe in the book was tested three times, noted Ann
Murphy, cookbook committee chairwoman, and at each tester's own
expense. Any league member was welcomed and encouraged to test
recipes. ``People were always bringing recipes to general meetings
to taste _ and we also had three or four testing parties _ to
sample and evaluate recipes,'' she noted. The book took a year to
complete _ and is just now rolling off the presses.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was looking for easy but good-looking recipes
suitable to serve family and guests at home. They appear to have
succeeded, as many of the recipes seem to have upscale flavor and
flair and look fairly simple to make. Of course, some require more
time, effort and ingredients _ and are more complicated than others
_ but many recipes will appeal to busy, in-a-hurry cooks. Among
them are dishes like Easy Chocolate Torte, Grilled Balsamic
Chicken, Spicy Cajun Shrimp, Basil and Tomato Torta, Artichoke and
Smoked Ham Strata, Chile and Tortilla Souffle, Carrot Coconut
Bread, Penne With Spicy Vodka Sauce, Wedding Shower Chicken Salad
and White Chicken Chili. ``We opted for different recipes rather
than the standards _ Lime Bars instead of Lemon Bars, for
instance,'' noted Snider.
</P>
<P>
   The nine chapter titles in the book have been designed to tie in
with the photographs _ and include At the Doorstep (appetizers);
Scones and Sconces (breakfast items); By the Hearth (soups and
chilis); In the Garden (salads); Patterns and Pasta (pasta); Sides
on the Sideboard (accompaniments and side dishes); the Foundation
(entrees); Decorative Decadence (desserts); and Let's Play (fun
creations for kids to make, such as Spaghetti Pie, Breakfast Pizza,
Dirt Cake and nonedible clay for play).
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled randomly throughout the book are special recipe
memories that some contributors shared along with recipe hints and
tips.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murphy, the best part about compiling the book was
that it was a unifying force in the league. Besides bringing
excitement and pride to members, it is currently bringing
visibility to the league and its programs in the community, she
noted. The worst part of the venture, of course, was the hectic
rush to get everything completed in just a year.
</P>
<P>
   The league's last cookbook raised $250,000 for Junior League
community programs _ and with this volume the league is hoping to
raise even more.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find the book at local bookstores, you can order it
by mail ($32.01 including California state tax and shipping) by
calling the Junior League of Pasadena Inc. at (626) 796-0162.
</P>

   To get a taste of ``Dining by Design,'' whip up some of these
recipes from the cookbook.

INCARCERATION TAKES ITS TOLL

<TEXT>

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PHOENIX _ Sheriff Joe Arpaio was gleeful about his newfound
ability to charge jail inmates for meals. But there was a down
side: He felt obligated to improve the food, if only a little.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the new dollar-a-day food charges, the man who
proclaims himself ``America's toughest sheriff'' last month
reluctantly ordered that tiny packets of salt and pepper be
provided with meals in the Maricopa County jail system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you try some of the food? I hope it wasn't too good,'' a
pained Arpaio asks a visitor who had just taken a jail tour.
Brightening, he adds, ``Hey, did you know it costs more to feed our
guard dogs than it does the inmates?''
</P>
<P>
   After reinstating chain gangs and requiring inmates to wear pink
underwear beneath zebra-striped uniforms, Arpaio has joined a
nationwide movement toward requiring prisoners and jail inmates to
pay for the services they receive behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriffs, wardens, and corrections officials are passing along
the costs of everything from food and medical care, to laundry
services and electricity, to family visits and nightly ``rent'' on
cells. A survey by the National Prison Project of the American
Civil Liberties Union found such fees assessed in 21 states, though
some charge only prisoners who are earning money in work-release
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has taken small steps in that direction, with
several counties charging new jail inmates a $30 processing fee and
small copayments for infirmary visits. The state Department of
Corrections takes 15 percent of the salaries of prisoners in
pre-release work programs, and charges them $5 for
prisoner-initiated medical visits.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the dollars-for-detention programs serve a dual
purpose: They ease the burden on taxpayers for the cost of keeping
1.7 million Americans incarcerated, and they are a small but
psychologically important deterrent aimed at encouraging ex-inmates
to never return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should law-abiding citizens continue to pay the whole
freight, building prisons and taking care of people who are
violating the law?'' said Sheriff Donald Zeller of Linn County,
Iowa, who charges inmates $60 a day, among the highest such fees in
the nation. His jail's per-inmate costs are about $64 a day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do the crime, you're not only going to do
the time, you're also going to pay for it,'' Zeller said.
</P>
<P>
   But prisoners' advocates and civil libertarians say the fees
ultimately punish inmates' families, and could backfire by creating
new financial burdens _ and incentives for crime _ among newly
released inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``By adding punishment on top of punishment, to make them pay
for going to prison, is absurd. The evidence is overwhelming that
treating these individuals poorly in prison makes them even worse
when they get out,'' said Dennis Palumbo, professor of justice
studies at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Gotsch, public education assistant at the ACLU's National
Prison Project, said health-care fees block access to medical care
among inmates, many of whom are poor. She also said jailers are
motivated in large part by the public relations points they score
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to vilify prisoners because people like to see that
prisoners have it hard,'' Gotsch said. ``People have this idea that
prison is a country club, and it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly is true of the maximum-security Madison Street
Jail in downtown Phoenix, and Arpaio wouldn't have it any other
way.
</P>
<P>
   The jail's 1,452 inmates spend most of their days inside their
cells, and rules are not flexible. Last week, a group of about 40
inmates groused about losing all privileges for two weeks _
including no visitors, telephone calls, or television _ because two
among them were hoarding towels.
</P>
<P>
   In a first-floor kitchen, a meal crew of about 20 inmates
wandered around in knee-high rubber boots, complaining about having
to pay for the food they slop onto brown plastic trays. They are
not paid, but working in the kitchen gets them out of their cells;
for some, it can also mean a shortened sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner this night was a brown agglomeration the guards swear is
beef stew on mashed potatoes, along with cooked carrots, bread and
butter, and watermelon slices. Watery fruit punch washes it down.
Some of the food is donated _ Arpaio says companies get tax breaks
for doing so _ but the inmates say they have to weed out green
bread and spoiled vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Older inmates yell at a new worker on the food assembly conveyor
belt _ ``Hey potato guy, get it in the hole'' _ for missing the
proper tray compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all are angry at the dollar-a-day food program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scam. It's bad enough we're in jail. Then we have to
pay for this?'' said Eric Olsen, 25, who has three months to serve
for violating his parole on an earlier grand theft charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a publicity stunt,'' said Anthony Thomas, 25, serving
time for domestic violence. Arpaio ``wants to keep getting elected,
so he has to show people he's giving us a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Farnsworth, 29, serving time on a drug charge, said the
food isn't worth even a dollar a day, but that's the whole point.
In words that would warm Arpaio's heart, he said: ``We're not
supposed to like it. We're not supposed to want to come back to
this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners' advocates say one of their many objections to the
fees is that many of the inmates in Arpaio's jails are awaiting
trial and therefore still considered innocent. Even some of the
most aggressive prison-fee programs elsewhere charge only those
inmates who have already been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio counters that he doesn't care if they're innocent or
guilty. ``If they were on the outside, they'd still have to pay for
meals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Hamm, executive director of Middle Ground Prison Reform,
Arizona's leading prison rights group, said there is no evidence
any of Arpaio's high-profile actions _ putting men and women to
work on chain gangs, forcing them to wear pink underwear, or
lodging some inmates in a ``tent city'' in the desert to alleviate
overcrowding _ have done anything to reduce recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about politics and the mean-spiritedness which
permeates our society,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   If every inmate paid for meals, Arpaio could collect roughly
$2.5 million a year toward his $70 million jail budget. However,
for now at least, Arpaio is collecting only from inmates who put
money in their jail bank accounts, which more normally are used for
purchases of candy, stationery, pens, and hygiene items. Some
inmates said they are purposely leaving their accounts empty _ and
forfeiting the ability to buy personal items _ to avoid paying for
their food.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arpaio said he collected more than $80,000 in the
program's first two weeks. And regardless of how much money the
effort yields, Arpaio is already basking in satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just to save money. I'd do it if I could afford
steak. They should not like jail, and paying for it helps that,''
said Arpaio, a Springfield, Mass., native who spent 1974 to 1978 as
deputy director of the Boston office of the US Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the salt and pepper packets rankle him, especially their
$20,000-a-year cost. But he takes solace in already having taken
away coffee, a $150,000-a-year savings, and eliminating mustard and
mayonnaise from inmate menus.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arpaio takes particular pleasure in the fees, he was
hardly the first to put them to use.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the earliest ``user fees'' were adopted in 1985 by
Macomb County, Mich., and since then the county has collected more
than $7 million. Charges there are on a sliding scale depending on
how much inmates earn outside prison, up to $56 a day. Doctor and
dentist visits cost $15, and prescriptions cost $5.
</P>
<P>
   The county also aggressively pursues inmates after release,
filing more than 400 collection suits this year alone, said Lori
Nyovich, Macomb County reimbursement coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayers love it, the inmates hate it,'' said Nyovich.
``They don't want to pay to be here. But we always say that we get
so many repeat customers, they must enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Told about the Michigan program, Arpaio pauses for a rare moment
of reflection. Behind him, a neon ``vacancy'' sign flickers on a
mock advertisement for his beloved tent city jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't charge them for the room,'' he said. ``Maybe I
should.''

THE LESSONS OF LARAMIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The horrifying murder of Matthew Shepard and the response that
murder has triggered demonstrate important truths.
</P>
<P>
   _First and foremost, it demonstrates that evil is everywhere. It
does not erupt only among the uncultured. Laramie, Wyo., is a
liberal college town, home to the state university, a place with no
shortage of advanced degrees and sophisticated tastes. But
education alone does not make people moral or drive away the
indecent. Shepard met his accused killers at the Fireside Lounge, a
University of Wyoming hangout. Chasity Pasley, one of the women
arrested as an accessory to his murder, is pursuing a degree in
art. The educated are as capable of savagery or hatred as anyone
else, and murder is no less likely in a university town than in a
redneck backwater.
</P>
<P>
   _What happened to Matthew Shepard is more evidence, as if more
were needed, of why a just society must have the death penalty. If
Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney did what they are charged with
doing _ kidnapping Shepard, robbing him, tying him to a fence,
beating him into a coma, and leaving him to die _ they should be
put to death. For some crimes, there is no retribution short of the
noose or the electric chair. Only by executing brutal murderers can
society proclaim unambiguously its abhorrence for their crime. A
criminal justice system that sentences such people to a mere prison
term declares, in effect, that what they did wasn't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   _The claims of activists notwithstanding, the atrocity in
Laramie does not indicate a nationwide ``epidemic'' of violence
against homosexuals. If anything, it indicates the opposite.
Shepard's slaying made headlines not because such things occur to
gay men all the time, but because they don't. When a young man is
beaten to death by antihomosexual bigots, it makes Page 1 _ that is
how unusual it is.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 21 Americans were
killed in 1996 because of their sexual orientation. That figure
doesn't square with FBI statistics, which include only 12 murders
among all reported hate crimes that year. But even if the higher
number is right, it means that antigay homicides comprised just
one-10th of 1 percent of all US homicides in 1996. That is not an
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   _Likewise, the tidal wave of revulsion over Shepard's death
shows that violence against gays is not treated with indifference
in this country. It has been passionately condemned _ by the
president, on scores of editorial pages, by the hundreds of
demonstrators who marched in Laramie on Sunday and the thousands
more who will participate in some 50 candlelight vigils around the
country this week. Would that there were similar anguish for other
victims of lethal attacks. Twenty thousand men, women, and children
will be murdered in America in 1998. Virtually none of them will be
mourned in candlelight vigils or written about in this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   _Once more we see the moral obnoxiousness of the word
``homophobia,'' a pseudopsychological slur that lumps together
anyone critical of homosexuality _ from Laramie-style thugs to the
pope. It is a term as insulting to the victims of gay-bashing as it
is to traditional Christians, Muslims, and Jews for whom antigay
violence is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   The men who murdered Shepard were not in the grip of a mental
disorder. They were not sick. They were evil, and like most
evildoers, they are responsible for their crime. Gay-bashers are no
more motivated by a ``phobia'' of homosexuals than neo-Nazis are
motivated by a phobia of Jews. What animates them is what animates
all violent bigots: hatred, cruelty, sadism, blood lust.
</P>
<P>
   Especially contemptible is the notion that good people who
disapprove of homosexual behavior on religious grounds are part of
a ``climate'' that leads to tragedies like Laramie. That is as
repugnant as suggesting that liberals who denounced Reaganomics
created the ``climate'' that produced John Hinckley.
</P>
<P>
   _Finally, the Shepard case makes clear why there is no need for
yet another federal hate-crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and many gay leaders want Congress to pass a
bill giving federal prosecutors vast new powers to target hate
crimes and adding gays and lesbians to the list of officially
protected groups. This widened federal jurisdiction would be on top
of laws already passed in 21 states that increase the penalties for
crimes committed because of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if anything should be obvious, it is that no new law is
needed to punish the tormentors of Matthew Shepard. Everything they
did _ kidnapping, aggravated robbery, murder _ is covered by
Wyoming's criminal code. There is no state where prosecutors would
ignore such monstrous crimes or fail to demand the harshest
punishment available.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't matter why the murderers in Laramie did what they
did. They should be punished because of their deeds, not because
they are bigots. Would Shepard's parents be weeping any less
bitterly if their son had been killed because he was short? Or
because his attackers wanted his wallet? Any law that declares some
victims more equal than others is unjust on its face. To cloak
certain groups with special protection is implicitly to signal that
other groups may be assaulted with impunity. What a travesty that
would make of Matthew Shepard's death.

REPORT CITES GENDER GAP IN COMPUTER TRAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEANNE RUSSELL  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Girls still trail boys in math and science
achievement, and an emerging gender gap exists in the number and
difficulty of computer classes they take, according to a new
national study.
</P>
<P>
   But boys have their own problems. The report, released Wednesday
by the Education Foundation of the American Association of
University Women, found that boys lag behind girls in reading and
writing, and are more likely to drop out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnicity and social class were linked to equally profound
differences in many of the 1,000 research studies synthesized in
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The association's landmark 1992 study, ``How Schools Shortchange
Girls,'' documented a pattern of teachers steering girls away from
math and science, favoring boys in these subjects, and using
textbooks rife with sexual stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools and girls have made a lot of progress over the last
five years, but we need to remain vigilant because there are some
quite alarming gaps in technology and career preparation,'' said
Pamela Haag, a senior research associate for the American
Association of University Women.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 25 percent of high school girls take computer
science, compared with 30 percent of boys. Only 17 percent of all
students taking the computer science advanced-placement test were
girls, according to the report, ``Gender Gaps: Where Schools Still
Fail Our Children.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cites a dearth of female role models as one reason
girls look elsewhere for career paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medium of technology education has been inhospitable,''
said Cornelia Brunner, associate director for the New York-based
Center for Children and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner said many children first interact with computer games
that often are geared toward boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have a population that's noticeably not entering
a profession, you have to look at what the profession is doing to
make itself attractive, not at the population,'' Brunner said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers argue that the new report, with a more sophisticated
breakdown of where schools run into trouble with girls, boys and
minorities, should help educators target their teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Recent articles have examined the role of schools in the low
reading scores among boys, as well as school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons From the Myths of
Boyhood,'' William Pollack, a clinical psychiatry professor at
Harvard Medical School, argues that schools fail to channel boys'
high energy into performance, hurting their self-esteem and
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for the American Association of University Women
also urged educators to look at such nuances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly recommend that excellence and equity go hand-in-
hand,'' Haag said. ``Schools need to look at what specific groups
of students _ African-Americans, whites, girls and boys _ need.''

THE GREATER THE GOP VICTORY, THE BETTER IT MAY BE FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1998 mid-term elections will likely be a boost to the
fortunes of Vice President Albert Gore, proving once again that the
law of unexpected consequences is immutable.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, things could hardly be worse for Gore. He is
inextricably tied to an administration synonymous with scandal. He
is the subject of a 90-day review by the Department of Justice,
which could result in the appointment of a special prosecutor to
investigate his role in the fund-raising scandals of the 1996
campaign. And the global financial crisis is threatening to
undercut domestic economic growth that has been the political
underpinning of the Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans are all but certain to make significant
gains this November. Midterm elections historically go against the
party that holds presidential power. Midterm elections in the sixth
year of a two-term presidency are especially difficult for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates this year vary, but the rough consensus among the most
experienced political analysts is that the GOP will pick up seven
to 15 seats in the US House of Representatives, three to six seats
in the US Senate, a gubernatorial seat to add to the 32 now under
their control, and somewhere between 200 and 350 state legislative
seats across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Weird as it might seem, however, the better the Republicans do
this November, the better it is for Gore. If a Republican landslide
occurs, the impeachment and conviction (or resignation) of
President Clinton becomes much more likely. In that event, Gore
becomes president, names Dianne Feinstein as vice president, and
proclaims that the long national nightmare of Clinton scandals is
over. Running for president is a whole lot easier if you are
already the president.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans make only modest gains, Gore will still be
the most direct beneficiary. The more Republican the political
landscape becomes, the less likely it is that Democrats will
tolerate a fractious presidential primary season in the year 2000.
In the same way that uncertainty breeds a flight to quality in the
financial markets, being outnumbered in the political arena creates
a flight to safety. Gore's candidacy is safe, familiar ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, modest or dramatic Republican gains in this
year's November elections give Gore the one thing he desperately
lacks: an argument. Gore's problem now is that when he boasts of
the economic success of the Clinton administration, it sounds
hollow. Most voters think Clinton is responsible for fostering a
positive economic climate. Opinion-makers and elitists credit
Treasury Secretary Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan for the economic boom. Virtually no one thinks Gore had
much to do with it. It's nice that he was there. He didn't do any
harm. But the perception is that he was not at the wheel when the
ride turned smooth.
</P>
<P>
   What Gore's presidential campaign has lacked is an argument that
voters and opinion-makers listen to and say: ``That's right.''
Republican gains in November assure Gore that he will have just
such an argument, regardless of whether the economy continues to
perform at its recent peak levels. That argument is, in the
venacular, ``don't let the lunatics take over every wing of the
asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   This message essentially reelected Clinton in the 1996 campaign,
even though Clinton's opponent (on the ballot) was one of the last
great men of American politics. But Clinton did not run against Bob
Dole, he ran against Republican extremism, using the loonier
elements of the GOP coalition as his foil.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Gore, Republicans are famous for repeating their
mistakes. In 1994, they imagined that the election returns were an
endorsement of each and every one of their policy initiatives
spelled out in the Contract for America. Wrong. In 1998, they are
likely to misread the election results as affirmation of their
agenda, even though they don't have one, so far as anyone can tell.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also tone deaf to the realities of modern
American politics. They forget that the average American voter
today is female, not male; tolerant, not intolerant; concerned, not
angry; and skeptical, not certain. Her preference is what decides
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   If this average American voter thinks that giving the GOP
complete control of every elected branch of government doesn't work
for her, then it will not happen. Clinton probably understands this
better than any American politician alive. Gore understands it
because he has been studying national politics at Clinton's side
for six years and has watched his boss survive all manner of peril
by never losing sight of the critical decision-maker in American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore may well be the only national Democrat smiling on
election night. Amidst the gloom of lost seats and diminished
Democratic influence in Congress, he will have the one true thing
that has been absent from his year 2000 presidential campaign: a
message that resonates with the average American voter. It's a
message he can run with until, as his boss might say, ``the last
dog dies.''

THERAPEUTIC GARDEN BRINGS HOME NATURE'S BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ Traumatized at an early age by a painful,
lonely hospitalization, a 5-year-old boy was so tuned out that he
was tested for autism. When he was first introduced to the
Therapeutic Garden for Children here, he would retreat into a
hollow in the side of a ravine, where a spreading yew creates a
roof over a stone bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hillside with pine trees behind the cave,'' said the
boy's therapist, Sebastiano Santostefano, director of the Institute
for Child and Adolescent Development, which commissioned the
garden. ``After several months, he would run up there, press the
pine needles into his palm, say `Ouch!' and run back into the cave.
He was reliving his trauma by saying the world outside hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Over two years of visits to the garden, the boy talked to the
plants and watered them ``to make them feel better.'' He ran
through a sprinkler he said rained poison water, and was not hurt.
He sent popsicle sticks down the garden's water rill, freeing them
when they got stuck and cheering them when they reached the pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spring, the boy ran up to those same pine trees and
leaned his cheek to the needles, called me over, and said, `Look
how nice this feels.' I said, `Oooh, that feels really good!'''
said Santostefano. ``He went from construing a world that hurts to
a world that is affectionate, experiencing it like the fingers of a
glove in a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Therapeutic Garden for Children, which last year won the
landscape design profession's top honor, the President's Award of
Excellence of the American Society of Landscape Architects, was
designed by Douglas Reed of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Wellesley garden works by providing a range of emotionally
evocative settings that help traumatized youngsters heal
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As the idea of the healing landscape gains currency, more and
more versions of therapeutic gardens are being built at hospitals,
nursing homes, prisons, hospices, and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's garden differs from most, however, in being a research
model for psychoanalytical ideas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It is also an example of an unusual collaboration between
landscape designer and therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Santostefano's first therapeutic garden was created when he was
at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. When he opened his nonprofit
institute in a suburban Victorian home here to help traumatized
youngsters, Santostefano enlisted Child Associates in Boston, where
Susan Child and Douglas Reed worked on the initial schematic-design
and land-form phase of the project. The mission was to design and
construct a $250,000 landscape to supplement the indoor playroom
setting traditionally used for child-therapy sessions. Reed, who
had gone on to start his own firm, was hired to finish the project.
Judy Pillsbury, a Paris-based dealer of fine art prints, was the
principal donor and wanted the design to have artistic as well as
therapeutic merit.
</P>
<P>
   Reed described his job as giving form to Santostefano's ideas.
``We really had a process with the institute's staff, where we
visited the Garden in the Woods and the Arnold Arboretum and we
showed slides of all sorts of different landscape elements to ask
if they had relevance. We talked about the dunes along the beach.
We looked at streams and I showed them photos of Indian mounds and
the rill at Rousham, which was an important influence.'' That
18th-century English garden has a stone-sided serpentine rill as
one feature in a series of landscape events that the visitor
journeys through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to learn about landscape,'' said Santostefano, and
Reed ``tried to learn about child therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a water course became the unifying theme of the
garden, inspired by the fact that the yard contained a wide swale 9
feet deep left over from the time when it was part of a stream that
drained into the Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   The water course begins as a fountain on the stone patio that
links the clinic's playroom to the garden. Each child can choose to
stay indoors, but a bubbling basin of green granite overflowing
with water beckons.
</P>
<P>
   The stream travels through steel pipes under the terrace and
flows into a steel-sided rill only 8 inches wide that wends its way
down through the garden and into a small pool. ``The movement of
the water ties into the whole objective of drawing the child out,''
said Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Along the journey, the child encounters many land forms that can
evoke a wide range of emotions, such as ``the cave,'' with its
sense of security; ``the island,'' which is a thicket of shrubs for
hiding; ``the ravine,'' with its shaded walks and views that invite
exploration; ``the bridge,'' which is really a set of
steppingstones across the rill that invite risk-taking; ``the
mount,'' for climbing and confidence-building; and ``the glade,''
an expansive area for running and playing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost devoid of flowers, it's a garden of grass, trees, shrubs,
water, and sculpted hills that invite participation. Like Frederick
Law Olmsted's Arnold Arboretum, another of Reed's influences, the
design skillfully combines many elements in a small area without
seeming cramped or contrived. It's a child-scale miniaturization
that contains many experiences in a single acre.
</P>
<P>
   In almost daily use by outpatients for several years now, the
garden is used for diagnosis as well as therapy. Therapists use a
map to record the parts of each garden used by patients on each
visit, collecting information for Santostefano's ongoing research.
</P>
<P>
   As in the case of the little boy who had been hospitalized, the
parts of the landscape where a traumatized child chooses to spend
time often follow a narrative from insecurity to increased
risk-taking. But the landscape does not work the same way for every
case. ``It's not a prescribed series of progressive experiences,''
said Santostefano. ``Each child picks what feels right for him.''
</P>
<P>
   One adolescent girl who had been been deeply affected when her
mother gave birth to a baby who died, would lie on top of ``the
mount'' and fantasize that she was lying on the belly of a pregnant
woman. ``She never went into the cave at all. Her mind chose `the
mount.' She sat on it for a number of weeks, and then she began to
lie down on it, while she worked on all the sadness and depression
that resulted when that sibling died,'' said Santostefano. ``A
piece of landscape doesn't have a meaning, except the meaning a
person's mind gives it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the parent's body being replicated by landscape is
related to psychiatric theories about feelings held in the body
that are gaining more attention among therapists. ``The first
landscape a newborn engages is the body of the caregivers, being
held against their chests, being nibbled on the neck,'' explained
Santostefano. ``The mind gradually extends the world to the kitchen
and then to the back yard or alleyway, our first landscapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardens themselves don't heal people, Santostefano believes.
``It's a person engaging and acting on the landscape that heals.
You give symbolic meaning to it. A child is constantly fantasizing.
Child therapists typically work with children by using symbolic
puppets in a playroom, and that's valuable. The problem in
manipulating toys is that they are several steps removed from
embodied experiences, which are experiences of the body, which are
the earliest experiences. Toys are more conceptual.''
</P>
<P>
   Santostefano believes children need bushes and places to hide,
enclosures, inclines to climb, rocks to step over where they're
testing their willingness to take risks. ``All of which you would
see if you rambled through the woods.'' And all of which have been
re-created at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything we can learn from this for our own back yards?
</P>
<P>
   Santostefano thinks that overmanicured home landscapes work
against children's sense of discovery. Often, he said, it's
neglected corners _ like abandoned lots or the weed patch behind
the garage _ that become children's special hideouts and forts. If
such places are lacking close to home, he added, children should be
taken on outings to woods and wilder areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increased interest in incorporating gardens and
landscape that relieve stress and provide a refuge so that a person
can restore their emotional and physical health,'' said Reed.
</P>
<P>
   His five-year-old firm, Douglas Reed Landscape Architecture
Inc., is busy these days. One commission is to create a garden for
patients with physical rather than emotional problems at the
Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital on the Charles River in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to create an intimate garden for physical
therapy and resolve all the requirements of a hospital, such as
parking, ambulance access, service, and delivery,'' he said.

BELLE &AMP; SEBASTIAN/``The Boy With the Arab Strap'' (Matador)
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fragile left-field music of this enigmatic dream-pop octet
from scotland named for a French novel garners the kind of
superlatives rarely seen in this era of one-hit wonderdom. The
band's 1997 debut, ``If You're Feeling Sinister,'' was more
immediately lovable, so if ``The Boy With the Arab Strap'' is your
introduction to the darkly romantic songs of Belle's primary
singer-songwriter Stuart Murdoch, expect to spend some time with
the album. The production here is expansive, with muted horns and
overdubbed guitars weaving a spell around painterly songs that deal
with 20-something stroke victims (``It Could Have Been a Brilliant
Career''), wasted time (``A Summer Wasting''), promises of fame
(``Seymour Stein'') and a reflective walk in the park (``Sleep the
Clock Around''). A quiet beauty. 3 1/2 stars

 &QL; 
SOUL COUGHING/``El Oso'' (Slash/Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Beck and the Beastie Boys, New York's Soul Coughing has
always been inspired by the beats and wordplay of hip-hop but for
the first time, the quartet has cooked up the grooves to match. On
this third album, singer-guitarist M. Doughty and company have
clearly been soaking up Euro drum 'n' bass rhythms as well, as
evidenced by the cyber-production skills of Brit dance-music
maestro Optical on two doomy tracks. As always, though, it's down
to Doughty's wry lyrics and sardonic delivery on such winners as
``So Far I Have Not Found the Science'' and ``Circles'' that put
this quirky noise across. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
BOB DYLAN/``Live 1966: The `Royal Albert Hall' Concert (Bootleg
Series Vol. 4)'' (Columbia Legacy)
</P>
<P>
   The goon who shouted ``Judas!'' at the newly electrified Dylan
at a British venue more than 30 years ago didn't know it then, but
he was making rock history. That moment, replete with the angry
boos and hisses of hostile folk purists who couldn't stomach their
hero embracing an electric guitar and rock band, is captured here
along with Dylan's caustic retort: ``I don't believe you. You're a
liar.'' For more than a quarter-century, bootlegs of this
extraordinary gig have circulated, misnamed the Albert Hall concert
when it actually took place at Manchester's Free Trade Hall. In any
case, this superb two-CD document captures Dylan at the peak of his
powers, opening with a stirring solo acoustic set that includes
``She Belongs to Me,'' ``Fourth Time Around,'' ``Visions of
Johanna'' and a beautiful ``Desolation Row.'' The second disc
reveals Dylan and his backup group (later known as the Band)
scorching through ``Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,'' ``Leopard-Skin
Pill-Box Hat,'' ``Ballad of a Thin Man'' and ``Like a Rolling
Stone,'' which comes after the angry exchange with the audience.
Terrific stuff that recalls a time when rock music had the power to
divide. 4 stars

SON VOLT/``Wide Swing Tremelo'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   Alt-country mainstays Son Volt seem to have embarked on a new
beginning with their third album. While the group's previous
release was mostly disappointing, ``Wide Swing Tremelo'' harkens
back to the quartet's eye-opening debut, ``Trace,'' with its weepy
pedal-steel, sagebrush-swaying acoustic guitars, well-crafted tunes
and leader Jay Farrar's rough, world-weary baritone. This time
around, the downbeat midtempo rockers are even more convincing and
hook-filled. At the heart of the matter, as always, are Farrar's
sublime vocals. 3 stars

 &QL; 
ARETHA FRANKLIN/``You Grow Closer'' (Peacock/MCA)
</P>
<P>
   At the tender age of 16, the Queen of Soul was already a force
of nature. Here are Aretha's first gospel recordings, made as a
teen in the '50s at her father's church in Detroit. The strength in
her voice, the jaw-dropping delivery, her intuitive feel for the
blues on such standout cuts as ``While the Blood Runs Warm,''
``Yield Not to Temptation'' and ``Never Grow Old'' immediately
brings the listener to the Aretha of today. 3 stars

VARIOUS/``Rare on Air (Vol. 4)'' (Mammoth)
</P>
<P>
   Showcasing the intimacy and spontaneity of Santa Monica, Calif.,
public-radio KCRW-FM's studio, the latest volume in this popular
series highlights the familiar mix of established artists and
underground faves. Some of the best of the new crop includes the
six-minute opening track ``Cut Chemist Suite'' from popular club
act Ozomatli, a lovely ``Subterranean Homesick Alien'' by two
members of Radiohead, and a five-minute blast of vocal fireworks on
``So Real'' from the late Jeff Buckley. 3 stars

THE BAND/``Jubilation'' (River North Records)
</P>
<P>
   With just three orginal members left, the Band marks the 30th
anniversary of the release of their groundbreaking debut, ``Music
From Big Pink,'' by recording 11 new songs, plus cameos from Eric
Clapton and John Hiatt, in a converted Woodstock, N.Y., barn. Still
able to put across warm folk-rock sounds and ragged rhythms, the
Band manages to create a vibe that's both familiar and fresh.
Clapton's solo on ``Last Train to Memphis'' is relaxed in the
front-porch style of J.J. Cale while Hiatt shares the microphone
with Rick Danko on the sturdy ``Bound by Love'' In the end,
``Jubilation'' is so good you almost don't miss Robbie Robertson. 3
stars

<P>
   Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
CAKE/``Prolonging the Magic'' (Capricorn)
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll, stripped of fashion, can still be engaging _ the
proof is in a slice of Sacramento's Cake. The catchy songs, crisp
yet raw production, clever and absurdist lyrics come mainly from
John McRea who delivers the best ironic, monotone vocals since
Flash &AMP; the Pan. Following the band's brilliant 1996 breakthrough
disc ``Fashion Nugget,'' this album's standouts include ``Mexico,''
``Sheep Go to Heaven'' and ``Never There'' _ as fine a rock tune as
you'll never hear on radio. If you're among the lucky few to have
tickets to Cake's sold-out Troubadour show Oct. 26, feel free to
gloat. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ James Hames &QR; 
 &QL; 
JACK SHELDON &AMP; RUSS TOMPKINS/ ``Class Act'' (Jadi)
</P>
<P>
   This recording pairs world-class musicians Sheldon (maybe best
known for his vocals on the animated ABC-TV Saturday morning
``Schoolhouse Rock'' shorts) on vocals and trumpet and Tompkins (a
20-year veteran of the ``Tonight Show'' orchestra) on piano.
Sheldon's voice brings a quiet resignation to the forlorn torch
songs here and Tompkins' tasty chops counterpoint delightfully. As
a duo, it's hard to tear into some of the standards here, so the
arrangements are suitably solemn. Although a heart-pounding swing
arrangement would improve the pace, the pure craftsmanship and
flourish are plenty. 3 stars

FIRST GRADE MAY BE THE HARDEST FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With one hand holding ``There Was a Mouse'' aloft so students
can see the pictures, Angela Hodgdon settles her free hand in the
lap of the child seated next to her on the rug. The little girl has
been squirmy while Hodgdon reads. Now she smiles shyly and falls
silent, happy to have this connection to her teacher. In the next
seven minutes, there are 15 more times when Hodgdon needs to reach
out, literally or otherwise, to keep the 10 children in the circle
focused.
</P>
<P>
   For mid-October in a first-grade classroom, this isn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the primary grades, first grade is the one that educators
typically say is hardest for children. One word sums up the reason
why: transitions.
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, Hodgdon's class at Davis Elementary School in
Bedford, Mass., illustrates the point. It's time to stop drawing
and have a snack, and even though this is a desirable activity, it
brings a myriad concerns and uncertainties, from ``I'm not
finished!'' to ``Is it OK for me to have water?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going from one activity to another is hard because the
structure falls down,'' says Hodgdon. ``Expectations aren't always
so clear. In snack, you can eat, drink, read, talk. `Well, what do
I want to do first?'And what about the drawing they weren't ready
to stop working on? Do they trust me enough yet to believe me when
I say there'll time for it tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Even trickier are the less obvious transitions, like going from
being a child whose mother walks you into the classroom to one who
takes the bus, or going from being a child who sees herself
primarily as a playmate to seeing herself as learner.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that children don't realize they are making this leap.
Indeed, they're so aware of it, they call first grade ``real''
school. That in itself speaks worlds about why the transition to
first grade can be so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great expectations for themselves,'' says early
childhood educator Amelia Klein of Wheelock College. When they
can't read a book the first week, or don't get homework, or can't
write as well as an older sibling, they are not just disappointed,
they feel as if they failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first year in which children are aware of their
comparative ability,'' says early childhood educator Lilian Katz, a
professor at the University of Illinois and director of Educational
Resources Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   While children may begin to notice differences even at the age
of 3 _ ``She's taller,'' ``His skin is darker'' _ it's typically in
first grade that they notice differences based on achievement: ``He
can write his name and I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big thing,'' says Katz. ``It begins to set in place
a self-attribution of being a fast or slow learner.''
</P>
<P>
   Identifying yourself as a good or bad student can have
long-lasting implications, says Katz, even for the child who sees
himself as more competent than peers. ``That child may worry, `Will
it last?' `Maybe next time I won't be able to do this,''' says
Katz. ``The child who decides he isn't as smart as he should be
begins to give up: `I can never learn this.'''
</P>
<P>
   What mitigates most against destructive self-comparisons is an
environment in which teachers work to reduce competition, says
Katz. ``There are no posters that say `Best reader of the week' or
`Super spellers!' Any time you have trophies or prizes, you're
communicating the importance of outranking each other,'' she says.
``First grade is way too early for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz and early childhood educator Susan Andersen prefer
first-grade classrooms where all contributions are valued _ ``Ian
is a person who's good at spelling, Jane is someone who's good at
singing ...'' _ and where cooperation is expected: ``You're so good
at writing a `g.' Can you help Mary?''
</P>
<P>
   This also is the year when the gap between the characteristics
of the child and the expectations of the classroom is widest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical 6-year-old is active, curious, talkative, easily
distracted, hands on, exhuberant,'' says Andersen. ``The typical
first-grade classroom expects this child to follow directions, not
interrupt, sit quietly, raise hands.'' Andersen is a consultant to
the Iowa Department of Education and on the governing board of the
National Association for the Education of Young Children.
</P>
<P>
   The wise teacher, she says, brings children through the
transition slowly, building in flexibility and giving them
challenges that are within their grasp so they see success. In
Hodgdon's class, for instance, mornings are devoted to academics,
afternoons to art projects and free choice. Mornings, she expects
children to raise their hands and not to talk out of turn;
afternoons are less structured.
</P>
<P>
   ``In October, the afternoons look like kindergarten. By January,
they'll look like first grade,'' Hodgdon says.
</P>
<P>
   The last transition first graders are going through is a
social/emotional one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be accepted by the group and they see that to
stay connected, they need to make a contribution,'' says Klein.
They quickly learn what does and doesn't work but a child who sees
that pushing in line doesn't get you friends must weigh his need to
be liked against his need to be first in line.
</P>
<P>
   Some children obviously are more socially aware than others.
``Not all children notice or care that someone else can tie his
shoe, or wait his turn patiently, or follow two directions at
once,'' says Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   This is one more way in which teachers and parents need to be
sensitive to developmental differences. Andersen reminds parents
that first graders can vary widely in terms of competence levels,
including from one sibling to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect too much of them,'' she says, and don't be
worried if they seem to have lost some skills since September;
they'll regain them as they gain confidence in school.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgdon says first graders are more likely to be successful in
school when parents share observations and problems with teachers
and when we stay connected to the school. Klein says, ``It's a
major transition for them not to see you in the classroom the way
they did in kindergarten or preschool. You need to find other ways
to stay connected because that translates to them not only that you
care about them, but also that you place a value on school.''
</P>
<P>
   Because 6- and 7-year-olds are not able to identify their own
emotions, she urges parents to ask questions about school. The more
specific you are, the more likely you'll get into a conversation.
Not ``How was school?'' but ``How was gym?'' ``Did you like the
book in literature group today?''
</P>
<P>
   Although your child's end of the conversation may be a long,
rambling discourse, don't tune out. What she's feeling will be
embedded in the narrative: ``I never have time to finish what I
like.'' ``I'm afraid to go on the field trip.''
</P>
<P>
   It's mid-October and even though the children in Hodgdon's class
look more and more competent every day, she knows they are still
scared. Just last week, she asked them what was hard about first
grade. Their list was a reminder of just how much energy it takes
for them to get through the day:
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus. It's too loud and it gives me a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the rug (for circle time) and having to think about
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids on the rug (at circle time) who are too silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to stay in the lines when you write letters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being inside. I really want to get outside (to play).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not (always) being first in line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much homework.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not enough homework.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm feeling inspired these days by Dr. Christiane Northrup, a
physician whose video, ``Women's Bodies, Women's Choices,'' is
startling in its challenge to many of the cultural norms that
govern this culture. In speaking about the ways a woman can improve
her chance of having a long and active life, she offers her
strategy for maintaining vibrant health.
</P>
<P>
   She's not talking about how to drag yourself out of bed and go
through the motions. Nor is she offering techniques for fighting
off exhaustion or reducing the stress of an intolerably harried
life. She's actually talking about the possibility that human
beings can live with vibrancy, or ``pulsating with vigor and
energy,'' as the dictionary puts it, from cradle to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Northrup suggests we build into our regimen in
order to become fully alive: 1.) Laughter and a sense of humor; 2.)
Sunshine and natural light; 3.) Nutritious food; 4.)  &UR; rr Clean air
and water; 5.) A fulfilling sex life; 6.) Uplifting relationships;
7.) Outdoor exercise; 8.) A satisfying living and work environment;
9.) Natural sleep and relaxation; 10.) Inspiring music; 11.)
Rhythmical dance.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a simple prescription. When you try to implement her
recommendations, it turns out to be a very complicated business.
</P>
<P>
   Take laughter. People hardly ever laugh alone. Even a recorded
laugh track isn't enough to do the trick. To laugh, we need friends
who take life lightly, co-workers who can see the humor in the
glummest situation, and we not only need to know them, we need to
be with them long and often enough to supply a medically beneficial
dose of snickers, chuckles, and peals. I suspect that women who
make time to laugh with friends spend far less time at the
drugstore filling their prescriptions for Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   In listing clean air and water, it's clear Northrup assumes
human health depends upon a healthy planet. Who can live a
wholesome life in a blighted setting? Yet, bizarrely, we act as if
we didn't know that our physical, as well as our mental, health
depends on an unspoiled environment. Even psychotherapists these
days are beginning to link our connection with nature with our
state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us now experiences in some way _ physically,
psychologically, economically, politically _ `the earth hurting,'''
writes clinical psychologist Sarah Conn, a lecturer at Harvard
Medical School. The therapist's task, she says in an essay called
``When the Earth Hurts, Who Responds?,'' is to hear the world
speaking through a patient's personal suffering and to help clients
develop an awareness of how that larger world is affecting them.
Tuning in emotionally, becoming better informed, and taking action
are the best ways, she believes, to overcome the denial, numbness,
confusion, and feelings of helplessness that beset so many of us.
</P>
<P>
   I also love the idea of a doctor insisting that we settle for
nothing less than ``uplifting relationships.'' What a great excuse
to avoid the aggravating, depressing, and demoralizing folks whose
feelings we're usually trying not to hurt. According to Northrup,
not only are these people no longer our obligation, they're a
hazard to our health.
</P>
<P>
   And no more feeling that a woman is ever obligated to go to bed
with a man who doesn't consider her happiness as important as his
own. Here's a line I'd love to hear used more often: ``Sorry, but
my doctor's forbidden me to engage in unfulfilling sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor exercise? Maybe Northrup is hoping that while we're
outside walking, running, or bicycling, the sight of a tree or a
bluejay will wake us up to the extraordinary beauty around us.
Perhaps she's trying to disengage us from our machines, if only for
a little while. Or perhaps, as we move in a realm of sun and wind
and sky, she's counting on our feeling protective toward this world
that nurtures us in every way.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad she threw in music and dance. One morning last week,
after spending an hour in aerobics class, pretending to be a
Rockette, I visited dear friends who always play tapes when they're
home. As we chatted, lovely music soothed and lifted my spirits. We
laughed and laughed. I rode my bike home.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't anyone ever tell me it could this much fun to take my
medicine?
</P>

SKIRMISHES IN THE GREAT PATRIOTIC MILDEW WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the coming of autumn, and cool, dry (we hope)
weather, we can kiss the old mildew problem goodbye forever. Or at
least until next spring, when it starts all over again.
</P>
<P>
   We have treated our patios, decks, steps, siding, and roofs with
bleach and water or other mildew-killers, and things look pretty
good outdoors. Good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   Guess again, soldiers of the great patriotic mildew wars.
</P>
<P>
   The mildew may be gone from outdoors (too cold and too dry), but
it has just moved indoors, where conditions are ideal for the mold
spores to grow: warm and moist.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the mildew grow in familiar areas such as
bathrooms and kitchens but also in unexpected areas such as
closets, in trunks, even on walls and ceilings, particularly on
walls behind large bureaus or bedsteads.
</P>
<P>
   The mildew is usually black, but can come in virtually any
color, and smells ``creepy,'' like a crypt. And, people allergic to
it suffer that much more.
</P>
<P>
   But how can it happen in a nice, tight house that is heated in
winter? Ah, there is the clue: that nice, tight house. New houses
are tight, well sealed with vapor barriers and insulation, to keep
water vapor out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they can be too tight, allowing water vapor to build up
to critical concentrations, enough to condense on cool surfaces.
Water vapor is humidity in the air, invisible, except when it
appears as steam coming out of our teakettle or when you can see
your breath.
</P>
<P>
   This water vapor finds its way to cool surfaces: the toilet tank
and bowl, the kitchen sink, walls of closets, and walls behind
bureaus and bedsteads. The walls behind bureaus and bedsteads are
cool, cooler than the rest of the room.
</P>
<P>
   A house too tight is no reason to make it loose again; a tight
house retains heat. But again, the immediate solution is to
ventilate. Such ventilation will allow water vapor to escape
outdoors. Despite such ventilation (temporarily and for short times
in winter), there will be no significant loss of heat.
</P>
<P>
   Mildew spores, invisible seeds, really, are forever floating
around, ready to land on a hospitable surface and grow. And grow.
And grow.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes mildew appears on exterior walls and maybe ceilings,
even in corners, where the surfaces are cool.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the great patriotic indoor war on mildew, you
can kill the mildew by treating it with a solution of liquid
chlorine bleach and water; a 1 to 3 ratio is adequate. This
solution will not harm any painted or varnished surfaces, or hard
plastic, Corian, granite. It will bleach untreated wood, and will
ruin unfast dyed cloth, fabric, and upholstery. If you have to use
a bleach solution on such materials, start out with a 1 to 10
ratio, and make a test treatment to see if it will work safely or
not.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the first skirmish. Now comes the biggest battle:
keeping mildew away. The solution is simple, the execution more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Ventilate: Make sure there is good air circulation in affected
areas. Reduce moisture, mainly by ventilating.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the bathrooms, which are the most notorious places
for mildew. Install an exhaust fan, or make sure the window is open
during showers and other ablutions. No window? Then an exhaust fan,
exhausting to the outdoors (not indoors or into the attic), and use
it regularly and for long periods of time, enough to take the fog
off the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a special paint will help reduce the growth of mildew.
Zinsser makes what it calls Perma-White Mildew-Proof bathroom
paint, ``guaranteed to remain free of mildew for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a phenomenal guarantee, but all you can do it try it.
Zinsser says it will also stick to painted surfaces, and can be
custom-tinted to off-white or pastel shades. It is acrylic, and can
be cleaned up with water.
</P>
<P>
   Ventilation can also be applied to kitchens to keep down the
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Water vapor builds up in closets with closed doors; closets are
usually chilly, ergo condensation and mildew. Again, ventilate.
Keep the door open. If that does not appeal, install louvered
doors. Keeping a 100-watt bulb lit in the closet (keep it away from
flammables) will help dry out the closet and keep it warm enough to
prevent condensation.
</P>
<P>
   For areas behind bureaus and bedsteads, the only solution is to
pull out the furniture six or more inches from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   But the exterior walls and ceilings where mildew grows seem a
mystery: Why there? It's no mystery; those parts of walls and
ceilings are cool because of indequate insulation, maybe even no
insulation at all, or where, in walls, blown-in insulation may have
settled, leaving a gap at the tops of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms where the mildew occurs can be ventilated, but that is a
constant battle in our patriotic mildew war. A more permanent fix
is difficult: Insulation must be added.
</P>
<P>
   If the ceiling is under an attic floor, it might be a simple
matter to add insulation, or at least to make sure there are no
gaps in the insulation already there.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ventilate, ventilate, ventilate. And wait'll
next year, when you can do it all over again outdoors.

 hERE'S HOW TO CLEAN UP AFTER THE SEWER BACKUP 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTOM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My brand-new house had a sewer backup in the basement. The
backup has been fixed and the sewage has ebbed, but the odor is
powerful. Adding insult to injury, the basement is finished. Should
I call in a fogger or a pest-control person? Otherwise, how can I
get rid of the odor?
</P>
<P>
   ANONYMOUS CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's an old story, sewer backups and, during floods, release
of sewage in the basement. It is of course new to you, but the
treatment remains the same. And that treatment is bleach _ lots of
it, although the more you let the basement dry out, by ventilating,
the better off you will be. You can use Lysol disinfectant spray as
an alternative, but it is likely to be more expensive than
store-brand bleach, which is a bargain at about a dollar a gallon.
You can use it straight, but cut half and half with water should be
adequate for disinfecting purposes. Paint or pour it on the floor,
sweep it up, and throw it away. Or, spread it on the floor and
spread a lot of Speedy Dry or other kind of absorbent clay to
absorb the sewage-bleach solution. Sweep it up and throw it away.
Repeat as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Fogging is similar to fumigation, which has to be done by an
exterminator, is expensive, and requires getting out of the house
for a day or more.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the finished basement. If the sewage rose along the
walls, the wet part of the walls must be cut out, any wet
insulation removed and disposed of, and the wall area disinfected
and allowed to dry out. Then install a new insulation and wall
finish. If you no longer can smell any odor, chances are excellent
that you have beaten the rap, or at least sanitized the place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Someone oversprayed my house, getting latex paint on the
asphalt roof shingles. The contrast between the light paint and
dark shingles is pretty obvious. I tried Goof-Off without success.
How can I remove that paint?
</P>
<P>
   MATT LEARY, Milton
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Goof-Off is designed to get latex paint off most surfaces
without ruining the surface, but asphalt is not one of them. You
can't use chemical paint remover either, because that will take off
some of the asphalt, too. So, you will have to disguise the paint
by spraying a black or dark spray paint on the stains. I suggest a
flat spray. This may wear off in tme so you may have to repeat. But
it will certainly look a lot better than that light-colored paint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm in a sort of a funny position of having to choose what
tenants will rent an apartment. I seem to have a choice of cat
persons or smokers. Which to choose?
</P>
<P>
   A.B., Brighton
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That is a real Hobson's choice. I'd opt for cat persons,
assuming that they will provide a proper cat box. Smokers are going
to smell up the apartment no matter what, and cleaning out the odor
is difficult. Cat persons might allow their animals free range.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My log cabin in New Hampshire is quite rustic but quite nice,
too. However, the flat window-frame boards (casing) that sit on the
round logs show gaps. How can I fill those gaps? Also, I have
double-glazed windows with wood frames, and I also have some old
storms that were taken down when the new windows were installed.
Can I put the old storms back up?
</P>
<P>
   RALPH SYLVIA, Vineyard Haven
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As for the gaps, leave them open. That way, any water that
gets into them will drain away readily. If you closed the gaps, any
water trapped there might stay around long enough to cause decay.
The only thing you will get in the open gaps is wasps and/ &QC; 
or spiders, both of which will help you get rid of a lot of bugs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the old storms, by all means, put them up. You will have
triple glazing that way, and a third more insulating power.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. An old problem cropped up again. My first-floor toilet tank
sweats, mostly on the bottom, but it is dripping on the floor and
could cause decay. I bought a tank liner at Spag's in Shrewsbury
for the second-floor toilet, and there is less sweating. Would a
liner help for the first-floor toilet? We are on well water and
it's mighty cold.
</P>
<P>
   ALYCE LUIPPOLD, Westborough
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A liner will definitely help, but make sure you line the
bottom of the tank as well as the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick you can try is to divert a little hot water into
the intake line feeding the tank. This will keep the tank water
warmer, reducing condensation. And, this additional warm water will
help reduce condensation that may be occurring on the toilet bowl,
as well. That seems to be the only cure for bowl sweating.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of extra ideas for the tank, however: One is to put a
tray under the tank with a hose leading to the toilet. You won't
stop the sweating, but the water will drip into the pan and into
the toilet. And finally, I think they still sell terry-cloth
jackets for tanks that will keep the tank warmer, a little like a
tea cozy.

   AUTO REVIEW-AZR (Undated) _ Four doors, no waiting. That's the
new slogan in the minivan world, where buyers have rebelled against
the right-side-only, sliding-rear-door setup. Now, it's rear doors
on both sides or else. The Nissan Quest/Mercury Villager has been
one of my favorite minivans for years, mainly for its driveability,
especially the carlike handling. For '99, the Quest has been
restyled and updated, with more interior space, a more-powerful
engine, freshened styling and, of course, a second sliding door. By
Bob Golfen.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-BMW-NYT (Undated) _ A look at BMW's M coupe, the
fastest car the company has ever sold in the United States. A
$42,370 Go Kart with two sport seats and room for two golf bags,
with the kind of razor-edged maneuverability that the company's M
brand manager, likened to ``a four-wheeled motorcycle.'' By James
G. Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-BMW-Z3-NYT (Undated) _ Much of BMW's M3's bone and
sinew has been transplanted into the smaller, lighter Z3 Roadster,
including the 3.2 liter -in-line six-cylinder engine at 240
horsepower. By Dan Neil.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-BUYING-NYT (Landover) _ People used to go to auto shows to
see new car models from all companies and then to a particular
dealer to test-drive the one they liked. Now General Motors, eager
to regain market share, is trying a new way to sell cars; it is
putting on its own one-company auto shows, where visitors can take
test drives, to raise the chance that when the customer goes to a
dealer, it will belong to GM. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Toronto) _ The new Odyssey is very different
from the old Odyssey _ which isn't exactly old in the grand scheme
of things. In some ways the new Odyssey is different from anything
else on wheels. It is the largest vehicle ever produced by Honda
and, unlike the old Odyssey, it is built on this side of the world,
in a new plant in Alliston, Ont., an hour's drive from downtown
Toronto. The heart of the Odyssey is a 3.5-liter ``variable''
horsepower V-6 mated with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
Variable? With premium-grade fuel, the new engine puts out 210
horsepower; with regular grades, the horsepower drops to 205 _
believe me, you can live with that. By John R. White.

LATEST PUBLISHING TREND IS TO GET TOUGH ON MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men Are Jerks'' and ``Let's Face it, Men are (AT)$$(NU)%/(CT)$''
are new books aimed at women who want to understand men, a
seemingly limitless audience because what women doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Labeling all men jerks and (AT)$$(NU)%?(CT)$ may seem harsh, but
publishing these days is a cutthroat business. These titles are
meant to grab the attention of buyers of relationship self-help
books, nearly all of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
   Look through the self-help shelves and there, alongside ``Women
Who Love Too Much'' and ``How to Make a Man Fall in Love With You''
are such titles as ``A Field Guide to Impossible Men,'' ``101 Lies
Men Tell Women,'' ``A Dog in Heat is a Hot Dog,'' and ``How to Dump
a Guy.'' Dayle Deanna Schwartz, author of ``All Men Are Jerks,''
says she thinks her title appeals to what many women are feeling.
``There's a ready audience who wants to hear this stuff,'' she
said. ``It's unfortunate, but if I'd called it `How to Find
Yourself,' no one would notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers hoping that Schwartz's book will be an antimale diatribe
will be disappointed. The complete title is ``All Men are Jerks
Until Proven Otherwise.'' In fact, ``How to Find Yourself'' would
have been a more appropriate title, because Schwartz's book
encourages women to concentrate on improving their own lives
instead of using all their energy trying to get a man. ``I believe,
if you want a man, get a life,'' she said. ``You have to make
yourself happy first.''
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Let's Face It, Men Are (AT)$$(NU)%/(CT)$'' isn't at
all misleading. The authors, psychologists Joseph W. Rock and Barry
L. Duncan, are extremely tough on (and very funny describing) their
own sex, writing about difficult men and offering women advice
about how to deal with them. The garbled word of the title stands
in for what Rock and Duncan refer to as ``the A epithet.'' Their
publisher, Health Communications, Inc., which published the
``Chicken Soup'' series, wanted them to remove the offending word
from the title.
</P>
<P>
   The authors learned from their experience with a previous book,
``Overcoming Relationship Impasses,'' which sold poorly. ``We had
such trouble trying to publicize that title,'' Rock said, from his
Ohio office. ``I used to joke that we should write a parody called,
`Let's Face It, Men are (A-epithets).'''
</P>
<P>
   Rock said whenever he mentioned the joke title to a woman, she'd
say one of three things, ``You're kidding,'' or ``Where can I buy
it?'' or ``I want to write a chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years both psychologists have treated many women in bad
relationships. ``It's usually the women who come in,'' Rock said.
``Women are so used to picking up the emotional slack, looking for
potential instead of looking at what's there. Taking blame. They're
much too easy on men. I get enraged listening to some of the stuff
they tell me. As a guy, I feel embarrassed for my gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock said he and Duncan don't think that all men are
(AT)$$(NU)%?(CT)$. ``But a disturbing percentage are,'' he said.
``Most men have it in them. My partner and I are fairly enlightened
people, but we've got it in us too, if we're not watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors have been promoting the book on the talk show
circuit, where they've been accused of male-bashing. Rock said,
``It's always a male talk-show host who says, `Men aren't like that
anymore. Men have changed; we're sensitive.' Well, maybe, but we're
still getting clients telling us these stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock says readers have to look hard to find positive references
to men in ``Let's Face It ...'' But when he and Duncan are asked,
as they often are, if they're being too hard on men, they have one
answer: ``Hell, no.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be part of a publishing trend. Carrie Lewis, publicity
director for Adams Media Corp., publishers of ``All Men Are
Jerks,'' says their spring list has a book titled ``Women are From
Venus, Men are From Hell.''

   RELIGION-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) -- Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis

anniversary of Freud's founding of psychoanalysis and the 100th
anniversary of Lewis' birth. By Diego Ribadeneira.

<P>
   YOUNG-PRIESTS-ART-NYT (Rome) _ Young American men entering the
priesthood today are far more conservative and tradition-bound than
many of their elders and most American Roman Catholics, according
to bishops, priests and church surveys. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-EDUC-NYT (Undated) _ As conservatives and liberals
alike have come to agree on the importance of marriage and the need
to strengthen families, a growing number of high schools across the
country are requiring students to undergo marriage education. The
movement to teach relationship skills, however, is only part of a
growing debate over what, and where, American children should be
taught about love and marriage. Some question the whole concept of
marriage education in the schools, arguing that it is an area best
left to churches and community groups and reserved for adults in a
relationship _ not high-school students. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ Just as the White House scandal
involving Monica Lewinsky has left many Americans divided and
angry, so it is becoming an increasingly public matter of
contention among the nation's religious leaders. Within their broad
ranks, the issue is not whether the president did wrong. Instead,
the question many clergy members have been wrestling with is, what
is the pressing moral issue at stake for the nation in the scandal?

   MIND OVER WATER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Craig Lambert &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marc Jaffe/Houghton Mifflin, 184 pp., $22 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first time I climbed into a racing shell, a friend's 26-foot
Van Dusen, I capsized within about 60 seconds, falling into the New
Hampshire lake I'd just finished swimming. This comically brief
sojourn and its upset accomplished three things. I had taken the
plunge awaiting every rower, albeit not for the last time. I'd
gotten a humbling notion of the sport's precision and difficulty.
And I'd managed five or six strokes _ enough to feel like a
dragonfly skimming the surface of the water, and to perceive, even
for a moment, that rowing might change my life.
</P>
<P>
   If that transient awareness sounds dramatic, I suspect it's a
fairly common phenomenon among novice rowers. What lesser
experience could make so many otherwise sensible people head for
the water at 6 a.m., waking to aching muscle groups they didn't
know they possessed, undeterred by any weather but ice or
lightning? Like any challenging sport, rowing (whether competitive
or recreational, whether single-oar sweeps with a crew or
individual, two-oar sculling) demands physical prowess, mental
focus, and sufficient social skill to abide by the rules _in this
case, of the coach, the crew, or the course. And as with any sport,
its rewards are both biological and psychological, a boon to muscle
mass as well as to confidence and well-being. But rowing seems to
give back something tenfold. Balanced somewhere between river and
sky, the rower has the chance to overtake the water by listening to
its counsel. The stroke, self-willed and self-propelled, can leave
the self behind.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Lambert, who knows all this firsthand, resonantly
describes the arcane universe of the sport in ``Mind Over Water,''
capturing its inner dimensions as well as its athletic trials.
After a brief but rigorous entry into the world of rowing as a
coxswain (or steersman) for Harvard's freshman crew in the
mid-1960s, he returned to it as a sweeps rower 20 years later. For
the past decade, he's rowed in single sculls on the Charles, where
he has encountered Olympian rowers; the terror of race traffic; and
_ best and hardest of all _ his own internal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The literature of rowing is scant indeed; David Halberstam's
``The Amateurs,'' which followed the 1984 Olympic trials, is
probably the best-known book on the subject (and now more than a
decade old). Part memoir and part ode to rowing, Lambert's work
brings to the field some of the rower's subjective experience: the
extraordinary mesh of mind and body in the natural world, the
intuitive grace that is the triumph of any great rower, the moment
_ I think of it as the lemur hang _ when the rower, suspended,
becomes a part of the boat's rhythmic glide.
</P>
<P>
   A versatile athlete through his 20s and 30s, Lambert began
rowing at 37; at the time, he had a doctorate in sociology, played
jazz and classical piano, and had just left the field of preventive
medicine to write full time (he's now an associate editor at
Harvard magazine). He brought this eclecticism of body and soul
with him to the river, and it's part of the sensibility of ``Mind
Over Water'': Lambert glides easily from the history of rowing (the
Greeks rowed three-tiered battleships, with 170 oarsmen) to the
torturous consequences of contemporary rowing machine trials (one
elite rower's thighs turned blue).
</P>
<P>
   He lovingly evokes the sweet synchronicity of a fast-moving
eight, where everything but the rowers' heartbeats (and maybe even
those) are in precise accord. He takes us into races through Tokyo
headwinds, to the dank and dreary indoor winter tanks at Harvard,
down the Charles in his own innocent attempt to compete in a double
at the 1986 Head of the Charles: ``By the one-mile mark we have a
firm grip on last place: the river is all ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert unabashedly waxes romantic about the magic of rowing,
but who can blame him? If a trouble spot exists in ``Mind Over
Water,'' it's one of metaphorical excess: rowing may be a microcosm
of balance, determination, and grace under pressure, but trying to
connect it to the rain forest or the human immune system is what a
coach might call a precarious reach. When Lambert simply writes
about the sport itself, he evokes the spare eloquence of an M.F.K.
Fisher: ``The stroke seat offers both anguish and glory.'' More
than once he brought chills to this reader, as in his memory of a
former crewmate who was blind _ an oarsman whose Labrador retriever
led him each day to the boat, where he then set the stroke for the
rest of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind Over Water'' is really a minor odyssey along the Charles
River itself, as well as the story of the clubs and characters who
belong there, from Community Rowing, founded 15 years ago in an
effort to democratize the sport, to the legendary Harry Parker, who
has brought far more glory than anguish to his Harvard crews in the
past three decades, and whose taciturn eloquence and grit epitomize
the sport. If there is a reluctant hero to this tale, it is Parker,
though he would surely eschew that stardom for the higher premise
of a well-manned boat, where a star could get a race into trouble.
Lambert has finished the course well in ``Mind Over Water,'' which
has the same attributes as the rowing he adores: precision, grace,
and total immersion.

`LA SENTINELLE': STUDENT LIFE AS A MIRROR OF DIVISION IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``La Sentinelle'' was shown as part of the New York Film
Festival in 1992. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 5, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes that Americans have a monopoly on conspiracy
theories should see the French director Arnaud Desplechin's
intricately constructed film, ``La Sentinelle.'' In the movie,
which might be described as a medical thriller, a brain that turns
out to be symbolic of the Cold War mentality is meticulously
dissected and analyzed on a laboratory table by a student of
forensic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away too much, it should suffice to say that
among other revelations about the recently ended Cold War is the
suggestion that it was a cloak-and-dagger game played with boyish
relish by participants on both sides of the divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Sentinelle'' follows the present-day travails, both
scientific and romantic, of Mathias Barillet (Emmanuel Salinger), a
glum young student who moves from Germany to France to attend
medical school. Aboard the train, he and his friend Jean-Jacques
(Thibault de Montalembert), an employee of the French Foreign
Ministry, are visited by customs officials. Although Jean-Jacques
passes the inspection, Mathias finds himself taken at gunpoint to
the customs car, where he is grilled by a sinister double-agent
type named Bleicher (Jean-Louis Richard).
</P>
<P>
   In his Paris hotel, however, Mathias finds a strange parcel in
one of his suitcases. Opening it up, he discovers the shrunken head
of a middle-aged man. Deeply shaken, he decides to keep his
discovery a secret, and over the following weeks he begins
surreptitiously testing samples of the head in his medical school
laboratory. His quest for information quickly mounts into an
obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The director, who also helped write the screenplay, extends the
Cold War analogies of people divided by nationality, religion and
sex to Mathias' touchy interpersonal relationships. Mathias decides
to share an apartment with William (Bruno Todeschini), a colleague
of Jean-Jacques' who is sleeping with Jean- Jacques' girlfriend,
Nathalie (Valerie Dreville). William is so insistent on guarding
his own space in the apartment that the door between their bedrooms
almost becomes a kind of checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand is Mathias' sister Marie (Marianne Denicourt), a
singer with a small opera company run by Jean-Jacques' boss, Varins
(Jean-Luc Boutte). An elegant and mysterious figure, Varins has the
power to decide if the company will visit Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The relations among everyone in this circle, in which Mathias
finds himself an outsider, are edgy. As he goes about his life, his
dealings with people have a quality of strained diplomatic
negotiations. Although the thriller aspect of ``La Sentinelle''
doesn't quite add up, the film is still an absorbing,
psychologically resonant portrait of French student life. As
directed by Desplechin, the attractive young cast hardly seems to
be acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Sentinelle'' is both an epitaph for the Cold War and a
reflection of it. It also wonders seriously about the psychological
ramifications of a united Europe.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   No one is under oath when writing their memoirs, but the joint
account by former President George Bush and his national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials than most.
</P>
<P>
   They not only had privileged access to official documentation,
as well as their own sources, but also were generously helped by
former staffers such as Richard Haass, Condoleezza Rice and Philip
Zelikow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A World Transformed,'' their new book, covers the years from
January 1989 to December 1991, and these were among the most
momentous of the century, including as they did the liberation of
Eastern Europe, the Tiananmen Square massacre, the unification of
Germany, the Persian Gulf war and the disintegration of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Both in background and personality, Bush was well fitted for the
task of navigating the rapids through which the United States and
the world passed during those three stupendous years. Friendship
was the clue to Bush's success, and he had a genius for it. It went
far deeper than the backslapping camaraderie with which some
Americans try to establish relationships with foreigners, which is
usually deeply resented. Clearly, Bush not only liked but
understood people, including those of different cultures. That made
them tend to like him.
</P>
<P>
   He was, admittedly, lucky in the leaders with whom he had to
deal. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl shared Bush's informal tastes
and anyhow knew the importance of keeping the United States on his
side during the delicate process of German reunification. Margaret
Thatcher never concealed her suspicion of Bush's tendency, as she
saw it, ``to go wobbly,'' but her determination to preserve the
``special relationship'' between Britain and the United States kept
her in line.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Mitterrand was another matter altogether: Had Bush not
charmed the French president during an informal weekend in
Kennebunkport, the persistent efforts of the Quai d'Orsay to rock
the boat might have caused a great deal more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But most important of all was the friendship with Mikhail
Gorbachev. It was not just that Bush, like Thatcher, found it easy
to do business with him. From the very beginning, he admits, ``I
liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Under other circumstances, Bush would no doubt have kept these
feelings under close control, but in solving the problems that lay
before them, a relationship of close confidence could do nothing
but good. Scowcroft was professionally more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   It took him some time, as it took many other Americans, to
realize that Gorbachev was ``for real.'' He feared that Gorbachev
was launching a dangerously successful charm offensive to disarm
the West, and warned Bush accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   As the year wore on, however, it became clear that Gorbachev's
concessions over arms control and Eastern Europe were not only
sincerely meant but bitterly opposed within his own entourage. The
support of Gorbachev against his internal enemies became a firm
plank of Western policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even Bush was determined that Gorbachev should not
be allowed to shape the future unilaterally with his dramatic
concessions. Bush was initially criticized for his apparent lack of
ideas, and he disarmingly confessed that he was not good at ``the
vision thing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of his presidency, however, he
badgered his staff to produce ideas that would enable him to
preserve the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But by the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so fast
that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the United
States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and manage
change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a vision of a
new world order.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental question was how to keep the Soviet Union on
board _ first while the people of central and Eastern Europe
struggled to free themselves from communism, then while Germany
pursued reunification, and finally to ensure that a united Germany
remained within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   This task involved convincing the Soviet leadership to swallow a
prolonged meal of toads, and only the most assiduous personal
diplomacy could have persuaded even Gorbachev to do so. The
determination to do nothing to humiliate the Soviet Union was
fundamental to Bush's policy, and it is clear that this was based
not only on prudent recollections of what happened in a humiliated
Germany after World War I but on Bush's own gentlemanly
inclinations.
</P>
<P>
   He stifled all manifestations of triumphalism after the fall of
the Berlin Wall. Bush also made it clear to Gorbachev that he
understood Moscow's dilemma when the Baltic states demanded their
independence. He encouraged the states of Eastern Europe not so
much to distance themselves from the Soviet Union as to liberalize
their own political and economic systems.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement of Bush during this delicate period of
transition was not that he did the right things but that he avoided
doing the wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The problems presented by the reunification of Germany were more
complex, if less dramatic. Here, whether the Americans liked it or
not, the initiative lay largely with Kohl. Had there been less
confidence between Kohl and Bush, the entire alliance might have
fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the wisdom of unifying Germany were widespread
among all the allies, not least the United States, but Bush himself
did not share them. As he put it, he was ``comfortable'' with the
prospect and therefore prepared to back Kohl in a policy that was
not entirely welcome even to all the chancellor's fellow citizens
in the Federal Republic.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, toads had to be swallowed not only by the Soviet
Union, but also by close U.S. allies like Britain and France.
Thatcher did not conceal how much she disliked the taste, but
having made her protest, she fell in line. So did Mitterrand, whose
``special relationship'' with Germany was as important to France as
that with the United States was for Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A final problem was how to reshape NATO so as to convince the
Soviets that the West no longer presented a threat, thereby easing
their withdrawal from Eastern Europe. Again, Thatcher protested but
acquiesced, while the French were able to say that, since they did
not belong to the military structure of NATO, it had nothing to do
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft reflects that in these negotiations Britain and France
might have been handled more tactfully, but it probably would not
have made much difference to the outcome. Although neither liked
taking a back seat, the reality is that the key players were Kohl,
Gorbachev and Bush. So long as they agreed, nothing else mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was
signed in Moscow on September 12, 1990. Six weeks earlier, Saddam
Hussein had invaded Kuwait, and the White House was already busy
dealing with that crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential diplomacy was at even more of a premium here. Bush
was careful to touch base, as he put it, not only with President
Husni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan, King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia and President Turgut Uzal of Turkey, but also with the
rulers of the smaller Arab emirates, and most important of all,
with Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gorbachev's promise of cooperation in the Persian Gulf
that led Bush to express premature hopes for a new world order in
which the superpowers would collaborate in preserving world peace.
Although initially cautious about the use of force, Bush was always
sufficiently determined about the need for firm action to require
no lecturing from Thatcher about being ``wobbly.''
</P>
<P>
   When on Aug. 5 he declared, ``This will not stand, this
aggression against Kuwait,'' he meant what he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the weeks rolled on, Bush's domestic critics complained about
a policy that they feared would lead to another Vietnam and
enormous casualties. Even the hard-won U.N. Security Council
resolution of Nov. 29, authorizing its members to ``use all
necessary means'' to restore peace and security, had so little
effect on a deeply divided U.S. public that the Senate vote to
authorize the use of force passed by only three voices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the allies were wavering, sending emissaries
to Baghdad in a vain attempt to extract concessions that would
redound to their own political advantage. It needed all of Bush's
strength and self-confidence to hold the course and go through with
the conflict that he knew to be necessary and believed _ in the
teeth of much expert military opinion _ would be brief.
</P>
<P>
   The only way of managing this crisis, he saw, was by fighting a
successful war.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, 1989-91 now seems as briefly euphoric as 1944-45.
Bush acknowledges in his memoirs how lucky and privileged he feels
to have been president during those years, but it can equally be
said that the United States, and the rest of the world, were very
lucky to have had him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, was to have a different order of
priorities and confront even more complex international problems.
Bush was a hard act to follow.

<P>
   No one is under oath when writing their memoirs, but the joint
account by former President George Bush and his national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials than most.
</P>
<P>
   They not only had privileged access to official documentation,
as well as their own sources, but also were generously helped by
former staffers such as Richard Haass, Condoleezza Rice and Philip
Zelikow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A World Transformed,'' their new book, covers the years from
January 1989 to December 1991, and these were among the most
momentous of the century, including as they did the liberation of
Eastern Europe, the Tiananmen Square massacre, the unification of
Germany, the Persian Gulf war and the disintegration of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Both in background and personality, Bush was well fitted for the
task of navigating the rapids though which the United States and
the world passed during those three stupendous years. Friendship
was the clue to Bush's success, and he had a genius for it. It went
far deeper than the backslapping camaraderie with which some
Americans try to establish relationships with foreigners, which is
usually deeply resented. Clearly, Bush not only liked but
understood people, including those of different cultures. That made
them tend to like him.
</P>
<P>
   He was, admittedly, lucky in the leaders with whom he had to
deal. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl shared Bush's informal tastes
and anyhow knew the importance of keeping the United States on his
side during the delicate process of German reunification. Margaret
Thatcher never concealed her suspicion of Bush's tendency, as she
saw it, ``to go wobbly,'' but her determination to preserve the
``special relationship'' between Britain and the United States kept
her in line.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Mitterrand was another matter altogether: Had Bush not
charmed the French president during an informal weekend in
Kennebunkport, the persistent efforts of the Quai d'Orsay to rock
the boat might have caused a great deal more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But most important of all was the friendship with Mikhail
Gorbachev. It was not just that Bush, like Thatcher, found it easy
to do business with him. From the very beginning, he admits, ``I
liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Under other circumstances, Bush would no doubt have kept these
feelings under close control, but in solving the problems that lay
before them, a relationship of close confidence could do nothing
but good. Scowcroft was professionally more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   It took him some time, as it took many other Americans, to
realize that Gorbachev was ``for real.'' He feared that Gorbachev
was launching a dangerously successful charm offensive to disarm
the West, and warned Bush accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   As the year wore on, however, it became clear that Gorbachev's
concessions over arms control and Eastern Europe were not only
sincerely meant but bitterly opposed within his own entourage. The
support of Gorbachev against his internal enemies became a firm
plank of Western policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even Bush was determined that Gorbachev should not
be allowed to shape the future unilaterally with his dramatic
concessions. Bush was initially criticized for his apparent lack of
ideas, and he disarmingly confessed that he was not good at ``the
vision thing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of his presidency, however, he
badgered his staff to produce ideas that would enable him to
preserve the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But by the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so fast
that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the United
States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and manage
change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a vision of a
new world order.

   4 Young Women Watch the Clock
</P>
<P>
   For a challenging little movie with good reviews but without a
lot of promotion, ``Clockwatchers'' has done quite well for itself
in theaters, where it has played for five months in about 80 cities
and earned more than $500,000 at the box office. Now it is time for
video.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which stars Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow, Toni Collette
and Alanna Ubach, is a drily funny and disturbing look at four
young women squelching their promise and dreams as temporary office
workers. ``It's a very quiet movie, and will play well in a
person's home,'' said Jill Sprecher, the director. ``It will seem
more intimate if people are in a contemplative mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most filmmakers, Ms. Sprecher prefers her work on the big
screen, but she also appreciates video, for a variety of reasons.
``We're just happy for the video market because that helped us get
the movie out and shown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   From its first appearance at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival,
``Clockwatchers'' has been guided along the distribution path by
BMG, an independent company that specializes in small movies of
worth that are not picked up by larger independents like Miramax
and October. BMG, which will release the film on tape Oct. 27,
plans theater runs for its properties but it aims for home video.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, company and movie made a match, if not immediately
at Sundance. At first, the film's cast and subject generated a
pre-screening buzz among those anticipating a broad comedy along
the lines of ``9 to 5.'' But then ``Clockwatchers'' revealed a
split personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the screening, all the theatrical distributors were there
and because they were expecting a comedy, they were laughing their
heads off during the first half of the movie,'' Ms. Sprecher said.
While there are humorous moments, they aren't that humorous. ``In
the last half, the laughter died down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larger distributors passed on the film and so did smaller ones.
``Even independents typically expect something more mainstream,''
Ms. Sprecher said.
</P>
<P>
   In stepped BMG. ``Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many normal
people get to go to Sundance anymore? `` said BMG vice president
Mindy Pickard, who was attracted to ``Clockwatchers'' at the
festival and helped start the process that led to the film's sale
several months later. ``It's all industry types.'' Ms. Sprecher's
film, she added, was overhyped at Sundance. ``A whole frenzy thing
happens, so sometimes it's not so smart for some films to go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among rank-and-file film enthusiasts at other festivals, Ms.
Pickard said, ``Clockwatchers'' caught hold. Having judged its
quarry accurately, BMG had a property it could put into theaters
and prepare properly for video. ``There's star power and Gen-X
appeal,'' she said. ``Also it's a serious effort by a filmmaker
with vision who has something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   One paradox, however. Among video dealers movies are as
categorized as they are at Sundance. ``For video, we're marketing
much more comedic,'' Ms. Pickard said.

   Seen cheerleading in a flashback, Sandra Bullock plays Birdee
Pruitt, who as everybody's high-school sweetheart rode on beds of
flowers made of toilet paper in sweet, little Smithville, Texas.
Later, though, life takes a chomp out of Birdee, and after her
husband cheats on her, she beats it back to Smithville for some
down-home guidance on such matters as divorce and single
motherhood. Aiming to dispense cheery succor, Forrest Whitaker's
film gets seriously over-cute in places but, Janet Maslin wrote in
The New York Times, still scores ``with a pajama-party intimacy
that can be disarming when it isn't overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   1998. Fox. $19.98. 114 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release
date: Tuesday.

   Dancer, Texas, Pop. 81
</P>
<P>
   For absolute Texas down-homeness, there's no beating Dancer,
where the widows besiege the lone widower with yummy Jell-O molds
and everybody packs the perfect little church for sermons decrying
the wages of lust. When four of the five graduating high-school
seniors announce that they're lighting out for Los Angeles,
skeptical townspeople start taking bets on how many of them will
chicken out and stay put in Dancer. Squirrel (Ethan Embry), after
all, has an alcoholic father to look after, and Keller (Breckin
Meyer) takes care of his grandfather. Terrell Lee (Peter Facinelli)
belongs in the oil business, and John (Eddie Mills) is a born
rancher. Though Tim McCanlies' film has a knowing eye for things
Texan, all gets smothered in ``a tone of saccharine folksiness''
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77. 95 minutes. Closed captioned.
PG.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan and the Lost City
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Rice Burroughs' durable ape man (Casper Van Dien), a k a
John Clayton or Lord Greystoke, deserts England and impending
marriage to a put-out Jane (Jane March) for a foray back to his
homeland, which is being thoroughly plundered and pillaged by the
evil scholar and explorer Nigel Ravens (Steven Waddington). At
stake finally are the riches of the city of Opar, the cradle of
civilization no less. The old Saturday afternoon chestnut is still
``kid stuff and little more, but the old formula still works''
(Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Warner. $102.96. 84 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Hit
</P>
<P>
   The name of Hong Kong director John Woo is invoked often, but in
this case he's the executive producer of a film put in the hands of
another Hong Kong veteran, Che-Kirk Won. And a preposterous mess it
is, with Mark Wahlberg evoking some sympathy as Mel, a neurotic hit
man tied to treacherous colleagues who leave piles of corpses and
end up kidnapping their boss' goddaughter. Swilling patent medicine
to calm his stomach, Mel swims upstream in a ``high-concept,
low-reward hodgepodge'' (Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77. 91 minutes. Closed captioned.
R. Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a

<P>
   THE TRIAL. ``Film,'' Orson Welles once told an interviewer,
``should not be a fully illustrated, all-talking, all-moving
version of a book, but should be itself.'' Managing striking
theatrical effects of its own, Welles' film, inspired by (he
rejected ``adapted from'') Franz Kafka's nightmare novel of
bureaucratic menace, stars Anthony Perkins as Joseph K, an
unlikable but innocent man who, over his increasingly desperate
protests, is convicted and finally executed by the state for a
crime that is never identified and he knows nothing about. The cast
includes Welles himself, Jeanne Moreau and Romy Schneider. Found in
a decrepit state, and by accident, the European-made film has been
restored by David Pierce and Milestone Film and Video. 1962. 129
minutes, with the original American trailer. $29.95. Information:
(800) 603-1104.
</P>
<P>
   MAN WITH A PLAN. Fred Tuttle's 94-year-old father needs $28,000
for a hip operation. Fred, a 73-year-old retired Vermont dairy
farmer who plays himself in John O'Brien's film, needs a job with a
six-figure salary and a dental plan. So he runs for Congress and
wins in a screen performance that earned Tuttle so much fame that
he actually won a real-life victory last month as the Republican
nominee for the U.S. Senate. (Never clarified, the Fred plan
apparently rests on being friendly, renewable, extraterrestrial and
dinky, whatever they mean.) 1996. Acorn. $19.95. 90 minutes. No
rating. Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. Tiny Tim warbles ``Danny Boy,'' ``Be My
Baby'' and ``I Got You Babe'' and other numbers on a tape from the
60's that includes selections by Jefferson Airplane, Frank Zappa,
Paul Butterfield, the Electric Flag and the Family Dog. 1998. Ivy.

BULLOCK AND KIDMAN MAKE A `MAGIC' PAIR

   Since the days of Salem, the sultry Owens women have been called
witches. Feared, reviled, exiled and lusted after, the Owens
matriarchs have survived despite a curse cast over them by an
ancestor. Jilted by her lover, Sarah Owens promised that every man
an Owens woman loves will be doomed to an early death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Sally Owens (Sandra Bullock) and her wild sister
Gillian (Nicole Kidman) are still feared by the inhabitants of the
small New England town where they live with their two spell-casting
aunts, Frances (Stockard Channing) and Jet (Dianne Wiest). Gillian
itches to see the world and runs off with the first man who comes
calling. Sally finds happiness at home, starting a business with
her husband and two young daughters. But things come to a boil
after hubby is mowed down by a truck and Gillian returns _ along
with an unwanted visitor _ her abusive, creepy boyfriend, Jimmy
(Goran Visnjic).
</P>
<P>
   After the sisters accidentally kill the woman-bashing punk with
an overdose of witchcraft, they bury him in the garden, but find he
just won't stay dead. It'll take all the strength and magic the
women can muster to break the old curse and rid the house of
Jimmy's hold over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' contains strong ideas about female bonding
and a ``sisterhood is powerful'' notion that is sure to alienate
some viewers. But it might be the next candidate for a meeting
ground for women everywhere, much as the film, ``First Wives Club''
and the novel about the ``Ya Ya Sisterhood,'' proved to be.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that ``Practical Magic'' has a spellbinding
charm and that's mostly ensured by the chemistry and star-power of
the cast, as well as the fact that the film maintains a smart, even
wry sense of humor about itself.
</P>
<P>
   Director Griffin Dunne has a quirky eye and a fascination for
the darker side of life. His film, ``Addicted To Love,'' managed to
make black comedy out of stalking and ``Practical Magic'' has much
of the same twisted sense of humor. But he also has a wonderful
flair for the visual storytelling medium (the film was shot in the
San Juan Islands) and the camera work and special effects play a
strong part in the film's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the popular novel by Alice Hoffman, screenwriters Robin
Swicord, Akiva Goldman and Adam Brooks have scripted an engaging,
if not wholeheartedly original, story, though most of the credit
must go to the cast for making movie-star magic with ultimately
contrived material.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman has fun playing a wild card and she and Bullock shine as
sisters who have a bond so intense it's a blessing as well as a
curse. ``Practical Magic'' needs their gung-ho talent and charisma
to draw us in and they throw themselves into this cauldron of dark,
uncomfortable comedy with gusto, conjuring more screen magic than
the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   Practical Magic. Directed by Griffin Dunne. Written by Robin
Swicord, Akiva Goldman, Adam Brooks. Cast: Sandra Bullock, Nicole
Kidman, Aidan Quinn, Stockard Channing, Dianne Wiest. Warner Bros.

IF CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN, BOY IS WELL ON HIS WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was young. The kind of young that thinks a 20-year-old is
ancient history. He had seen just enough through those big green
eyes to acquire a hint of wariness that caused him to cling to the
hem of his mother's dress like a small piece of lint. Yet his
innocent, easy smile and fluid gestures indicated that his trust
could be bought with a small candy bar or a big puppy.
</P>
<P>
   His mother and older sister wore their understated affluence
across their proud shoulders and down their slender, well-tanned
frames. Chanel, Donna Karan for Kids, Halston, Movado. I took this
designers inventory out of appreciation and curiosity. The ladies
looked so nice, but the little boy, well, he looked, um, shall we
say, colorful? Very colorful.
</P>
<P>
   Little Skippy was wearing pinstriped pants, red and blue. They
were about an inch shy of covering his ankles and the green socks
that he wore. His short-sleeved shirt was covered with stars and
moons; green stars and yellow moons. Skippy's hair was combed in
four directions, none of which seemed to be the natural pattern of
growth. A thin, brown belt held his ensemble together.
</P>
<P>
   I was behind Skippy and his family in a long line at the
convenience store. The little boy stared at me until I smiled at
him. Suddenly shy, he giggled and turned away. Sensing potential
danger, I suppose, his mother glanced back and his sister did a
graceful pirouette in my direction. Having satisfied herself that I
was a mild-mannered housewife on a mission to buy toilet tissue,
his mother smiled. His sister then borrowed her mother's smile and
shared it with me as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have lovely children,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' she replied. Then she quickly added as if in
apology, ``My son dressed himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Skippy looked at his mom and then at me, awaiting my reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding,'' I exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   I looked down at Skippy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did a good job Skippy. You're a big boy. I think you look
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Skippy beamed. His sister rolled her eyes in disbelief. Skippy
took a step toward me and said, ``You know what? These are my
favorite pants. When grandpa was in the big box, they put a flag on
it and it was just like my pants. My grandma got the flag, but
she's gonna give it to me someday. She promised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm sure she will if she promised,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, Skippy continued, ``And my shirt is for my daddy. He
flies air-o-planes way up in the stars. I'm gonna be a air-o-plane
pilot just like my daddy someday. Then I can fly to visit my
grandpa way up in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   With tears in her eyes, Skippy's mother said, ``Darling, is that
why you chose those clothes? I didn't know that. You really miss
grandpa, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Skippy nodded. His mother turned to me and said, ``My father
recently passed away.''
</P>
<P>
   I offered condolences as she paid for their purchases. They
started to leave, then Skippy ran back and gave me a great big hug.
</P>
<P>
   Back in my car, I noticed the chocolate stain on my blouse; a
small price to pay for wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Skippy. You really are a big boy.

THE TOUGH TASK OF FILLING THE SHOES OF A LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Freeman might want to give Morris Smith a call.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, you may remember, was the Fidelity Investments money
manager who found out just how painful it could be to follow the
legendary Peter Lynch. Now it is Chuck Freeman's turn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.4l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Freeman spent 27 years as the understudy for superstar manager
John Neff at Vanguard Group's storied Windsor fund before taking
over in 1996 when Neff retired. Things went well at first, and
Windsor was the only big nonindex equity fund to beat the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 over his first seven quarters in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   But the roof has fallen in lately on the 54-year-old Freeman, a
partner at Boston's Wellington Management Co., which has long
managed the fund for Pennsylvania-based Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, a contrarian value investor, has trailed the index the
last four quarters, including a disasterous loss of 19.4 percent
last quarter. Over the last year, Windsor is down 23.2 percent
compared with a loss of 9.03 percent for all growth and income
funds monitored by Lipper Analytical Services. Windsor ranks 424 of
450 among all such funds over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days before fund managers were followed as closely
as home-run hitters, someone like Neff could have a lousy year and
it was written off as the nature of the business. Neff, in fact,
had awful years in 1989 and 1990, and his numbers were fairly
mediocre his last few years. But that was then.
</P>
<P>
   Now the scrunity is far greater, the choices for investors
endless, and money far more mobile, thanks to the mutual fund
supermarkets, which have made switching funds as easy as a
telephone call. And The Chuck Freeman Watch has begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fund manager skates on thin ice,'' said Business Week this
month. The Wall Street Journal, and an on-line investment
publication, both ran stories suggesting Vanguard could consider
changing managers or going to a multimanager approach. ``When
there's bad performance for an extended period, you don't just
stand there. Sooner or later you've got to do something,'' the
Journal quoted Jack Bogle, Vanguard's founder, as saying after a
board meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard insists there are no such changes are in the cards.
John Brennan, Vanguard's chief executive, says Bogle's comments
were taken out of context and that Windsor is doing exactly what it
is supposed to do _ making gutsy bets against the market. ``The
board of directors is fully supportive of Chuck Freeman and his
team,'' Brennan said yesterday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say things haven't been ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman has found himself in just the wrong place in this
volatile market. Late last year, he badly underestimated the impact
of the Asian crisis and had too much of the fund invested in the
kind of commodity and cyclical stocks that got crushed. He was
light on the ``Nifty Fifty'' big-name stocks that have lead the
market and over-invested in small- and medium-capitalization
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Freeman noted yesterday in an interview, have been
``horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors yanked $1.7 billion from the fund in the first nine
months of the year, says Daniel P. Wiener, editor of the
Independent Advisor for Vanguard Investors, a newsletter in
Potomac, Md. The fund, which had $23 billion in assets in April,
was down to $17.1 billion at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been particularly stark compared with those of
Vanguard's Windsor II, a sister fund, which has been holding up
well in the downturn. That fund ranks 101 of 711 growth and income
funds over the last year and 35 of 450 funds over the last three
years, says Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard maintains the funds were never supposed to be clones of
each other, with Windsor II more diversified than its highly
concentrated older sibling. Still, says Freeman, ``they had just
the right portfolio for an economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is standing by his contrarian picks. Windsor has three
times the weighting in commodity cyclicals like basic materials and
energy as the S&AMP;P 500. This is about as far away from indexing as
you can get; fully 35 percent of his portfolio isn't even included
in the S&AMP;P index.
</P>
<P>
   What Freeman is betting is that the US and European economies
are going to do a lot better than people think despite the problems
in Asia and Latin America and that a worldwide economic turnaround
is in the cards in the next 12 months. When that happens, Freeman
says, the market should broaden out and his cheap stocks should do
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a classical turning point,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That would suit those patient Vanguard executives just fine.
Wiener, the Vanguard newsletter editor, says Bogle's personal
Windsor holdings are down $450,000 this year; Brennan's holdings
are down $350,000 and five Vanguard executives on the board
together have lost $1.2 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman won't be exact, but says ``far and away the majority of
my worth'' is in his own fund. And he has been adding to his own
Windsor holdings, both in August and September. This is no easy
profit-sharing money either, he notes, but ``real money, cash
purchases.''

FOR PEEPING AT NATURE, MAINE ALMOST HAS IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAR HARBOR, Maine _ Peeping at nature, perhaps the most popular
recreational activity, has its seasons, and except for alligators
in ditches such as off the Tamiami Highway in Florida, Maine has
them all.
</P>
<P>
   In spring, there is no place better to peep at moose than Maine,
better known as the great salad bowl of New England.
</P>
<P>
   The hardwood forests, especially where there's been
clear-cutting, are the perfect habitat for moose, which also like
to wander roadways, making moose-peeping so easy that the animals
are more dangerous than logging trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is not the only Northern state where whale-peeping is a
commonplace summer activity, but it adds a strange-looking seabird
_ the puffin _ that inhabits a few small islands off the coast.
Boat trips from Bar Harbor to peep at whales and puffins are
usually packed as they head out to Petite Manan and Matinikus
Islands well into the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common of the peeping sports is fall foliage, an
activity that grows by the year and ranges from a cruise in the old
Buick to a strenuous mountain hike or bike trip.
</P>
<P>
   Acadia National Park, with its central town of Bar Harbor, has
it all. It's a microcosm of the Northern outdoors _ ocean and
inland waterways, forest, beach, and mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain in question, Mount Cadillac, is only 1,500 feet,
which is more of a big, rocky hill. But from its summit last
Sunday, a ringingly clear day, the autumn tweed weave of orange,
red, and yellow stretched for miles to the blue distance where the
bulking shapes of Mount Washington and Mount Katahdin were in view.
</P>
<P>
   So if Cadillac is not Everest or K2 _ you won't need to bring
oxygen _ the climb is still exhilarating and right now at the
height of the foliage colors. It is the highest point on the
Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors to Acadia first make the 27-mile Park Loop Road
drive around Cadillac that begins at the visitor center just across
the bridge from the town of Ellsworth.
</P>
<P>
   For coastal hikers, several pathways run along the cliffbound
coast of the island, with walks from a couple of miles to full-day
hikes that take in such features as Sand Beach and the Otter Cliffs
where Thunder Hole performs. This is an amazing natural rock
formation where, at about three-quarter tide, the waves pound into
a long chasm in the cliff and explode with a roar into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The tamest walk is probably the Shore Path in Bar Harbor. Though
it gets crowded in the summer, the mile walk along the coast of
Frenchman Bay is one of Maine's many postcard settings.
</P>
<P>
   Still in operation is the 151-foot, five-masted schooner
Margaret Todd, which, with red sails billowing in a stiff northeast
wind, heels out among the whitecaps, out of sight behind Sheep
Porcupine Island.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the hiking breaks into two categories: easy, along
the 50 miles of carriage roads that crisscross Acadia; and
strenuous, walks up not only Cadillac but Acadia, Huguenaut,
Champlain, and Gorham. Of these, Acadia, about 3 1/2 hours, is the
best. The summit has spectacular views of the region in its flaming
autumnal colors, offshore islands, and a true fjord, Soames Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac also has great views and one's choice of challenge. The
rockface approach is tough, but the road is easier on the opposite
side. For those who don't want to walk, there is an auto road and
facilities at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the summit, there is a half-mile easy walk that swings a
360-degree view of the region from the Atlantic's highest
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A few other hikes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Jordan Pond Bridges: a 2-mile walk of moderate challenge with
history of Acadia's carriage roads and stone bridges.
</P>
<P>
   -- Forests of Lilliput: 1 1/2 miles, rated moderate, it takes
walkers into a world of unique mosses, ferns, lichens, and fungi _
and also along the ancient shoreline by island's forest.
</P>
<P>
   -- Carriage roads offer any length walk, bike ride, horseback
ride. Some of these are restricted to foot only; others allow
various uses. All are marked and offer extremely easy access. Few
offer any challenge beyond easy walking, but trail maps are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor center or ranger stop at the park entrance is the
place to pick up maps and information about the entire park and its
hundreds of features.

UNITED AIRLINES DRAWS THE LINE ON BULKY BAGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Airlines travelers who like to lug lots of bulky stuff
with them on the plane had better think again.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing an industrywide trend of carry-on crackdowns, United
Airlines announced it will fit some airport security X-ray machines
with stainless steel templates to keep out bags that are too big to
be brought on board.
</P>
<P>
   Bags will have to fit through a 9- by 14-inch rectangle, United
spokeswoman Kristina Price said Wednesday. If necessary, bags can
be folded to make them fit.
</P>
<P>
   Bags that can't make it through must be checked. United will
have customer service representatives on hand to help at the
checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of months, United has had templates in Los Angeles.
On Nov. 1, the airline will begin using them at 38 more U.S.
airports, including Bush Intercontinental, where it has 27 daily
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Safety and cutting down on flight delays are among the reasons
for United's actions, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   When people drag oversized items on board and can't find room,
they end up having to get their bags checked. That may delay
takeoff. Also, she said, officials are concerned about items
tumbling out of bins onto people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, we feel this will really be a much smoother,
hassle-free experience for the customer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The templates, Price said, have generally been well-received by
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At the majority of airports where United installs the templates,
its passengers are the only ones to use the security checkpoints,
Price said. At checkpoints United shares with other airlines, the
equipment is going in only if the other carriers agree, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, United shares with US Airways, whose officials
couldn't reached for comment. US Airways has 11 daily departures
from Houston, according to the Houston Airport System.
</P>
<P>
   United is also spending about $10 million to improve its baggage
handling. That will go for more employees and new technology, Price
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a number of carriers began tackling the
carry-on issue by beefing up and more strongly enforcing policies.
Some began counting briefcases and laptop computers in their
carry-on limits.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines is testing a system similar to United's in a few
airports, including New York's La Guardia Airport, said Delta
spokeswoman Jackie Pate. Houston is not among them. Delta has not
made any plans to expand the templates beyond the test sites, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers, including Northwest Airlines, Southwest
Airlines, Trans World Airlines, American Airlines and Houston-based
Continental Airlines, said Wednesday they don't plan to install
such systems.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to carry-ons, Continental is going the other way
from United, said spokeswoman Julie Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting our efforts into accommodating our passengers
and their baggage,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Continental's new planes are coming with larger overhead storage
bins and some older planes are being retrofitted with larger bins,
she said. Continental does not count laptops or briefcases in its
carry-on limits.
</P>
<P>
   At Dallas-based Southwest, which kicked off its ``Don't be a
Bin &UR;  &LR; Hog'' campaign on Groundhog's Day in February, the company
tested a similar system to United's on the West Coast, said
spokeswoman Melanie Jones. But, she said, the carrier decided not
to go with United's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons, Jones said, is that Southwest wants to have
consistency at its airports. In places where it shares checkpoints
with other carriers, she said, they might not agree to install the
templates. Also, she said, the airline wants its employees _ not
security workers _ to deal with the issue of bags.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Worth-based American, spokesman Tim Smith said officials
are watching what United is doing with interest. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Bertie Wooster, the dimwitted swell of P.G.
Wodehouse's ``Jeeves'' novels, didn't get many things right. But he
did show unusual wisdom in his perception that a certain kind of
woman was dangerous. It wasn't so much hard-hearted vamps that gave
Bertie the shivers as what he called ``soupy'' girls, with an
overdeveloped sense of whimsy: the type, as he described one of
them, to say that ``rabbits were gnomes in attendance on the Fairy
Queen and that the stars were God's daisy chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Were Bertie to meet the female constituents in the wayward
wedding party of Beth Henley's new play, ``Impossible Marriage,''
which opened Thursday night in a Roundabout Theater Company
production starring the Oscar-winning actress Holly Hunter, he
would probably book the next train to Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Their names are Pandora, Floral and Kandall, and their behavior
confirms the fanciful choices of their christeners. Pandora, who is
soon to be married, plans to accessorize her bridal gown with a
pair of blue wings. Floral, her heavily pregnant older sister,
relieves pre-ceremony tensions by rolling down a hill. And Kandall,
their mother, the sensible one, is deeply distressed when a visitor
kicks over some toadstools in her garden because, she wails, he has
``destroyed all the fairies' houses.''
</P>
<P>
   A fanciful disposition is nothing new to the characters of Beth
Henley, who emerged as a startlingly original theater voice in the
early 1980s with such plays as the Pulitzer-prize winning ``Crimes
of the Heart'' and who here makes a long overdue return to the New
York stage. But even the crimson-haired, baton-twirling heroine of
Ms. Henley's 1984 comedy ``The Miss Firecracker Contest,'' which
memorably starred Ms. Hunter, might find the women of ``Impossible
Marriage'' a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley appears to be deliberately pushing the envelope of
eccentricities that is her stock in trade. In creating characters
who are as baroquely mannered as anyone out of Oscar Wilde, she is
also pointing out the limitations of those who live by the pose. As
Floral (Ms. Hunter) notes, in a jarringly clear departure from her
usual ornate utterances, ``Everyone isn't always what they seem.''
</P>
<P>
   A ravening fear and loneliness surge beneath the willful
preciousness of ``Impossible Marriage.'' But unlike ``Crimes'' and
``Firecracker,'' this comedy never breaks through its exterior to
reveal a fractured human heart. There are signposts aplenty,
pointing to the conflict between rarefied posture and primitive
passion, but they remain stuck on the surface. And while an
estimable cast, which includes the wonderful Lois Smith as Kandall,
has been assembled, the actors are hard pressed to connect with
their characters in any way that they or their audience can
believe.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence the play, stiffly directed by Stephen
Wadsworth, never acquires any organic flow. The whole evening often
feels like Pandora (Gretchen Cleevely), twirling in the moonlight
on the eve of her wedding, while calling out: ``Come look at me
everyone. I'm all alone out here.'' The work is a sustained, flashy
cry for attention, but it doesn't quite know how to behave once it
gets it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Impossible Marriage'' is Ms. Henley's contemporary answer to
``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' It is set in the lush,
pastel-flowered garden (Thomas Lynch's picturesque setting suggests
Martha Stewart on Prozac) of the Georgia country home of Kandall
Kingsley, a wealthy Savannah widow. Like Shakespeare's Athenian
forest, it is a place where the course of true love will assert
itself in disruptive and unexpected ways and couples will be
scrambled like the partners in a square dance. Love, the play
suggests, is always impossible, and all you can do is let it take
you where it will.
</P>
<P>
   The people who act out this theory are all of poetic
temperament, throwing metaphors among themselves like balloons at a
children's party. (Excuse the simile: Ms. Henley's style is
perilously contagious.) In addition to the Kingsley women, there is
Edvard Lunt (Christopher McCann), a famous novelist who has left
his wife and eight children for the childlike Pandora, and his
hopelessly self-conscious son, Sidney (Daniel London), who is
determined to stop the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand are Floral's husband, Jonsey Whitman (Jon Tenney),
an aimless rich boy who defines himself entirely by his
mannequin-like handsomeness, and the elderly Rev. Jonathan Larence
(Alan Mandell), who has just returned from missionary work in
Nigeria and who tends to wince, for reasons that quickly become
apparent, whenever people talk about how good he is. ``Sincerity,''
he says ominously, ``is difficult to discern.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Impossible Marriage'' ends, a gun is fired, a wedding
cake is ravaged and assorted secrets, whose nature can be discerned
early on, are dragged into the open. There are a couple of jolting
carnal images, in which unlikely couples make brief physical
contact, but mostly the evening is an occasion for lots and lots of
fancy talk.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley is a virtuosic wordsmith, and she knows how to bend a
figure of speech in all sorts of unexpected ways. Consider, for
example, Edvard's paean to his bride-to-be: ``a brand-new penny
that has not been dropped down tollbooths, handed to beggars,
thrown into wishing wells, flipped for bets or used in bad magic
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Such lines are usually pitched not to another character but
directly to the audience, as the epigrams are in high-school
productions of Wilde and Sheridan. The intention, one gathers, is
to accent the posturing nature of Ms. Henley's self-dramatizing
lovers. But the actors seem uncomfortable with, and even distanced
from, their dialogue, and the result is a doubly affected rendering
of affectations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter, heaven knows, is a splendid actress, as anyone who
saw her in ``Broadcast News'' or ``The Piano'' can attest, and her
association with Ms. Henley has been long and fruitful.
Unfortunately, she is ill served here. Her strength has always been
in an intense emotional sincerity. Artificiality does not come
naturally to her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith provides the evening's greatest depth of feeling.
``She can do so much with the tone of her voice,'' says Floral of
her mother. And Ms. Smith's Kandall does indeed work wonders with
inflections and pauses. The performance is also disjointed,
however, unusually so for this actress, and marked with a tendency
to mug. The only actor to come up with a fully integrated
performance is Tenney, whose Jonsey seems both touchingly resigned
to and saddened by his inability to get beyond the fact of his good
looks. It is telling that the most convincing character in the
comedy is also its most superficial.
</P>
<P>
   There is another, uncredited performer in ``Impossible
Marriage.'' That's the brown and white dog who runs across the back
of the stage in a gleeful blur in the show's opening and closing
moments. The dog's appearance is never explained, but its seeming
spontaneity registers in resonant contrast to the noncanine actors,
hinting at a natural world, a realm of instinct beyond all those
enameled manners. ``Marriage'' is clearly charted to take its
characters into the world. Somehow they never arrive there.

`THE ALARMIST': PEDDLING HOME SECURITY BY HOOK AND CROOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's hope that Evan Dunsky's gleefully paranoid comedy ``The
Alarmist'' doesn't give some unscrupulous salesman of the kind
found in a David Mamet play any ideas for devilish new scams.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a company dealing in home security systems that drums up
business by finding out when potential customers are going to be
out of the house, breaks into their homes to create a panic, then
aggressively peddles its wares to the neighborhood's frightened
residents. Sometimes the company even stages bogus semi-break-ins
when customers are at home to terrorize them into making costly
impulse purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The weasel behind this operation is Heinrich Grigoris (Stanley
Tucci). a slick, high-powered salesman. In one of the subtlest,
most delicious performances of his career, Tucci imbues this
unsavory character with enough sleazy, back-slapping charm and
man-to-man ``sincerity'' to make you begin to see the world through
his unapologetically larcenous eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``The Alarmist'' sees the world through two pairs of
eyes. One belongs to Heinrich; the other to his ingenuous
eager-beaver protege and star salesman Tommy Hudler (David
Arquette). Tommy is the epitome of a tail-wagging gung-ho young
salesman, but he is also an almost nauseatingly straight arrow. One
evening when he and his boss are driving around Los Angeles after
having downed a few cocktails, Heinrich insists they stop in front
of a well-appointed red-brick house. To his protege's shock,
Heinrich blithely skips up to the front door and kicks it in,
setting off a cacaphony of alarms, then dashes back to the car like
a little kid who's just pulled off a triumphant prank.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, adapted from Keith Reddin's play ``Life During
Wartime,'' isn't just about thievery and shady business ethics. It
is also a free-floating satire of various modes of American
looniness, Southern California style.
</P>
<P>
   In scenes that suggest a no-fault late-'90s variation of ``The
Graduate,'' Tommy embarks on an affair with Gale Ancona (Kate
Capshaw), an attractive 40ish divorcee who becomes his first major
customer. Gale has a teen-age son, Howard (Ryan Reynolds), who is
only a few years younger than Tommy. Some of the movie's squirmier
scenes find Tommy awkwardly trying to playing surrogate father to a
boy who turns out to be more sophisticated than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy and Gale have sharply clashing notions about the meaning
of their relationship. The emotionally myopic young salesman
insists that Kate is his true love and dreams of marrying her. To
Gale, he is nothing more than some pleasant recreational sex. Their
points of views collide when Tommy coerces a reluctant Kate into
meeting his family, and in an extremely funny sequence that reveals
Ms. Capshaw's skills at deadpan comedy, Gale retaliates by making
outrageously inappropriate sexual remarks that leave Tommy's family
cowering in embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the halfway point, ``The Alarmist'' takes a
dramatic U-turn into a murder mystery in which Tommy suspects his
boss of being the killer. At this point a movie that succeeded as a
light, loopy satire of sex, salesmanship, shoddy ethics, gun nuts
and geeky teen-agers finds itself seriously in over its head.
Unable to decide where to go or what tone to adopt, it ends up
treading water.

 &HT;    Are you prepared for the greatest computer glitch in history _
the Year 2000 Bug?
 &HT;    Throughout history, prophets and visionaries have spent their
lives preparing for the end of the world.
 &HT;    But this time it is software programmers who are blazing the
millennial trail. They've have read the future, not in the Book of
Revelation, but in a few million lines of computer code.
 &HT;    By now, the source of their anxiety is well known.
 &HT;    In the 1950s and 1960s, when the computer world was young and
memory was expensive, programmers developed a convention for
marking the passage of time. It's the same system most people use
to date their checks: two digits for the day, two for the month and
two for the year. Dropping the ``19'' from the year was convenient,
and it saved two bytes of precious RAM every time it was used.
 &HT;    Those were days of innocence and optimism. Everyone knew what
would happen if this little shortcut was still in use in AD 2000 _
the two-digit year would roll over like the odometer on an old
Chevy, and the computers would think they'd jumped 100 years into
the past. Programmers knew it, and they warned their managers.
 &HT;    Not to worry, was the usual reply. When the millennium finally
rolls around, all this code will be ancient history.
 &HT;    But the code stuck around. The old software worked fine in the
post-mainframe world, so nobody felt compelled to replace it.
Instead, like Roman architects, they just built on top of it. The
two-digit year became a standard, wired right into the heart of
Cobol _ the Common Business Oriented Language that still serves as
the digital workhorse of commerce and industry. It also crept into
the embedded microchips found in everything from VCRs to nuclear
power plants.
 &HT;    For years the Y2K bug sat quietly, remembered largely as an
amusing textbook example of poor software design.
 &HT;    But as 2000 drew near, the screwup became less amusing. In
November 1996, the ``comp.software.year-2000'' newsgroup was
launched, creating an on-line forum that would soon become ground
zero for the Y2K survivalist movement. But at first, the charter
was clear: Discussions would be limited to Y2K bug fixes,
remediation strategies and reports.
 &HT;    Over the course of the next year, information poured into the
newsgroup, and most of it was bad: The FAA was hopelessly behind
schedule in patching air-traffic-control systems; Edward Yardeni,
chief economist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Bank, laid odds that
Y2K upheaval would trigger a recession; Ed Yourdon, a respected
software guru and author of 25 computer books, predicted the
collapse of the U.S. government _ not long after he packed up and
moved to New Mexico.
 &HT;    Optimism became a scarce commodity. Philosophical questions were
raised: Do programmers have a moral duty to remain at their
keyboards until the last moments of 1999, like captains on a
sinking ship?
 &HT;    Debates raged over social Darwinism and the ownership of wheat
in grain elevators. Plans were made to begin converting equities
into gold and buying land in remote parts of California, Arizona
and Oklahoma.
 &HT;    In January 1998, 250 ``hits'' were posted to the Website
``misc.survivalism'' _ up from an average of 30 a month in late
1997. Gradually, a new acronym entered the Internet lexicon:
TEOTWAWKI, pronounced ``tee-OH-tawa-kee.'' The End of the World as
We Know It. The Internet's very own survival movement was born.
 &HT;    Scott Olmsted, a 20-year programming veteran, who lives in San
Diego, has known about the Y2K bug since the 1980s, but he never
gave it much thought until early 1997, when he received a
snail-mail flyer from Gary North, a historian and early leader in
the Y2K preparedness movement. After reading it, Olmsted remembers
feeling a vague sense of dread.
 &HT;    But as a rational guy and student of decision analysis _ the
science of logical decision making in the face of chronic
uncertainty _ he didn't jump to any conclusions. Instead, he went
online to do some research.
 &HT;    As he pored over Web sites and news clippings, Olmsted felt
himself moving through the same psychological stages endured by
people confronted with fatal illness: denial, fading into anger,
leading to a deep depression that culminates in a sense of
acceptance.
 &HT;    ``I'm still not 100 percent sure that the world's coming to an
end,'' he admits. ``But the idea that I may want to get out of town
for a while is not such a long shot. It's enough to make me want to
prepare.''
 &HT;    Olmsted has decided that the only real fix for the Y2K problem
may be to pack up and move to a patch of land 75 miles from his San
Diego home.
 &HT;    ``In the next year or so,'' he predicts, ``the most common
cocktail party chatter will be, 'What are you doing to prepare for
Y2K?' But by then, it will be too late.''
 &HT;    His Y2K retreat is in an area of sagebrush country where high
security means a few strands of barbed wire clinging to a rusty
pole. Olmsted's chain-link fence is shiny and new. The
alarm-company sign that hangs from the fence would be more at home
in Brentwood, and on the roof there's a DirecTV satellite dish
pointed toward the sky. The shed outside his back door will hold
nonperishable food.
 &HT;    Olmsted intends to celebrate New Year's Eve at his home in the
suburbs; the place in the desert will be there just in case things
get rough.
 &HT;    The hardcores believe it will happen like this: On Jan. 1 (or
shortly thereafter), the electricity grid will go dead. Groceries
in America's refrigerators will go bad. Food distribution systems
will crash and store shelves will go bare within days. Businesses
will fail, either because they aren't Y2K compliant or because they
are dependent on noncompliant customers and suppliers.
 &HT;    As losses mount and companies go under, the stock market will
plummet. Banks will calculate interest for negative 100 years. The
government will stop issuing entitlement checks to gray-haired
senior citizens when their age suddenly clicks back to -35. Panic
will set in. Police dispatch systems will be crippled, and the only
law will be the law of the jungle.
 &HT;    Desperate citizens will abandon the cities to hunt for resources
in rural areas. They'll come looking for the mad prophets _ the Y2K
survivalists _ ready to plunder their food, their heat and their
communications links.
 &HT;    Millions of Americans have already gotten a small taste of
critical system failure. When the onboard control system of the
Galaxy IV communications satellite failed on Tues., May 19, 1998,
the outage temporarily crippled U.S. pager networks, several
broadcast news operations and even credit-card verifications
systems.
 &HT;    Most of the disruptions were brief _ technicians were able to
switch to backup communications paths _ but doctors who use pagers
as a lifeline with patients and colleagues were forced to set up
camp in hospitals and offices. The failure of one satellite threw a
wrench into the mechanisms of modern life, perhaps providing a peek
at what life may be like at the dawn of the new millennium.
 &HT;    Or sooner. While the full brunt of the Y2K bug is reserved for
AD 2000, some early problems are already developing. In 1996, Visa
and MasterCard temporarily stopped issuing credit cards with an
expiration date of 2000 after credit-card verification terminals
began choking on the ``00.'' The gaffe led to customer complaints
and a lawsuit filed by a suburban Detroit grocery store against its
computer supplier, TEC America Inc.
 &HT;    Since then, most verification systems have been upgraded, but
Y2K is making its presence known in other areas. The Information
Technology Association of America released a survey last March
showing 44 percent of the U.S. companies they polled have already
experienced Y2K failures. Ninety-four percent of the respondents
termed Y2K a ``crisis.''
 &HT;    The GartnerGroup estimates that 180 billion lines of code need
to be examined and that 20 to 30 percent of all firms worldwide
have not yet started preparing for Y2K. Many of these are expected
to suffer significant failures.
 &HT;    In a series of studies issued over the last year, Gartner
surveyed 15,000 companies in 87 countries to assess their Y2K
readiness. The results weren't encouraging. Small companies rated
lowest _ for most, winning over new customers has taken priority
over the Y2K problem. But midsize and large companies are lagging
too. Gartner then rated the overall Y2K efforts of industrialized
nations on a scale of zero to five, where five is total compliance
on all systems.
 &HT;    The highest scorers on the scale, including the United States,
Canada and Australia, rated somewhere between two and three _ a
score that suggests they have completed an inventory of Y2K
vulnerabilities, but not yet developed a comprehensive remediation
plan.
 &HT;    The United States may be at the front of the pack in the Y2K
race, but that's small comfort to some legislators. Last March, the
House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and
Technology warned that 37 percent of the critical systems used by
federal agencies will not be ready in time. Then in June,
California Republican Stephen Horn, who heads the subcommittee,
issued a scathing report card on the Clinton administration's Y2K
progress. He gave the government an F.
 &HT;    John Koskinen, head of the president's Year 2000 Conversion
Council, complains that Horn is just a tough grader. ``As a
government, we're in a C+ to B range,'' he argues.
 &HT;    Koskinen keeps a digital desktop clock that runs backward _ on
the day we spoke, the clock showed 609 days, 8 hours, 39 minutes,
16 seconds, and counting _ but he generally refrains from calling
the situation a crisis. Instead, he describes it as a ``critical
management challenge.''
 &HT;    He fully expects the federal government's critical systems to be
ready on time, or even early. ``Many companies, financial
institutions and federal agencies are still working on the
problem,'' he says. ``But most major organizations plan to have
their solutions in place by the first quarter of next year.''
 &HT;    If the council is successful, Koskinen believes, Americans will
confront little more than a few minor inconveniences when the year
2000 finally rolls around. ``There's not enough information right
now to indicate that stocking up on Coleman stoves and Sterno is an
appropriate response,'' he says.
 &HT;    And in the end, he predicts, ``a lot of people won't notice.''

 &HT;    Are you prepared for the greatest computer glitch in history _
the Year 2000 Bug?
 &HT;    Throughout history, prophets and visionaries have spent their
lives preparing for the end of the world.
 &HT;    But this time it is software programmers who are blazing the
millennial trail. They've have read the future, not in the Book of
Revelation, but in a few million lines of computer code.
 &HT;    By now, the source of their anxiety is well known.
 &HT;    In the 1950s and 1960s, when the computer world was young and
memory was expensive, programmers developed a convention for
marking the passage of time. It's the same system most people use
to date their checks: two digits for the day, two for the month and
two for the year. Dropping the ``19'' from the year was convenient,
and it saved two bytes of precious RAM every time it was used.
 &HT;    Those were days of innocence and optimism. Everyone knew what
would happen if this little shortcut was still in use in AD 2000 _
the two-digit year would roll over like the odometer on an old
Chevy, and the computers would think they'd jumped 100 years into
the past. Programmers knew it, and they warned their managers.
 &HT;    Not to worry, was the usual reply. When the millennium finally
rolls around, all this code will be ancient history.
 &HT;    But the code stuck around. The old software worked fine in the
post-mainframe world, so nobody felt compelled to replace it.
Instead, like Roman architects, they just built on top of it. The
two-digit year became a standard, wired right into the heart of
Cobol _ the Common Business Oriented Language that still serves as
the digital workhorse of commerce and industry. It also crept into
the embedded microchips found in everything from VCRs to nuclear
power plants.
 &HT;    For years the Y2K bug sat quietly, remembered largely as an
amusing textbook example of poor software design.
 &HT;    But as 2000 drew near, the screwup became less amusing. In
November 1996, the ``comp.software.year-2000'' newsgroup was
launched, creating an on-line forum that would soon become ground
zero for the Y2K survivalist movement. But at first, the charter
was clear: Discussions would be limited to Y2K bug fixes,
remediation strategies and reports.
 &HT;    Over the course of the next year, information poured into the
newsgroup, and most of it was bad: The FAA was hopelessly behind
schedule in patching air-traffic-control systems; Edward Yardeni,
chief economist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Bank, laid odds that
Y2K upheaval would trigger a recession; Ed Yourdon, a respected
software guru and author of 25 computer books, predicted the
collapse of the U.S. government _ not long after he packed up and
moved to New Mexico.
 &HT;    Optimism became a scarce commodity. Philosophical questions were
raised: Do programmers have a moral duty to remain at their
keyboards until the last moments of 1999, like captains on a
sinking ship?
 &HT;    Debates raged over social Darwinism and the ownership of wheat
in grain elevators. Plans were made to begin converting equities
into gold and buying land in remote parts of California, Arizona
and Oklahoma.
 &HT;    In January 1998, 250 ``hits'' were posted to the Website
``misc.survivalism'' _ up from an average of 30 a month in late
1997. Gradually, a new acronym entered the Internet lexicon:
TEOTWAWKI, pronounced ``tee-OH-tawa-kee.'' The End of the World as
We Know It. The Internet's very own survival movement was born.
 &HT;    Scott Olmsted, a 20-year programming veteran, who lives in San
Diego, has known about the Y2K bug since the 1980s, but he never
gave it much thought until early 1997, when he received a
snail-mail flyer from Gary North, a historian and early leader in
the Y2K preparedness movement. After reading it, Olmsted remembers
feeling a vague sense of dread.
 &HT;    But as a rational guy and student of decision analysis _ the
science of logical decision making in the face of chronic
uncertainty _ he didn't jump to any conclusions. Instead, he went
online to do some research.
 &HT;    As he pored over Web sites and news clippings, Olmsted felt
himself moving through the same psychological stages endured by
people confronted with fatal illness: denial, fading into anger,
leading to a deep depression that culminates in a sense of
acceptance.
 &HT;    ``I'm still not 100 percent sure that the world's coming to an
end,'' he admits. ``But the idea that I may want to get out of town
for a while is not such a long shot. It's enough to make me want to
prepare.''
 &HT;    Olmsted has decided that the only real fix for the Y2K problem
may be to pack up and move to a patch of land 75 miles from his San
Diego home.
 &HT;    ``In the next year or so,'' he predicts, ``the most common
cocktail party chatter will be, 'What are you doing to prepare for
Y2K?' But by then, it will be too late.''
 &HT;    His Y2K retreat is in an area of sagebrush country where high
security means a few strands of barbed wire clinging to a rusty
pole. Olmsted's chain-link fence is shiny and new. The
alarm-company sign that hangs from the fence would be more at home
in Brentwood, and on the roof there's a DirecTV satellite dish
pointed toward the sky. The shed outside his back door will hold
nonperishable food.
 &HT;    Olmsted intends to celebrate New Year's Eve at his home in the
suburbs; the place in the desert will be there just in case things
get rough.
 &HT;    The hardcores believe it will happen like this: On Jan. 1 (or
shortly thereafter), the electricity grid will go dead. Groceries
in America's refrigerators will go bad. Food distribution systems
will crash and store shelves will go bare within days. Businesses
will fail, either because they aren't Y2K compliant or because they
are dependent on noncompliant customers and suppliers.
 &HT;    As losses mount and companies go under, the stock market will
plummet. Banks will calculate interest for negative 100 years. The
government will stop issuing entitlement checks to gray-haired
senior citizens when their age suddenly clicks back to -35. Panic
will set in. Police dispatch systems will be crippled, and the only
law will be the law of the jungle.
 &HT;    Desperate citizens will abandon the cities to hunt for resources
in rural areas. They'll come looking for the mad prophets _ the Y2K
survivalists _ ready to plunder their food, their heat and their
communications links.
 &HT;    Millions of Americans have already gotten a small taste of
critical system failure. When the onboard control system of the
Galaxy IV communications satellite failed on Tues., May 19, 1998,
the outage temporarily crippled U.S. pager networks, several
broadcast news operations and even credit-card verifications
systems.
 &HT;    Most of the disruptions were brief _ technicians were able to
switch to backup communications paths _ but doctors who use pagers
as a lifeline with patients and colleagues were forced to set up
camp in hospitals and offices. The failure of one satellite threw a
wrench into the mechanisms of modern life, perhaps providing a peek
at what life may be like at the dawn of the new millennium.
 &HT;    Or sooner. While the full brunt of the Y2K bug is reserved for
AD 2000, some early problems are already developing. In 1996, Visa
and MasterCard temporarily stopped issuing credit cards with an
expiration date of 2000 after credit-card verification terminals
began choking on the ``00.'' The gaffe led to customer complaints
and a lawsuit filed by a suburban Detroit grocery store against its
computer supplier, TEC America Inc.
 &HT;    Since then, most verification systems have been upgraded, but
Y2K is making its presence known in other areas. The Information
Technology Association of America released a survey last March
showing 44 percent of the U.S. companies they polled have already
experienced Y2K failures. Ninety-four percent of the respondents
termed Y2K a ``crisis.''
 &HT;    The GartnerGroup estimates that 180 billion lines of code need
to be examined and that 20 to 30 percent of all firms worldwide
have not yet started preparing for Y2K. Many of these are expected
to suffer significant failures.
 &HT;    In a series of studies issued over the last year, Gartner
surveyed 15,000 companies in 87 countries to assess their Y2K
readiness. The results weren't encouraging. Small companies rated
lowest _ for most, winning over new customers has taken priority
over the Y2K problem. But midsize and large companies are lagging
too. Gartner then rated the overall Y2K efforts of industrialized
nations on a scale of zero to five, where five is total compliance
on all systems.
 &HT;    The highest scorers on the scale, including the United States,
Canada and Australia, rated somewhere between two and three _ a
score that suggests they have completed an inventory of Y2K
vulnerabilities, but not yet developed a comprehensive remediation
plan.
 &HT;    The United States may be at the front of the pack in the Y2K
race, but that's small comfort to some legislators. Last March, the
House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and
Technology warned that 37 percent of the critical systems used by
federal agencies will not be ready in time. Then in June,
California Republican Stephen Horn, who heads the subcommittee,
issued a scathing report card on the Clinton administration's Y2K
progress. He gave the government an F.
 &HT;    John Koskinen, head of the president's Year 2000 Conversion
Council, complains that Horn is just a tough grader. ``As a
government, we're in a C+ to B range,'' he argues.
 &HT;    Koskinen keeps a digital desktop clock that runs backward _ on
the day we spoke, the clock showed 609 days, 8 hours, 39 minutes,
16 seconds, and counting _ but he generally refrains from calling
the situation a crisis. Instead, he describes it as a ``critical
management challenge.''
 &HT;    He fully expects the federal government's critical systems to be
ready on time, or even early. ``Many companies, financial
institutions and federal agencies are still working on the
problem,'' he says. ``But most major organizations plan to have
their solutions in place by the first quarter of next year.''
 &HT;    If the council is successful, Koskinen believes, Americans will
confront little more than a few minor inconveniences when the year
2000 finally rolls around. ``There's not enough information right
now to indicate that stocking up on Coleman stoves and Sterno is an
appropriate response,'' he says.
 &HT;    And in the end, he predicts, ``a lot of people won't notice.''

 NOTE: Full-length article (2,300 words) available on request  
 &HT;    Hollywood and Las Vegas have a lot in common. Both towns _ twin
oases in different deserts _ feed greedily on our collective dreams
and desires.
 &HT;    The strongest connection between the two places is that neither
really cares much about history, but both are loaded with
mythology.
 &HT;    The biggest difference between them is that in LA, when the
movies are done shooting, the sets come down. The sets where Las
Vegas dreams _ the casinos and theme hotels _ have to last for
years and years.
 &HT;    Now the biggest long-duration set of them all is under
construction on 63 acres of prime real estate in the middle of the
Las Vegas Strip. In one gigantic engineering feat, this ``set of
the century'' will culminate in a hotel-casino complex called The
Venetian. Among other things, it conjures D. W. Griffith building a
massive Babylonian temple in Hollywood for his film
``Intolerance.''
 &HT;    This Renaissance Venice is on the exact site of the old Sands
Hotel, where Dino, Frank, Sammy and the other Rat Pack boys whooped
it up at least a thousand years ago.
 &HT;    The price tag for this bit of old-world charm is about $2.5
billion and, as its promoters never tire of saying, when it's
finished it will be the biggest resort of its kind in the world.
 &HT;    The Venetian will, of course, sport canals. More than a quarter
mile of them, including 650 feet of outdoor waterways that will run
parallel to the Strip. The canals won't go through the casino, but
will slide gracefully through the 800,000-square-foot enclosed
shopping complex _ built to mirror Piazza San Marco and,
conveniently, house 150 upscale shops and restaurants.
 &HT;    Phase I of The Venetian _ the area with a replica of Saint
Mark's Square at its center _ broke ground on April 14, 1997, and
is expected to open in the spring of 1999. Phase II, The Lido, a
``beach resort'' containing a marina, then begins construction.
When both phases have been completed, their hotels alone will
contain more than 6,000 rooms.
 &HT;    The Mirage and Treasure Island hotels across the street already
look less like big-time resorts and more like Disneyland rides.
 &HT;    When Bovis, principal construction manager for The Venetian,
poured the foundation of Phase I, it was the largest continuous
concrete pour in U.S. history. To be precise, Bovis used 300
workers and 125 trucks to pour 20,600 cubic yards of concrete in 30
hours, creating a 68,000-square-foot foundation slab 8 feet deep.
 &HT;    According to Kurt Ouchida, publicist for The Venetian, Bovis
could have poured more concrete that day, but it would have meant
shutting down all construction in LA for a weekend.
 &HT;    The Vegas Venice will offer the greatest hits: the Doges'
Palace, the Campanile tower, the Rialto Bridge and Bridge of Sighs,
the Contarini Palace and Saint Mark's Square, sited like a
Renaissance rummage sale.
 &HT;    But then Vegas has pretty much always epitomized a certain kind
of hospitality, the malleable kind. The fantasies here are generic,
populist, with the promise of extravagance. This is the home of the
water feature, the deluxe discount, the Ideal Guest Experience, in
addition to being the home of the evanescent lucky streak.
 &HT;    Even the dusty, pre-theme-hotel Vegas (talk about ancient
history) had it, this quality and enticement of the extraordinary.
The saloons and bordellos were like something out of a John Ford
western: functional and minimal and alluring.
 &HT;    What could be more dreamlike, right here, right now, than
bringing Venice, a city of water, to the middle of the American
desert?
 &HT;    When The Venetian is finished, besides the surreal ribbon of
canals and the humming craft (gondoliers plying poles for show
while serenading their customers), the first thing you'll see is
the looming Campanile tower _ 315 feet tall. You'll also espy the
Doges' Palace, serving as a grand entrance to the
116,000-square-foot casino. The tower will lead to the Palace via
the Rialto Bridge. The bridge will feature a people mover on which
tourists will glide into the Saint Mark's shopping area.
 &HT;    A company called Treadway is in charge of the multitude of
planned statuary and ornately carved cornices and moldings and
friezes. Venice is a city that is lousy with marble, but The
Venetian will not be, except for floors in places like the Doges'
Palace. (In a city of illusions, the Vegas crew scored big here:
They're getting their stone from the quarry that supplied it for
the original palace.)
 &HT;    Most of the ``marble'' will be made of polyurethane foams,
expanded polystyrene, and sign foam (aka polyiso foam) _ the same
materials used to carve large structures on many movie sets _ then
hand-painted with marble texturing. Some of the sculptures will be
made from glass-fiber-reinforced concrete. It's a strong material,
and Treadway has developed a formula that looks remarkably like
marble.
 &HT;    Despite all the synthetic materials and techniques (including a
computer-driven cutter that roughs out giant foam sculpture blocks
for Treadway's artists), much of the fabrication is like that of a
Renaissance workshop, and concrete pieces are cast using a process
similar to the one artists have used for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    So can we expect Elvis in wrap-around shades and Cesare Borgia's
cardinal's robes, waving to us from the Doges' Palace?
 &HT;    Well, wasn't Venice the Vegas of its day, full of overblown and
sexy distractions, warring families, political and power factions?
Is the Venice of the Renaissance really all that different from the
Vegas of Bugsy Siegel, $2 shrimp cocktails and nude ice-skating
spectaculars?
 &HT;    Consider the famous Campanile tower: While it's a lovely thing,
and the subject of high praise by many critics, including John
Ruskin in his exalted book `The Stones of Venice,'' the one now
standing in Venice isn't even the real tower. The original one
collapsed in 1902, and a new tower was built in 1912. A
reproduction.
 &HT;    Consider also Saint Mark in the Vegas pantheon. He's the patron
saint of the actual city. He rates a major square and a cathedral
in his name. But Mark isn't Venice's first patron saint. That was
Theodore, a warrior saint, and defender of the Venetian city-state.
But Saint Mark had a better spin than Theodore, and in the year
828, when a couple of plucky merchants smuggled Mark's remains from
Alexandria back to Venice, Saint Theodore was out of luck.
 &HT;    It's not hard to see Theodore as the spiritual version of Bugsy
Siegel in this little tale. Both were early supporters and
protectors of their cities, both were warriors and both, after
their deaths, were swept under the carpet of convenient history.
Saint Theodore fared a little better. His statue, standing atop a
crocodile, is situated across from Mark's winged lion on the Piazza
San Marco.
 &HT;    There are no memorials to Bugsy, the man who pretty much
invented the idea of the big hotels on the Strip. In fact, when it
came time to expand the Flamingo in 1993 _ the hotel Bugsy helped
finance and build _ the new owners bulldozed Bugsy's special
bulletproof bungalow-office and tossed the remains out with the
trash.
 &HT;    What's especially striking about The Venetian, in the context of
Vegas' current building boom (according to the Las Vegas Sun, as of
July 1997, there were 15,000 new hotel rooms under construction),
is that it's the best and brightest example of the city's latest
romance _ with the past.
 &HT;    For sure, if Venice isn't to your taste, you can try another
city-themed complex, Bellagio _ or Paris (Paris) or Burma (the
Mandalay Bay) _ built to re-create its past glory. But it should go
without saying that none of the new resorts is about re-creating
the past, The Venetian least of all.
 &HT;    These hotels, really vast self-contained entertainment
arcologies, are Big Gulp Super-Size Monuments that are _ surprise!
_ really about Vegas itself, and the Swell Future to Come.
Capitalism triumphant. Boundless optimism. Sex and youth and
vitality forever and getting rich quick. As long as there's sun and
land to expand into, we'll never die, never even grow old, never
end up like Europe, with its sad weight of history, collision of
languages and soon, some weird common currency that's less
convincing as money than the Jimi Hendrix chips at the Hard Rock
Casino.
 &HT;    Leave it to a Frenchman, though (Jean Baudrillard, the
postmodernist poster boy), to observe that there ``is something
stronger than sex or happiness: the passion for illusion.'' Maybe
he was passing through Vegas. It's all here, in Vegas as in
Hollywood, and in the empty spaces in between, and on the grounds
of The Venetian _ still waiting for its Renaissance sculptures
carved from expanded polystyrene and sign foam. Collapsible time,
where the past, present, and future merge into an endless,
revisable dream.

<P>
   The pivotal event in ``Beloved'' is the arrival of a
breathtaking apparition. A beautiful young woman dressed in
mourning is washed up on a riverbank, caught in a trancelike state
on the verge of drowning.
</P>
<P>
   In the most exquisitely strange moments of Jonathan Demme's
transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, this
creature seems poised at the crossroads where the supernatural and
natural worlds meet. Bugs and butterflies mysteriously herald her
arrival into the lives of the story's other characters, who have
their own kind of strangeness; they know what it means to be
haunted. They take the otherworldly in stride. Ghostly spirits
already dominate their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-present specter in ``Beloved'' is that of slavery,
which Ms. Morrison conjured with such inspired obliqueness in a
story set just after the Civil War. Much of the tale takes place in
a rough-hewn house outside Cincinnati, where the well-traveled road
outside the front door might as well lead from the past to the
future. The house belongs to an ex-slave named Sethe, and the very
fact that she has gone from plantation life to owning this place
speaks long, harrowing volumes of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Beloved'' avoids the literal and instead artfully suspends
Sethe between past horrors and the possibility of renewal. Occult
visions express her tumultuous emotions and are more welcome than
real memories anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on the most enticing yet daunting job of literary
adaptation since ``The English Patient,'' Demme succeeds uncannily
well in bringing the novel's pulse to the screen. (And at times
heightening it: those insects and butterflies are his visual
inventions, as eerily attuned to Ms. Morrison's story as the
drumbeats and a cappella voices that enhance Rachel Portman's
stirring score.)
</P>
<P>
   Though this ``Beloved'' begins slowly and sometimes reveals its
earthbound side, it accelerates into a gripping, wildly imaginative
film that's not quite like any other.
</P>
<P>
   Its lynchpin is of course Oprah Winfrey, who had the clout and
foresight to bring ``Beloved'' to the screen and has the dramatic
presence to hold it together. However fiercely she plays the role
of Sethe, she is more often a person acting than an intuitive
actress. So the film has its deliberately busy scenes, in which
sharp editing and conspicuous activity (kneading, farming) take the
place of subtler shadings. And it saves the story's worst traumas
for Lisa Gay Hamilton, who plays Sethe as a terrified younger
woman.
</P>
<P>
   But what Ms. Winfrey supplies is a sense of the deep, stubborn
strength essential to Sethe's survival. And if her Sethe seems so
level-headed that she could solve problems by talking them over
with Oprah, that actually suits the grit and tenacity of Ms.
Morrison's heroine just fine.
</P>
<P>
   In telling Sethe's story, the film faces, and largely overcomes,
great structural problems. It begins heatedly in 1865, with Sethe's
house so clearly haunted that a dog is sent flying across a room,
though the source of this turmoil is not yet known. Then, in 1873,
in a segment that unfolds more gradually than Ms. Morrison's
eloquent novel does, an old friend arrives at Sethe's door. He is
called Paul D, a slave's name, and is played sagely and warmly by
Danny Glover with a masculine tenderness that makes him instantly
welcome. Having wandered alone for nearly two decades, Paul D is
looking for someplace to roost.
</P>
<P>
   But so is the restless ghost who has plagued Sethe so much that
her home, in Ms. Morrison's words, is ``a house peopled by the
living activity of the dead.'' No sooner has Paul D reached a truce
with Denver (Kimberly Elise), Sethe's willful teen-age daughter,
than the beautiful lost soul from the river joins the household
too. As played astonishingly by Thandie Newton (who has given big
performances in little-seen films like ``Jefferson in Paris'' and
``The Journey of August King''), she is a dangerous, captivating
riddle, a creature who snores and grunts and drools but embodies
dewy perfection. She calls herself Beloved. She has the skin of a
baby. Somehow her feet are new.
</P>
<P>
   The word Beloved also appears on a gravestone that marks the
epicenter of Sethe's suffering. And it takes on a sweet, unexpected
meaning when the film is over. But with the arrival of the
near-drowned Beloved it signals only upheaval, giving the film an
edge of horror and bringing Sethe face to face with an unspeakable
past.
</P>
<P>
   These are difficult developments to translate visually, but
Demme affectingly mixes faded color with glorious bursts of light,
jarring angles with startling flashbacks, the vitality of nature
with the harshness of man, until the full weight of Sethe's memory
makes itself felt. ``You got two feet, Sethe, not four!,'' Paul D
exclaims in shock, when Sethe finally tells him about her most
dreadful deed. ``Why you have me? Why you leave me?,'' Ms. Newton's
scarifying Beloved demands of Sethe.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sethe is ready to answer those questions,
``Beloved'' has summoned the outrages of slavery in ways not quite
like any treatment of the subject before. It's in the white woman
who helps Sethe through childbirth, declaring, ``I'm good with sick
things, ain't I?'' It's in the rousing preaching of Sethe's
mother-in-law, Baby Suggs (a radiant Beah Richards), who binds the
ex-slaves together even after she becomes their most benevolent
ghost. (Baby Sugg's clarion calls to the ex-slaves make for some of
the film's most beautifully realized moments.) It's in Sethe's
remark that she never found out why her mother was hung, and in the
grotesque sexual assaults that plagued both mother and daughter.
It's in the angry way Sethe exhorts Paul D to ``feel how it feels
to be a colored woman roaming the roads with anything God made
liable to jump on you. Feel that.''
</P>
<P>
   The strange, raw force of this story makes itself felt through a
faithful yet inventive screenplay (credited to Akosua Busia,
Richard LaGravenese and Adam Brooks) and Tak Fujimoto's unusually
visceral cinematography. Production and costume design, by Kristi
Zea and Colleen Atwood respectively, express both the ex-slaves'
past deprivation and their hard-won freedom to lead everyday lives.
A group of endearingly demonstrative older actresses, among them
Carol Jean Lewis and Irma P. Hall, create a vital sense of
community by the end of the story. Like Ms. Richards' Baby Suggs,
they invest ``Beloved'' with not only the echoes of hardship but
also with the power to inspire.

<P>
   ``Beloved'' works on its own but is much enhanced by familiarity
with the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. In so ambitiously bringing
this story to the screen, Ms. Winfrey underscores a favorite,
invaluable credo: read the book. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No man is an island, nor woman either. Manhattan,
however, certainly is, and on occasion it's refreshing to look at
it from the surrounding waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the years I've lived in New York, I've perused this
glittering borough from the Staten Island ferry, the ferries to
Liberty and Ellis Islands and, of course, the standard of
sightseeing voyages _ the three-hour trip around the isle on the
Circle Line.
</P>
<P>
   This excursion, which really encourages a clock watcher to
unwind, is especially challenging when one is caring for a small
child and time is measured in pure emotion, according to the
duration of the child's irritability and happiness, rather than
increments on a clock.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days I heaved a toddler and stroller up the Circle
Line gangplank, the company has inaugurated a new Manhattan voyage
from the South Street Seaport: a brisk tour, one hour flat. On a
recent weekday afternoon, I decided to try it, this time alone. The
weather was rather wet, and although the vessel could accommodate
several hundred passengers, only about 35 were sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Most headed directly indoors on the main deck. There were
several knots of teen-agers, a few families with kids, three or
four young couples and a sprinkling of solitaries. One couple chose
to stay on the outer deck, in the rain. I had wanted to stand in
their spot, at the point of the bow, to scan the horizon with full
compass.
</P>
<P>
   But it was evident they had sought privacy, so I moved to an
indoor perch and settled down to listen to the tour guide,
positioned somewhere on the upper deck out of sight. He had a good
voice, a trained baritone: hearty, optimistic and as clear in
diction as a television announcer's.
</P>
<P>
   If you were there, the voyage would have gone something like
this. As we pull away from the pier, you notice a red-and-black
four-master, called the ``Peking.'' The guide explains it was built
in Hamburg, in 1912, as a lighthouse ship and is the last of its
kind. Oh, you want a hot dog. Well, you can't have one yet. The
attendant in the snack area has to boil them, and that will take 10
minutes. Here, have a swig of bottled water. There's no more
hydrating experience than drinking water on the water, unless it's
drinking water on the water while standing in the rain. You can't
do that because the young couple might get embarrassed. Pretend
you're standing in the rain. See how much fun you're having; that's
what imaginations are for.
</P>
<P>
   Look, there's the tree-lined esplanade of Brooklyn Heights and,
below, what used to be the bustling port of Brooklyn. No, I don't
know why there's no buttermilk in the Buttermilk Channel, unless
it's the same reason there's no butter in buttermilk. Here we are
at John Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge, 1883. Now, the Manhattan
Bridge, 1909. Why are they called suspension bridges? Because of
the cable.
</P>
<P>
   Say, did you know the East River isn't really a river but a
salt-water estuary in which the direction of flow, to or from Long
Island Sound, is determined by the tide? That's pure New York!
Buttermilk Channel without buttermilk, egg creams without eggs or
cream, an East River that isn't a river. At least Trinity Church is
a real church, although in this fog it's kind of hard to see. Let's
imagine we see it, right next to the disappearing glass tower of
I.M. Pei.
</P>
<P>
   Wow, here's Battery Park, where Lafayette landed and Sam Morse
set up the first telegraph. Battery Park City? I think that's
fronting the other river, the one that's a real river. There goes a
two-masted schooner. She takes passengers around the harbor, but
the tour guide can't remember her name.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, he thinks it may be the Mae West. No, it's the Letty
Howard. Of course he knew that all the time. What he doesn't know
is the fate of Governors Island. Will they install casinos there?
Right across from the Statue of Liberty? He doesn't think so. Hey,
check out Castles Clinton and William: walls 14 feet thick, rooftop
cannon never fired in battle, and just as well, because they're
pointing the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the towers of the World Trade Center. Have you
ever been on the elevator to the top? Fifty-seven seconds. Almost
like being shot out of a cannon. Bon voyage. Incidentally, Jenny
Lind made her United States debut at Castle Clinton. Jenny Lind:
there was a songbird who could carry a tune.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we've swung around. There's Battery Park City. The modest
octagonal structure is the new Holocaust museum. What are those
festive blue-and-yellow tents right next to it? The Cirque du
Soleil. You know, in this era of memoirs, there's a story people
should read. It was published in the 1940s by a Holocaust survivor
named Dr. Olga Lengyel. Her suffering is beyond comprehension.
Anyway, during one particularly life-denying New Year's at
Auschwitz, she tried to imagine what people in a world untouched by
disaster would be doing. Somewhere, she thought, they were drinking
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Lengyel was intensively educated and had very high style.
The best I could probably imagine might have been tourists on a
boat trip, regarding this building next to those tents. By the way,
we're now in the Hudson River, navigable all the way to the
Adirondacks. The river has its source way upstate, in Lake Tear of
the Clouds.
</P>
<P>
   If you look east toward the World Financial Center, you'll see
Henry Hudson Park _ especially beautiful at night, the tour guide
says. To the south, you can glimpse a ferry en route to Staten
Island. He recommends that ride at night, too. In fact, he seems to
recommend night rides in general. Hmm. It must get cold listening
to all this history under the constellations. I guess you provide
your own deck blanket, or improvise.
</P>
<P>
   Look, it has stopped raining. There's the old Jersey Central
terminal. And Ellis Island. You'll never see anything built like
them anymore. And here's the star of the show: the Statue of
Liberty. She stands 305 feet over the harbor, a sculpture fashioned
entirely of hammered copper, oxidized to a green patina.
</P>
<P>
   The Statue of Liberty: the one thing in New York that isn't
famous enough. Priceless. Once it had a price tag, though. To help
raise money for the pedestal alone, Emma Lazarus wrote a sonnet in
the statue's voice. Pretty good. Imagine, one little poem so highly
valued that it helped bring in enough cash to put Liberty, herself,
on her feet. That's what history says, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Great, we're back. Before we leave, let's say good-bye to the
guide and thank him. His name is Stephen Moran, and he turns out to
be a writer. Wouldn't you know? Go ahead, ask him a question. Does
he know how to steer a boat? What a crazy question. He doesn't know
port from starboard; what he does know is how to ad lib his way
from the Ninth Circle of Hell. He thinks of New York as a
university course in civilization, in all its dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, why is that other man running around the ship and yelling?
He's advertising a ride called ``The Beast,'' which takes place in
a speedboat painted to look scary, with fearsome teeth on the bow.
</P>
<P>
   He says he'll offer history, all right: exactly 30 seconds
worth. After traveling more than 50 miles an hour for 45 minutes,
that's about all the history the passengers will be able to absorb.
He says that he's the captain and that his name is Mad Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Can we take the trip? Sure. As soon as we join the circus and
get shot out of a cannon.

AT THE MOVIES: REVISITING OZ 6 DECADES LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The song ``Over the Rainbow'' was almost cut. Judy
Garland was not the studio's choice, with some executives
preferring Shirley Temple or Deanna Durbin. One director after
another _ including King Vidor and George Cukor _ was replaced. The
film itself was highly expensive, for 1939, costing $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its original problems, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ``Wizard
of Oz,'' directed by Victor Fleming, remains perhaps the most
inspired film musical ever. It is certainly the most enduring, with
a record 23 airings on network television.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of the movie's 60th anniversary, Warner
Brothers, which owns the rights, is re-releasing a restored version
around the nation at nearly 1,900 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The re-release, set for Nov. 6, will have state-of-the-art
technical improvements, including a remastered soundtrack and a
digitally restored picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've re-released any number of films _ `Giant,' `Blade
Runner,' `Wild Bunch,' `Streetcar Named Desire' _ with original
footage,'' said Barry Reardon, the distribution chief at Warner
Brothers. ``I knew the 60th anniversary of `The Wizard of Oz' was
coming up, and I thought: `Oh great, let's bring it back; there's a
whole generation of people under 25 who've never seen it in a
theater.' And a theater is the place to see the film.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, the studio held a test screening of the
restored film in a theater in the San Fernando Valley, and Reardon
called it a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers were actually coming up to thank us for re-releasing
the film,'' he said. ``How often does that happen?''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It is the quintessential American family film.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the lasting popularity of the film, which was
adapted from the classic children's novel by L. Frank Baum, is
underscored by the way Warner Brothers stores are stocking up
before the holidays on ``Wizard of Oz'' toys, trinkets, coffee mugs
and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Recently ``Wizard of Oz'' items sold unexpectedly strongly on
the QVC shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were shocked,'' Reardon said. ``They never dreamed they'd
sell this much merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Feiner, president of the optical effects division at
Pacific Title/Mirage, said the original black-and-white portions of
the film, depicting Dorothy's world in Kansas, had been destroyed
in a fire in the mid-1970s. Working with a copy of the print,
technicians spent more than nine months removing dirt and scratches
and correcting the images on computers, frame by frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim was to restore the negative to its original condition
as if it just got out of the camera,'' Feiner said. ``We did
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The film stars a 16-year-old Judy Garland (above) as well as
Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke,
Margaret Hamilton, Charley Grapewin and ``The Munchkins.'' It was
nominated for six Academy Awards and won two _ for its original
score by Herbert Stothart and for best song, ``Over the Rainbow,''
by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg.
</P>
<P>
   Though the song was cut out of several previews, Arthur Freed,
the associate producer, who later became MGM's foremost producer of
musicals, threatened to quit the project unless it remained in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The competition among films in 1939 was extraordinary. The year
is regarded as Hollywood's most glorious, and remains a sad
reminder of the current caliber of films: now it often takes an
effort to come up with five best picture choices for the Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other movies released that year were ``Gone With the
Wind,'' ``Gunga Din,'' ``Wuthering Heights,'' ``Dark Victory,'' ``
Smith Goes to Washington,'' ``Of Mice and Men,'' ``The Women,''
``Stagecoach,'' ``Love Affair,'' ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,''
``Young Lincoln,'' ``Beau Geste'' and ``Babes in Arms,'' which also
starred Judy Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen King Tale
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the release of the highly praised 1995 suspense
drama ``The Usual Suspects,'' Bryan Singer, the movie's director,
sent a copy to the novelist Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's aim was simple: He wanted to acquire the rights to a
King novella, ``Apt Pupil,'' about a perfectly normal high school
senior whose fascination with the Holocaust leads him into a
dangerous relationship with a man whom he believes to be a former
SS officer. (There was an aborted attempt to make the film in 1988
with Nicol Williamson and Rick Schroder).
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the novella when I was 19, and I knew, even back then,
that I wanted to make a movie out of it,'' said the 31-year-old
Singer (below left), who obtained the rights and whose film, ``Apt
Pupil,'' opens Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``What intrigued me most,'' he continued, ``was that this
terrible event that happened so many decades ago in Europe, this
evil, had manifested itself in this completely placid, suburban
Southern California world with this seemingly normal boy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It wasn't so much about Nazism or Fascism. It was
how people become infected with the purity of the power and the
horror of the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   King recently saw the film in New York and was pleased with it,
the director said.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Ian McKellen as the Nazi war criminal who has
been quietly living in hiding and Brad Renfro as the 16-year-old
boy at the top of his high school class who becomes fascinated with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those stories that dealt in a very intense way
with adolescent curiosity,'' Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Usual Suspects'' won two Academy Awards, for Kevin Spacey
as best supporting actor and for Christopher McQuarrie for best
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   After its unexpected success with critics, as well as at the box
office, Singer became one of the most sought-after young filmmakers
in town. He was offered huge sums to direct stars in some action
dramas, but decided to turn them down because of the poor quality
of the scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find any material that was really inspiring,''
Singer said. ``I finally realized I should go with my gut in terms
of what interests me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has hardly turned his back on big-budget studio films. He
is now getting ready to make a high-tech film for 20th Century Fox,
``X-Men,'' which is based on the Marvel comic series. To prepare,
Singer, among other directors, visited the set of ``Titanic,'' also
from Fox, and conferred with its director, James Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   The new film may cost as much as $90 million. ``It's the biggest
Fox film since `Titanic,''' Singer said delightedly.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   800-Pound Gorilla
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin was writing the script for ``The American
President'' through the night at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los
Angeles when, during breaks, he began watching ESPN's
``Sportscenter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living alone and I had `Sportscenter' on to keep me
company,'' the 37-year-old writer recalled. ``I actually wasn't an
avid sports fan, but it just seemed like a place that I'd want to
work, and I began creating this fantasy _ what was going on at ESPN
Sportscenter behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was ``Sports Night,'' a television program created by
Sorkin (above) for ABC about a late-night sports show. The show has
received strong reviews, but Sorkin is waiting to see if the
network, which has a 13-episode commitment, will opt for 9 more.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin, who also wrote the Broadway play ``A Few Good Men'' as
well as its film adaptation, has had a surprising journey to
television.
</P>
<P>
   `` `A Few Good Men' took me two years to write, and so did
`American President,''' he said. ``On television, you have a week
to write the script. You have to tell a story in 21 minutes and 15
seconds. The immediacy is wonderful. I finished a script last
night, and I start rehearsing it this morning. In movies and
theater, you write a joke and you don't hear a laugh for two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is you're tired all the time and I live every day
in complete fear that I won't be able to write the next episode,''
Sorkin continued. ``It's always on my mind. When you're finished
with a movie, there's a period of basking in what you've done. Here
there's a period of two minutes, and you have to get started on the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin is also working on a film script, ``In the Ocean of
Storms,'' about a former Apollo astronaut whose life has unraveled,
as well as the book for a Broadway musical adaptation of the Paddy
Chayefsky's script for the film ``Marty.'' The show, with a musical
score by Charles Strouse and Lee Adams, is scheduled to star Jason
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Sorkin said, `` `Sports Night' is the 800-pound gorilla
in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I wish I could work more on each script. I'll often
look at a completed show and think, `Now I know how to write it.'
But you can't take it back. You can only learn from that show and
put it back in the next.''

`PRACTICAL MAGIC': DESIGNER WITCHES IN LIGHTWEIGHT FARCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review.)  
(kd) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' has a new look for Halloween: super-cute.
It's Barbie Joins a Coven time as Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman
shake their long flossy hair and play witch sisters with
otherworldly decorative qualities. In a bouncy, bubble-brained
movie with the look of a shelter magazine, they flounce through a
domesticated story in which magic is for dealing with menfolk and
brooms look all too comfortably at home. ``C'mon, ladies, let's
clean house!'' is the battle cry in the big broom scene at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Alice Hoffman's fanciful novel and directed with
go-for-broke prettiness by Griffin Dunne, ``Practical Magic'' is
nothing but a guilty pleasure. Despite a transcendently silly story
line and a lot more froufrou touches than the traffic will bear,
it's liable to work as escapism for anyone who thinks ``Little
Women'' has too much grit.
</P>
<P>
   The stars are svelte and charming, in a hopelessly retrograde
way. (``What wouldn't I do for the right guy?'' wonders Ms. Kidman,
who has never before made herself quite this dizzy.) And they have
delightful comic support in Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing, as
the senior witches in the family, benign old sisters who depart
unexpectedly for a solstice celebration at one point in the story.
``We can't back out,'' they tell Ms. Bullock's Sally and Ms.
Kidman's Gillian. ``We're on the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   These are all members of the Owens family, and they share a
curse: men who fall in love with them have a tendency to be struck
dead. ``Boys looked at her and got so dizzy they had to be rushed
to the emergency room for a hit of oxygen or a pint of new blood,''
Ms. Hoffman wrote of Gillian, the family flirt. Sally, the
homebody, is so much more down to earth that she winds up running a
botanicals shop. ``Practical Magic'' is the kind of movie that
loves to look at all the matching bottles and hear her talk about
hand lotion.
</P>
<P>
   At first the sisters spurn their witchy heritage and reserve
their magic for little things, like putting the coffee spoon on
auto-stir. Then Gillian has an abusive boyfriend (because witches
have as many talk show issues as anyone else) and he winds up a
teeny bit dead. This causes problems, so out come the potion
recipes. Sally and Gillian do something clever with needles and
Redi-Whip, and before you can say snazzy special effects, the evil
but handsome boyfriend (Goran Visnjic) is making even more trouble.
Most magically, Sally's Mr. Right (Aidan Quinn) shows up as a
detective on the boyfriend's trail. ``Practical Magic'' is also the
kind of movie in which the detective likes cactus-shaped pancakes
and is staying in an inn that's as picture-perfect as the witches'
charming lair.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to vie for the cover of House and Garden,
``Practical Magic'' also makes vegetables look lovely whenever
vegetables appear, and throws in baby-boom chestnuts on the
soundtrack. (Stevie Nicks, doyenne of witchcraft chic, is among
those heard.) Fortunately, its leading actresses are capable of
real enchantment, enough to outshine the prefabricated kind.
``Practical Magic'' was written by Robin Swicord and Akiva Goldsman
and also by Adam Brooks, one of the writers of the ``Beloved''
screenplay. Coincidentally or not, both films culminate in
supportive rallying by groups of women who join forces to help
sisters in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
It includes violence, profanity and witchy vamping.

ANTIQUES GET EVER YOUNGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los
Angeles sets the trends.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 25, two Los Angeles auction houses will team up for the
first time to conduct a sale, ``20th-Century Decorative Arts, Fine
Art and Modern Design.'' Los Angeles Modern Auctions, which since
1992 has been conducting three sales of 1950s furniture each year,
is branching out. The house, known as Lama, will sell the fixtures
from Rebecca's Restaurant in Venice, Calif., in a joint venture
with Santa Monica Auctions, which sells mostly contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Just so you know how new an antique can be: Rebecca's closed
three weeks ago, said Peter Loughrey, the head of Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca's, a fashionable Mexican restaurant with a subaquatic
theme, opened in 1983. Frank Gehry, the Los Angeles architect who
designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, created the entire
space from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   It had an 18-foot-long cut-glass octopus chandelier in bright
red, a pair of giant black crocodile sculptures with individually
bent metal scales suspended from the ceiling, and two
nine-foot-tall cut-glass-and-silicon fish lamps that were leaping
out of the sea _ more specifically, from the rear of the custom
banquettes. It was an underwater fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was ``to create indirect, atmospheric light,'' Gehry
said at the time. ``Walking in, you see a bunch of strange objects
and forms but the important thing I was striving for was that each
element be discrete and complete, so there's no blurring. They just
stand on their own in this space.''
</P>
<P>
   In the auction catalog, Thomas Hines, a professor of history and
architecture at UCLA, writes that like Charles Rennie Mackintosh's
famous Cranston Tea Rooms in Glasgow in 1900 or Adolf Loos'
American Bar in Vienna in 1907, Gehry's Rebecca's has ``regrettably
joined the venerable company of Restaurants Departed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines suggests that Gehry's fixtures are ``unique artifacts''
that should ``somehow continue to stand on their own as survivors
of Rebecca's unfortunate demise.''
</P>
<P>
   Loughrey said several New York City dealers had expressed
interest in the Gehry pieces, despite the high presale estimates
($100,000 to $150,000 for the octopus, $80,000 to $150,000 each for
the crocodiles, and $40,000 to $50,000 for the pair of fish lamps).
</P>
<P>
   Loughrey does not find the estimates so high. In the 1980s, he
pointed out, the Fred Hoffmann Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif.,
sold limited editions of Gehry's smaller fish lamps, in glass and
translucent Formica chips, for about $40,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Hines writes in the catalog that the fish motif has always been
important to Gehry, because it reminds him of shopping for the
makings of gefilte fish with his grandmother as a child in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates for other items in the sale, not from the restaurant
but many of them designs by other world-famous architects, are more
modest. There is the brilliant red polyurethane foam prototype of
``Joe,'' a club chair in the form of a baseball mitt that the
Italian team of DePas, D'Urbino &AMP; Lomazzi designed for the
Poltronova company in Italy in 1969. This chair, eventually
manufactured with stitched leather upholstery to look more
authentic, has been a status symbol for homeowners with private
sports bars for years. The auction house's estimate is $8,000 to
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some design treasures that could probably be
unearthed only in Los Angeles. There is, for example, an original
Unit Chair by R.M. Schindler, the Austrian architect who moved to
Los Angeles in the 1930s and is now the height of fashion among
modern-design aficionados (estimate: $12,000 to $14,000).
</P>
<P>
   Schindler designed the Unit for the Elizabeth Van Patten house
he built in 1934 in the Silverlake section of Los Angeles, and he
continued to make other versions of it for two later houses. It is
an upholstered chair whose square seat has slots to allow
attachments, like a table or seat back. It looks as contemporary as
the latest beds by the French designer Philippe Starck, which have
bedside tables attached.
</P>
<P>
   The auction also includes several pieces of furniture that have
come to be considered ``les musts'' of Modernism: the Dunbar sofa
designed by Edward Wormley ($1,500 to $1,800), a wood armchair with
webbed upholstery by Jens Risom ($800 to $1,000), a pair of club
chairs with trapezoidal arms attributed to Paul T. Frankl ($1,200
to $1,500) and a George Nelson built-in storage unit from the home
of D.J. Dupree, a former president of the Herman Miller furniture
company ($2,500 to $3,000).
</P>
<P>
   Loughrey said collectors now look for modern pieces with notable
provenance: ``1950s pieces that were special-ordered for a
particular person, like the Dupree storage wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The validity of modern furniture is now firmly entrenched,''
he added. ``Modern design is not just a fad. The market for modern
has never slumped. We are still seeing record prices again and
again. We achieved a world record for a design by Charles and Ray
Eames last May 17 _ a 15-panel folding screen in wood sold for
$41,800.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe mid-century design will be recession proof, but that does
not explain its intense appeal. Loughrey, who is 30, tried to
explain his feelings. ``I grew up in Maryland with delicate
18th-century furniture and silver,'' he recalled. ``There were
rooms I wasn't ever allowed to go into as a child. Modern furniture
is to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to put it in more historical terms: ``There was a huge
boom after World War II and people had enormous optimism about the
future and the postwar world order. We have to remember this
furniture was brand new and anti-traditional. It had refreshing new
forms. This furniture is what 20th-century design is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale preview, from Monday through Oct. 24, will be at the
I.M. Chait Gallery, 9330 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills.

   Antiques in New York: What's Happening
</P>
<P>
   This is the 10th anniversary of the International Fine Art and
Antique Dealers Show, which opens Friday at the 7th Regiment
Armory, at Park Avenue and 67th Street, and runs through Thursday.
Christie's ``Arts of France'' sale is next Friday, with 176 lots.
Sotheby's has its English and Continental silver sale Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not forget what's close at hand: Manhattan has some of
the finest antiques dealers in the world. No fair or auction house
has anything more spectacular, for example, than the exceptional
pair of solid silver Italian consoles with gilt bronze decorations
now gracing the walls of Dalva Brothers, at 44 E. 57th St. Equally
spectacular is the Roentgen chest of drawers with gilded bronze
tassel pulls that Tony Victoria, the owner of Frederick Victoria &AMP;
Sons at 154 E. 55th St., is selling.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's important to pay attention to the hometown teams,
too.

   NEW MEXICO -- DOMENICI. Sen. Pete Domenici found himself in a
familiar position this week: fighting against the clock to keep the

`ALL THE RAGE': A CRUEL PECKING ORDER AMONG FLIGHTY PEACOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review.)  
(kd) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A-gays look good in the shower, so ``All the Rage'' opens with
close-ups of soaping up and rinsing, with beads of water thrilled
to be on such perfect gym-toned skin. A-gays have fabulous
kitchens, work out religiously (``Today I do chest and arms''),
have windowed offices on high floors and sneer when someone sends
roses after the first date (and to the office! with a note! that he
signed!). A-gays know who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a critical look at this subculture of affluent, urban,
meticulously groomed, self-satisfied gay men who consider
themselves on the A-list in their particular cities is a pretty
brave idea. It's easy to see how ``All the Rage,'' which is Roland
Tec's feature-film debut as director, producer, writer and
composer, could become a film festival favorite. But out in the
real world, it doesn't have much to offer beyond its concept.
Neither the performances nor the script are up to the challenge of
a meaningful social issue.
</P>
<P>
   The film is the story of Christopher Bedford (John-Michael
Lander), a very good-looking 31-year-old lawyer whose worldview is
a little shaken when he falls for a guy who would never make the
A-list. Stewart (David Vincent) is an editor (that's one strike
against him because of publishing's low pay), doesn't give much
thought to his wardrobe and, my God, doesn't even have a gym.
Larry, Christopher's friend and co-worker, actually says, ``Are you
telling me you went out with a guy who doesn't work out?''
</P>
<P>
   That line says a lot about the film's self-consciously clever,
proud-to-be-superficial characters. One scene begins with a man in
couples counseling telling the therapist: ``That's why I was mad.
It had nothing to do with the fig torte.''
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion of the pros and cons of latching onto a rich
boyfriend, the lead character announces, ``Queens who live in glass
houses shouldn't throw stones, dear.'' (A minute later he adds,
``You didn't exactly marry a pauper.'' But he pronounces the last
word very close to ``popper,'' suggesting a pretty bizarre image.)
</P>
<P>
   But when a plot point needs to be made, all the cleverness flies
out the window and earnest literalness flies in. Christopher, for
instance, sums up his character's problem, and what the film
suggests may be a culturewide shallowness, in a bedroom scene _ not
with Stewart, incidentally. ``Everybody wants me,'' he says. ``So
why should I want you?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about ``All the Rage,'' and this deserves
applause, is that it shows men casually touching, dancing, hugging,
kissing _ and not just in sexual encounters _ as naturally as
heterosexual couples on screen always have. It's a reminder of how
natural some of Tom Hanks' scenes with Antonio Banderas in
``Philadelphia'' weren't. &QL;

`THE SOULER OPPOSITE': A FINE LINE BETWEEN ANGER AND HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review.)  
(kd) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who can get past the title pun and the opening shot of
misogyny in ``The Souler Opposite'' is liable to like Bill
Kalmenson's almost film in spite of itself. Its hero, like
Kalmenson, is a stand-up comic, and his mean-spirited wisecracks
earn him a well-deserved sock in the nose early in the story. The
rest of the film is about his struggle to get involved in a real
romance and be less of a jerk. Once the sardonic character of Barry
Singer (Chrisopher Meloni) worms his way into your affections, you
may just wish him success.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Kalmenson, who is nothing if not enterprising.
He has based this story on his own experiences (including trouble
with a girlfriend who worked in Jerry Brown's 1992 presidential
campaign) and directed it with reasonably Woody Allenish aplomb. It
is being distributed by Buffalo Jump Productions, a company of
which he happens to be president and founder. And he showed up last
January in Park City, Utah, home of the Sundance, Slamdance and
other offshoot film festivals, claiming that his film was an entry
in an event called Souldance. The only entry, as a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he has also made a film that deserves to see the
light of day. Though its plotting creaks, the principal characters
are engaging: Barry himself, who is his own worst enemy, and Robert
Levin (Timothy Busfield), his romance coach and best friend. In a
film that's as much about anger as humor, both these guys remain
flabbergasted that women resist them. Janel Moloney blithely plays
Thea Douglas, an earnest person who has so little in common with
Barry that she naturally sends him head over heels. All he wants
from a woman, Barry maintains in his nightclub act, is somebody
who'll like him for who he pretends to be.
</P>
<P>
   With shades of ``Seinfeld,'' ``The Souler Opposite'' also
illustrates the ego wars of the stand-up comedy game. All he needs
to get a nightclub job, Barry is told, is to kill about 40 guys
competing for the same spot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Souler Opposite'' is rated R. It includes profanity and
sexual situations.
</P>

of 15 games since becoming coach in 1997. For a program that had

`THE POISONWOOD BIBLE': A FAMILY A HEART OF DARKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl) 
By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although ``The Poisonwood Bible'' takes place in the former
Belgian Congo and begins in 1959 and ends in the 1990s, Barbara
Kingsolver's powerful new book is actually an old-fashioned
19th-century novel, a Hawthornian tale of sin and redemption, and
the ``dark necessity'' of history.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's central character, a fiery evangelical missionary
named Nathan Price, is part Roger Chillingworth, the coldhearted,
judgmental villain of Hawthorne's ``Scarlet Letter,'' and part
Ahab, Melville's monomaniacal captain who risks his own life and
the lives of those closest to him in pursuit of his obsessive
vision.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, certainly, ``Poisonwood'' might seem to have
little in common with Ms. Kingsolver's earlier work (``The Bean
Trees,'' ``Pigs in Heaven,'' ``Animal Dreams,'' ``Homeland and
Other Stories''), fiction set for the most part in the American
South and Southwest and dealing, most memorably, with the plight of
single mothers trying to sort out their lives.
</P>
<P>
   These previous works, however, also grappled with social
injustice, with the intersection of public events with private
concerns and the competing claims of community and individual will
_ some of the very themes that animate the saga of Nathan Price and
his family and their journey into the heart of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated in alternating chapters by Nathan's wife, Orleanna, and
their four daughters, Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May, ``The
Poisonwood Bible'' begins with the arrival of the Price family in
the remote Congolese village of Kilanga _ a tiny cluster of mud
houses devoid of all the ordinary amenities of life back home in
``the easy land of ice cream cones and new Keds sneakers and  &UR; We
like Ike &LR; .'' Here, there are plagues of killer ants, hordes of
malaria-carrying mosquitoes and unseen parasites, and lions and
tarantulas and snakes _ a fearsome world of nature whose perils are
magnified by political and racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Moving fluently from one point of view to another, Ms.
Kingsolver does a nimble job of delineating the Price girls'
responses to Africa and their father's decision to uproot them. At
15, Rachel, the whiny would-be beauty queen who ``cares for naught
but appearances,'' can think only of what she misses: the five-day
deodorant pads she forgot to bring, flush toilets, machine-washed
clothes and other things, as she says with her willful gift for
malapropism, that she has taken ``for granite.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah, the feisty one, pledges herself to her father's mission in
the face of mounting opposition, while her twin, Adah, damaged
since birth and unable (or unwilling) to speak, records her
observations of her family with a shrewd poetic intelligence. As
for the youngest, 5-year old Ruth May, she brightly tries to make
sense of the exotic new world in which she finds herself, even as
she makes friends with the children of Kilanga.
</P>
<P>
   All this while their mother, Orleanna, struggles with the
hardships of daily life _ toting and disinfecting the family's
water, scrambling to make ends meet and trying to protect her
family from the myriad terrors of the bush.
</P>
<P>
   Orleanna's misgivings about her husband mount as his hubris and
utter selfishness become more and more apparent. Although the local
people are reluctant to abandon their traditional deities (and
fearful of baptizing their children in the crocodile-infested
waters of the nearby river), Nathan vows to convert them. He proves
equally oblivious to the welfare of his own family when he refuses
their entreaties to leave _ even in the face of illness and
escalating violence against whites. Indeed he will end up
sacrificing the life of one of his daughters to his self-righteous
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, of course, is meant to represent the patronizing
attitude of white colonialists toward Africa _ and the devastating
legacy of violence they bequeathed to regions like the Congo. Such
efforts by Ms. Kingsolver to turn the story of the Price family
into a social allegory can be heavy-handed at times, transforming
many of her characters into one-dimensional pawns in a starkly lit
morality play.
</P>
<P>
   Orleanna, it's clear, is a symbol of the not-so-innocent
bystander, whose own passivity keeps her from speaking up against
the crimes of others; Rachel is a symbol of the selfish pragmatist,
who puts her own desires before the needs of others; and Rachel's
lover, a white mercenary and diamond smuggler named Axelroot is a
symbol of foreign meddling in the Congo. Even the Prices' pet
parrot, Methuselah (long accustomed to living in a cage and eaten
by a wild animal once it is released), becomes a symbol of the
Congo's newly won independence _ independence that swiftly devolves
into violence under the dictatorial rule of the Cold War strongman
Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that keeps ``The Poisonwood Bible'' from
becoming overly schematic and lends the novel a fierce emotional
undertow is Ms. Kingsolver's love of detail, her eye for the small
facts of daily life: the Betty Crocker cake mixes, carefully
carried to Kilanga, that won't work in Orleanna's primitive African
kitchen; the Clorox bleach, ``measured out like the Blood of the
Lamb'' to wash the local produce; the endless bargaining the
Congolese, under Mobutu's regime, must conduct for everything from
a kidney-stone operation to a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Kingsolver endows two of her narrators, Leah
and Adah, with a sympathetic intelligence that reveals both their
girlish difficulties in coping with their family's plight and their
maturing need to make sense of the world for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In watching these two Price sisters grow up _ one will become a
doctor in America; the other, the wife of a Congolese activist
jailed for opposing Mobutu _ the reader is made to understand not
only the ways in which a father's sins are visited upon (and
expiated by) his children, but also the ways in which private lives
can be shaped and shattered by public events.
</P>
<P>
   As Leah will observe many years later, ``We've all ended up
giving up body and soul to Africa, one way or another.'' Each of
us, she adds, ``got our heart buried in six feet of African dirt;
we are all co-conspirators here.''

`EDGAR DEGAS, PHOTOGRAPHER': AN EYE FOR THE UNSEEN WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not exactly a revelation that Degas made
photographs _ his work has been exhibited so often lately that
nothing about him remains a mystery _ but I would guess that the
only picture by him familiar to many people is his double portrait
of Renoir and Mallarme.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Mallarme stands, hands in jacket pockets, gazing down at
Renoir, who sits, leaning back, smiling slightly, staring at us _
or really Renoir is staring at Degas, whose reflection we see in a
mirror. Degas is beside his camera, looking a little like a ghost
because his head is obscured by the haze of a lamp that also casts
Mallarme's profile in shadow on the wall. Two other figures appear
in the mirror, Mallarme's wife and daughter, both of them glancing
toward Renoir and Mallarme, which is to say that they appear, from
our view, to be looking at us in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? I think of Velazquez (maybe Degas did too when he took
the picture) but also about how Bonnard later turned the same sort
of unprepossessing family portraits into similarly tricky visual
conundrums. Degas, as much as anyone, exemplifies what Yeats once
called the fascination with what's difficult: his art almost always
involves a degree of convolution, one function of which was simply
to make the eerie dexterity of his results more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Photography was no exception, as we see in the exhibition now at
the Metropolitan Museum, the first devoted to Degas' photographs.
It includes nearly every photograph by him that survives, 40 of
them; and together with a few related works, they make a handsome,
solid, compact show. Like the double portrait of Mallarme and
Renoir, much of what's on view at first looks basically
straightforward, only to seem after a while complex and kind of
odd.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean compositionally odd. The oddity is more
psychological. Degas' double-exposed portraits of friends, the
Halevys, Taschereaus and Niaudets, for example, present us with
rows of heads that seem to float in the air. A picture of Louise
Halevy, as if in a trance, reclining on a sofa, eyes shut, makes
the vaporous glare of a lamp at her feet into another sort of
spooky apparition.
</P>
<P>
   And three glass-plate negatives of dancers, bright orange and
red, though they may be technical failures that Degas only stumbled
upon, are startling for making the dancers look disembodied, like
phantoms.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the photographs are dated 1895 or thereabouts.
Evidently no one really knows how many photographs Degas took
before or after that because he didn't regard photography as an
occupation worth documenting or declaring publicly. He never
exhibited his photographs. Of the ones that survive, a number were
found among his belongings after his death in 1917. Others were
probably destroyed or lost.
</P>
<P>
   I think we should be careful about what we make of these
pictures. We know he painstakingly arranged them and forced his
sitters to pose for annoyingly long periods of time, so there was
nothing haphazard or casual about the results.
</P>
<P>
   Some are a little dull; others are astonishingly, touchingly
beautiful, although their value to the history of art, which is a
different matter, probably has most of all to do with Degas'
particular approach to materials. For the period it intrigued him,
photography joined a continuum with painting and drawing and making
sculptures and prints, each medium intertwined with the others.
Some photographs recalled Degas' paintings of years earlier. Some
drawings and pastels were derived from the photographs. In other
words, Degas worked interchangeably across media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Daniel, the show's curator, writes in the preface to the
exhibition catalog that ``just as he picked up the traditional
materials of etching plate and printer's ink and produced
unprecedented monotypes, transformed the disciplined application
and soft rendering of pastel into a vibrant and physical medium,
and combined the bronze caster's wax with fabric, plaster and other
materials to shape a new colorful, textural type of sculpture,
Degas took up photography without heed to the accepted standards of
photographic practice, the established fashions of the professional
portrait studio or the esthetics of the Photo-Club artist.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd put it more simply. Good artists make the most of what a
medium can do. Great artists make the most of what a medium can't
do; they see potential in limitations. Perhaps what's most
intriguing about Degas' photographs is that Degas exploited

   Even in his self-portraits, where you might think he would be
straightforward, people and objects appear out of the darkness
around him like dreams he conjured up. Daniel mentions that Degas'
sister died in 1895. Degas' friend Evariste de Valernes was about
to die. This may partly explains the melancholic and ghostly
quality of these photographs. In the catalog, Eugenia Parry, a
Degas specialist and photographic historian, also mentions the
influence of Symbolism: ``Degas extracted from photography's exact
science a process of suggestion, and the effects, if not strictly
Symbolist, at times approached the expressive fantasy of pure
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a useful point: that photography, an emblem of the age
of positivism, a mechanical process ostensibly reflecting the world
exactly as it was, became for Degas a medium for images of a
peculiar ineffability, the pictures' ambiguity being heightened
precisely by contrast with the medium's objectivist associations.
</P>
<P>
   Did Degas also look at spirit photographs of the time? I wonder.
It happens that several of them from the mid-1890's are on view in
the Met's photography galleries. Spirit photography had been around
since the 1860's. By the end of the last century, photography was
used to serve various pseudo-scientific agendas. The notion of
photography as a technological window into the psyche was then
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It occurs to me that the X-ray was also discovered in 1895 and
immediately seen as an admixture of science and the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, this was the age of Bertillon and Lombroso,
whose theories about criminals, which they connected to physical
typologies documented in photographs, we know influenced Degas
because, among other things, he based the head of his famous
sculpture of a 14-year-old dancer on Lombroso's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what all this means with respect particularly to
Degas' photographs, but I mention spirit photography and Lombroso
and X-rays to stress a simple fact: that Degas, no matter how
infamously reactionary he may have been in his personal affairs, as
an artist he was always skeptical about convention and cognizant of
even the most bizarre new ideas. For this reason, among others, he
is the prime model of the modern artist.
</P>
<P>
   It's typical of his unorthodox and arrogant genius that as a
painter in the 1860s and '70s he had anticipated the cropped,
seemingly uncomposed quality of snapshot photography, which then,
as it were, mimicked him. Later, when he picked up a camera, he
used it to make pictures whose strange ethos is more traditionally
the province of a medium like painting.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schjeldahl once wrote about ``an awful coldness'' in
Degas, ``which is nothing less than the thin, intoxicating air on
the snowy peak of the capital A in Art.'' I know what he means,
though he shortchanges the austere humanity in some of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's true that we remain especially fascinated by Degas
because, with cool perfection, he seems constantly to reinvent one
medium after another. Even with a passing endeavor like
photography, he took nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar Degas, Photographer'' remains on view at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, through
Jan. 3, then goes to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles in
February and to the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris in May.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's revealing that the set for ``More to Love: A Big
Fat Comedy'' is a vast, cluttered garage, because the production
that unfolds around it is a big fat mess.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a play, less, even, than a memorable club date, ``More
to Love'' aspires to some strange hybrid performance genre: Call it
stand-up dramedy.
</P>
<P>
   Written by and starring Rob Bartlett, best known for his
contributions to Don Imus' radio show, this trite piece is only
entertaining (and sporadically so at that) when Bartlett drops the
dramatic charade, parks himself center stage and riffs on such
comedian-friendly topics as airline travel and fast-food joints.
For the rest, the most helpful critical judgment that can be
offered is: avert your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some examples of how dumb this concoction is. The
appealing Dana Reeve, portraying Bartlett's long-suffering wife,
with the usual assortment of sitcom gestures (hands placed on hips,
eyes rolling), is required to strip to a bustier and romance her
mate with a ``Hey, big spender'' kind of number that makes fun of
her husband's girth (sample lyric: ``It was so tough/To get
enough/Until I fell for you'').
</P>
<P>
   You want more evidence? The veteran actress Joyce Van Patten
plays an electric fuse.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that Ms. Van Patten, as Bartlett's stereotypically
obnoxious agent, Maxine, carries on a fantasy dialogue with her
client in the garage, a device that requires Ms. Van Patten to pop
out of storage bins and the like. At one point, Bartlett opens the
fuse box, and there is poor Ms. Van Patten doing the tough-dame
routine and wearing an odd little electric-fuse crown.
</P>
<P>
   Maxine is hanging around Bartlett's garage thanks to the utterly
disposable premise of ``More to Love,'' which opened last night at
the Eugene O'Neill Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, called ``Rob'' here, is in a lamentable state. Not
only does his wife make endless fat jokes at his expense (her name
is Alice, like ``The Honeymooners'' character, get it?).
</P>
<P>
   But Rob also has a problem that any of America's estimated 33.7
million working funnymen _ the show's apparent target audience _
can relate to. He's on the verge of inking a deal for his first HBO
special, and well, he just doesn't feel appreciated for the true
comic genius he is. He's turning 40; younger comics are leaving him
in the dust, and self-doubt is bearing down on his ego.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alice strolls in from the house, to hand Rob a cup of
coffee or something (good girl!) or to lecture him halfheartedly
for not cleaning the garage, designed, by the way, by no less a
scenic magician than David Gallo. (The director, to his discredit,
is Jack O'Brien.)
</P>
<P>
   Between Ms. Reeve's long, cross-stage treks, Bartlett segues
into a canned stand-up act. Some of the standard-issue material is
not bad, especially Bartlett's impressions of a flight attendant's
safety precaution mime show and of a Jordanian contestant on an
Arabic ``Wheel of Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Who talked Bartlett into this dopey
dog-and-pony show? At the end of the production, Rob learns that
the HBO deal has fallen through; there's a chance instead of going
to Broadway. ``More to Love'' certainly makes that seem like the
booby prize.
</P>

 DEALERS TO SEE HOW GLOBAL CRISIS AFFECTS ANTIQUE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ANTIQUES-COLUMN) 
(mk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last decade, exhibitors at the International
Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show have seen it all. They remember
the flush days of the late 1980s when collectors elbowed one
another to be the first through the heavy carved oak doors of the
Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, dropping several million
dollars on a chic little table or a pair of unusual chairs. But
they also remember the bleak years of the early '90s when the
crowds came but almost nobody spent.
</P>
<P>
   Just how this year's show, which opens Friday and runs through
Thursday, will be affected by the worldwide financial crisis is yet
to be seen. As usual, the offerings are broad and the booths
glamorous. A walk around the show provides a look at everything
from a $3 million Cezanne still life to a $100 delft tile and a $40
18th-century silver mustard spoon. Dealers hope the art market will
continue to rise as it did in 1987 after Black Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a client yet who says he's feeling too broke to
buy,'' said Edward Munves, owner of James Robinson, a Park Avenue
gallery specializing in antique jewelry and silver. ``People
consider buying silver or jewelry simply moving money from one kind
of asset to another. It didn't stop me from bringing good pieces
because people today would rather not buy than have lesser
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers take a less sanguine view of the market. Khalil
Rizk of Chinese Porcelain Co. in Manhattan is prepared to see a few
less sales this season. ``Volume will be down, but things that are
compelling and essential to a collector won't be passed up,'' he
said. ``There's such a shortage of great objects that connoisseurs
won't be able to resist them.''
</P>
<P>
   The walls of Rizk's booth are covered with black felt to show
off 70 watercolors of Chinese birds, which were made around 1810
for an English nobleman. They are priced at $3,800 each, and Rizk
said he hoped collectors would buy them in interesting groups
rather than one or two at a time. These are his purely decorative
offerings. The stars of his booth are an 18th-century Chinese
painting of a reclining horse, which has a $125,000 price tag, and
a seventh-century Vietnamese gold Buddha, which stands 22 inches
high and which Rizk says is one of the largest gold pieces of that
period known. It costs $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to find booths like Chinese Porcelain Co.'s
that feature both affordable items and very expensive ones. Mark
Brady, a painting and drawing dealer from Manhattan, said he
brought reasonably priced decorative objects as well as serious,
museum-quality works. Over the last several years, Brady said, he
has had a significant rise in sales to American museums. But given
the uncertainty of the market, he said he believed careful pricing
was crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't feel like spending excessive amounts of
money like they did a year ago,'' Brady said. ``They want to find
works of art that are attractively priced.''
</P>
<P>
   One such work is a haunting painting titled ``The Emperor
Napoleon's Horse, Tauris,'' which was in the collection of the
National History Museum in Paris. Priced at $38,000, it is signed
and dated B. Noriac/1908 and depicts the skeleton of a horse being
fed by his trainer, who also happens to be a skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fair seems to offer a wider range of paintings than
it has in recent years. Waring Hopkins, a Paris dealer, has a
whimsical and colorful Calder from 1974, ``The Card Players,''
which costs $50,000 and comes from a private collection in Paris.
Also arresting is a Nabis-period Bonnard, ``The Stork,'' an
oil-on-cloth painting with a brilliant red background, which costs
$960,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins just flew in from France after participating in the
Biennale des Antiquaires, Paris' big antiques event, which ended
last month. ``The biennale wasn't as lively as the Fine Art Fair
here in May,'' he said. ``But we made many sales, so I can't
complain.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the four new dealers this year, De Jonckheere, also
showed at the biennale and is no stranger to New York fairs. The
Paris gallery, which specializes in 16th- and 17th-century Flemish
and Dutch paintings, has a booth filled with paintings by masters
like Teniers, Bruegel and Cranach. One outstanding Bruegel, ``The
Return of the Country Fair'' (1620), depicts a lively village
scene. It is priced at $2 million and came from a private
collection in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The three other new dealers tried to decorate their booths with
flair, and all succeeded. Frederick Schultz, an antiquities dealer
from Manhattan, paneled his booth in a blond wood with modular
displays that feature all kinds of objects, from a fifth-century
B.C. bronze horn with a wonderful patina that costs $475,000 to an
Iberian column idol dating from 200 B.C. for $165,000. ``I'd like
to think that I present antiquities in an intriguing way to people
who never thought about them before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One booth away from Schultz is Galerie Blondeel Deroyan, another
new dealer. The cool gray space features simple, sleek clear
plastic display cases that show off a wide variety of objects,
including antiquities, tapestries, furniture and artworks.
Unforgettable are the booth's three important tapestries. The most
striking is a large French embroidered one dating from 1600 that
shows scenes of the Old Testament around the border and the New
Testament in the middle, with the four Evangelists. It is from a
private collection in northern France and costs $360,000. On a
simple pedestal in the center of the booth is an impeccably carved
figure of an Egyptian dignitary from the period of the Ramses
kings, 1315 to 1090 B.C., for $525,000.
</P>
<P>
   Galerie Blondeel Deroyan is based in Paris. So is another new
dealer, Maroun Salloum. But Salloum specializes in 19th- and
early-20th-century furniture and artworks. ``My taste isn't very
French,'' Salloum said. The walls of his small booth are paneled to
resemble an Arts and Crafts room. In the booth, a pair of early
cabinets by Adolf Loos, the Austrian architect and designer, face
each other; they are priced at $110,000 for both. Other pairs here
include 1860 plaster figures and evocative silver scones by
Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann, a leading Parisian decorator and designer
of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   If one trend is evident at the fair this season, it is a
proliferation of 1920s and '30s furniture and decorative objects.
Vallois, another French dealer, is back for its second year, with a
large booth whose walls are covered in parchment-colored undulating
paneling. Nearly all the objects _ dining tables, chairs, vanities
_ are by Ruhlmann. And an old-timer at the show, Ciancimino from
London, used to epitomize English country-house taste until recent
years when its booth and Pimlico Road shop have consistently
carried Art Deco objects. This year a pair of ebony screens by
Jean-Michel Frank flank the booth's back wall. ``We feel most of
our American decorators are going toward that look,'' Jean-Claude
Ciancimino said.
</P>
<P>
   They're also going for Russian furniture. Some of the best can
be found at the booth of another London dealer, Antoine Cheneviere,
who is showing a pair of Russian commodes by Heinrich Gambs, a
major cabinetmaker of his time. Dated 1810, the pieces are of
mahogany and ebony with gilt bronze leopardlike faces for drawer
pulls and gilt claw feet. The dealer says he has not priced them
yet.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for his predictions about the fair, given the state
of the economy, Cheneviere said: ``Some people may decide to buy
because it's another sort of investment. But at this point, it's
anyone's guess.''

NEW YORK TO PROVIDE COUNTY-BY-COUNTY `CANCER MAPS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Responding to pressure, the state Health
Department will produce before the end of the year the first
``cancer maps'' showing the rate of the disease in each New York
county.
</P>
<P>
   Despite urging from cancer-awareness and environmental groups,
the maps may not reveal which neighborhoods have the highest cancer
rates, department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the project, the first of its kind in New York, is
to geographically pinpoint every reported cancer case. Because of
concerns about patient confidentiality and the chance of
statistical error, the maps will list cancer rates and types by
county but may not indicate the existence of clusters of cancer
cases, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, we're not looking to show dots on a
street,'' spokesman Robert Hinckley said. The cancer-mapping
project will eventually produce more detailed information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Marie Williams, president of the 400-member Cancer
Awareness Coalition based in New Paltz, disparaged the idea of maps
that don't have the geographic details.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't do it by Zip Code, it doesn't mean a whole
lot,'' Williams said Wednesday. ``When you disperse the numbers
over the area, you're missing the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists contend that knowing where high rates of cancer occur
would help identify potential environmental causes that would
explain the incidence of cancer. The groups suspect landfills,
contaminated drinking water, toxic waste sites and pesticides may
cause cancer in people living nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, lawmakers have supported grassroots efforts to
determine if cancer rates are linked to their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   But because cancer mapping is such an emotional and politically
charged undertaking, the Health Department said it must proceed
carefully to ensure that its information is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The state is drawing on outside experts for help. Three
scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, and a representative from the North American Association
of Cancer Registries in Sacramento, Calif., will arrive on Oct. 29
to advise on finding the best way to create the maps, said Health
Department spokeswoman Kristin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Health Commissioner Barbara DeBuono also is convening a
15-member advisory committee of scientists, academics and activists
to guide the development of the cancer maps, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that releasing raw cancer data corresponding to
individual Zip Codes would do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so rife with inaccuracies that any conclusions you draw
would be faulty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also holding up the project is its prime source of data. New
York's cancer registry, a list of every reported case of cancer in
the state that currently contains data only through 1995. Before
the maps are created, Smith said, the Health Department wants to
include the 1996 data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been frustration with the slow pace of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the department needs to move as quickly as humanly
possible to put all these pieces of the puzzle together,'' said
Martha McNeil, a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer rates have declined in recent years, but what many
activists say is a paucity of cancer data has given added meaning
to projects like cancer mapping.
</P>
<P>
   According to the cancer registry's 1994 data, the latest
available to the public, the rate of cancer occurring in men and
women in New York was below the national average, but mortality
rates for both sexes was slightly above the U.S. average.

   I am balanced on a stepladder in my son's second-grade
classroom, staple remover in one hand, taking down a back-to-school
bulletin board and putting up a fall-themed collage of pumpkins and
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   My 7-year-old is making a Chinese dragon, busily gluing, cutting
and drawing, and I nearly fall off the ladder trying to see if it's
coming together all right.
</P>
<P>
   School volunteering is a free ticket to spy on the world your
child inhabits daily, and I'm taking full advantage of my rare
bird's-eye view.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the perks of my new gig as a stay-at-home mom.
</P>
<P>
   Since switching to a part-time job a few months ago, I've
experienced how the other half lives: I sometimes go grocery
shopping on Monday afternoons or hit the park with a picnic lunch
on Tuesdays with my toddler.
</P>
<P>
   This is quite a switch for someone who used to rarely be home in
time for dinner during the week, shopped regularly after midnight
and crammed weekends full of all other chores, social commitments
and family activities.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that there isn't a downside.
</P>
<P>
   First, 2-year-olds can be quite cranky, especially when they are
coming down with chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I'm expected to cook a lot more (never my strong suit). I
do the emergency vet trips, the waiting for service calls, the ``To
Do'' list by the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Try as I might, I can't justify dividing household chores 50-50
with my spouse anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, for someone who's easily distracted, being home is
not necessarily the best place to get work done. There's one
particular squirrel outside my office window who does kamikaze
dives from tree to tree just to make me look.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, I'm looking forward to setting the alarm,
showering, dressing up and driving in to an office where
Teletubbies, mashed bananas, tantrums and laundry are not on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I have a nagging suspicion I'm not very good at this
stay-at-home mom business yet.
</P>
<P>
   This was underscored by the unfortunate incident at Gymboree,
where Sarah slipped out and managed to pull a piece of equipment
down on her head.
</P>
<P>
   My fears of a skull fracture proved unwarranted, although she
did have a nasty black eye for a week or so. How did she get hurt
at Gymboree? friends asked me. I didn't even think that was
possible. Isn't everything padded?
</P>
<P>
   And today, while I was volunteering, I couldn't help but
straighten Adam's dragon when he brought it past me. (Even though,
I suspect, classroom volunteers are supposed to operate under the
same non-interference premise as Star Trek's Enterprise crew.)
</P>
<P>
   While I envisioned having lunch with Adam at school once a week
as a treat for him, I'm not sure it has worked out that way. I make
him eat his lunch, under threat of loss of Nintendo time.
Apparently, when I am not sitting beside him, he merely stares at
his tray for the entire half-hour, not wanting to disrupt the
symmetry of the food.
</P>
<P>
   During the worst weeks, I crave my full-time job like I used to
crave more time at home.
</P>
<P>
   But, during the best moments, when I can say yes to people who
call for help with the fund-raiser, or take the dog for a walk
before dinner, or decide to make spaghetti sauce from scratch, I
think this is the best of both worlds, and I am content.

MORISSETTE PUTS PALLADIUM AUDIENCE IN HER POCKET
</HEADLINE>
 
(Restores missing grafs 2-4) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We shoulda known.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who entertained doubts about Alanis Morissette's ability
to make compelling music after the unprecedented success of her
1995 major-label debut, ``Jagged Little Pill,'' should've squeezed
into the Hollywood Palladium on Wednesday when the Ottawa-born
singer debuted new songs from her forthcoming album.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette showed she still has the stuff _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   The anxious crowd let out a roar when the lights came down and
Morissette's newly expanded band opened with an Eastern-style
rhythm, the perfect foil for the headliner's wide, distinctive
vocal range.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be home,'' Morissette said after the second song,
later adding she was having ``flashbacks to that Dragonfly show I
did a few years ago,'' referring to the local rock dive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most memorable new songs, mostly co-written with
Morissette's co-producer, Glen Ballard, were set-opener ``Baba''; a
powerful ``Are You Still Mad,'' which kept the audience rapt; and
``Uninvited,'' from the ``City of Angels'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The crafty new single ``Thank U,'' already a radio staple, left
the crowd cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette's band, expanded with the addition of keyboardist
Deron Johnson, also boasted a new second guitarist. But the
always-reliable Nick Lashley anchored the proceedings with lashings
of sturdy rhythm and lead guitar work.
</P>
<P>
   The drummer, too, was worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette has retooled some of her best-known material,
including the petulant breakup breakthrough hit ``You Oughta Know''
and the title track of her multimillion-selling Maverick debut.
</P>
<P>
   The new disc, ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,'' is due
Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the spindly Morissette still seems somewhat awkward,
saying little between songs and making strange, jerky movements.
But it's clear that performance and composing act as some type of
therapy for her, with her primary goal being emotional honesty.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the freewheeling singer has such a vast, apparently
loyal audience that touches on nearly all demographic groups. A
song such as ``Hand in My Pocket,'' for example, can be equally
understood by a 4-year-old listening to Radio Disney and a boomer
tuned into KBIG-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Forthcoming tracks such as ``Baba'' and ``Are You Still Mad''
show the onetime child TV star has grown musically in the past two
years, during which she collaborated with Ballard at his Woodland
Hills home.
</P>
<P>
   On first listen, some of the songs have unusual structures with
subtle shifts in mood and tempo. They also have powerful dynamics
that keep the listener interested. Can't wait to hear the entire
album.
</P>
<P>
   The impression above all Wednesday was the strength of
Morissette's piercing delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Infatuation Junkie'' comes out,'' you'll know it, too.

`RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER': JUST IN TIME FOR HALLOWEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.)

   The message that the late Gene Autry conveyed in 3 minutes, 13
seconds of perennially popular song takes 90 minutes to transmit in
the pedestrian animated film that goes by the tortured title
``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushing the Christmas season by more than two months but just in
time to position itself among Halloween's tricks or treats, this
plodding though well-intended lesson in nasal tolerance may divert
very young and indiscriminating filmgoers. But any among them who
have honed their baby teeth on Disney animation cannot be faulted
for finding this ``Rudolph'' just another in a herd of animated
films that are long on yearning and short on magic.
</P>
<P>
   This candy-colored account of the travail and coming of age of
the reindeer with a difference follows a snowy storytelling trail
well marked by the details, props and characters of animated Disney
films from ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' ``Pinocchio,''
``Bambi,'' ``Cinderella'' and ``Peter Pan'' to ``The Little
Mermaid'' and ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   But imitation often lacks inspiration, and ``Rudolph,'' though
set in and around Santa's Village and populated with sprites and
elves, never achieves enchantment. Its animation lacks the subtlety
of art; the mouths of its characters remain unsynchronized with the
dialogue, and the film's new songs _ with lyrics like ``I'll bury
that old gizzard in a wizard of a blizzard'' _ rely too heavily on
simplistic rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   Produced and directed by Bill Kowalchuk, written by Michael
Aschner and with music and lyrics by Michael Lloyd and Al Kasha,
``Rudolph'' employs the voices of John Goodman as Santa Claus,
Debbie Reynolds as Mrs. Santa Claus and Whoopi Goldberg as the evil
ice queen, Stormella. Eric Idle gives voice to Slyly, the Arctic
fox, and Bob Newhart to Leonard, the lumbering polar bear, who
become poor Rudolph's sidekicks after he runs off into the frozen
wastes of the North Pole when life deals him a few too many harsh
blows.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the taunts of his schoolmates addressed to his red nose,
Rudolph, the son of Blitzen, has been banished from the Reindeer
Games that often herald a coveted future as a Flyer, one of the
reindeer that pull Santa's sleigh. And it seems as if Rudolph may
never win the hoof of the fair Zoey, the reindeer of his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Santa has assured him: ``We're all different on
the outside, son. But what counts, young buck, what really counts,
is what's inside our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph will never grasp the wisdom of such platitudes until his
character is tested. And when rotten old Stormella takes Zoey
prisoner and uses a magic icicle to conjure up a terrible storm and
lower visibility on Christmas eve, Rudolph gets a chance to light
up his life.
</P>
<P>
   But as animated films go, this one doesn't cast a lingering
glow.

ART REVIEW: RENDEZVOUS AT THE END OF A CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum may be the country's
leader in exhibition spectaculars. In a few short years it has
mounted sprawling overviews of the visual culture of the Russian
Revolution, 20th-century Italy, Africa and China, not to mention
Robert Rauschenberg, a continent unto himself.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, most of the museum's available New York real
estate is once more filled with a mind-boggling extravaganza, or
maybe two of them, depending on how you divide things up. This time
the French are involved, and the subject is modernism and its
successor, post-modernism, a fitting topic for the twilight of the
modernist century.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell: If you want to look at great art and lots of it,
head to the Guggenheim's Fifth Avenue citadel for ``Rendezvous:
Masterpieces From the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Guggenheim
Museums.'' If theory, architecture, work by promising young artists
and tolerable levels of hot air excite you, the Guggenheim Museum
Soho should be your first stop, there to fight your way through
``Premises: Invested Spaces in Visual Arts, Architecture and Design
From France, 1958-1998.'' But the shows are complementary, one
looking back, the other ahead, and both reward careful attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rendezvous'' is divine, a dream-team, all-star show of 350
works by 150 artists. It brings together the cream of two
world-class museums as well as several works from the Peggy
Guggenheim Collection in Venice and a couple from the Guggenheim
Bilbao, which seems almost too young to be owning art.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition capitalizes on the fact that the Pompidou is
closed for renovation, until Dec. 31, 1999, and amenable to lending
major works in bulk; it also takes advantage of common ground. Both
museums emerged in the middle of the century, they have emphasized
European art and are housed in initially controversial
architectural statements that are now beloved symbols of the
avant-garde: Frank Lloyd Wright's inward-turning spiral and Richard
Rogers and Renzo Piano's inside-out industrial bird cage. Their
differences include genesis: the Guggenheim was founded by a
private patron and initially emphasized non-French modernists like
Kandinsky. The Pompidou, established by the French government, was
initially intended as a repository for French art of this century
and has consciously extended far beyond its originally boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The show has been selected and beautifully installed by Lisa
Dennison, deputy director and chief curator at the Guggenheim, and
Bernard Blistene, chief curator and director of contemporary
programs at the Pompidou. The exhibition's designer, the well-known
industrial designer Andree Putman, seems simply to have tweaked the
environment _ changing lighting, adding some faintly colored walls
or a bit of scrim _ so that everything looks crisp and clean.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the bottom of the ramp with a stunning cluster of
Brancusi's distilled evocations of human and animal life, most
belonging to the Guggenheim, the show marches upward through time.
Fauvism, Cubism, Surrealism roll by, a little de Stijl and Russian
Constructivism, then the more contentious postwar period.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, unity of opinion prevails and the collections
mesh. In dazzling displays of strength, they also go head to head,
Picasso for Picasso, Braque for Braque, Gris for Gris, Klee for
Klee. Sometimes, an identical subject elicits fascinatingly
different responses. One of the exhibition's richest comparisons is
between Matisse's subtlly angular image of a sleeping woman, ``The
Dream'' (1935, from the Pompidou) and Picasso's voluptuously
curvaceous painting of an also sleeping Marie-Therese Walter of
1931, ``Woman With Yellow Hair'' (Guggenheim).
</P>
<P>
   Together the museums conjure a mini-Leger retrospective in the
first of the new tower galleries culminating in the Pompidou's
playfully majestic ``Composition With Two Parrots,'' whose buoyant
yet shadowed figures fill a wall that seems to have been built for
them. Upstairs there is a similar summation of Giacometti, a
three-way collaboration among the New York and Venice Guggenheims
and the Pompidou, followed by displays of Kandinsky, Max Ernst and
Miro.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also wonderful one-of-a-kind inclusions from the
Pompidou that provide new angles on familiar careers: a rare
collage of an avuncular but sinister head by George Grosz that
seems to be the point of origin for the ``Monty Python'' television
graphics; Dali's ``Spectral Cow,'' a brilliant little Surrealist
landscape that catalogs the artist's superfine rendering skills; an
early relief by Jean Arp made of driftwood that adds folk-art charm
to his innate playfulness, and a black ceramic sculpture by Lucio
Fontana that suggests a piece of outer space violently compressed
into a rough cube.
</P>
<P>
   The shape-shifting Picabia puts in multiple appearances with his
gigantic Cubist machine, ``Udnie'' of 1913, behind the Legers, and
his cacophonous ``Cacodylic Eye,'' of 1921, covered with witticisms
by the artist and his friends to form an early, intimate instance
of graffiti art.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning the Guggenheim and the Pompidou agree to such
an extent that they complete each other's sentences, one owning
studies separated at birth from finished works in the other's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim's Duchamp drawing ``The Chess Players'' is the
precedent for the Pompidou's tender little canvas of the same name,
a work that glows with an un-Duchampian love of painting while also
presaging the atmospheric transparencies of ``The Large Glass.''

 NEW YORK: Large Glass.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are moments of striking contrasts: furniture and design
objects from the 1930s to the '50s from the Pompidou are grouped
with appropriate paintings from the Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   A lovely selection of Surrealist photographs from the French
museum, most using only inanimate objects, answer Joseph Cornell's
like-minded boxes. A Guggenheim triptych by Francis Bacon is
grouped with two drawings by Antonin Artaud and a 1965 painting by
Georg Baselitz, from the Pompidou, forming a surprising diagram.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II the competing masterworks are replaced by
more pointed French-American face-offs between artists: Pollock and
Masson; Roberto Matta and Gorky; Ellsworth Kelly and Francois
Morellet; Alain Jacquet and Andy Warhol; John Chamberlain and
Cesar, Brice Marden and Daniel Buren (although some of the Pollocks
are the Pompidou's).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's hard not to take sides. No amount of cajoling is
going to make me think Hans Hartung is as good or even very related
to Franz Kline. But he's definitely interesting as an inadvertent
precursor to some of the self-conscious post-modern painting that's
developed over the last two decades, like Jonathan Lasker's.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition's final gallery, the two museums are brought
back into alignment again by their shared enthusiasm for
Post-Minimalism and Arte Povera, and an increasingly international
art scene. The proceedings end with Joseph Beuys' haunting,
elephantine felt-covered grand piano, a fitting coda to Brancusi's
sleekly abbreviated creatures at the show's start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premises,'' at the Guggenheim Museum Soho, is the perfect foil
for the relatively smooth progression of ``Rendezvous.'' It fills
all the museum's downtown branch, including newly opened if not
exactly renovated basement galleries that add 8,000 square feet to
the 23,000 already in use. The artworks fight among themselves and
sometimes contradict the conversation uptown.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of the show's early galleries, not yet open, is
dedicated to the Situationist International, whose heyday, the late
1950s and '60s, falls easily within the purview of ``Rendezvous.''
But the loosely affiliated S.I. artists only occasionally made
artworks, much less masterpieces _ a concept they detested _ and
tended to argue that a drifting stroll (or derive) through the
streets of Paris, if attentively experienced, could be art.
</P>
<P>
   Also here is Daniel Spoerri's ``Room No. 13 of the Hotel
Carcassonne, Rue Mouffetard, 1959-1964,'' a recent re-creation of a
piece based on the modest art-filled room where the artist spent
the early years of his career. These works suggest that the easy
flow of modernism, so prevalent uptown, was being disrupted long
before post-modernism gleamed in any theorist's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premises'' has been organized by four Pompidou curators,
including Blistene, working with Alison Gingeras, assistant curator
at the Guggenheim. It contains mostly French art from sundry
collections and proceeds with an indisputably French accent, but it
has the contentious, often pretentious chaos of large international
shows like Documenta. Which is to say that it is noisily
multimedia, virtually devoid of painting, infused with large doses
of theory and accompanied by a catalog that it only intermittently
resembles.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the post-modernist disdain of linearity, focus or
integrity, the exhibition design, by Alain Guiheux, chief curator
of architecture at the Pompidou and an organizer of ``Premises,''
makes extensive use of translucent plastic walls that allow sounds
and sights to blend. Large installation pieces alternate with
little booths devoted to video and narrow galleries that present
slices of the history of French architecture since World War II
using slide projections, films and architectural models that are
among the show's most beautiful objects.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely informative and sometimes frightening (one's sympathy
with Prince Charles' view of modern architecture may grow), the
architecture galleries form a virtual show within the show while
also lending the larger event a semblance of coherence that it
otherwise lacks.
</P>
<P>
   The art itself tends to swerve between morbid sentimentality
(Annette Messager and Louise Bourgeois) and excessive cerebrality
(Alain Sechas and also Sarkis, whose cabinet-of-curiosities
photographs would do just fine without their over-designed
environment). There are a few notable exceptions, mostly among
works from the 1970s like Christian Boltankski's harrowing
three-minute video, ``Coughing Man,'' and among the younger
generation, especially Pierre Huyghe's video installation
``Dubbing'' and Thomas Hirschhorn's elaborately handmade
anticapitalist installation whose roiling organic energy and
bristling forms (not unlike Jason Rhodes') seem to have pushed
through the front window of the museum's bookstore and onto
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It is strange to come away from an exhibition of French art
thinking that the best of it is mostly French architecture. But if
one leaves ``Premises'' more dazed than visually inspired, there is
also the inkling that the post-modern faith in scattered
simultaneity and information overload is as much an illusion as
modernism's tidy linearity. Perhaps it will also be as fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rendezvous: Masterpieces from the Centre Georges Pompidou and
the Guggenheim Museum'' is at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum,
1071 Fifth Ave., at 89th Street, through Jan. 24. ``Premises:
Invested Spaces in Arts, Architecture and Design From France,
1958-1998'' is at the Guggenheim Museum Soho, 575 Broadway, at
Prince Street, through Jan. 10.

DAYDREAMS AND NIGHTMARES IN PBS' DARK `WUTHERING HEIGHTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Wyler's 1939 film version of ``Wuthering Heights''
stopped midway through Emily Bronte's novel, and a new, fuller
rendering on ``Masterpiece Theatre'' tends to legitimize the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie problem. The last patch of this latest ``Wuthering
Heights'' (Sunday on PBS) sputters and dwindles as Heathcliff
(Robert Cavanah) completes his torment over the death of Cathy
(Orla Brady). Some of the twists are also apt to confuse viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to warn anyone away from Sunday's edgy, genuinely
disturbing adaptation of the 1847 classic.
</P>
<P>
   Produced for London Weekend Television, this version takes a
deep breath and rushes at you with a sort of gothic gust until it
eventually stalls. You'll go to bed Sunday night knowing you
haven't spent your evening watching electronic wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said for ``A Will of Their Own'' (Sunday and
Monday on NBC), a multigenerational potboiler that purports to do
for American women what ``Roots'' did for black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Will of Their Own'' is a tedious, didactic and sloppy
miniseries that exposes its star, Lea Thompson (``Caroline in the
City''), as a dramatic incompetent. Did I mention that it's a bad
TV show?
</P>
<P>
   Back to the moors. Introducing the one-parter, Russell Baker
observes that Bronte's novel ``often feels like the work of a
lonely young woman, mingling daydreams with nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have added that ``wuthering'' was a colloquialism
referring to the roar of a storm. Against the backdrop of a windy,
craggy landscape, the movie is a wild ride atop wuthering passions,
with love and hate in dangerous juxtaposition.
</P>
<P>
   You know the story. Liverpool urchin, Heathcliff, is adopted
into a rural family and forms a soul-mate attachment to his
``sister,'' Cathy.
</P>
<P>
   When they mature to adulthood, she confides to a servant that
she loves Heathcliff, but it would be degrading to marry him.
Instead she marries the refined Edgar Linton (Crispin
Bonham-Carter), setting up a whirlwind of obsession, revenge,
madness and death.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanah's Heathcliff is more astringent than Laurence Olivier's
because the new film's continuation of the story gives us
Heathcliff at his darkest. But it's a pungent, no-holds-barred
performance, in which Heathcliff's explosive emotions are sad,
sinister and vibrantly alive.
</P>
<P>
   Working from Neil McKay's script, director David Skynner conveys
a sense of wild animalism in the bond between Heathcliff and Cathy,
from their childhood romps on the moor to his pursuit of her,
literally, into the grave. It's as scary as it is romantic; it's
definitely a workout.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``A Will of Their Own,'' the miniseries has a hurried,
unfinished and cheapening veneer despite its pedigree. It's
produced by David Wolper (``Roots'') with his son Mark, and
scripted by a previous Peabody Award winner, Susan Nanus.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to examine the changing status of women in American
society from the 1890s to the 1980s through six female generations
of one fictional family. The idea is also to counterprogram the
World Series on Fox, because, presumably, male viewers are pounding
beer and watching baseball. It's network-think.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Will of Their Own'' is almost as subtle as a body slam. It
begins shipboard, with an Irish woman on her way to a new life in
America, giving an heirloom mirror to her daughter and saying, ``My
flame belongs to you now, lovey. Here, don't ever lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what happens in the next scene? Right, mom suffers a
serious head boink on the ship, and she's dead. Just as there's no
stray dialogue, there are no small, character-forming scenes. Every
action is portentous, every word is part of a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson comes along quickly as the third generation and the
focus of the program. She's Amanda Steward _ rebel, feminist,
nurse, famous photojournalist, mother, grandmother and, more than
once, selfish tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   It's an awful performance. Thompson might have some knack for
light comedy, but it obviously doesn't extend to heavy lifting.
She's all wide eyes, dimples and contortions. In a role that
demands much, she's got practically nothing to give.
</P>
<P>
   Using its characters like cardboard cutouts, ``A Will of Their
Own'' marches superficially through suffrage and suffering _ rape,
abortion, financial exploitation, legal discrimination, wife
beating and plain male piggishness.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Burstyn is on hand as Amanda's decidedly unliberated
paternal grandmother (``Head up, back straight, a woman glides when
she moves''). Faye Dunaway contributes one overcooked scene as
birth-control advocate Margaret Sanger. Sonia Braga also has one
scene as an actual personage, migrant farmworker organizer Jessie
Lopez de la Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   The men stir most of the misery in the miniseries. Thomas Gibson
(``Dharma &AMP; Greg'') leads the way as the love of Amanda's life, who
fails to tell her he's married. Unlike most men in the miniseries,
though, he has a chance _ I'll leave it at that _ to redeem
himself.
</P>
<P>
   There's the germ of a powerful miniseries here. It just seems
there's not enough money, not enough care, not enough time, not
enough something. Certainly not enough raw talent in the lead role.
But it's a botched chance to do something right with a theme that's
a TV natural.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say sloppy? How about a switch in camera shot where Gibson
keeps talking though his mouth is closed? How about a character
whose Army cap is tucked into his epaulet in one camera angle but
not another?
</P>
<P>
   ``A Will of Their Own'' is five hours of wuthering
worthlessness.

`REACH THE ROCK:' SOLVING ROMANTIC PROBLEMS BY GETTING TO JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(kd) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a young man like Robin to do? His old girlfriend, the
beautiful daughter of the richest man in town, is leaving the next
day for a new life in New York. Robin (Alessandro Nivola), it
seems, is stuck in this small Illinois town, where he grew up. Now
he finds himself, late at night, standing in the unnatural,
deserted quiet of the town's main street. Calmly he pulls down the
American flag and uses the flagpole to break the window of the
hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally this lands him in jail, but that turns out to have
been his plan. ``Reach the Rock,'' an intriguing but slightly
off-balance film written by John Hughes and directed by his
29-year-old protege, William Ryan, is the story of Robin's unusual
night behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   The police sergeant, Quinn (William Sadler), never liked Robin
and has liked him even less since the night Quinn's nephew drowned.
Quinn blames Robin, who was with the nephew at the time. This is
the serious underpinning to a nicely structured plot that is
largely played for laughs until the final scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The evening consists of Robin breaking out of his cell more than
once and sneaking out of the police station to wreak more havoc and
generally annoy Quinn. Throughout the night, Quinn's deputy, Ernie
(Bruce Norris), tries desperately to steal some time to make love
to his girlfriend, Donna (Karen Sillas). This is a running joke
that quickly wears thin.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Robin gets his wish: to have Lise (Brooke Langton),
the old girlfriend, come to the police station to bail him out.
It's the only way he can think of to get her to the station. But
when she arrives, looking effortlessly perfect, she points out to
him that since they broke up, she has gone to college, graduated,
fallen in love a few times and, in essence, moved on. Why, she
suggests, doesn't he do the same? They eventually have a sultry
romantic scene in his cell, and Robin makes a decision about his
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reach the Rock'' seems like the dark side of Hughes' earlier
films like ``Pretty in Pink'' and ``Sixteen Candles,'' reflecting
the realization that dating the prom queen (or being her) isn't the
solution to youth's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a small-town quietness of its own, and the low
rumble of thunder, threatening and promising rain throughout the
night, has the desired symbolic effect. But the film doesn't trust
its audience to feel that and makes things much too obvious by
having Ernie say: ``We need the rain. People get uncomfortable
waiting too long for something to happen.'' Finally, a hard rain
falls on the town, pouring down on the empty Tastee Freez, a
powerful small-town symbol on its own.

   Tony Questions Get Early Start
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is eight more months until the Tony Awards, but a
few curious questions have already surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   First is how to classify ``Swan Lake,'' Matthew Bourne's
testosterone-driven take on the dance classic: Is it a new musical
or merely a ballet on Broadway? And what about the revamped
``Scarlet Pimpernel''? Will it be eligible for best new musical, or
best revival, which would have a sweet double meaning if the
rewrite boosts ticket sales?
</P>
<P>
   ``Swan Lake'' producers have begun lobbying, this week inviting
some 1,500 Tony voters to the show. Producers are also likely to
ask the American Theater Wing, which administers the awards, to
consider the show for either best musical or a special achievement
award.
</P>
<P>
   At ``Pimpernel,'' producers said they would also pursue Tony
recognition, but probably as a revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were nominated for best musical last year, so that would
probably be out,'' said Tim Hawkins, the executive producer. ``But
this is such an unprecedented situation that I hope that it would
be a dialogue rather than us making requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Fool Moon,'' the Bill Irwin-David Shiner clown
comedy, which is being restaged next month at the Brooks Atkinson
Theater. Its strained relationship with the awards dates from its
original staging in 1993, when the producer James Freydberg asked
Tony administrators to consider the show for a special award,
maintaining that it was neither a play nor a musical.
</P>
<P>
   The administrators declined. But Freydberg says he will try for
a special award again this time. ``You can't get unless you ask,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Somlyo, the president of the American Theater Wing, said
that final decisions on eligibility lay with the awards' 24-member
administrative committee, which will consider the questions by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's going to be something that raises some
questions,'' Somlyo said. ``This year, it's just happening
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Awards for Design
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One awards ceremony attracting little controversy _
and little recognition _ are the Maharams.
</P>
<P>
   The what, you ask? The Maharams, the original name for what are
now blandly called the American Theater Wing Design Awards, are in
their 34th year and were named for Joseph Maharam, a supplier of
fabric for shows. The awards, voted on by a panel of critics, honor
work in scenic design, costumes, lighting and ``unusual effects.''
This year's winners were announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the awards unique is that nominees are selected from
Broadway, off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway shows and that each
category can have as many nominees as voters please. (The Tonys
allow a maximum of four nominees.)
</P>
<P>
   The wide-open field makes for some delicious David versus
Goliath races. In lighting design, for example, Andrew Hill, a
designer for ``Symphonie Fantastique,'' competed against Donald
Holder, a Tony winner for ``The Lion King.'' There were 11 other
nominees. The winners were Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer of
``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Underdogs fared badly. Other winners were Eugene Lee for scenic
design (``Ragtime'') and Julie Taymor for costumes (``Lion King'').
Ms. Taymor and Michael Curry also won for noteworthy effects.
</P>
<P>
   No Chain Saw Now
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's just about matinee time on a Wednesday, and
Christian Slater is standing in a dirty white tuxedo, holding a
chain saw and flashing his trademark smirk at a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' said Slater later, taking a break from the photo shoot
for an upcoming film. ``You just don't get this type of experience
in theater.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 18 years since Slater last appeared on a Broadway
stage, in the musical ``Copperfield.'' In that time the 29-year-old
actor has appeared in more than 30 films, playing a wide variety of
rebels, outsiders and, yes, chain saw-wielding socialites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is taking over as Clifford, the narrator of ``Side
Man,'' Warren Leight's drama about a son and his jazz-obsessed
father, which starts on Tuesday at the John Golden Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said he identified with the role. ``My father was an
actor and my mother was in casting, so I kind of have a feel for
this,'' he said. ``Clifford's this young guy who's just trying to
establish his own identity. I can relate.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiet Side of `Christi'
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid the din of protesters and supporters at Tuesday
night's opening of ``Corpus Christi,'' there were a few less
strident moments.
</P>
<P>
   At ``a quiet walk for the First Amendment,'' for example,
chatter was infectious. ``You get a bunch of actors together and
all they're going to do is talk, talk, talk,'' said Gareth Saxe, a
graduate acting student. ``I was studying lines for a while but
felt like I was being antisocial.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the street, where protesters prayed, George
Gordon, a part-time producer, was passing out fliers for ``The
Jeweler's Shop,'' described as ``a love story with family values.''
The play's author is Pope John Paul II, a former actor and
director, who wrote the script in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just offering an alternative,'' Gordon said. ``And this is
a good crowd to give it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ It could be a very Merry Christmas for the Donmar Warehouse.
The London-based theater will have two Broadway openings this
December. The first is ``Electra,'' a co-production with the
McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., due to open at the Barrymore
Theater on Dec. 3. Then, on Dec. 13, David Hare's ``Blue Room,''
starring Nicole Kidman, will open at the Cort Theater, fresh off a
sold-out run in London.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 1999 ``Encores!'' season at City Center will offer the
1937 musical ``Babes in Arms,'' by Rodgers and Hart, running Feb.
11 to 14; ``The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936,'' with lyrics by
Gershwin, on March 25 to 28, and ``Do Re Mi'' (1960), with lyrics
by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Jule Styne, from May
6 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the brave few who haven't had enough of the presidential
scandal, New Dramatists is offering a reading of the complete
testimony of Monica Lewinsky on Wednesday. Information: (212)
757-6960.

NEW YORK CITIZENS PAY MORE TO FEDS THAN THEY GET BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York is among the top 10 ``loser'' states where
residents pay more in federal taxes than they get back in federal
spending, according to a new Harvard University study.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows New Yorkers paying $785 more per capita in
federal taxes in fiscal 1997 then they got back in federal programs
such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who has for 22 years
released studies of the so-called ``balance of payments'' between
the states and the federal government, said New York is in ``near
desperate'' financial health and that its ``persistent balance of
payments deficit'' may be responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New York has to pay more attention to this than it has
done,'' Moynihan said in an interview after a Capitol Hill news
conference on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan added that New York's credit rating is the worst of any
state except Louisiana and that it has the third highest poverty
rate (20.5 percent) in the country. While it has the ninth highest
per-capita income ($27,119), it has the fourth highest
cost-of-living rate, making it a relatively wealthy state with a
large number of poor people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 states with the largest payments-to-benefits deficits
were mostly in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region, and they
had been on the list for six years, according to Jay H. Walder and
Herman B. Leonard, professors at Harvard University's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, who conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   Besides New York, the states were Connecticut with a $2,272
deficit, New Jersey with $1,946, Illinois with $1,688, New
Hampshire with $1,419, Nevada with $1,413, Michigan with $1,383,
Minnesota with $1,325, Delaware with $1,030 and Wisconsin with
$965.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., said, ``Clearly you don't want to be in
a situation where you're not receiving your fair share of federal
dollars.'' But he added that Michigan has a deficit largely because
three military bases, which had received federal funds, have closed
in the state in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   California had the 16th worst deficit with a per-capita loss in
fiscal 1997 of $366.
</P>
<P>
   Walder and Leonard noted that the movement of money between
Washington and the states generally leads to a redistribution of
funds from wealthier states to lower-income states.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico has consistently led the nation with the greatest per
capita balance of payments surplus. New Mexicans received $3,500
more per capita in federal programs in fiscal 1997 than they paid
in federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Other ``winner'' states receiving considerably more in federal
benefits than they contributed in federal taxes were North Dakota,
getting back $2,788 per capita, Virginia with a $2,648 per capita
surplus, West Virginia with $2,235, Mississippi with $2,234,
Arkansas with $2,019, Montana with $1,925, Hawaii with $1,788,
Maryland with $1,767 and Alaska with $1,603.

`A WILL OF THEIR OWN': A CENTURY OF WOMEN'S STRUGGLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one is yet declaring that the women's movement has achieved
all its goals, but you know it has been largely successful in
winning over mainstream America when a major network will devote a
five-hour mini-series to the cause. NBC, it's safe to say, would be
unlikely to give over two lucrative prime-time evenings to
political advocacy unless the views expressed were no longer
getting any serious argument.
</P>
<P>
   So by that standard ``A Will of Their Own,'' a melodramatic saga
chronicling several generations of American women through the 20th
century, is a testament to how effectively the movement has made
its case. Only troglodytes would blink at the movie's central
affirmations of equal rights and equal protection under the law.
</P>
<P>
   But it's equally telling that for all its political awareness,
the movie, by clothing itself mostly in the period costumes of
suffragists and '20s bohemians, isn't as bold as the women it
portrays. Though it reaches into the '80s, the movie safely
sidesteps unresolved feminist issues, matters like sexual
harassment, unequal pay and Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an agenda here, it's less to advance the feminist
banner than to enshrine those who fought the good fight in more
brutish times. Produced in part and written and directed by women,
the movie honors the trailblazers who did take risks, and suffered
for their pains, so that their daughters and granddaughters could
one day have titles like producer and director.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake ``A Will of Their Own'' for a social-history
monograph. This is an offering from the producers of ``The Thorn
Birds,'' after all. And what they've produced is a faithful version
of the 1992 novel ``Daughters of the New World,'' by Susan Richards
Shreve. Faithful, that is, to a fault. Like the book, the movie
wraps its ambitious theme in the soggy cliches of popular romance,
weighs it down some more with leaden dialogue, then tries to keep
everything afloat with moral uplift, swelling music and the sheer
momentum of generational history.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying the load is a cast of up-and-comers drafted from NBC's
fall lineup and led by Lea Thompson of ``Caroline in the City,''
Thomas Gibson of ``Dharma and Greg'' and Eric McCormack of ``Will
and Grace.'' Only McCormack, though, as a no-good husband, seems to
be having any fun. The movie meanwhile trades misleadingly on the
star power of Faye Dunaway, Ellen Burstyn and Sonia Braga, using
their names for box-office draw but giving only Ms. Burstyn any
real camera time, as a stiff society matron.
</P>
<P>
   The story they flesh out spans decades, beginning with calamity
aboard a ship of penniless immigrants from Liverpool in 1894 and
ending on a note of hard-won and well-heeled triumph in 1985. In
between, girls are born, grow to women and give birth to girls of
their own, each distinct but linked by a family credo that asserts
that ``even a woman can make something of herself if she's got guts
and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   There is Annie (Reiko Aylesworth), a self-reliant housemaid in
turn-of-the-century Washington who upsets the class system by
eloping with the doctor son of her wealthy employers. There is her
daughter, the free-spirited Amanda (Ms. Thompson), who has a child
by a handsome photographer ( Gibson) during World War I only to
discover he's married; she then embarks on a picture-taking career
of her own. There is Amanda's daughter, the conventional Sarah
(Paris Jefferson), who chooses a society marriage over college,
later divorces her abusive politician husband ( McCormack) and
becomes a successful businesswoman. And there is Sarah's daughter,
Susan (Charlotte Ross, of ``Trinity''), a '60s flower child who
becomes a socially conscious doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Holding this formulaic mini-series sprawl together is the
pivotal figure of Amanda, who also has the job of recounting the
proceedings in flashback as an old woman. (This is the sort of
television movie in which 25-year-old actors made up to appear old
invariably look like 25-year-old actors made up to appear old.)
</P>
<P>
   Born around 1900, Amanda is the living link for a century of
women and, as a photojournalist, conveniently well positioned to be
an eyewitness to history: the world wars, the winning of the right
to vote, the birth of Planned Parenthood under Margaret Sanger (Ms.
Dunaway, fleetingly), McCarthyism and the farm workers' movement
(which is where Ms. Braga comes in, for a cameo).
</P>
<P>
   Yet for a character who sees and experiences so much, Amanda is
curiously uninteresting. That may have something to do with Ms.
Thompson's frequent and humorless spasms of overacting. Or it may
be that pillars of endurance and accomplishment are admirable but
finally boring. By contrast, in a supporting role, Ms. Jefferson is
subtly more effective as Amanda's conventional, mistreated
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the very broadness of the ``sweeping epic''
mini-series genre almost necessarily precludes depth. A movie like
this has a lot of ground to cover and a crowded cast to introduce,
and even in five hours it's a squeeze. So we're left with a diorama
of stock figures _ long-suffering wives, pigheaded husbands, lying
lovers _ forced to mouth standard-issue soap-opera lines.
``Whatever happens, we'll get through this together,'' Gibson tells
Ms. Thompson at one point.
</P>
<P>
   One imagines that real women, long accustomed to a man's world,
might reply, ``Yes, we've heard that one before.''

NEW YORK CITIZENS PAY MORE TO FEDS THAN THEY GET BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: ADDS the words ``released Thursday'' to second graf)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York is among the top 10 ``loser'' states where
residents pay more in federal taxes than they get back in federal
spending, according to a new Harvard University study.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Thursday, shows New Yorkers paying $785
more per capita in federal taxes in fiscal 1997 then they got back
in federal programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and
defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who has for 22 years
released studies of the so-called ``balance of payments'' between
the states and the federal government, said New York is in ``near
desperate'' financial health and that its ``persistent balance of
payments deficit'' may be responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New York has to pay more attention to this than it has
done,'' Moynihan said in an interview after a Capitol Hill news
conference on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan added that New York's credit rating is the worst of any
state except Louisiana and that it has the third highest poverty
rate (20.5 percent) in the country. While it has the ninth highest
per-capita income ($27,119), it has the fourth highest
cost-of-living rate, making it a relatively wealthy state with a
large number of poor people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 states with the largest payments-to-benefits deficits
were mostly in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region, and they
had been on the list for six years, according to Jay H. Walder and
Herman B. Leonard, professors at Harvard University's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, who conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   Besides New York, the states were Connecticut with a $2,272
deficit, New Jersey with $1,946, Illinois with $1,688, New
Hampshire with $1,419, Nevada with $1,413, Michigan with $1,383,
Minnesota with $1,325, Delaware with $1,030 and Wisconsin with
$965.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., said, ``Clearly you don't want to be in
a situation where you're not receiving your fair share of federal
dollars.'' But he added that Michigan has a deficit largely because
three military bases, which had received federal funds, have closed
in the state in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   California had the 16th worst deficit with a per-capita loss in
fiscal 1997 of $366.
</P>
<P>
   Walder and Leonard noted that the movement of money between
Washington and the states generally leads to a redistribution of
funds from wealthier states to lower-income states.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico has consistently led the nation with the greatest per
capita balance of payments surplus. New Mexicans received $3,500
more per capita in federal programs in fiscal 1997 than they paid
in federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Other ``winner'' states receiving considerably more in federal
benefits than they contributed in federal taxes were North Dakota,
getting back $2,788 per capita, Virginia with a $2,648 per capita
surplus, West Virginia with $2,235, Mississippi with $2,234,
Arkansas with $2,019, Montana with $1,925, Hawaii with $1,788,
Maryland with $1,767 and Alaska with $1,603.

POLL SHOWS DAVIS RETAINS SLIM LEAD IN CALIFORNIA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic nominee for
governor in California, maintains a slight lead over Republican
challenger Dan Lungren, according to a poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was favored by 48 percent of those surveyed, the same
percentage of voters supporting him in three polls since July.
Lungren, the state attorney general, was backed by 42 percent of
those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The closeness of the contest means the remaining undecided
voters are crucial to both candidates. In order to win, analysts
said, Davis must avoid controversy and Lungren must swap his
tough-on-crime agenda and start talking about education and other
issues to soften his conservative image.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it stays like this, Davis probably wins,'' said Del Ali,
senior vice president of Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research of
Columbia, Md., which conducted the poll from Oct. 11-13 for the San
Francisco Examiner and San Francisco's KTVU-TV. The survey of 820
likely California voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicated a continued gender gap between the
candidates, with Davis more favored by women voters and Lungren
more favored by men.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed Davis capturing the liberal San Francisco Bay
area and urban Los Angeles, and Lungren leading in the more
conservative Central Valley and San Diego areas.
</P>
<P>
   And there appears to be a smaller-than-expected undecided group.
Just 10 percent of those surveyed were undecided, indicating that
voters made up their minds early in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The race is shaping up as a traditional fight between two
establishment candidates with the same educational and extended
backgrounds as public servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the primary, a lot of people looked at the
candidates and made up their minds,'' said Mary Hughes, a
Democratic political consultant in San Francisco. ``I think people
got a sense of what was going on. And because there wasn't a
contested Republican primary, and as we get inside the three-week
window, Republicans are coming home to their candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren was unopposed in the June primary, but Davis faced a
tough fight against two other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Lungren campaign has not shied from its candidate's
conservative credentials, a strategy built on the belief that
integrity and making tough choices are more important to voters
than the actual issue positions.
</P>
<P>
   In one televised ad, Lungren looks into the camera and tells
voters he is opposed to abortion and that Davis is distorting his
record, a politically risky move in a state that is largely
sympathetic to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ali said Lungren must ``stop running stupid ads about his
abortion position when he is trying to attract soccer moms. That
saves some money for Gray, running those ads. And I know crime is
his issue, but he's got to start talking about education.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California
showed the majority of Californians surveyed listed education as
their priority.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Lungren has a tough task, because voters already may
know what Lungren and Davis feel about key issues such as abortion,
gun control, the environment and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few issues that are not already on the table,'' she
said. ``So it's not like we are all of a sudden going to discuss
their differences on guns, their differences on choice. ... People
have decided. You're fighting over a very small part of the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far too early to declare a successor to Republican Gov.
Pete Wilson, who is barred by law from seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you factor in the statistical error, it's really just a
slight lead (for Davis),'' said Barbara O'Connor, a professor at
the Center for California Studies at California State University in
Sacramento. ``You're talking about one or two voters per precinct,
statewide, and that is a very narrow margin. ... I think what's
happening now is the campaign is congealing, which is typical for
three weeks out.''
