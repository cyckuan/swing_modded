<HEADLINE> EU Launches Projects to Combat Violence Against Women, Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Thursday that it will support 49 new projects in 1999 under
the so-called DAPHNE initiative to combat violence against women
and children.
</P>
<P>
The total budget of 3.8 million euros (4.3 million U.S.
dollars) will be used for projects involving non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) from all 15 European Union (EU) member
states.
</P>
<P>
Anita Gradin, the EU commissioner for Justice and Home
Affairs, said the involvement of NGOs was crucial to success of
this important work.
</P>
<P>
"They deserve our wholehearted support in order to develop
their knowledge of the issues, to support the victims and to
exchange information and experience. Therefore I also hope that
we can get a decision in the near future to turn this initiative
into a five-year work program, as proposed by the commission."
she said.
</P>
<P>
" For the future, I would also encourage proposals for
projects that are not just dealing with the situation of women
and children, but also with the issue of men and violence," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Of the 49 projects, 13 are concerned with violence against
children, 17 with violence against women and the remaining 19
focus on violence against both groups. The projects cover a
wide-range of activities, including awareness raising and
prevention campaigns, exchange of experience on support to
victims of human trafficking, European data collection and
research and the fight against child pornography on the internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom Prime
Minister Tony Blair said on Thursday that Britain stood ready to
use military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Blair's official spokesman said the Prime Minister late on
Wednesday held telephone talks with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, who is now holding the European Union presidency.
</P>
<P>
Blair told Schroeder that force might be necessary to resolve
the deteriorating situation in Kosovo, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to use military action but there is a concern
that there has to be some political process underpinning it," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Britain sent four more warplanes to a NATO base
in Italy, doubling its ground attack force there to eight planes.
</P>
<P>
NATO ordered more warplanes to Italy on Thursday to reinforce
squadrons from 13 allied countries now on 48-hour standby for
possible air strikes at Yugoslav military targets in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group, consisting of the United States,
Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Russia, will meet in London on
Friday to discuss the implications of the Racak massacre, in which
45 Albanians were found dead.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Interior Minister Tenders Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Interior Minister
Gavril Dejeu on Thursday tendered his resignation, marking the
first government casualty of the Jiu Valley miners' strike.
</P>
<P>
According to the national Rompres news agency, Dejeu will be
temporarily replaced by Constantin Dudu Ionescu, a former
secretary of state with the defense ministry. Due to the growing
domestic turmoil, the government is expected to appoint a new
interior minister today.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the resignation was not given, but many analysts
here believe Dejeu was being held responsible for the coal
miners' march through the Jiu Strait, the only natural barrier on
their way to the capital, Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of the Interior Ministry failed to stop the
miners' advance as requested, and the miners are getting nearer
and nearer to Bucharest," a cabinet member was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Around 15,000 miners went on strike in January 4 in the Jiu
Valley area, Romania's largest coal field, to demand higher pay
and increased mine subsidies. On Monday, 10,000 miners began a
protest march to the capital. They are now about 180 kilometers
from the city.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Southeast Asian
economic crisis is disproportionately affecting women and girls,
particularly their productive health, education and employment,
according to a new report by the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Southeast Asian Populations in Crisis --
Challenges to the Implementation of the ICPD Program of Action,"
is a joint project by the UNFPA and the Australian National
University. It examines the impact of the economic crisis,
especially in relation to women, in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia
and Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Increased unemployment has resulted in massive increases in the
numbers of people living below or close to the poverty line,
creating a "new poor," the report says. It finds women are
disproportionately affected because entrenchments are most severe
in sectors where they are prominent.
</P>
<P>
Budget cuts have reduced reproductive health services and the
depreciation in exchange rates has affected the supply and
affordability of medicines, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The reduced access to reproductive health services is leading
more young women to choose unsafe abortions. Many women are also
turning to the commercial sex industry to find work and support
their families, the report says.
</P>
<P>
These new recruits are likely to be poorly equipped to
protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases and
HIV/AIDS, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1969 at the initiative of the General
Assembly, the UNFPA is the largest multilateral source of
population assistance to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Egypt Over Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
is expected to pay a brief visit to Egypt on Saturday for talks
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace
process, Palestinian sources in Cairo said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The peace process between the Palestinians and Israel have been
in a deadlock since Israel's suspension in last December of the
Wye River accord, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington last October, under which Israel
should withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank in three
phases.
</P>
<P>
After materializing a first-phase pullback in early December,
however, Israel shelved the accord, citing that the Palestinians
had failed to bring rampant violence against Israel under control.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming talks, Arafat will brief Mubarak on steps
to be taken by the Palestinians to break the deadlock in the
foreseeable future, the sources said, adding the steps could
include a tour of Europe by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Arafat and Mubarak might fly together to
Amman, Jordan, to congratulate Jordanian King Hussein on his safe
return after a six-month cancer treatment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Arafat have paid frequent visits to Egypt to coordinate with
Mubarak the stances on the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Shoots Up in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit shot
up to 15.5 billion U.S. dollars in November as the country's
exports of some major goods fell sharply while imports rose to an
all-time high, the Commerce Department said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The November deficit was up 14 percent on a revised October
figure of 13.6 billion dollars, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
For November, imports rose 0.4 percent to a record high of
94.1 billion dollars, reflecting big increases in imports of
computer chips, telecommunications equipment, autos and furniture.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports fell 1.9 percent to 78.7 billion dollars as sales
of farm products such as soybeans, rice and wheat declined. Sales
of manufactured goods including commercial aircraft, computer
equipment, computer chips and telecommunications products dipped
as well.
</P>
<P>
Although the figures for December have yet to be published,
the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services for 1998 has already
hit an all-time high of 153.9 billion dollars, surpassing the old
record of 153.4 billion dollars in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believed that including the figures for
December, the U.S. trade deficit for the whole 1998 is likely to
climb to around 164 billion dollars, far above last year's 110
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade figures released Thursday indicate that the surge in
steel imports took a downturn in November although steel imports
for the whole of 1998 are still far ahead of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Steel imports from Japan were down 47.3 million dollars to 306
million dollars in November, but up 1.27 billion dollars to 2.88
billion dollars for the first 11 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in Japanese steel exports has led to a sharp
widening in the trade gap between the world's two largest
economies and growing trade friction in a number of areas. The
U.S. trade deficit with Japan totalled 58.2 billion dollars
through to November, up 14 percent on a year ago.
</P>
<P>
With the Pacific Rim region, the U.S. trade deficit saw a
sharp 34 percent increase to 148.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Only Two EU Cities Have No Waste Water Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here in a report which was published Thursday that only Brussels
and Milan have announced that they are unable to respect the Urban
Waste Water Directive of the European Union (EU) because they have
no such disposal system at all.
</P>
<P>
The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is one of the main
pillars of the existing EU legislation on water, which is designed
to protect the environment from the adverse effects of discharges
of urban waste water. The law requires EU member states to ensure
that such water is collected and treated according to strict
standards.
</P>
<P>
The main adverse effects of insufficiantly treated waste water
are pollution of drinking water resources, the ecological
disturbance of the rivers and lakes as well as dispersion of
pathogens in bathing waters and shellfish waters.
</P>
<P>
The EU has set December 31, 1998 as the deadline for providing
collection and advanced treatment systems in all agglomerations of
more than 10,000 population equivalents discharging to sensitive
waters. But Brussels and Milan have expressed their inability to
follow the deadline.
</P>
<P>
When the commission adopted the report, commissioner for
Environment Ritt Bjerregaad said that while the overall picture on
the implementation of this directive is encouraging, it is of
great concern that Brussels as well as Milan are lagging behind.
"I hope that our report will contribute to speed up the necessary
work. In the meantime I am committed to my policy of strict
enforcement of the EU's environment legislation."

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Calls for New Agenda to Combat Social Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai Thursday called for a new social agenda with the
participation of people to overcome the social problems caused by
the ongoing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He made the call at a meeting organized by the World Bank and
hosted by the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP) on social issues arising from the East Asian
economic crisis and policy implications for the future.
</P>
<P>
Chuan cited growing unemployment, rising costs of health care
and growing numbers of school dropouts as the most serious social
consequences of the economic crisis which began in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
"We need a stronger partnership between public and private
sectors, NGOs and the civil society to overcome the crisis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the level of unemployment in Thailand has
doubled due to a worsening situation in the country's corporate
sector leading to massive retrenchment of workers, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of students dropping out of schools
had also increased while financial constraints were affecting
research and development efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has taken a series of measures to mitigate
the social impact of the economic crisis, among which were public
spending to create new employment opportunities and the allocation
of adequate resources to the health and education sectors.
</P>
<P>
Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of ESCAP, called for the
introduction of an effective system of unemployment insurance,
saying studies suggest the feasibility of such schemes with "a
modest pay-roll tax on the employers and employees."
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's vice-president for the
East Asia and Pacific Region, said that though some improvements
can be expected in economic growth this year all over Asia, there
would also be further deterioration of the social situation.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment will probably increase unless active social and
structural policies are developed to mitigate the impact of
unavoidable corporate restructuring and the further decline in
revenues of many groups in the affected countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, opened here Thursday, is being attended by
high-level representatives from governments throughout East Asia
and of international funding agencies, U.N. organizations and
specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations.

cities and villages, with civilians as the preferred targets, the
propagation of terror as the premeditated tactic, and the physical
elimination or mass displacement of certain categories of
population as the overarching strategy.
</P>

Mello said breaches of human rights and humanitarian law,
including mutilation, rape. forced displacement, denial of the
right of food and medicine, diversion of aid and attacks on
medical personnel and hospitals are no longer inevitable
by-products of war.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Won Rotary International Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni was presented with a global Polio Eradication Champion
Award here Thursday afternoon for his support of polio eradication
efforts in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The award was received by Prime Minister Kintu Musoke who came
to represent the president at the opening ceremony of the African
Presidential Conference of Rotary International being held at the
International Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
When presenting the award, Rotary International President James
Lacy said: "The end is in sight for global polio eradication, and
with the strong leadership of President Museveni, the last drive
will be successful. For as long as polio exists anythere, there is
a threat everywhere."
</P>
<P>
"National support for conducting national immunization days and
 implementing a system of monitoring suspected cases of polio is
crucial during the next 24 months. We commend the efforts of
Uganda to this end," Lacy added.
</P>
<P>
The award was established in 1995 to recognize public officials
who have distinguished themselves by making significant
contributions toward the goal of polio eradication.
</P>
<P>
Other world leaders who have received this award include U.S.
President Bill Clinton, former British Prime Minister John Major
and Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev.
</P>
<P>
Once polio is eradicated, the World Health Organization (WHO)
estimates an annual global savings of 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars.
The United States alone will save 230 million Dollars each year in
costs that would have otherwise been allocated to national polio
immunization.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, Rotary International's contribution to polio
eradication will reach approximately 500 million Dollars. The
organization has committed more than 313 million Dollars for
global polio eradication since the PolioPlus Program began in
1985.
</P>
<P>
To date, 119 countries around the globe have benefited from the
 PolioPlus grants.
</P>
<P>
Rotary International, recognized by WHO as a non-governmental
organization working in the field of international health, was
formed in Chicago, the United States, in 1905. It has 1.2 million
members working in 29,000 clubs in 159 countries.

<HEADLINE> Canada Wants Mandatory Canadian Films on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's public and private
broadcasters have been required to reserve prime TV time for
Canadian movies in a bid to boost Canada's film industry.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to win prime time for homemade films,
more time will be given to Canadian theatrical releases, which
are limited to only 12 minutes of commercials per hour, according
to a report to be released Thursday by an advisory committee
under Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps.
</P>
<P>
The committee suggested that a feature film fund, with an
estimated budget of between 150 million and 188 million Canadian
dollars (97 million and 122 million U.S. dollars), be established
to support production of homemade films.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the feature film advisory body also called on
broadcasters to contribute more fund to Canadian film industry.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the panel says it wants its proposal to help
the industry achieve several objectives over the next five years.
These include:
</P>
<P>
--Increasing the Canadian share of screen time from two
percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
--Increasing the number and quality of Canadian feature films
produced each year and their share of box-office revenues.
</P>
<P>
--Increasing the average budget of Canadian films, and the
support from the public sector.
</P>
<P>
--Increasing private-sector investment in Canadian feature
films, and increasing the strength and quality of Canadian
distribution and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The committee also addresses the perennial problem caused by
the fact that Canada is defined by the U.S. film industry as part
of the U.S. market for film-distribution purposes. For years,
successive governments have attempted to deal with this headache,
and then backed away.

UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Thursday called upon all parties to conflicts to abide by
international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the United Nations meeting on Promoting Peace and

laws are unknown or ignored in most contemporary conflicts and the
gap between existing international norms and respect for them on

</P>
<P>
Mello said the greatest challenge is to bridge this gap through
the realization of international laws and fundamental principles
in practice.
</P>
<P>
Mello said while the primary obligation to abide by the
international laws rest with Member States and parties to
conflicts, who have often committed themselves on paper, the
Council is still charged with ensuring respect, as part of its
international responsibility to maintain peace and security.

KAMPALA, January 21 (Xinhua) --James Lacy, president of Rotary
International, a worldwide non-governmental organization devoted
to improving welfare of the needy, has clarified that children are
the most vulnerable to fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said this at the opening ceremony of the Rotary
International Conference here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"They are most vulnerable. About 32 children die of diseases
or starvation each day in the world," he told more than 700
delegates from 25 African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to materials distributed at the conference, the focus
of the organization in the year 1999 will be put on children in
the world, especially those suffering from various calamities.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Prime Minister who came to represent President Yoweri
Museveni at the conference, said poverty is the major challenge
Africa faces now and that the Ugandan government needs partnership
of NGOs like Rotary International in its poverty eradication
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
A staggering 1.3 billion people in the world live in abject
poverty. Every year 15 million of these people die of
poverty-related causes in both developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On a global scale, poverty is predominantly a rural problem.
Some 800 million people worldwide are suffering from chronic
malnutrition.

<HEADLINE> 1,100 Bodies Collected for Burial in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- About 1,100 bodies have been
collected for burial from the central districts of Sierra Leonean
capital Freetown after fierce fighting since January 6, the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report added that there are "certainly many more" deaths in
the fighting between the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG
and the Sierra Leonean rebels for the control of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Early estimates have put the number of deaths at a minimum of
2,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a ship-load of rice donated by Italy has been
diverted to Conakry of Guinea because of security concerns in
Freetown, a spokesman of the World Food Program (WFP) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The ship is not going to Freetown," the spokesman said in
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, adding "when the situation in Sierra Leone
improves we will transfer the food to Freetown."
</P>
<P>
The ship is already unloading 1,800 tons of rice in Conakry,
according to media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Though ECOMOG sources said it was putting security measures in
place at the port in Freetown for aid ships, the WFP spokesman
said even if security is provided, logistics will be a major
problem.

<HEADLINE> Japan Not to Interfere in Other Countries' Affairs: Obuchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi said Thursday that Japan will abide by the principle of
not interfering in other countries' internal affairs set by the
international law when it provided support to United States forces
 in the event of emergencies surrounding Japan.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi made the remark while replying the questions from
opposition parties at the plenary session of the House of
Councilors, or the upper house.
</P>
<P>
Japan's action will be within the limits of the Constitution
when it provides the support, Obuchi said, adding that the
country will stick to its basic policy for pure defense.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "areas surrounding Japan" where Japan and
U.S. will enhance military cooperation under the revised
bilateral defense cooperation guidelines, Obuchi said "It is a
situation which has a serious influence on Japan's peace and
security, so it is not hypothesized to occur on the other side of
the globe."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government maintains that Japan and the U.S. will
cooperate in the event of emergencies under the guidelines which
it says do not refer to a geographic concept, but rather a
situational one.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, updated in September 1997, call on Japan to
provide more active support to U.S. forces in emergencies in the
undefined areas surrounding Japan.

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Blasts Internet Reports on His </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi has decried the bad publicity being floated on the Internet
and other foreign media as detrimental to the prosperity of his
country.
</P>
<P>
"Most of it is rubbish," Muluzi said of the news on Malawi
floated on the Internet and foreign newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi's ire comes in the wake of concerns raised by Malawians
based in Botswana about the political, economic and social
situation in Malawi's lakes, reported political divisions in the
country and health conditions in Malawi's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In a question-and-answer session after addressing the Malawians
during a visit to Botswana, Muluzi disputed reports that his
government would stop funding the University of Malawi and
instead, ask students to pay up to 70, 000 Kwacha (about 1,628
U.S. Dollars) for each academic year.
</P>
<P>
"The issue has never been discussed in cabinet or at any
level."
</P>
<P>
"We will have to support the university education. Of course
funding is sometimes a problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi's assurance put to rest wide speculation in the local
and international media about an alleged plan to raise university
fees up to 70, 000 Kwacha to make the institution self-sustainable
and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
The speculations come in the wake of recommendations by the
Malawi Institute of Management to make the university sustainable
in the face of financial difficulties beleaguering the institution
due to delays in disbursement of funds from central government
coffers.
</P>
<P>
The president highlighted the economic gains in Malawi since
the transition to democracy and efforts to eradicate poverty
through small and medium enterprises as well as infrastructural
development programs using local and foreign financial resources.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying hard to consolidate democracy through economic
growth to forge more bilateral and multilateral ties," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Leaves for Arusha Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni left here for Arusha in northern Tanzania Thursday to
join Presidents Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and Daniel arap Moi of
Kenya for the annual east African leaders' summit.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Thursday
evening that the summit, which opens Friday, will review the work
of the Tripartite Commission and endorse the agenda for the coming
year, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the three leaders are expected to have a meeting
on Burundi to hear a report from the facilitator of the Burundi
Peace Initiative, former Tanzanian President Mwalimu Julius
Nyerere, who will brief the leaders on the progress so far in the
quest for peace in the land-locked country.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda will also be discussion on possible lifting
of economic sanctions imposed on the country.
</P>
<P>
Following Major Pierre Buyoya's coup in July 1996 to overthrow
the elected government of President Sylveste Ntibatunganya, a
regional summit attended by Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia,
former Zaire, and Zambia imposed economic sanctions on Burundi to
force Buyoya to restore constitutional governance and to commence
talks with opposition groups in order to prevent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya insisted that he can not succumb to the demands of
regional leaders when blood-letting continued. However, he had
lifted the ban on political parties, restored parliament, and
continued to exert efforts toward restoring peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He has also met opposition groups on several occasions in an
attempt to reach a negotiated settlement. All his efforts have
been communicated to regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Although conditions there are improving, the situation in
Burundi is still volatile and cases of inter-ethnic killings are
occasionally reported in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the United Nations Security Council Meeting on
Peace and Security, Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N.
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
Relief Coordinator, said humanitarian action cannot succeed
without unimpeded access to those in need, and it is an obligation
under international law of all legitimate authorities to ensure
that all those in need receive assistance.
</P>
<P>
Mello said there is a need for the Security Council to strongly
reaffirm these principles, both in a generic and country-specific
manner.
</P>
<P>
Mello said the contribution peacekeeping forces and
international police can and do make to averting and containing
humanitarian crises is too often overlooked and there are many
positive examples of collaboration between peace-keepers and
humanitarian agencies.
</P>
<P>
Mello said even where humanitarian objectives were not part
of their primary mandates, peace-keeping operations have proved
valuable, often vital, in supporting and protecting needy
populations, humanitarian workers and supplies in environments
where there was limited consent form the warring parties on the
security conditions or when the security situation is simply
beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
Mello said the peace-keepers can also play a valuable role in
helping to prevent the diversion or abuse of aid for political
or military purpose.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Supports Federative Solution on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hungary holds that the
settlement of the Cyprus issue should be based on a single,
independent, federative state, Hungarian new ambassador to
Nicosia Istvan Pataki said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting credentials to Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides,
Pataki said his country is convinced that the long standing
division of Cyprus can be overcome with a clear commitment of the
international community and with a strong political will of the
partners involved.
</P>
<P>
He said Hungary supports the implementation of the
U.N. Security Council decisions and the goodwill mission of the
Secretay-General, as well as international efforts aimed at a
just, permanent and mutually acceptable solution.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his country's participation in the
U.N. peacekeeping forces in Cyprus, Pataki said its aim is "to
contribute to creating favourable conditions for a peaceful
solution".
</P>
<P>
Hungary participates in the U.N. peacekeeping force with 105
men.
</P>
<P>
On his part, President Clerides expressed his gratitude for
Hungary's "principled stance" and its support in the efforts
to achieve a solution of the Cyprus issue and for Hungary's
contribution to the U.N. peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern one third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.

NICOSIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand supports a solution
to the Cyprus issue based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation in
accordance with United Nations resolutions, New Zealand's new High
Commissioner to Cyprus Peter Robert Bennett said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his credentials to Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides, Bennett said the international community can play a
vital role in facilitating a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
But "a just, lasting and peaceful settlement of the issue lies
in the hands of the parties directly affected - the Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot communities themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the process of Cyprus' accession to the
European Union "can and should" help to achieve the final solution
to the Cyprus problem on the basis of the relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Greek Cypriots will continue efforts
toward defusion of tensions, demilitarization and the
peaceful reunification on the divided island.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) plans to build an airport in the West Bank city of
Bethlehem, the second airport in the Palestinian self-rule areas,
a Palestinian official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fayez Zeidan, director of the Palestinian Civil Aviation
Authority said the Bethlehem airport, comprising one air strip and
several buildings, will be much smaller than the newly opened Gaza
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Zeidan also noted that the airport project is still under
planning and no date has been set for the beginning of its
construction.
</P>
<P>
About three million Christian pilgrims are expected to visit
Bethlehem, Jesus' birthplace, by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio quoted Shlomo Dror, spokesman of the
Israeli government's Palestinian affairs adviser, as saying that
Israel has not been informed of the airport plan.
</P>
<P>
Dror said that since planes must cross the Israeli air space to
land in Bethlehem, the airport plan should be consulted with
Israel.

<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Thursday that the meeting of Arab
foreign ministers due Sunday will serve as a tester of Arab
stances on key issues in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The event comes at "a very crucial moment" when a unified Arab
stance and determination to ease the tensions in the Arab world is
"imperatively required," Abdel-Meguid told Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
An Arab foreign ministers meeting was first scheduled on
December 30, 1998, to discuss a Yemeni call for an Arab summit on
the Iraqi crisis after a U.S.-British attack on the country in
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the meeting was put
off to January 24 for better consultations and preparations.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said the Arab foreign ministers shoulder "a
historical responsibility" to stand up to "the growing challenges"
in the Arab world and reach a consensus in their coordination and
solidarity.

<HEADLINE> France to Speed up Restructuring of Defense Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- France will speed up
restructuring of its defense industry while seeking alliance with
German defense industry, after the British Aerospace-Marconi
merger excluded a triangle alliance as was first hoped by France.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Thursday that the
government could sell more stocks of the Aerospatiale aeronautics
group in order to create a "European scale" defense industrial
group.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said on Wednesday that the British Aerospace-Marconi
deal gave France good reasons to speed up the planned alliance
between Aerospatiale and the private Matra Haute Technologies,
which would result in a partial privatization of Aerospatiale.
</P>
<P>
But the French government will remain the biggest shareholder
of a future Aerospatiale-Matra group.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also said that France will continue to seek a European
aeronautics group "perhaps through a Franco-German alliance."
</P>
<P>
The number one candidate for such an alliance could be the
German Dailer-Benz Aerospace (DASA), which excluded an alliance
with the British Aerospace after the latter's merger with Marconi,
which is also British.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Communist Party
Thursday marked the 75th anniversary of the death of Vladimir
Lenin - the founder of the Soviet state - in Moscow, according to
the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and his colleagues
laid flowers to lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said that Lenin's legacy was "timely as ever",
including his New Economic Policy (NEP), which allowed a cautious
return of some features of capitalism to Soviet life.
</P>
<P>
In Zyuganov's opinion, the NEP is knocking at Russia's door. He
hoped that its ideas would not remain uncalled-for by the
government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
There are 50 monuments to Lenin still kept in Moscow, eight of
them are protected by the government as works of art, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in Ulyanovsk - Lenin's birthplace - was held
a ceremony attended by local leaders, school and college students,
policemen, and workers to mark the anniversary of the death of the
Bolshevik leader.
</P>
<P>
Similar ceremonies were held in St.Petersburg and the Ukrainian
capital Kiev, according to the Itar-Tass.

Lenin died 75 years ago at the age of 53. Since then, his body
has been well preserved in the Mausoleum in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt: U.N. Not Care About 2nd Fallen Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government officials
said that judging from what the U.N. observers have been doing
these days, they can say that the U.N. does not care about the
searching of the second plane downed in central Angola earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan News Agency quoted officials reluctant to be
identified as saying that the U.N. observers had asked the
government forces to stop military actions around areas of
Bailundo in Huambo Province and Andulo in Bie Province as from
Tuesday, for the convenience of the investigation work, but three
days have past and the U.N. men still show no sign of any action.
</P>
<P>
These officials said that what the U.N. observers are doing can
only offer time for the military men of the rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to regroup their
forces after having suffered great losses in the region, thus
bringing more destruction to the areas.
</P>
<P>
They said that the government forces will not be responsible to
any inconveniences for the plane search if they are forced to
resume their military actions in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Two U.N.-chartered cargo planes were downed on December 26 1998
and january 2, 1999 respectively in UNITA-controled areas in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. investigation group found the wreckage of the first
plane on January 8 but failed to found any survivals of the plane
which were carrying 14 people on board.
</P>
<P>
There were nine people aboard the second plane, which is yet to
be found.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Lawyer Wraps Up Defense in Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's private lawyer David Kendall told senators Thursday that
evidence used by House prosecutors to allege obstruction of
justice was "profoundly ambiguous" and that senators had an
obligation to restore fairness to the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up White House's three-day defense of Clinton in the
Senate impeachment trial, Kendall denounced the Whitewater
investigation that led to the impeachment inquiry as "tortuous and
meandering" and said he was before the trial to rebut the
"rhetoric" of the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by
the House along partisan lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Kendall focused his attack on the impeachment article accusing
Clinton of obstruction of justice, saying it was "based on
circumstantial evidence, and that evidence is at best profoundly
ambiguous."
</P>
<P>
"The evidence plainly shows that the president did not obstruct
justice in any way and there is nothing in this article that would
warrant his removal from office," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds Senate vote is needed to convict
Clinton and remove him from office. At the moment, no one believes
there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.

"Seminar on Poverty and Policy in Ethiopia" held at the U.N.
Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
Samuel said Sub-Saharan Africa is a poor continent where the
majority population live in poverty under one U.S. Dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the cause of poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa
is not short of efforts, saying that African governments, U.N.
agencies and non- governmental organizations have increased their
efforts on poverty eradication in the region.
</P>
<P>
He called for more efforts on eradicating poverty in Africa to
meet the challenge of the new century.
</P>
<P>
In her opening speech, Wendy Crane, Country Director of
Action-Aid Ethiopia, said the seminar is held to share the
findings of the non- governmental organizations research
initiative and the policy-making body for greater understanding of
the pressing challenges that Ethiopia faces in reducing the
steadily rising level of poverty.
</P>
<P>
She said the seminar will also identify areas of future
cooperation within the non-governmental organizations community
and with the policy- making body in terms of promoting
constructive dialog on issues of poverty and policy in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar discussed topics such as poverty
measurement, profile and policy in Ethiopia; the making of
anti-poverty policy in Ethiopia; economic reform and gender; and
non-governmental organizations collaborative research on economic
reform and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the UNDP, and organized by the
collaborating non-governmental organizations group in association
with the department of economics of Addis Ababa University, and
the Inter Africa Group.

<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Continued weakness for U.S.
technology shares and a further slide in Brazil saw European
shares Thursday in gentle slide.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 Index of leading shares closed down
83.3 points at 6022.3 despite a business survey found some
hopes of the economy picking up in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Many dealers were shelving investments until Friday's
gross domestic product figures give more indications on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
German share prices defied losses elsewhere in Europe
for most of the day before succumbing to selling pressure
in late trade.
</P>
<P>
The leading Dax index finished up 14 points at 5156 but
the later-trading electronic Xetra Dax slipped below a key
technical level of 5200 points in nervous trade to close
down 33.70 points at 5163.45.
</P>
<P>
With the market still concerned about Brazil and a lack
of major corporate news to influence share prices in
Europe, "investors can't find any reasons to play the
market," said a trader.
</P>
<P>
Prench stocks suffered losses in line with other
European equity markets, as U.S. markets dictated genative
sentiment. The leading Cac 40 index closed down 36 points
at 4154.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has allocated three million U.S. Dollars for
Tanzania to launch an agricultural development program.
</P>
<P>
FAO country representative, Sulayman M'boob, said in Dar es
Salaam Thursday that the 10-year program is aimed at helping the
country become self-sufficient in grain supply.
</P>
<P>
M'boob said his office, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives, is finalizing establishment of the
program including identification of agricultural projects to be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives,
William Kusila, will announce its launching next month.
</P>
<P>
M'boob was speaking at the hand-over of 300 bags of maize worth
4.5 million Shillings (about 6,600 U.S. Dollars) to the Equal
Opportunities for All Trust Fund (EOTF). The maize was donated by
a Dar es Salaam-based Export Trading Company (ETC).
</P>
<P>
EOTF chairperson Anna Mkapa, the first lady of Tanzania, said
150 bags of the maize will be distributed to hunger-stricken
people in Handeni district, Tanga Region in the north, and the
other 150 bags will be distributed in central Singida Region.
</P>
<P>
Affected by drought since last October, 13 of 20 regions on the
 Tanzanian Mainland are enduring starvation. In the first half of
the year, the country has a food deficit of 600,000 tons,

UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Director
of the Iraq Program, Benon Sevan, on Thursday welcomed the release
of 43 contracts for the supply of urgently needed spare parts and
equipment for Iraq's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council's Sanctions Committee
withheld the 43 contracts following the U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's request on December 29, 1998 to expedite the approval
of contracts and further review those contracts placed on hold.
</P>
<P>
However, Sevan noted that there were still 116 contracts on
hold worth 45,018,839 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the Security Council authorized Iraq to export up
to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in a six months period,
the state of Iraq's oil industry and the depressed world price
for oil combined to limit exports in the last phase to just over
3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase production for export, the Security
Council authorized Iraq to import a total of 600 million dollars
worth of oil industry spare parts and equipment.

LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Rolls-Royce plc, the civil
aerospace, defense and energy group, announced Thursday that the
Trent 8104 engine has exceeded 110,000lb thrust during initial
test runs.
</P>
<P>
The Trent 8104 is proving new technologies which will benefit
all new members of the Trent series, the most successful family of
large aero engines on offer in the world today.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, innovative features include the
new "swept" fan blade, which introduces the fourth generation of
advanced design, maintaining the company's world leadership in
wide-chord fan technology.
</P>
<P>
The advanced aerofoil design passes a greater airflow and
delivers improvements in fuel efficiency. The "swept" blades are
also stronger increasing resistance to bird strike impact and
runway debris, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Phil Hopton, Rolls-Royce Trent 800 Projector, said: "These are
exciting results in a design and manufacturing program which saw
the first engine run achieved on schedule after 15 months."
</P>
<P>
"Results have matched predictions and bear out our confidence
in the continuing growth of the Trent engine," he added.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Warn of Genetic Weapons Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Advances in genetic knowledge
could be misused to develop powerful biological weapons, the
British Medical Association (BMA) warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A new BMA report entitled "Biotechnology, Weapons and Humanity"
said that international action is necessary to block the
development of new, biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of BMA's Health Policy Research,
told a news conference launching the report that genetic
information is already be used to develop lethal weapons within
five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"Recipes" for developing biological agents now are freely
available on the Internet, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
As genetic manipulation becomes a standard laboratory
technique, there is a risk that this new information will also
become widely available.
</P>
<P>
Genetic information is already being used to "improve" elements
of biological weapons, the report said, for example by increasing
their antibiotic resistance, which could raise the spectre of
highly targeted biological weapons being used on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, weapons could also be developed which affect
particular versions of genes clustered in specific ethnic or
family groups, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
Urgent action is needed to strengthen the 1972 Biological and
Toxin Weapons Convention to improve verification provisions, the
BMA said.

NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
committed one million Pound (about 1.6 million U.S. Dollars) to
Rwanda to assist the residents of northern Ruhengeri Prefecture
displaced by insecurity in the area, a special story by Rwandan
News Agency (RNA) reaching here Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The money is being given to three non-governmental
organizations to enable them to carry out their activities in the
northwest, according to a press release of the British Embassy in
Kigali, capital of Rwanda, the RNA said.
</P>
<P>
The organization Concern Worldwide has received 470,00 Pound
for their work in Kinigi, and Nyarutovu communes, where its
priority is distributing non-food items like blankets, cooking
pans and therapeutic feeding centers for malnourished children.
</P>
<P>
The press release further said that Christian Aid has been
given 275,272 Pound for blankets and medical boxes, as well as
training to be given via the Episcopal Church of Rwanda to the
needy people in Shyira diocese.
</P>
<P>
The Australian organization World Vision has received 293,000
Pounds to provide plastic sheeting, to build latrines and give
related training to people in Kinigi region.
</P>
<P>
''The decision of Britain's Department for International
Development to contribute to the humanitarian work being carried
out in Ruhengeri comes as a result of appeals made by the NGOs,
the U.N. and the Rwandan government following the move of hundreds
of thousands of people in the prefectures of Ruhengeri and Gisenyi
from their villages to camps centered on communal headquarters
buildings,'' the press release explained.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program (UNDP) country resident, Steve
Browne had indicated that in December, UNDP had called upon donors
to provide about 37million U. S. Dollars needed to resettle about
half a million displaced people in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.
</P>

He said the U.N. finds that security has returned in much of
northwest Rwanda, and that there was no problem with resuming
humanitarian activities in the that region.

MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Parliamentary Assembly of
the Russian-Belarussian Union on Thursday granted Yugoslavia's

BAGHDAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Cabinet announced on

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Force May be Needed over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday it may be necessary to use force to restore stability in
Kosovo as Yugoslavia disputed with the West over the death of 45
ethnic Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for the stability of the region that the
international community insist on Serb compliance, through the use
of force if necessary," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
authorized its forces to hit Yugoslav military targets if Belgrade
violated pledges to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The United States has demanded Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reduce the Serb security presence in Kosovo, cooperate
with a U.N. war crimes tribunal and reverse a decision to expel
U.S. diplomat William Walker, the head of the Kosovo Verification
Mission (KVM) set up to monitor the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade gave Walker until Thursday evening to leave the
country after the U.S. diplomat blamed Serb forces for the
massacre of the 45 ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade insisted that the victims are the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas who fought for the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any encouraging signs," Lockhart said of
Serb compliance.
</P>
<P>
"What's important here is that we take positive forward steps
here toward access and identifying those responsible and bringing
them to justice."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. of Urging Anti-Iraq Arab Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf on Thursday accused the U.S. of pushing Arab
states to adopt an anti-Iraq stance in the forthcoming Arab
foreign ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Sahhaf said the U.S. has pushed
Arab states to take aggressive measures toward Iraq in the
forthcoming Arab foreign ministers meeting scheduled on January 24
in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. made 22 "talk points full of poison, allegations
and lies" in an attempt to turn Arab governments against Iraq,
said Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
He said these talk points are aimed at alienating the Iraqi
people from their government, defending no-fly zones, defending
the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM), urging
Arab to stand against Russian, French and Chinese stances on the
Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said the Iraqi government has prepared a draft proposal
that expresses Iraq's position toward the embargo and no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies established no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War with a
claimed aim of protecting minority Kurds in the north and
Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's oppression.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said Iraq demands Arab governments and the U.N. Security
Council abandon any practice of a double-standard policy in all
previous and following issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the eight-year-old embargo imposed on Iraq should be
lifted totally.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed comprehensive economic sanctions on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reiterated that Iraq demands compensation
for the damages it has sustained since 1991 until the latest
U.S.-British aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf called on Arab governments to condemn the imposition of
no-fly zones. Iraq considers the restricted zones as illegal and
its troops has fired at U.S. and British jets patrolling there.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries planned initially to hold a foreign ministers
meeting at the end of last year to discuss a Yemeni call
for an emergency Arab summit on the Iraqi issue after the
mid-December U.S.-British air raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Requested by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries,
the Arab League decided to put off the proposed meeting to
January 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The White House said
Thursday that the U.S. administration remains committed to the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) but has told Russia it may
seek changes in order to counter threats from rogue states.
</P>
<P>
Clinton sent a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
discuss budget requests to fund a missile defense system to thwart
missile attacks by rogue states, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Bell, an arms control specialist on the National
Security Council, said news reports had misrepresented what
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday in announcing the
administration will make an accelerated push to build missile
defenses.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary did not threaten to withdraw from the treaty,"
Bell said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen did note in his remarks at a Pentagon news conference
Wednesday that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty allows
either the United States or Russia to withdraw from it with six
months' notice.
</P>
<P>
Other officials said the administration would not let the ABM
treaty stand in the way of deploying missile defenses if President
Clinton decides such defenses are necessary.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the administration intends to open negotiations with
Moscow on ways of amending the treaty to allow the United States
to deploy missile defenses now in development. Bell stressed today
that the administration had not yet decided which amendments it
might propose.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to discuss, with the Russians, any steps that may
need to be taken or any amendments that may need to be made as far
as any future deployment of the national missile defense system,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"We remain committed to the ABM treaty," Lockhart told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The ABM accord, reached in 1972, limits both sides' ability to
deploy anti-missile systems. Russia has said it will not make
strategic arms cuts if the ABM is not observed.

PARIS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- France will send its aircraft
carrier Foch to the Adriatic Sea and a dozen Mirage warplanes to
southern Italy in preparation for possible NATO intervention in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Mirage warplanes will leave their bases in France Friday
for the airbase of Istrana in Italy near Venice, Agence
France-Presse quoted official sources as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Five Jaguar reconnaissance planes and one Transall C-160
reconnaissance plane of the French army participating in
monitoring operations in Bosnia are already in the Istrana
airbase.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Foch will leave the navy base in Toulou,
southern France, Monday. It will be accompanied by the Montcalm
anti-submarine frigate, the Sorcouf stealth frigate and the
oil-supplier Meuse.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff of the French Armed Forces said Thursday
that France will deploy the same number of warplanes and aero-navy
forces in Italy and the Adriatic Sea as in October 1998, when NATO
was preparing for possible air strikes against Serb forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
This decision conforms to the engagement made by France after
NATO issued the Order of Activation threatening to bomb Serb
forces in Kosovo, said the chief of staff in a communique.

<HEADLINE> Romania Has New Interior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Constantin Dudu Ionescu was
named late on Thursday as Romania's Interior Minister, replacing
Gavril Dejeu who has just tendered his resignation.
</P>
<P>
After the new Interior Minister had been sworn in, President
Emil Constantinescu said that Constantin Dudu Ionescu's
appointment as an Interior Minister "takes place in a moment when
the institutions of the state of law are threatened in Romania".
</P>
<P>
The President expressed his hope that the new Interior Minister
will do his duties and will ensure that the state's institutions
take actions "in full authority".
</P>
<P>
Constantin Dudu Ionescu is a temporary secretary general of the
main ruling Christian Democratic National Peasant Party and held
office of secretary of state with the Ministry of National
Defense.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the resignation was not given, but many analysts
here believe Dejeu was being held responsible for the miners'
march through the Jiu Strait, the only natural barrier on their
way to the capital, Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of the Interior Ministry failed to stop the miners'
advance as requested, and the miners are getting nearer and nearer
to Bucharest," a cabinet member was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Around 15,000 miners went on strike in January 4 in the Jiu
Valley area, Romania's largest coal field, to demand higher pay
and increased mine subsidies. On Monday, about 10,000 miners began
a protest march to the capital. They are now about 180 kilometers
from the city.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Favors U.N. Presence in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday voiced its favor for "a continued
multidisciplinary presence of the United Nations" in the war-torn
Angola despite U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's recommendation
that the peacekeeping operations be shunt down in the African
country.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council underlines the great importance it
attaches to a continued multidisciplinary presence of the United
Nations under the direction of a representative of the
secretary-general in Angola," said the council in a presidential
statement.
</P>
<P>
The multidisciplinary personnel include peacekeepers,
humanitarian workers and human rights workers, U.N. officials here
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "recognizes that such a continued presence
depends on the safety of United Nations personnel and requires the
agreement of the government of Angola and the cooperation of all
concerned," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council shares the assessment and judgments of
the secretary-general on the political and military situation in
Angola" in his 26-page report presented to the council on January
17, which recommended that the world body withdraw the U.N.
Observer Mission in Angola, known as (MONUA), from the southwest
African nation.
</P>
<P>
"It welcomes the intention of the secretary-general to consult
urgently with the government of Angola on such a United Nations
presence and to report to the council in this regard," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council "expresses its deep regret that
the present political and security situation in the country and
the lack of cooperation, especially by UNITA (the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola), with MONUA have prevented
MONUA from fully carrying out its mandate role," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its alarm at the serious
deterioration in the political and military situation in Angola,"
the statement said. "It reaffirms its belief that lasting peace
and national reconciliation cannot be achieved through military
means."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to send MONUA into Angola on June
30, 1997, with the aim of monitoring the peace process in the
war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been in and out of Angola since 1989. In 1994, it
brokered the Lusaka Protocol that brought a four-year pause in the
country's two-decade-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The war broke out in 1975 after Angola's independence from
Portugal. A 1991 peace accord also collapsed after UNITA rejected
its defeat in the 1992 elections.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls on World to Attend to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council on
Thursday adopted a presidential statement, calling on the
international community to support the Angolan Government in
fulfilling its primary responsibility for the humanitarian needs
of the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement was adopted by the 15-member
Security Council following its closed-door consultations on a
January 17 report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
recommended the world body shut down its peacekeeping operations
in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its profound concern at the
humanitarian impact of the conflict on the Angolan people," the
statement said, "It urges the international community to support
the Government of Angola in fulfilling its primary responsibility
for the humanitarian needs of the Angolan people."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council calls upon all concerned to "concur and
cooperate with United Nations humanitarian assistance activities
on the basis of the principle of neutrality and
non-discrimination, to guarantee the security and freedom of
movement of humanitarian personnel, and to ensure necessary,
adequate and safe access and logistics by land and air, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It urges all concerned to cooperate with the human rights
activities of the United Nations, which help to lay a basis for
lasting peace and national reconciliation," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, said he told the Security Council that "many
humanitarian organizations will be forced to curtail or even halt
their operation" unless the Angolan Government and the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
provided assurances on safety and freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
"If the parties don't cooperate, the conclusion is obvious," he
told reporters. "Are we going to continue letting our staff die in
Angola? Many died already. Obviously not."
</P>
<P>
The fighting and restrictions by the government and UNITA have
prevented U.N. operations in central highland areas controlled by
UNITA, where they are needed most.
</P>
<P>
De Mello said more than half a million people were displaced
from their homes over the last year, road access in the interior
of the country was either nonexistent or unsafe and landmines were
"again being laid in large numbers," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Alleged Arms Supply to UNITA Sores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba Thursday challenged his
Angolan counterpart Eduardo Dos Santos to have frankly provided
all the details to substantiate the allegation that Zambia is
supplying arms and logistical support to the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambia has no intention to engage in hostilities
with Angola or any other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are a secure, honest and peaceful nation and we want to be
frank, let President Dos Santos and the people of Angola tell us,
it is an open invitation, let us know what we have done wrong," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the intelligent and security wings of Zambia,
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) have
already carried out their independent investigations and have
found no truth in the alleged arms deal.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the Zambian president described the allegation as
"extremely sad".
</P>
<P>
Chiluba confirmed that he has received a letter from Angola
accusing his country of supplying arms to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it is extremely sad because Zambia has neither the
political will nor the money to engage in such activities."
</P>
<P>
He said it is unfortunate that the allegation has come up again
 even after the allegation was dispelled by the OAU and the United
Nations verification mission which visited Zambia and Angola last
April.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has no expansive ideas in any other country apart from
developing its economy for the purpose of economic stability, said
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
People who continued to accuse Zambia of supplying arms to
UNITA have a motive of playing down Zambia's role as a mediator in
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to spearhead the peace initiative in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the Angolan government may be acting
emotionally because the war in that country has taken too long.
</P>
<P>
Asked as to whether Zambia is prepared, should Angola decide to
take action, Chiluba said Zambia has no resources to start a war
with any of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that Zambia will defend itself if something
like that happens.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio De Moura said in his letter
dated January 13 to his Congolese (K) counterpart Jean Charles
Otoko Lolakome that "it is with profound disgust that I want to
inform you that the Angolan government has in its possession
credible information that confirms a large involvement of the
Zambian authorities in the logistic and military support sent to
Dr Savimbi in Angola, to perpetuate the war and suffering of the
Angolan people."
</P>
<P>
With this position, the Angolan government vehemently
demonstrates its repulsion and condemnation of the Zambian
government's hostile acts, said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter was circulated to the reporters covering the
regional ministers' meeting held here last week to seek a peaceful
solution to the five-month war in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
As a protest against the alleged support to UNITA, Angola only
sent a delegation led by its ambassador to Zimbabwe Bento Rabeiro
Kabulo to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba expressed Zambia's indignation over the allegation to
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, U.N. secretary general's
representative and various ministers attending the regional
meeting on DRC.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one year ago Angola repeatedly accused some Zambians of
supplying arms through Zambia's territory to UNITA and demanded
the Zambian government take measures to stop the territory from
being used as a springboard for the arms supplies, otherwise
Angola would send troops to Zambia to help its opponents topple
the government.
</P>
<P>
However, OAU Assistant Secretary General Daniel Antonio said
last April that the Angolan government had assured him that Zambia
had not involved in the alleged arms deal with UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after talks with both the Angolan
government and UNITA before visiting Zambia to discuss the
implementation process of the Lusaka peace accord signed in 1994
by The Angolan government and UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Refers Controversial Bills Back to Par't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has referred three controversial bills back to the
National Assembly for reconsideration, the president's office said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three bills are the Tobacco Products Control Amendment
Bill, the Liquor Bill and Broadcasting Bill.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco bill aims to ban smoking in public places and
tobacco advertising and sponsorship, the broadcasting bill seeks
to comprehensively regulate public and private broadcasting in
South Africa, while the liquor bill sets out comprehensive
parameters within which liquor may be sold.
</P>
<P>
The three bills, approved by the National Assembly late last
year, were all heatedly debated.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's office said he was concerned that the broadcasting
bill gave the broadcasting minister an imprecise and potentially
over-broad power to regulate even on matters falling under the
Independent Broadcasting Authority.
</P>
<P>
He had been advised that this exposed the bill to
constitutional attack and that the minister's regulatory power
should be defined and restricted.
</P>
<P>
Mandela believed although the other two bills were
constitutional, sections of them needed to be looked into.
</P>
<P>
Major opposition parties welcomed Mandela's move.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appoints Special Representative for Iraqi Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Thursday announced that Frank Ricciardone would take the
new post of special representative for transition in Iraq, with a
mandate to coordinate opposition to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"He will be assisted by a team that will include both a
military and a political adviser with extensive on-the-ground
experience in the region," Albright said in a speech to the Center
for National Policy, the Washington think-tank which she once
headed.
</P>
<P>
"With the aid of Frank Ricciardone and his team, we will
persist in helping the Iraqi people re-integrate themselves into
the world community by freeing themselves from a leader they do
not want, do not deserve and never chose," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ricciardone, a career diplomat, has been deputy chief of the
mission in Ankara, an important listening post for events in the
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the White House designated seven Iraqi opposition
groups as eligible for U.S. aid. In a report to Congress by
President Bill Clinton, the administration certified that the
seven groups were committed to democratic values, human rights,
Iraq's territorial integrity and peaceful relations with Iraq's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was fulfilling a requirement in last year's Iraqi
Liberation Act, which makes 97 million dollars available for
approved Iraqi opposition groups, mostly in the form of military
material from Pentagon surpluses.
</P>
<P>
The designation is the first step toward disbursing the
assistance, but U.S. officials said it might be some time before
they would decide when to start paying out.
</P>
<P>
The seven groups are the Iraqi National Congress, the Kurdistan
Democratic Party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the
Tehran-based Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq,
the Iraqi National Accord, the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan
and the Movement for Constitutional Monarchy.
</P>
<P>
The report said the seven groups represented a broad spectrum
of opposition to Saddam and the administration would stay in touch
with other groups to see if they met the criteria for designation
and wanted to cooperate with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko: Russia-Belarus Union "Counterbalance" to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Russia and Belarus
could become "an effective counterbalance to the present unipolar,
aggressive trans-Atlantic monopoly," Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has taken a hegemonic stand and given itself
the right to substitute for international organizations,"
Lukashenko told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Russia-Belarus
Union in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said that weak countries cannot survive on their
own, noting that "the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia and air
strikes against other countries show that nobody is taking into
account countries weakened by internal squabbling, countries
without support from their allies," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-Belarus Union could become the core of "a powerful,
economically independent civilized center capable of efficiently
dealing with political problems," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
The union of the two countries will be "the integrative core of
a new Slavic unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Creating a powerful Slavic union is beneficial for Russia and
Belarus not only from the economic point of view," Lukashenko
said. "This is a real opportunity to overcome separatist trends."
</P>
<P>
The union will allow the two countries to coordinate their
foreign policies, including "their positions on the situation
around Kosovo, security issues and control over nuclear weapons,"
Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
He said in mid-1999, treaty will be prepared on the voluntary
unification of Russia and Belarus while "preserving their national
sovereignty."

<HEADLINE> More Missile Batteries to Arrive in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force is expected
to deliver more Patriot missile batteries to Incirlik Air Base in
Adana, southern Turkey in recent days, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A C-5 cargo plane carrying the first Patriot surface-to-air
missile battery ordered by Turkey and 150 U.S. military staff on
Wednesday arrived at the base, where a batch of U.S.-led allied
forces are stationed to oversee the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With a claimed aim of shielding the Kurds in the north and the
Shiite Muslims in the south from being suppressed by the central
government, the U.S. and Britain set up no-fly zones in northern
and southern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has ever since virtually lost control of the areas.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 planes of the allied forces being stationed at the
Incirlik base as part of Operation Northern Watch to patrol the
no-fly zone in the north.
</P>
<P>
Turkey decided to buy the missiles after Baghdad reportedly
renewed threats last week that it might launch missile attacks
against its neighboring countries where the western aircraft are
based.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said the
decision to buy the Patriot missiles was based on the
"developments" in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between the U.S. aircraft taking off from Incirlik and
the Iraqi anti-aircraft units were intense last week as Baghdad
vowed to defy the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. advance team arrived at the base last weekend to prepare
for the missile installation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-made Patriot missile batteries have been already
deployed in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel.

<HEADLINE> France Rules Out Abandoning Nuclear Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday ruled out an
abandoning of nuclear energy as Germany has done, but said it
would seek balanced and diversified energy supplies.
</P>
<P>
"Neither all oil, nor all nuclear, nor all gas -- our energetic
policy should be balanced in its make-up and its orientation,"
said French State Secretary of Industry Christian Pierret
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
France greatly relies on nuclear energy as a source of
electricity power, with 78 percent of its electricity coming from
its 52 nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated the call by French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin that Germany should give France appropriate compensations
for canceling the contracts on nuclear waste recycling.
</P>
<P>
The French state-owned nuclear reprocessing plant Cogema said
that Germany's cancellation of the contracts on sending nuclear
waste to France for recycling will result in a loss of some 30
billion francs (5.2 billion U.S. dollars) for France.
</P>
<P>
"If the cooperation which exists until now is jeopardized,
appropriate compensations should well be found," said Jospin when
attending an economic forum Thursday.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy and Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said Thursday that the government does not plan to stop
reprocessing nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
The government will also not intervene into the cooperation
between the French nuclear energy company Framatome and the German
company Siemens on the future nuclear reactor, the EPR, said
Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
The French Greens, who have joined the Socialist-led
government, have been raising their voice calling for an
abandoning of nuclear energy.

<HEADLINE> Russia on Humanitarian Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian work
should be based on impartiality and not to be used to bring
pressure on parties to a conflict, Russian representative stressed
here on Thursday,
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russia's Permanent Representative to the United
Nations, made the statement when the U.N. Security Council met
this morning on Promoting Peace and Security: Humanitarian
Activities Relevant to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Lavrov said this principle applied to
humanitarian operations and non-governmental organizations (NGOS).
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said when a mission has a humanitarian element, it must
be defined in the mandate, it must be feasible and it must be
properly resourced.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said the two NGOS in northern Iraq operated without
consent of Iraq's Government and in the presence of the
Government's protests, and they illegally crossed the border into
northern Iraq, which undermined the Council's efforts to confirm
the sovereign integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said the Council had never taken a decision on a no-fly
zone in Iraq and attempts to invoke a Council resolution to
justify the unilateral declaration of no-fly zones was improper.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said the Council could not exclude the use of
force in support of humanitarian activities, but concepts such as
humanitarian intervention raised practical questions and questions
of principles.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over attempts to make humanitarian crises
grounds for intervention, without Security Council endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Only the Council could determine whether a situation existed
that was a threat to international peace and security and only the
Council could authorize the use of force, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
That principle of international law could change, but at
present it was outlined in the Charter of the United Nations and
must guide deliberations, and one could hardly provide
humanitarian assistance while violating the Charter and the basis
principles of international law, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Labor Achieves Compromise Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to avoid a split
ahead of the May general elections, the Israeli opposition Labor
Party Thursday reached a compromise over the primary within the
party.
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal, submitted by Labor lawmaker Yossi
Beilin, was approved after tense discussion at the meeting of
Labor central committee Thursday to end an internal dispute over
the primary.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Ehud Barak had proposed that each voter could
choose nine to 11 candidates in the primary for the party's
Knesset (parliament) list, which was opposed by some key party
members.
</P>
<P>
Haim Ramon, who has lots of supporters in the Labor, threatened
to quit the party if the proposal would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The compromise turned out to an alternative method for the
voting: each voter will mark nine to 11 names and grade the first
five.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Ramon and Beilin believe that the new
method will improve their chances of being elected in the top five
on the Knesset list.
</P>
<P>
If Labor wins the coming general elections, the top five will
have better chances to be named as ministers in the next coalition
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon Thursday
announced the arrival of the first shipment of a battery of U.S.
Patriot missiles in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman did not indicate how many Patriot
launchers would be taken to Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey,
but said about 150 soldiers would be deployed there. A battery
contains eight missile launchers.
</P>
<P>
He said the first members from the 69th Air Defense Artillery
Brigade, near Giebelstadt, Germany, had begun arriving at Incirlik
Thursday, accompanied by some Patriot equipment.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United States and British aircraft patroled the
Western-enforced no-fly zone in northern Iraq, set up after the
1991 Gulf War, which, however, was denied by the Iraqi government
as intrusion of its air integrity.
</P>
<P>
Since the four-day bombing raids against Iraq by U.S. and
British missiles in mid-December, there have been up to eight
clashes between U.S. warplanes and Iraqi air defense radar sites.
Tension was mounting. The Turkish government made the request at
this tension-ridden time for the Patriot missiles.
</P>
<P>
Patriot missiles were used in Israel during the Gulf War to
shoot down incoming Iraqi Scud missiles. They are also deployed in
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

"Russia is always ready for cooperation with all interested

the U.N. Security Council and the land-for-security principle,"
Primakov was quoted as telling visiting Israeli Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of Russia, a co-sponsor of the peace process, is an
important factor, Sharon said, adding that Israel is very much
interested in political cooperation with Russia as regards peace
and security in the Middle East, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Sharon arrived here Tuesday on a three-day working visit.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Shilling Weakens Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) - The Kenya Shilling gave in to
relatively heavy U.S. Dollar buying from offshore accounts
Thursday, to its lowest level in the week.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling closed at 61.90/62.10 to the Dollar from
61.55/61.65 at Tuesday's close, according to a source available
here.
</P>
<P>
Commercial dealers said the local units' position was worsened
by lack of Dollar inflows from agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen offshore banks strongly present to buy Dollars,''
said one senior dealer, adding that the Dollar interest was
triggered by foreign investors' selling out of their positions on
treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said a quiet trading session would be expected Friday
and the Shilling would gain some ground next week bolstered by
export revenues that were lacking this week.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya posted a Shilling opening mean
indicative rate of 61.5389 to the Dollar from 61.5222 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Pound and the Euro were at 101.4171 and 71.1503 to the
Shilling respectively against 101.5275 and 71.2472 Tuesday, the
bank noted.

<HEADLINE> UK Key Utilities on Way to Beating Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Key parts of UK infrastructure
services declared Thursday that they were well on the way to
beating the Millennium Bug and ensuring it will be business as
usual over the millennium.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the water, gas, oil, telecoms and
financial industries reported at the National Infrastructure Forum
that the majority of their members had completed testing and had
given the all-clear.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure consistency of approach and enable
comparisons between sectors, Action 2000, the British
government-funded body set up to raise awareness about the
Millennium Bug, has introduced traffic light color coding.
</P>
<P>
Blue was for no "substantive risks of material disruption,"
amber was given for areas that were on course for blue status
within an agreed timescale, and red meant that current planning
would not be sufficient within the agreed timescale.
</P>
<P>
Releasing their interim reports on readiness progress,
regulators of the six key sectors said they had reached the
"amber" stage, meaning they were on track to beat the bug or had
suitable contingency plans in place.
</P>
<P>
Of the six key areas only the electricity and financial sectors
showed any cause for concern, with 2 percent of the electricity
industries not doing enough and "a few reds" in the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
"With just under 11 months to go, these results indicate that
the key infrastructure providers are well on the way to achieving
`blue' status and the `business as usual' objective," Don
Cruickshank, chairman of Action 2000, has noted.
</P>
<P>
The UK's other essential services, including health, emergency
and postal services, food, transport, local government, benefits,
tax, and education will detail their Millennium Bug preparations
by April.

<HEADLINE> Angola Hopes to See Exit of MONUA in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Angolan
diplomat on Thursday openly asked the U.N. Security Council not to
extend the mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA)
in the African country after its current mandate expires on
February 26.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is MONUA presence in Angola," Afanso Van Dunem
"Mbinda", Angolan permanent representative to the United Nations,
said. "That's the question."
</P>
<P>
"So we don't confuse, the U.N. presence (in Angola) is
different from MONUA presence," he told reporters after the
Security Council adopted a presidential statement, which favored
some U.N. presence in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the U.N. is different from the role of MONUA," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan envoy is echoing his government's open stance that
U.N. peacekeepers should leave the the war-torn country after its
mandate expires in late February.
</P>
<P>
"There is no peacekeeping now (in Angola), it is war now
(there), there is no peace to be kept in Angola," he said. "In
this circumstance, do you think we are going to allow people to be
killed by UNITA (the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola)?"
</P>
<P>
"We are not," he said, but he declined to ask a press question
why his government and rebels both held MONUA responsible for
worsening the political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that the outstanding issues need to be
discussed between his government and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has told his envoy in Angola
to urgently contact the government to discuss a future U.N. role
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who has recommended the United Nations pull out
peacekeepers from Angola, also asked African countries and the
three nations overseeing the peace process in Angola -- Portugal,
Russia and the United States -- to use their influence with the
government to allow the United Nations to maintain contact with
the UNITA rebels, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Clinton Trial Harms Foreign Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday cautioned against a lengthy Senate
trial of President Bill Clinton, saying time would be lost in
tending to "the people's business."
</P>
<P>
After a speech to the Center for National Policy, Albright told
reporters, "What bothers me is we have a huge agenda."
</P>
<P>
She said Congress has the authority to try Clinton, but it also
is a partner of the administration in dealing with such problems
as Kosovo, Iraq and the spread of nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
"So any time we are not spending on the people's business
ultimately is time lost," she added.
</P>
<P>
The House impeachment of the president and his current trial in
the Senate is puzzling to foreign leaders, Albright said. "Friends
around the world are kind of amazed this is going on."
</P>
<P>
However, Albright said respect for the United States and its
powers remains very high.
</P>
<P>
Albright will leave Sunday on a six-day trip to five countries:
Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Britain and France. Topping her
agenda is the conflict in Kosovo and the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
One of her important tasks in Moscow will be how to deal with
the question of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), which
was signed in 1972.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen announced Wednesday the
United States will spend an additional 6.6 billion U.S. dollars
over the next five years to deploy a new anti-missile system
against threat from "rogue states."
</P>
<P>
Albright said that she will discuss the ABM treaty and the need
for possible modifications of the accord with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
"We have believed that the ABM treaty is central to our
national interest and to our arms control," she said. "The ABM
treaty has been amended before, and I think it will be essential
to look at how it will be affected."
</P>
<P>
"It has been possible before to abrogate the ABM treaty if
there is supreme national interest," she said. "We have not found
that necessary, neither side has."

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- With no sign the Senate has the votes to remove President
Clinton from office, senators of both parties have launched
informal, behind-the-scenes efforts to find a strategy for
ending the impeachment trial--but no consensus has yet developed
on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
-- Pentagon officials are studying a proposal that would
allow Russia to deploy a new strategic missile with up to three
warheads if,in return, Moscow does not object to U.S. plans to
build a limited national missile defense system at two sites
with up to 200 launchers, according to administration sources.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton said that it is "highly likely" that a
terrorist group would launch or threaten a germ or chemical
attack on American soil within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
-- A day after the Brazilian Congress approved austerity
measures framed by investors as a key test of the country's
commitment to reduce systematic overspending, the country's
currency and stock market fell and fears mounted that Brazil is
running low on dollars to pay for imports, debts and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslavia backed down in a confrontation with NATO,
suspending an order to expel the chief U.S. truce monitor in
Kosovo because he accused Serb forces of massacring 45 ethnic
Albanians last week. Clinton spoke with Britain's Blair and
agreed force should be used if needed to halt Serb attacks.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. plans for a missile defense threaten Russia's security,
Moscow said, and Secretary of State Albright is being dispatched
to Russia this weekend to, among other things, try to allay the
concerns. The White House is insisting that it seeks
modifications to, not the abandonment of, the 1972 ABM treaty.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Postpones Emergency Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Friday afternoon postponed the declaration of a
state of emergency as Prime Minister Radu Vasile began
negotiations with the Jiu Valley Miners' delegation led by Miron
Cozma.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made to create a climate helpful to
negotiations, but whether to declare an emergency state depends
on the negotiation results, according to a statement issued by
the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu announced early Friday morning that a state of
emergency across the whole country would come into effect at 2:00
p.m. local time (12:00 GMT), if the miners refused to return to
work.
</P>
<P>
A government delegation headed by Prime Minister Vasile
arrived at 2:00 p.m. local time in Cozia, a village 15 km from
Ramnicu Valcea city, where the miners spent the night on their
march to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Vasile is now trying to persuade the miners to return home and
end their two-week long strike. But the miners continued
repeating their demands for a pay rise and an end to planned pit
closures.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who had refused to meet with miners unless
they resumed work, decided Friday morning to become directly
involved in talks due to the escalating tension.
</P>
<P>
Around 15,000 miners went on strike on January 4 in the Jiu
Valley area, Romania's largest coal field. On Monday, about
10,000 miners began a protest march to the capital. They are now
about 180 kilometers from the city.
</P>
<P>
Romeo Beja, a senior miners' leader, was quoted in a local TV
report as saying that if the government failed to meet their
demands, they would continue their march toward Bucharest even if
the state of emergency was introduced.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Nets 1.13 Billion Dollars in Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's trade surplus in
December 1998 recorded a slight change from the previous month as
a rise in imports offset a slight increase in exports, Thai News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country registered 1.13 billion U.S. dollars in surplus
compared with 1.16 billion dollars last November. Still, the
surplus was about double that in the same month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Exports in December 1998 were 4.68 billion dollars, up by 2.7
percent from last November, but down 5.1 percent from December
1997, the report quoted the Customs Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
A stronger baht against the dollar has made Thai goods more
expensive in most foreign markets, slowing sales of goods abroad.
</P>
<P>
Computers and parts, electrical appliances and commodities such
as rice, pineapple and rubber are among Thailand's main exports.
The government last month said it would subsidize some
agricultural products to aid farmers.
</P>
<P>
Imports in December 1998 rose 4.6 percent to 3.55 billion
dollars from last November but fell by a third from a year
earlier, reflecting Thailand's worst recession in three decades.
Thailand has now posted trade surpluses for 16 months, after
running deficits through most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance swung into the black after the baht plunged
in value in July 1997, causing demand for foreign products to
drop. While surplus is good for Thailand's external balance
because it generates hard currency needed to refurbish reserves
and help companies pay foreign debt, analysts said it would be
better if the imbalance came from strong exports rather than
limited demand for imports.

ABU DHABI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Hotels operated by
international chains in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Muscat have suffered
a sharp drop in their profits in 1998, while Manama, Kuwait,
Riyadh and Macca showed strong growth.
</P>
<P>
According to a benchmark survey made by Arthur Andersen, a
hotel hospitality consulting firm, the average room yield in
Dubai registered a fall of 18.2 percent, from about 346.90 dirhams
(about 94.8 U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 283.66 dirhams (77.5 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Room yields are calculated by dividing room revenue by rooms
available.
</P>
<P>
The report said room occupancy in Dubai was down by 10.3
percent, from 73.8 percent in 1997 to 66.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In Abu Dhabi, the average room yield was down by 14.2 percent,
from about 70 dollars in 1997 to 60 dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the room occupancy declined by just 1.4 percent last
year from the 59.1 percent recorded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Muscat also took a battering last year with an 18.4 percent
fall in hotels revenues.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait hotels were able to garner 9 percent more revenues in
1998 than the previous year, while Bahrain posted a 9.5 percent

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Warns of Worldwide Deflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Friday asked his country to be prepared for a
possible worldwide deflation.
</P>
<P>
Since there is a high possibility of a worldwide depression in
the future, Malaysia must insure itself against it, Mahathir said
Friday night at the launching of the 50th anniversary logo of the
American International Assurance (AIA) here.
</P>
<P>
"When the bubble bursts we cannot help but be affected. So our
problems are far from over," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the expected deflation did not take place,
there would certainly be other challenges.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Malaysians, who he said are great savers,
disciplined and a hard-working lot who thought that their
well-being and their country were their responsibility, are to
continue with these habits and cultural traits.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides deflation, one of the challenges which
Malaysia may face is the much talked-about globalization or a
borderless world.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting ready to open up our borders. But we are not
getting ready to handle the problems that will come with opening
borders," he said. Malaysia had a foretaste of globalization when
capital was pulled out of the country and the ringgit (the local
currency) was devalued, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said globalization could also be good if it was
regulated just as capital flows could be good if regulated.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that although Malaysia welcomed globalization,
deregulation, liberalization and borderlessness, it must know what
all the mergers and acquisitions and the consolidation of the
foreign corporate giants were all about.
</P>
<P>
"We should welcome globalization but we must ensure that it
will not be open to abuses," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Forces Withdraw from Malanje Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- After two weeks' gunfire and
besiegement by the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), life in Malanje City, capital of Malanje Province
in northern Angola, has returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
The official Angola News Agency said Friday that UNITA forces
have withdrawn from its position outside the city as a result of
fierce resistance on the part of government army and national
police hence only sporadic gun fires could be heard.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources here said, early this week, the
government army has moved large troops from Kwanza-sul and Bie
provinces from central Angola where the defense capabilities have
been strengthened, to reinforce the besieged Malanje City.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the city have started cleaning the streets while
government institutions and shops also resumed business. The food
prices which had been doubled in the black market are obviously
coming down. Thousands of refugees fleeing to the city from
fighting are now back to their residence in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, UNITA forces seized a large part of Malanje
Province and started attacking its capital, making the area the
third largest battle field after Huambo and Kuito cities in
central Angola since the civil war broke out once again in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The intense seesaw fighting has killed over 500 civilians and
wounded more than 300 others.

<P>
CAIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's national airline carrier, the Middle East
Airlines (MEA), lost a total of 70 million U.S. dollars in 1998,
Lebanese Minister of Public Works and Transportation Najib Mikati
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the As Safir newspaper, the minister
suggested that the company, which is mainly owned by the
country's central bank, be privatized.
</P>
<P>
He said he would raise the issue at a cabinet session late
this month.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian exporting companies have signed cotton
exporting contracts with over 37 countries with a contract value
of 227 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contracts covered 2,105,000 kantars (105,250 tonnes) of
various grades of Egyptian cotton, the Cairo daily "Al Ahram"
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Italy, India and Switzerland are in the forefront of countries
importing Egyptian cotton, with cotton contracted at about 560,000
kantars (28,000 tonnes), 341,000 kantars (17,050 tonnes) and
247,000 kantars (12,350 tonnes), respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Cotton Exporters has decided to maintain the
current prices for Egyptian cotton in a bid to preserve stability
in the world market and to attract further demand for the Egyptian
cotton.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Wheat production in Egypt in 1998 has met 50 percent
of the country's domestic needs despite of the rise in population
by about 20 million people from 1982 to 1998, said Egyptian
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili.
</P>
<P>
The area under wheat cultivation increased from 1.3 million
feddans (546,000 hectares) in 1982 to about 2.4 million feddans (1
million hectares) in 1998, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has been working on a new project for producing
bread, the principal food for most of the Egyptians, by using a
mixture of wheat and maize.
</P>
<P>
The project has been extensively tested by the Food Technology
Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Institute of
the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Domestic demand for meat in Saudi Arabia is expected
to reach 974,000 tonnes by 2001, up by 18.6 percent as compared to
the 1997 consumption of some 821,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey issued on Thursday by the Saudi Establishment
for Consultative Services shows that the demand for white meat in
2001 will reach 652,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the demand for red meat is estimated at 322,000
tonnes of which 179,000 tonnes will be locally provided.
</P>
<P>
The value of imported meat, both red and white, during the
period of 1993 to 1997 amounted to some 8.4 billion rials (2.24
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Meets to Discuss Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from member
states of the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia met in London on
Friday to try to seek a diplomatic solution to the latest crisis
in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held as the situation intensified over last
Friday's recovery of bodies of ethnic Albanians in the village of
Racak. Belgrade said the corpses belonged to terrorists, but
Foreign observers said they were victims of a Serb massacre.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy met in the British Foreign Office, discussing
the next move in the province.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to work out a paper on the future of Kosovo
which could lead up to a ministerial meeting in London next
Friday to issue formal invitations to peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The group will also hold separate talks next week with ethnic
Albanian leaders and with the Belgrade government if they could
get a new momentum into the political process in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Despite its denial of the massacre in Racak, the Yugoslav
government has allowed a Finnish forensic medial team to examine
the corpses and suspended a former decision to expel the chief
international ceasefire monitor in Kosovo, William Walker, easing
the immediate risk of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
However, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said earlier in
an interview with the BBC radio that NATO was ready to take
military action if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic did not
halt Serb attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to take military action, military action must be in
support of a clear political demand and a clear political
process. Today, we are going to agree on what that political
process should be," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group had developed a detailed document proposing
that Kosovo have its own internal government, be in charge of its
own police, have free elections and have its status reviewed
after three years, according to Cook.
</P>
<P>
Western governments have been demanding that Milosevic allow
officials of the U.N. war crimes tribunal into Kosovo to
investigate the killings and withdraw more security forces from
the southern Serbian province in keeping with an October
agreement with NATO.

<HEADLINE> France's Arms Sales See Sharp Rise in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- French arms sales abroad hit 50
billion francs (nine billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, the highest
since 1985 when France sold 60.8 billion francs (10 billion U.S.
dollars) of armaments.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro newspaper Friday quoted defense ministry
sources as saying that nearly half of revenues from arms sales
last year came from deals struck with the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) for the sale of 30 Mirage 2000-9 warplanes produced by the
Dassault Aviation, and air-to-air missiles and cruise missiles
produced by the Matra Haute Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
The two deals alone brought France a total of 28 billion
francs (5.04 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
France earned 19.6 billion francs (about 3.3 billion dollars)
and 30.2 billion francs (five billion dollars) from arms sales in
1996 and 1997 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Terror Attack in US likely: NY Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) - U.S. President Bill Clinton
said a biological or chemical attack was "highly likely" to be
threatened or carried out in the U.S. within the next few years,
the New York Times reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was "a near certainty" that "there will be some group,
probably a terrorist group, that attempts to bring to bear either
the use or the threat of a chemical or biological operation",
Clinton told the newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that is highly likely to happen sometime in the
next few years," he said, adding that he had been persuaded by
intelligence reports that the United States needed to bolster its
defenses.
</P>
<P>
"I want to raise public awareness of this," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that any biological or chemical attack would
prompt "at least a proportionate if not a disproportionate
response".
</P>
<P>
He said he was considering a Pentagon proposal to establish a
commander-in-chief for the defense of the continental United
States and would propose 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in the next
budget to fight biological, chemical and computer-related
terrorism attacks.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Refuses to Meet with British Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has decided to call off his only scheduled meeting with
visiting British envoy on Cyprus, David Hannay, due Friday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency, the decision was made in
response to what seemed to be diplomatic gaffes made by the envoy
upon his arrival at Larnaca airport Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the British High Commissioner to Cyprus David
Madden, Clerides protested against the envoy's remarks, which have
been described by Cyprus government spokesman Christos Stylianides
as "unfortunate statements."
</P>
<P>
Hannay's mission was to consult with British ambassadors to
Cyprus, Greece and Turkey on the Cyprus issue. Asked by reporters
at the airport, he termed Cypriot government's acceptance of the
U.N. Security Council resolution 1218 as a "tactical manoeuvre,"
aimed at reciprocal moves from the Turkish side.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted last December, prolongs U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan's good offices mission in Cyprus in search of a
peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
Hannay also complained that there has been "excessive
concentration on matters of forms and not enough of focus on
matters of substance" in the talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was originally set to hold talks with Hannay at a
dinner with Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides and Undersecretary
to the President, Pantelis Kouros, attending.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying for decades to
reunite the island through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation
formula, but attained little progress.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Bans Obscene Phone Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Raunchy telephone sex lines
have been banned in China's capital of Beijing after
telecommunication authorities clamped down on the growing number
of commercial firms using the telephone network to offer sexual
advice and other salacious services.
</P>
<P>
In a circular,they have also ordered the closure of two
telephone information companies on the grounds that the contents
of their services were "vulgar and unhealthy" and were having a
bad influence on the public.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 15 such telephone information providers in
Beijing. In a bid for quick profits and more customers they are
providing a sex advice service or offering character and
horoscope forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The cost of these services can be as high as fifteen times the
normal call rate, reaching three yuan (about 0.36 US dollars) per
minute.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city telecommunication administration set 30
yuan as the maximum monthly payment such services can take from
each private home phone. But the restriction is not imposed on
public telephones.
</P>
<P>
Two security guards at the environmental protection bureau in
Haidian District were found calling the service using company
phones during their night shifts in November and December, which
accumulated telephone bills of 37,000 yuan and 38,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The circular issued today also bans telephone horoscopes and
character assessments by telephone declaring them to be
superstitious activities and not in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
All telephone information services must ensure that they keep
unhealthy and obscene information off their business lines, the
circular warned.

<HEADLINE> East China City Bans Styrofoam Fast Food Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The ban on the use of styrofoam
fast food containers was confirmed today in Fuzhou, capital of
Fujian Province, because authorities say they are a major source
of pollution.
</P>
<P>
An official with the city's environmental protection bureau
said that the booming fast-food business in the city in recent
years has resulted in increasing numbers of such disposable
containers, averaging 1.5 million every month.
</P>
<P>
The white boxes cannot, mostly, be recycled and are causing
severe problems for environmental protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
In its fight against such pollutants, Fuzhou issued
regulations prohibiting their manufacture, sales or use two years
ago. Since then it has punished or fined one hundred or so
illegal manufacturers or others involved in using them, the
official revealed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of
Pakistan and Turkmenistan will visit Afghanistan next week to
launch joint efforts for restoration of lasting peace in the
war-shattered country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz and his Turkmen
counterpart, Sheikh Muradov, who is arriving here Monday on a
three-day visit to Pakistan, will proceed to the Afghan Taliban
militia's stronghold of Kandahar next week, official sources said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
During their visit, the two foreign ministers will hold talks
with Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar, the militia's
official in charge of foreign affairs Mullar Hasan Akhund and
other senior Taliban officials, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said it is not yet known if the Pak-Turkmen joint
peace mission would meet opposition or not.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Turkmenistan agreed to launch joint efforts for a
peaceful settlement of the long-standing Afghan imbroglio during
Pakistani Minister of State Siddique Khan Kanju's visit to
Turkmenistan in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, diplomatic efforts in the region will
intensify in the coming couple of weeks to promote a negotiated
settlement of the Afghan turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, the United Nations and Central Asian states will hold
extensive consultations on ways and means to end the 20-year civil
war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen foreign minister's trip to Pakistan is part of
Islamabad's endeavor to coordinate efforts with the Central Asian
republics to restore durable peace in Afghanistan, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said the U.N. secretary-general's
special envoy on Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, will embark on an
extensive tour of Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian countries
later this month or next month as part of the consultations on the
Afghan turmoil.

MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Friday that he was pleased with both the bilateral
and international development of Russian-Chinese cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"It would hardly be fair to look at Russia's foreign policy in
1998 as more oriented to the West," Ivanov told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian trend in Russia's foreign policy, if it is analyzed
in progression, was not only comparable with the European trend,
but was even more dynamic," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This holds true above all in Russian-Chinese ties," Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow "attaches great significance" to the upcoming
visit by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, adding that the visit,
scheduled for late February, would "give a fresh impetus to
bilateral relations".
</P>
<P>
Russia was making intensive preparations for the visit "in
trade, economic, and military spheres", the minister said.

HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Three bags containing a

HANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Zhejiang Province has
suffered from a decline in overseas investment in recent years
but rallied last year, with the number of overseas-funded
projects increasing by 13.3 percent to 965.
</P>

Contracts about the projects were worth 1.83 billion U.S.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Get World Bank Loan by Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a
structural adjustment loan of 350 million U.S. dollars to Pakistan
which will be dispersed by next Monday, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the disbursement of the World Bank loan, Pakistan's
foreign exchange reserves would reach 1.65 billion dollars, Dar
told the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves on Friday reached 1.3
billion dollars for the first time after the nuclear tests in May
last year.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the government has a plan now to pay up quickly the
amount of debt arrears accumulated in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
He said the approval of the loan by the World Bank Executive
Board Thursday demonstrated the confidence of international
financial institutions in the policies and programs of the
Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
He also said the main objectives of the latest agreement with
the International Monetary Fund are consistent with the national
agenda of economic and social reforms to accelerate the pace of
economic growth, ensure macroeconomic and financial stability and
improve the climate for more savings and investments.
</P>
<P>
The targets set under the agreement for the medium term include
5- to 6-percent annual growth rate in GDP, reduction in the rate
of inflation to 6 percent and gradual reduction in current account
deficit to less than 1.5 percent of GDP, Dar noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that under consideration are also reduction in
dependence on external loans, improvement in the rate of domestic
savings from 12 to 16 percent of GDP, reduction in budget deficit
to 3.3 percent of GDP and rapid increase in the availability and
quality of social services.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the targets set under the agreement, Dar said,
structural changes would be made in the economic and social
sectors.

BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has achieved
successful results in the control of air pollution, thanks to the
introduction of a series of timely and effective measures, the
city environmental protection bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
Beginning December last year, the city has promoted 18
measures to control local air pollution caused by coal burning,
exhaust emissions from autos, and dust and floating dirt
particles.

<P>
The city intends to replace coal burning with oil and gas
fired heating systems. And autos with exhaust emissions above
approved standard levels are now forbidden to enter local
downtown areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Romanian Prime Minister to Meet Striking Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister
Radu Vasile decided on Friday to become directly involved in
talks with striking miners of Jiu Valley in a last-ditch attempt
to avert more violent confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Vasile, who has till now refused to meet with miners unless
they resumed work, had to make the concession due to the
escalating tension.
</P>
<P>
The national TV station reported that Vasile had left the
capital by car this morning for Cozia, a village near Ramnicu
Valcea, where the miners spent the night on their march to
Bucharest. He was accompanied by Finance Minister Decebal Remes
and a secretary of state to the Industry and Commerce Minister.
</P>
<P>
A government delegation led by the Minister of Labor Alexandru
Athanasiu went to Ramnicu Valcea on Thursday to negotiate with
the miners, but was turned away by miners' leader Miron Cozma,
who said he only wanted to talk with Vasile.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the striking miners, after a bloody clash
with the security forces in the area, managed to push through the
blockade set to stop their advance to Bucharest from
Ramnicu-Valcea, reported the Rompres news agency.
</P>
<P>
About 70 people from both sides were hospitalized with
injuries, including several in very critical condition, local
hospital sources said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said it was the worst crisis to hit the country
since Cozma's miners assaulted the government headquarters in
September 1991 and forced then Prime Minister Petre Roman to step
down.
</P>
<P>
Given the grave situation, Romania's President Emil
Constantinescu decided this morning to impose a state of
emergency across the whole nation, effective at 2:00 P.M. if
miners refuse to retreat to their Jiu Valley coal field.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency will come into force immediately, if
the ultimatum is not observed and miners try to move towards any
other direction than indicated, the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency restricts civil liberties and allows
authorities to use tougher measures against the violent miners,
but Romeo Beja, a senior miners' leader was quoted in a local TV
report as saying that the miners would continue their march
toward Bucharest even if the state of emergency was introduced.
</P>
<P>
Around 15,000 miners went on strike on January 4 in the Jiu
Valley area, Romania's largest coal field, to demand big pay
rises and an end to planned pit closures. On Monday, about 10,000
miners began a protest march to the capital. They are now about
180 kilometers from the city.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Interior Gavril Dejeu was dismissed on Thursday,
following the successive failures of the law enforcement forces
to stop the miners from approaching Bucharest.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Has Highest PC Ownership Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- About 50 percent of Sweden's
4.1 million households have their own personal computers, the
highest PC ownership rate in the world, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of 1.46 million PCs were sold in Sweden, up
55 percent from a year earlier, and half of them were bought for
domestic use. Sweden is now also leading in the updating of PCs,
the study claimed.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also predicted healthy sales this year with an
expected rise of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to another survey conducted by the Stelacon Company,
the number of Internet clients also shot up in Sweden last year,
accounting for 67 percent of all PC households. As proof of the
trend that people are moving towards making more commercial
transactions over the Internet, net purchases last year surpassed
100 million U.S. dollars.

GUANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The first firm in China
involved in infrared thermal imaging technology research,
development and production was set up on January 21 in this
capital of Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
It will be jointly operated by a local hi-tech company, a Hong

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Continues to Attract More Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai attracted increased
investments from the United States and European countries last
year to counteract the dramatic drop in funds flowing from Asia.
</P>
<P>
The city's contracted overseas capital grew 9.92 percent on a
yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Municipal Overseas Investment
Commission show that Shanghai signed 1,490 contracts involving
overseas capital of 5.84 billion U.S. dollars, with 60 percent of
the funds coming from the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attributes this to the city's efforts to
optimize its overseas investment structure.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has substantially approved real estate projects since
the beginning of 1998 to counteract the glut facing the sector.
On the other hand, however, the city encouraged investments in
key areas such as agriculture, infrastructure construction and
new and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also selected more than 110 small and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises for cooperation with
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
As a result, overseas funds flowing into the manufacturing
sector jumped 32.7 percent and accounted for 70 percent of total
investments. Over half of the new overseas-funded projects in
1998 were wholly overseas-funded, with 84 projects involving an
investment of over 10 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has so far approved a total of 18,800 overseas-funded
projects.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Down for December 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in Hong Kong
registered a decline of 1.6 percent in December 1998 over a year
earlier, according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures
released today by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Compared with November 1998, the Composite CPI for December
decreased by 0.7 percent. For the fourth quarter of 1998, the
Composite CPI fell by an average of 0.8 percent over the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1998, the Composite CPI was on average
2.8 percent higher than that in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman noted that the further distinct easing
in consumer prices in December 1998, while largely resulting from
the weak local consumer demand, was equally a reflection of the
expeditious cost/price adjustment in the economy to weather the
impact of the regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
To a certain extent, this easing was also attributable to the
freezing in government fees and charges and in a number of public
utility charges in 1998, as well as the one-off rates rebate by
the government effective in the fourth quarter, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was virtually no price pressure from external
sources, as import prices continued to be soft generally, the
spokesman added.

MACAO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior police officers from
Macao and China's Guangdong Province said here today that they
would strengthen cooperation in cracking down on cross-border
crimes, especially illegal migration and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Soares Monge, secretary for security of Macao, and Chen
Shaoji, director of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security
Department, expressed the consensus at the 31st regular meeting
of Guangdong and Macao security officials.
</P>
<P>
The two officials vowed that they would make greater efforts
to ensure Macao's smooth transition and hand-over.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that to manage public security well is rather
important, for Macao is returning to the motherland soon.
</P>
<P>
He added that his department has been supporting Macao police
in combating crimes and safeguarding public security and will
give Macao utmost support if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a Chinese idiom, Chen gave a serious warning to
criminals: "Good is rewarded with good and evil with evil; if the
reward is not forthcoming, it is because the time has not yet
come."

<HEADLINE> Israeli DM Fails to Register for Likud Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai on Friday failed to register for primaries in
the ruling Likud Party, signaling that he may quit the party soon.
</P>
<P>
Likud spokeswoman Ronit Eckstein said that 87 candidates have
registered but Mordechai was not among them. The primary
elections of the Likud Party are due to be held in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
However, Likud could still place Mordechai on the candidate
list by a special decision, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for registering was set at noon, and at that time
Mordechai was reportedly holding talks with leaders of the
newly-formed centrist party in Tel-Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio quoted local political observers as saying that
Mordechai may lead the centrist party if he decides to join it.
</P>
<P>
Results from the a public opinions poll issued by the centrist
party on Friday show that Mordechai could defeat Netanyahu in the
elections for premiership slated for May 17.
</P>
<P>
If Mordechai leaves the Likud Party, he will quit as defense
minister too, said political observers.
</P>
<P>
As a popular politician in Israel, Mordechai's defection would
be a severe blow to Netanyahu's re-election chances.

<HEADLINE> China's Building Materials Industry Hit by Asian Economic Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's building materials
industry suffered losses in 1998 because of the Southeast Asian
financial crisis, whose impact was much more severe than the
industry expected.
</P>
<P>
Lei Qianzhi, deputy director-general of China's State
Administration of Building Materials Industry, told a press
conference today that about half the state-owned building
materials companies were operating in the red last year, and
total industry losses amounted to a billion yuan, the same as for
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The currency devaluations in Southeast Asia made exports so
competitive that China lost almost all its cement and plateglass
market in the region, Lei says. In the first six months of 1998,
cement prices fell 30 percent on the China market, while
plateglass was selling for less than it cost to produce.
</P>
<P>
The building materials industry saw its losses increasing by
400 million yuan in the first half of 1998 from the same period
of the previous year, but, thanks to increased government sp
ending on roads, railways, and construction projects in the
latter half, the industry stopped a 20-month stretch of losses in
September. Prices bottomed out that month and rose steadily in
the last four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year, the industry had a five percent increase
in industrial output over the previous year, which was below the
national economic growth rate. To compensate for the loss of
traditional markets in Southeast Asia, the industry began looking
at the U.S. and Africa and got contracts on building three cement
plants in Africa, with discussions on several other cement and
glass plants underway.
</P>
<P>
From January to September 1998, it exported 2.91 million tons
of cement to the U.S., accounting for over 44 percent of cement
exports for the period and earned more than 2.1 billion U.S.
dollars from exports.
</P>
<P>
Lei said that since last September the industry has shown a
strong comeback momentum and the slump in glass prices since 1996
has been stopped.
</P>
<P>
China will cut its cement production capacity by 40 million
tons this year and cut another 60 million tons in 2000. It plans
to close 257 small glass plants and cut glass production capacity
by 1.5 million tons over the next two years. It expect to produce
520 million tons of cement and 8.5 million tons of glass this
year, equal to last year's output.

<HEADLINE> Panda Cuts Up Rough Because of Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Food may have to be airlifted
in for a giant panda in a zoo in Haikou who apparently hates the
bitter taste of bamboo in this warm, southern region of China and
it has become very aggressive because of its hunger.
</P>
<P>
Since arriving at the zoo in the capital of Hainan Province,
from the Wolong Nature Reserve in southwest Sichuan Province, the
ten-year old panda called "Zhuanzhuan" has snarled at a visitors
and sightseers and ripped two plastic water containers to shreds,
according to zookeepers who say he was timid at first.
</P>
<P>
The panda, called "Zhuanzhuan" has virtually eaten nothing for
two days and zoologist Tang Chunxian who came from Sichuan with
him to ensure he settled in, says he is starving.
</P>
<P>
Pandas only eat bamboo shoots, usually equivalent to their own
weight every day, and are very choosy about food. "This is why he
is losing his temper," explained Tang.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are sensitive to climate and food and it takes a
couple of days for these rare animals to get used to new
environments.
</P>
<P>
But Tang said, "If Zhuanzhuan cannot adjust himself and eat
the bamboo here in the next few days, we might have to airlift in
food from his native Sichuan."
</P>
<P>
As pandas like cool and wet climates, the zoo in Haikou has
now also installed air-conditioners in his new residence.

<HEADLINE> HK Economy Soon to Recover, Says Movado's Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- It won't be long, probably
after about another 15 or 18 months, before Hong Kong recovers
from the current economic slow-down, Gedalio Grinberg, chairman
of renowned Swiss watchmaker Movado Group Inc. has predicted.
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, we had undergone many recessions, as
often as every five to ten years, but normally we come out. So
you will also see a very strong recovery here," the American
businessman said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Grinberg, 67, was in Hong Kong at the last stop of his eastern
Asian trip which included Japan and China. He had visited Beijing
and Shanghai, where he signed a memorandum with the National
Ballet of China.
</P>
<P>
Grinberg described the move as marking "the commencement of a
friendly agreement between the two parties."
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Movado will, starting from February
this year, support as one of the sponsors the Chinese ballet
group in fields including training, practice and performance, as
well as cultivating more ballet lovers in the country through
joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Born in Cuba, Grinberg became the exclusive Cuban distributor
of famous timepieces Omega and Piaget. After his settlement in
the United States in 1960, the sophisticated marketer acquired
Movado in 1983 and gradually reformed the small Swiss watchmaker
into a world-recognized brand.
</P>
<P>
Grinberg said he had realized the marketing potential of
associating the famed brand with cultural pursuits. In the United
States, the company has been a principal benefactor of the
American Ballet Theater since 1986 and Grinberg is now a trustee
of the troupe.
</P>
<P>
Grinberg emphasized that the cooperation with the National
Ballet was the first step of Movado's China Tour. The company,
with its brand as one of the most sought after ones in China
during the 1920s, is exploring opportunities to work with various
charity groups for future plans, which will be finalized and
announced later this year.
</P>
<P>
The successful watchmaker said that his discussions with
National Ballet leaders including Director Zhao Ruheng were very
fruitful, which will lead to some Movado-sponsored performances
such as the famous Red Detachment of Women and two others set for
early February.
</P>
<P>
"There is no limit for the length of this cooperation. We hope
it will be forever," Grinberg said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties Agree on Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Two minor parties in Nigeria, the
Alliance for Democracy (AD) and the All People's Party (APP), have
agreed on alliance terms that will allow them present a joint
candidate for the February 27 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports Friday, Udenta Udenta, the national
secretary of AD, told reporters in Nigerian capital Abuja Thursday
that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been
formally informed of the development.
</P>
<P>
He said the two parties would also field joint candidates for
the National Assembly election scheduled for February 20.
</P>
<P>
The alliance has been criticized by the People's Democratic
Party (PDP), which won overwhelming victories in the local
government and state house of assembly elections held earlier.
</P>
<P>
Its national chairman Solomon Lar told reporters in Abuja
Thursday that the alliance is unholy and illegal, as it is against
the electoral guidelines released by the INEC.
</P>
<P>
The PDP national secretary Ekwesilieze Nwodo said the party has
lodged an official protest with the INEC and got assurance that
the commission is also against the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We have done our investigation and research into the
illegality of the issue and we have contacted INEC and from their
response, they too are convinced about the illegality of this
matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
Thursday, INEC's Deputy Director of Public Affairs Ibrahim Niu
called the alliance "a very hypothetical situation" and said the
INEC will take its decision when that happens.
</P>
<P>
INEC chairman Ephraim Akpata has said earlier that a
presidential candidate can only run the platform of one party.

afternoon.
</P>
<P>
All candidates and political parties contesting the elections

Dissanayake.
</P>
<P>
Seven political parties and three independent groups will

</P>
<P>
All voters should take with them the official polling card sent

the polling card, they should call their respective polling
stations and obtain the ballot paper.
</P>
<P>
The National Identity Card or any other document to prove their
identity will be very useful, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He has also advised voters to leave the polling stations
immediately after casting their votes.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner added that all steps will be taken to hold a
peaceful election as incidents of election-related violence have
risen to more than 600 since nominations last December.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Urged to Enhance Illegal Logging Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The international
environmental group Global Witness urged the Cambodian government
Friday to take tough measures to crack down illegal logging,
warning that forests will be logged out by 2003.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Friday, Global Witness praised Prime
Minister Hun Sen's political will to crack down on illegal
logging.
</P>
<P>
"This gives real optimism for the future of Cambodia's forests
and should impress the international community," said Global
Witness' Patrick Alley.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Global Witness is calling on the international
community at the Consultative Group meeting in Tokyo on February
25 and 26 to impose positive conditionality based on
performance-related criteria relating to logging.
</P>
<P>
Before 1969, the country's forest cover accounted for 75
percent of the total land area and natural disasters as flooding
and drought occurred only occasionally about one every 10 to 15
years. Nowadays the forest cover has shrunk to less than 35
percent.

<HEADLINE> France Launches Campaign Against Hepatitis C </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- France is launching a four-year
national campaign against the epidemic disease, hepatitis C,
which has infected 550,000 to 600,000 people in the country, or
one percent of the French population.
</P>
<P>
The French State Secretary of Health and Social Action Bernard
Kouchner said on Friday that the campaign would reinforce control
of hepatitis C through detection, treatment, prevention and
research.
</P>
<P>
The French government would spend 16 million francs (three
million U.S. dollars) in fighting the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the use of drug needles remains the major
channel of transmission of the virus of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 to 30 percent of the patients suffering from hepatitis
C recover without treatment, while the rest develop chronic
hepatitis diseases, including cirrhosis of the liver.

<HEADLINE> Body of Alleged DPRK Submarine Crewman Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea on Friday recovered
the body of a crewman of a submarine allegedly from the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which was sunk by
the South Korean Navy last month.
</P>
<P>
A deep sea recovery vehicle, in charge of salvaging the craft,
found the body attached to the rear of the vessel with its head
completely decomposed, a South Korean Navy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On December 18 last year, a South Korean Navy vessel spotted
the submarine, which was reportedly capable of carrying eight
crew members, off the coast of South Cholla province and sank it
after a seven-hour chase and exchange of fire.
</P>
<P>
After a month-long search, the navy found the 12-meter-long
craft in waters 150 meters deep, about 100 kilometers south off
South Korea's Koje Island last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has denied knowledge of the submarine, claiming it
is a South Korean plot to discredit the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Overseas Investment in Travel Agencies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China is encouraging overseas
investors to establish jointly invested travel agencies in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to further expand the opening of the tourism sector
to the outside world and to promote the growth of China's tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Procedures for Overseas-Invested Travel Agencies,
was jointly issued by the National Tourism Administration and the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on December 2,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Overseas applicants must be involved in international travel
services, or a wholly-owned enterprise running international
travel service, must have an annual tourism turnover of at least
50 million US dollars, have joined international or their
respective national computer booking networks, or have set up
their own inhouse network, and should have full membership of
their respective officially recognized national tourism
associations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese partners must also be involved in international travel
services, and demonstrate that they have had over 300,000
overseas customers for three years running prior to their
application. They must also have annual tourism turnover of at
least 50 million yuan (about 6.04 million US dollars), and should
have full membership of China's tourism associations.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that the registered capital of a
jointly-invested travel agency must be at least five million yuan
(about 604,000 US dollars), and the joint venture should be one
of limited liability, with the Chinese side holding at least 51
percent of shares.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the legal representative of the joint venture
shall be appointed by the Chinese side, and the venture must have
a proper and approved place of business, facilities and
personnel. The term of the joint venture will be for a maximum of
20 years.

<P>
An overseas partner can only establish one joint venture with
a Chinese partner and no subsidiary is allowed in the interim
period.
</P>
<P>
The business scope of a joint travel service includes China
travel for overseas tourists and domestic travel. The business of
Chinese nationals traveling overseas, including the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, Macao and Taiwan, is excluded.
</P>
<P>
Special travel services and travel for various specific
destinations must first obtain approval from the State Tourism A
dministration and other departments.
</P>
<P>
Investors from the Hong Kong SAR, Macao and Taiwan will enjoy
the same treatment as investors from other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is only one jointly-invested travel agency in
China. The Yunnan-Litian Travel Service was set up last May in
southwest China's Yunnan Province, jointly funded by Dietherm Co.
of Switzerland and the China International Travel Service (CITS)
and the Yunnan Travel Company Ltd. with a registered capital of
one million US dollars, 51 percent of which came from the Chinese
partner.
</P>
<P>
Dietherm is the general agent of 30-odd European travel agents
operating in Southeast Asia, while the CITS is the largest travel
agency in China.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sets 1st Execution in 23 Years on Feb. 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Justice Secretary
Serafin Cuevas Friday announced that the execution of child rapist
Leo Echegaray, the first in 23 years in the country, has been set
on February 5.
</P>
<P>
Cuevas said he received the official transmission from Judge
Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Cuevas said they have enough time to make the necessary
preparations for the execution of Echegaray by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
Echegaray had been set to be executed on January 4, 1998, but
the Supreme Court stayed the execution and postponed it to June
15, 1998, to allow the congress to consider the review of the law
restoring the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court lifted the temporary retraining order after
the congress voted not to review the law.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court then directed Judge Ponferrada to set the
date of Echegaray's execution without further delay.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian, Singapore FMs Urged to Convene Urgent Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Syed Hamid Albar and his Singapore counterpart S. Jayakumar have
been urged to convene an urgent meeting to resolve outstanding
differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Making the appeal in a statement issued here Friday, Malaysia's
opposition leader and Democratic Action Party (DAP)
Secretary-General Lim Kit Siang said "If the ministers of the two
governments cannot resolve their differences through negotiations,
then the two governments should consider submitting their disputes
to an international mediation or arbitration commission."
</P>
<P>
Lim said the commission could be set up under ASEAN or some
other international framework to set an example for the civil
settlement of disputes among neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the majority of the peoples of Malaysia and
Singapore wanted both countries to maintain close and proper
relations rather than continually confronting each other with
"hammer and tongs".
</P>
<P>
The outstanding issues between the two neighbors include the
dispute over Malaysia's customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ)
facilities at the Tanjong Pagar rail station in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which broke out last August when Singapore shifted
its CIQ facilities from the Tanjong Pagar station to its northern
Woodlands checkpoint on August 1 while Malaysia's immigration
continues to operate from there, took a new twist when Jayakumar
reportedly told the Singapore Parliament Wednesday that Malaysia
must recognize Singapore's sovereignty over the Tanjong Pagar
issue first before the two countries could proceed to resolve all
outstanding bilateral issues as a package.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Jayakumar's statement, Syed Hamid said Thursday
Malaysia has never disputed Singapore's sovereignty, and the
question of Malaysia disputing Singapore's sovereignty did not
arise.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Kuala Lumpur's position was that all
outstanding issues with Singapore, including the dispute and
Malaysia's water supply to Singapore, should be settled as a
package as agreed on earlier by both countries.

<HEADLINE> Institute Predicts S. Korea's Return to Economic Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Different from the South Korean
government's optimistic economic forecasts for 1999, Hyundai
Research Institute warned Friday that the nation may slip back
into recession in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest recovery in key indicators is merely a reaction to
last year's deep recession and the economy may spiral further
downward toward the end of the year, the institute, a think-tank
of Hyundai Group, said in a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Possible instability in the local financial sector, combined
with unpredictable external factors, such as looming financial
crises in Russia and Latin America, may stand in the way of an
early economic rebound," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai institute urged the government to refrain from
forcibly pushing down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
It said that artificial interest-rate cuts may seriously
weaken the financial markets, subsequently worsening the credit
crunch and delaying the overall restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
The government should maintain their efforts to stimulate the
economy to promote consumption gradually, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report came amid increasingly optimistic speculation,
particularly by the government, that South Korea's economy will
soon bottom out and resume a sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and Economy and the central Bank of
Korea said the economy will recover in the second half of this
year with a yearly gross domestic product (GDP) growth reaching 2
to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have been approaching an optimal level in view
of current economic conditions and the stable exchange rate of
the Korean currency also properly reflects the changing market
situations, Minister of Finance and Economy Lee Kyu-sung told a
group of business managers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's economic recovery is likely to come more rapidly
than expected, as the latest macroeconomics trends are not
bubbles but a reflection of renewed industrial vigor, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry will maintain interest rates at low levels
throughout the year to boost consumption and investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, South Korea will regain its sustainable
growth potential of 4 to 5 percent, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish National Poison Control Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A national poison control
center is to be set up in China's capital which will be the
headquarters of a help service for such cases.
</P>
<P>
Due to becoming operational within two months, the center will
be linked with local disease control departments. It plans to
provide toxic-related information, antidotes and hospital
facilities, while conducting research into toxicants, according
to Sun Chengye, one of those establishing the center.
</P>
<P>
Through hotlines and the Internet, medics and the public can
get information about more than 3,000 kinds of toxic materials,
including chemical products, pesticides and toxic animals and
plants.
</P>
<P>
"The center will also seek help from similar leading overseas
centers, if necessary," Sun added.
</P>
<P>
Lack of a highly-effective help network has often hindered
local medics from diagnosing and giving proper treatment to
poisoned people in recent years, even though similar institutions
have been established to serve the chemical industry, army and
several provinces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Death tolls caused by injuries and poisoning were only
slightly less than cancer, cerebral illnesses, heart attacks and
respiratory diseases, statistics from the Ministry of Health
suggested in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest poisoning case occurred in east China's Jiangxi
Province late December, killing two people and making some 200
hospitalized after they ate contaminated lard.
</P>
<P>
Diagnosis and treatment were delayed because local hospitals
failed to detect the toxicant, organic stannum, Sun explained.
</P>
<P>
The center, established at the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine, will also initiate publicity activities in a bid to
increase public awareness of self-protection.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health is working on an action plan which aims
to teach grass-roots medical workers how to deal with poisoning
cases. A book to increase ordinary people's understanding of
toxication-prevention will also be published this year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope tragedies like the lard poisoning incident in Jiangxi
won't happen again after the center is opened," Sun says.

<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China has increased the number
of telephones in use, with one phone for every ten people in
1998, the Ministry of Information Industry reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to MII statistics, there were 27.7 phones for every
100 urban residents in China at the end of 1998, and a national
average of 10.64 phones for every 100 people.

</P>
<P>
Mobile phone use increased nearly 80 percent last year, 3
times the growth rate for fixed phones.
</P>
<P>
There are 2 mobile phones for every 100 Chinese, making China
the third largest user of mobile phones in the world.
</P>
<P>
In Guangdong province, more than 30,000 households have two or
more mobile phones each.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the number of phone customers in China increased by
28.34 million from 1997, with mobile phones accounting for more
than 11 million.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges People to Maintain Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Friday urged his people to maintain national unity.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the riots in Ambon, capital of Maluku Province,
Habibie said here that the most important thing in the reform
process is the maintenance of national unity.
</P>
<P>
"What is most important is to maintain national unity by giving
the people correct information," the president said at the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The president also reminded the Indonesian people that they
should respect other religions and religious followers, as the
country does not prioritize one religion over the others.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people not to pit one against the other,
particularly in terms of religious, racial, ethnic and inter-group
differences.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure, and God willing, the incident in Ambon will serve
as a lesson to us," he said, adding that the situation in Ambon
has returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the violence was sparked by Tuesday
night's clash between Muslims from Batumerah village and a bus
driver from the neighboring Christian-dominated village of
Mardika. The ensuing quarrel escalated into an open clash between
the two villages.
</P>
<P>
According to official Antara News Agency, the death toll of the
riots rose to 40 on Friday and most of the victims were Muslim
settlers from Southeast and South Sulawesi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Scores of houses, places of worship, markets, cars, motorcycles
and pedicabs had also been set on fire by mobs.
</P>
<P>
Regional Command chief Maj. Gen. Amir Sembiring said the riots
that flared in Ambon and its surrounding areas were believed to
have been ignited by "irresponsible provocateurs."
</P>
<P>
"I have received a report that there were some provocateurs who
have so far formed several small groups to move the masses,"
Sembiring said during a dialogue with religious and public
figures, government officials and military leaders in Ambon.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Commander General Wiranto is expected to arrive in
Ambon Friday night to inspect the riot-hit Ambon, Sembiring was
quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.

BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua)-- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad said today in an exclusive interview with the
Xinhua News Agency that "China and Bangladesh are good friends
which enjoy excellent relations."
</P>
<P>
Azad addressed Sino-Bangladeshi relations during the interview
which followed shortly after a two-hour meeting with his Chinese
counterpart Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
He said a China visit by First Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman laid solid foundation for bilateral relations, and note
that a 1996 visit by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina shortly after
she assumed office reflected the importance that Bangladesh
attaches to relations with China and constituted a milestone in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Azad pointed to frequent reciprocal high-level visits and the
increasing cooperation in the economic, cultural, scientific,
technological and educational sectors.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh sincerely appreciates China's long-term support,
according to Azad. He added that the Chinese government has
helped build four bridges in Bangladesh and the design for a
fifth one was recently completed. Both Bangladesh and China
suffered from unprecedented flooding during 1998, but China
provided three million yuan to support the post-flood rebuilding
effort in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"The actions of the Chinese government symbolize the close
friendship and cooperation between our two countries," said Azad.
</P>
<P>
Azad and Tang signed an agreement on economic and
technological cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will not only be an important result of my
visit, but also an important step the two nations have taken to
further promote bilateral economic and trade relations," said
Azad.

Economic and trade relations between China and Bangladesh have
witnessed rapid growth in recent years, with the former
participating in the construction of major projects in the
latter. A bilateral investment cooperation seminar held in
Beijing last October attracted 150 Chinese entrepreneurs who
expressed their willingness to invest in Bangladesh and establish
joint ventures to produce cement, medicines, textiles and
household electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh hopes to further enhance economic and trade ties
with China, and welcomes Chinese investors to participate in
infrastructure constructions," said Azad, adding the his country
fully supports China's membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Azad said Bangladesh, a developing country, considers
expediting economic growth as a paramount priority. He said
"people in Bangladesh are looking forward to a stable and
prosperous life."
</P>
<P>
People in Bangladesh believe in developing friendship with all
countries. They also believe that peaceful coexistence with all
neighbors is the foundation for their country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh opposes arms race of any kind in South Asia and
the world as a whole," said Azad. He noted that Bangladesh has
adopted a positive attitude concerning the post-nuclear testing
era in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Azad expressed hope that "South Asia will enter a new era of
stable development."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Bangladesh supports China's stance on issues
related to Taiwan, Tibet and human rights. "We're delighted to
see the successful implementation of the 'one China, two systems'
policy in Hong Kong and anticipate the smooth return of Macao."

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Haves And Have-Nots Widening in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the haves and
the have-nots in Australia was widening, Governor-General William
Deane warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Australians would not achieve true
reconciliation without addressing the "appalling problems of
material disadvantage" oppressing Aborigines, the Australian
Associated Press reported from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the Australia Day Council of New South Wales,
the governor-general said, Australia was among the world's most
prosperous nations, but entrenched disadvantage was a "great
national problem."
</P>
<P>
He said the ultimate test of Australia's worth as a true
democracy was how it treated its most vulnerable and
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
He told a gathering of almost 2,000 people that an indigenous
baby girl born on Australia Day this year could, on current
statistics, expect to live approximately 20 years less than a
non-indigenous baby girl born on the same day.
</P>
<P>
"And the chance of her dying in infancy is three times
greater," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all Australians to address the "problems of the
spirit" faced by Aborigines - "the loss, the emptiness, the lack
of self-esteem that have resulted from past dispossession,
introduced diseases and tragically mistaken, though often
well-intentioned, policies."
</P>
<P>
He said Australia had made considerable progress towards
reconciliation in recent years, but there was "so much more to be
done."

JINAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Expressways stretching 1,487 km
opened to traffic in China in 1998, bringing the total length of
the country's expressway system to 6,258 km, according to a
senior government official.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong attributed the rapid
expansion of expressway to increased investments.
</P>
<P>
Construction of China's expressway system commenced in the
late 1980s and has entered a peak period, according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
The 258 key road construction projects under construction this
year stretch 27,000 km, including 12,600 km of expressways, Huang
told the ongoing national conference on transportation.
</P>
<P>
He also said China's highway mileage has reached 1.26 million
km, a targeted level reached two years ahead of the official plan.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal allocations for highway construction hit a record 180
billion yuan during 1998, said Huang, adding that this year's
investment will rise by an additional 12-15 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Dire Dawa Foreign Trade
Office of the Ethiopian Ministry of Trade and Industry has given
licenses for 2, 000 merchants engaged in trade along the
Ethio-Djibouti border.
</P>
<P>
The licenses were given in the past six months after Ethiopia
began to route its export goods entirely through Djibouti Port,
the Ethiopian Herald newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Electric goods and clothings have been making their way into
Ethiopia while agricultural and manufactured products entered
Djibouti from Ethiopia since the border trade began, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The border trade is contributing to the promotion of the
social, political and economic relations between the two
countries, the report quoted the foreign trade office as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has diverted from Assab Port of Eritrea to Port of
Djibouti as its outlet since the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrean border
conflict on May 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government decided to issue licenses to small
merchants engaged in trade along the Ethio-Djibouti border with a
limited capital of 2,000 Birr (267 U.S. Dollars) each.

<HEADLINE> HK, Russia Ink Agreement to Boost Air Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China today signed an air services
agreement with Russia, forging a legal framework for expanding
the air links between Hong Kong and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The SAR's Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip said
after signing the agreement here that the event is "an important
milestone in the development of Hong Kong's economic relationship
with Russia."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will help to forge closer ties between the two
places in areas such as aviation, tourism and trade," Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zaitsev, director general of the Federal Aviation
Authority of Russia, said at a press briefing later that the
first government-level air agreement between Hong Kong and Moscow
provides "solid basis for tourism and cultural exchanges, and
maybe more cargo transportation."
</P>
<P>
Direct air services between Moscow and Hong Kong began in 1992
and were operated by the Russian International Airlines AEROFLOT.
Since then bilateral trade with Russia and the number of Russian
visitors to Hong Kong have both increased by about three times.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation led by Zaitsev also signed a similar
agreement with Macao. Zaitsev said he also expects Southeast
Asian countries to use Hong Kong as a transit stop to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was the SAR's 35th and Russia's 50th air
services accord.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry Report on Airport Chaos Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Lack of time, coordination
and risk assessment plus overconfidence led to the chaos at the
Chek Lap Kok New Airport when it opened on July 6, 1998,
according to an inquiry report released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its 700-page report, the Commission of Inquiry on the New
Airport set out in detail the problems associated with the
airport opening, their causes and the responsibility of the
concerned parties -- findings and conclusions of a six-month
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo Kwok-hing, Chairman of the Commission, said at a
press conference Friday that the two main culprits for the chaos
were the deficiency of the Flight Information Display System
(FIDS) and the breakdown of the Cargo Handling System of the Hong
Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL), which built Super Terminal
1.
</P>
<P>
Baggage handling confusion was another major problem because
of its impact on numerous passengers, according to the report,
which also identifies 39 minor and moderate problems.
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that the root cause of Super Terminal 1's
paralysis and the deficiency of Flight Information Display System
is the lack of time.
</P>
<P>
As to who should be responsible for the problems, the report
criticizes the Airport Authority's (AA's) top management and HAC
TL for being overconfident and not paying sufficient heed to
risks involved despite progressive delays in the construction in
both the passenger terminal building and Super Terminal 1.
</P>
<P>
The report points out: "Had a deferment been suggested by
either AA or HACTL, the chaos could have been avoided by
postponing the airport opening date by about two months.
Unfortunately, no one ever made any such suggestion, and everyone
was working diligently but blindly towards the common goal of
opening the airport on July 6, 1998."
</P>
<P>
Despite the bumpy start, the new airport has completely come
out of the pit of problems to attain the standard of a
world-class airport, according to the report which contributes a
section to the present situation at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
The airport has recently won the annual Critics' Choice award
of an American premier travel industry publication which
commended the new airport's fast baggage delivery time, the high
speed rail link and the attractive passenger terminal building.
Its overall security was rated by the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration as "excellent".
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo, who was appointed by the Chief Executive in
Council in July, 1998 to chair the Commission, reiterated that
the inquiry had been conducted independently, impartially and
with the high degree of transparency. "We have revealed the
truth without ill will, favor or fear," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the report was made public, the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa told a
press briefing that he accepted the Commission's findings and
appreciated its valuable views on the lessons to be learned.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission's Report will help us prevent a recurrence of
such problems in conducting major projects in future," Tung said.
Learning from the process, the Chief Executive highlighted the
importance of clear delineation of functions and efficient
coordination so that each party knows precisely its
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"I also agree with the Commission's view that there should
always be a global risk assessment and comprehensive contingency
planning," he added.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Chief Executive called on Hong Kong people to be
positive and forward looking. "We were all disappointed by the
problems in the initial operation of the airport. These problems
are now behind us. All the parties involved should now continue
to work together to further improve the services and facilities
so that the airport will play a bigger role in Hong Kong's
economic development."

<P>
BUCHAREST, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu threatened Friday a state of emergency against
striking coal miners if they do not back off from marching toward
this capital city before 14:00 local time (1200 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu announced his decision after an emergency
meeting of the country's Supreme Defense Council starting from
Thursday night through Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is facing events that can lead to most serious
consequences for it and our people," the president said in a
televised message, adding the Jiu Valley miners had generated
"most violent actions and dangers" over the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"Security forces have been attacked, military beaten and
insulted, or taken hostages, and munitions stolen from the Gendarm
erie stores," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the miners' violence continues, Romania will have no
future," Constantinescu said, vowing to declare the emergency
state across the nation "unless miners start their way back to
the Jiu valley by 14:00."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "if miners try to move to any other
direction meanwhile, the emergency state will take effect right
away."
</P>
<P>
Late on Thursday, the government adopted an emergency
ordinance calling for the declaration of an emergency state as an
exceptional measure taken whenever the country's security and the
constitutional order is seriously imperiled.
</P>
<P>
The decree mandates a series of political, economic, social
and public peacekeeping measures concerning some areas across the
country or the entire territory under the emergency state
effective for up to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Around 15,000 miners went on strike in January 4 in the Jiu
Valley area, Romania's largest coal field, to protest at the
government's decision to close down some mines in the area and
lay off their employees.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, about 10,000 miners began a protest march to the
capital. They are now about 180 kilometers from the city.

<HEADLINE> Japanese-ROK Agreement Violates Chinese Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government states
that the fisheries agreement signed between the governments of
Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) on November 28 last year
violates China's sovereign rights involving an exclusive economic
zone in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remarks here
today when commenting on the Japanese-ROK Fisheries Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government declares that China's rights,
interests and fishing activities in the exclusive economic zone
are not restricted by the agreement which demarcates the
exclusive Japanese and ROK economic zones in a water area
bordering China, Japan and the ROK.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government holds that it is imperative for the
three concerned parties to settle the demarcation issue involving
territorial waters through consultations, and that the
presumptuous demarcation which excludes any of the three parties
violates international law, said Sun. He also noted that China
has expressed grave concern and has presented formal
representations to both Japan and the ROK.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Police in southern China have
sunk a boat and seized two others that were being used to smuggle
cigarettes, the General Administration of Customs reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of January 5, the 3 boats moved into an
area under the jurisdiction of Nanning Customs in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. When they were
intercepted by police, warning shots were fired, but they failed
to stop the boats. Maritime police from Fangcheng Customs, a
branch of Nanning, tried to immobilize their engines to prevent
their escape and sank one boat in the process, seized the two
others, and arrested seven people who were suspected of smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The three boats had smuggled cigarettes into Qishui in the
western part of Guangdong Province on the night of January 4th
and were discovered by police on their way back to carry more
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Another boat has been reported seized by maritime police on
the evening of January 20 in the sea by Fangcheng Customs for the
same reason.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Heavy floods have cut off road
traffic between the provinces of Zambezia and Sofala in central
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Joao Zamissa, spokesman for the Technical Council for Emergency
of Mozambique, said in Maputo Wednesday that the vehicles to and
from the two provinces have to take way through neighboring Malawi
before reaching their destinations.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Noticias newspaper quoted the spokesman as saying
that because of the floods caused by heavy rains since
mid-January, vehicles could not pass by the bridge linking the
two provinces across Zambeze River.
</P>
<P>
Zamissa said that some parts of the southern African country
had been flooded by the continuous heavy rains, especially along
the rivers of Zambeze, Pungue and Buzi.
</P>
<P>
The suburban areas of Quelimane City, the provincial capital of
Zambezia Province had been seriously flooded, he noted, without
giving any details.
</P>
<P>
However, Mozambican Deputy Minister of Agriculture and
Fisheries, Helder Muteia, who was leading an investigation team in
Beira, capital of Sofala Province, said Wednesday that compared
with the situation last year, the floods are not so serious.
</P>
<P>
But he urged people to provide food, medicine and seeds to
those in the flooded areas so that they can resume production.

1997.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Spends $1m Daily on ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, the main troops
contributor to the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG, is
spending about one million U.S. Dollars a day on ECOMOG's
operation in Sierra Leone, said Sierra Leonean Finance Minister
James Jonah.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports reaching here Friday, Jonah told
the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Thursday that Nigeria
has so far spent 568.5 million dollars, since ECOMOG intervened in
Sierra Leone shortly after the May 1997 military coup that ousted
President Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his government's gratitude to Nigeria, the
minister said Sierra Leone is making plans to set up a 15,000
strong civil defense force to prepare for ECOMOG's eventual
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain is considering equipping the force for Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's operation against the rebels in Sierra Leone has cost
Nigeria dearly, especially at a time when its own finance base has
been muched reduced by the slump in the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, there has been growing pressure from within
Nigeria on the military government of Abdulsalami Abubakar to
pull out its troops from Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said that Nigeria's coming civilian government,
which is expected to take over from Abubakar on May 29, is most
likely to give in to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
According to Jonah, Sierra Leone's new defense force will be in
place by June this year.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah announced plans to set up a new defense force
shortly after his reinstallment last March after ECOMOG expelled
the military junta that emerged after the coup, but the plans have
not be implemented.

<HEADLINE> Further Growth Expected for China-EU Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Trade between China and the EU
is expected to grow further in 1999 in the wake of last year's
strong growth.
</P>
<P>
Strong trade relations offer many opportunities for further
growth in bilateral ties between China and the EU, according to
Zhou Wenming, an associate research fellow with the Chinese
Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. Zhou
made the comment in a Friday interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China's exported products valued at 28.15 billion US dollars to
 the EU in 1998, up 18.1 percent on the previous year. The export
volume accounted for 15.3 percent of China's total exports in
1998.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in China-EU trade is becoming an increasingly
important aspect of the nation's foreign trade arena," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
China , excluding the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), is the EU's fourth largest trade partner, and
the EU is also China's 4th largest trade partner. .
</P>
<P>
Zhou attributed the strong bilateral trade to EU's growing
economy, as well as expanding bilateral ties, complementary
markets and the high competitiveness of Chinese commodities.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that Sino-EU trade ties will grow even further
this year in line with expanding political relations.

Britain in the latter half of 1999. Jiang will be the first
Chinese head of state to visit Britain since the two nations
established diplomatic relations.

Several leaders of European nations are scheduled to visit
China during 1999, with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder set

<P>
Trade relations and economic cooperation will be an important
part of the growing political ties, according to pundits.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Pledges Clampdown on Illegal Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese government has decided
to clamp down on illegal immigration to Cyprus and cooperate with
the island in this effort.
</P>
<P>
The government has informed Cyprus of its decision and said it
would not allow anyone to use Lebanon as a transit point to
illegally enter the Mediterranean island, about 200 kilometers off
Lebanon's coast.
</P>
<P>
The problem between Cyprus and Lebanon surfaced last week after
Cypriot police stopped a bid to smuggle 29 illegal immigrants on
board a Lebanese ship, Mustafa, a diplomatic source told the Daily
Star.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot authorities notified Lebanon that the ship had set sail
from its northern port city of Tripoli and asked it to take back
those illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Beirut rejected the demand, however, saying it could only take
in six Egyptians who held Lebanese residency cards.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus then took back the rest 23 immigrants who were later
sentenced to prison terms of up to 45 days for entering the
country illegally.
</P>
<P>
The incident strained normally close ties between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Needs More Time in Signing Skies Deal With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has demanded a transition
period to complete the liberalization of its aviation industry
before Kenya and the United States sign an open skies agreement,
the Daily Nation newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is skeptical of fully opening up its aviation sector to
U.S. before fully grasping the operational modes of the open skies
agreement, Permanent Secretary for Transport and Communications
Stanley Murage was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenya stands to gain from an open skies agreement with the U.S.
although it has not grasped fully the operations of such an
agreement, said Murage, who headed the Kenyan delegation in the
bilateral talks with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a joint statement as a result of the
Kenya-U.S. talks on bilateral civil aviation which took place on
Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the joint statement,
transitional provisions will be completed as early as possible
this year and the discussions will resume soon in Washington.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.S. does not have an open skies agreement with any
African country. Kenya is among eight African countries chosen
by the U.S. to participate in a Safe Skies for Africa Initiative.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Sell Drinking Water to Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is expected to sell
drinking water to Palestine in the near future, the local Daily
News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Acar Transportation and Tourism Company has signed an
agreement with Palestine under which 1,000 tons of water will be
sent to Gaza harbor from the Mediterranean city of Antalya every
10 days.
</P>
<P>
Ahmet Acar, head of the company's executive board, said the
water will be sent to Gaza harbor in containers and solutions
have been found to all the transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
The deal, known as the Manavgat Peace Water project, will be in
operation at the end of this month, with each shipment costing
100,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lack of water has been a chronic problem that hampers economic
development in the Palestinian self-rule areas. Israel is often
accused of trying to control most of the water resources in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"We are sending water to the Middle East countries, hoping that
the water will help development programs in the region," said the
company official.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Regional Autonomy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Following are some facts and
figures explaining the ethnic regional autonomy system practiced
in the Tibet Autonomous Region:
</P>
<P>
Tibet is an area where the Tibetans live in compact
communities, with people of the Tibetan ethnic group making up 95
percent of the total population of 2.44 million in the autonomous
region, and the people of the Han and other ethnic groups
accounting for only five percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution of the People's Republic of
China, the state practices the ethnic regional autonomy system in
Tibet, which has been established as the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Between 1965 and 1998 more than 110 local regulations were
promulgated, such as the Rules of the Procedure of the People's
Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Regulations on
the Study, Use and Development of the Tibetan Language in the
Tibet Autonomous Region (for trial implementation), covering
politics, the economy, culture, education, environmental
protection and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The legislative and administrative organs of the Tibet
Autonomous Region have designated the Tibetan New Year, the
Sholton and other traditional festivals of the Tibetan ethnic
group as the Region's holidays, in addition to the official
national holidays. In accordance with the special natural and
geographical conditions of Tibet, the autonomous region has
decreed a work week of no more than 35 hours, five hours less
than the official national work week for workers and staff.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the number of regulations formulated
since 1992 by the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous
Region and its Standing Committee to safeguard the interests of
the Tibetan people in light of the actual conditions in Tibet
exceeds the total formulated during the 12 years preceding 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous
Regional People's Congress and the chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Region are both citizens of the Tibetan ethnic group.
Since the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region all the four
chairmen of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of
the Tibet Autonomous Region and five chairmen of the Region have
been Tibetan citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, members of the Tibetan and other
ethnic minorities now account for 84.6 percent of the chairman
and vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of the People's
Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region; for 80 percent of the
members of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Regional
People's Congress; and for 74.4 percent of the chairman and
vice-chairmen of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
After the election of members to succeeding governments at the
township (town), county, prefectural (city) and autonomous
regional levels in 1993, members of the Tibetan and other ethnic
minorities accounted for 93.2 percent of the component members of
the organs of state power at these four levels, respectively for
99.8 percent and 98.6 percent of the township (town) and county
heads elected, and respectively 96 percent and 89 percent of the
presidents of the people's courts and the procurators of the
people's procuratorates at the autonomous regional, prefectural
(city) and county levels.
</P>
<P>
According to 1996 statistics, the number of cadres belonging
to the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities in Tibet had increased
by 18.22 percent over the 1992 figure, making up 73.88 percent of
the total and showing an increase of 4.48 percentage points over
the figure for 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language is the common language for the whole
autonomous region. The resolutions, regulations and decrees
adopted by the people's congresses, and official documents and
proclamations issued by governments at all levels in the Region
are in both Tibetan and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In court cases involving Tibetans, the Tibetan language must
be used in hearing cases, and legal documents must be written in
the Tibetan language. Newspapers, magazines, and radio and
television stations also use both Tibetan and Chinese languages.
All signs and marks of government institutions, streets, roads an
d public facilities are in both Tibetan and Chinese scripts.
Tibetan academic, cultural and art workers have the right to
write and publish their academic or artistic works in their own
language.

<HEADLINE> 8 Foreign Airlines Bid for Stake in S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- At least eight airlines
of Europe and America are bidding for a 20 to 25 percent equity
stake in South African Airways (SAA) when the state-owned airline
is privatiz, the company has announced.
</P>
<P>
The bidders are KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and its U.S. partner
North West Airlines and Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG with its
partner Singapore Airlines, SAA spokesman Victor Nosi said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other airlines also expressing an interest include British
Airways, Swissair, Britain-based Virgin Atlantic Airlines and
American Airlines, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
SAA, part of South Africa's transport parastatal Transnet, has
been preparing for privatization since 1995, but the process was
hobbled by the talks with its lenders and the restructuring of
its four billion Rand (about 666 million U.S. Dollars) debt
before being privatized.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the South African government struck a
deal with the SAA last November which could see the state absorb
part of SAA's liabilities on Transnet's balance sheet before the
carrier was privatized.
</P>
<P>
The government expected SAA's stake to be sold off by the end
of May, a senior Transnet official who asked not to be identified
disclosed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SAA last reported a profit in 1995, but after that the
global airline has been reportedly suffering deficit.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Asks Embassies to Help Attract Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Salim Hoss has
sent a memorandum to the country's embassies abroad, asking them
to help attract more foreign investments, the Daily Star reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The memo, signed by Hoss on Thursday, outlined the government's
efforts "to maintain a healthy economy and continuous financial
stability."
</P>
<P>
In it, the government pledged to curb its debt and deficit,
streamline the state's role in the economy and encourage domestic
and foreign investments on sectors which help secure new jobs,
develop markets and financial systems.
</P>
<P>
The memo also promised some favorable conditions for foreign
companies to invest in Lebanon, such as a no-more-than-10-percent
income tax on foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has set up tax-free industrial zones and a public
authority that guarantees investments and loans to productive
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The public authority operates under international arbitration
rules and has a strict banking secrecy law in practice, the memo
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked these embassies to provide the
Foreign Ministry with basic information about the major companies
in their host countries to facilitate the government to contact
them on the possibilities of investing in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, a veteran economist and politician, came to power in
December 1998 to succeed Rafik Hariri, a construction billionaire
who has served as premier for six consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
During the Hariri-sponsored mass reconstruction drive after the
 1975-1990 civil war, Lebanon has attracted about 5 billion
U.S. dollars foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Small, Medium Industries Granted Favors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The small- and
medium-scale industries (SMIs) in Malaysia have found favors with
the government due to their pivotal role in the nation's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The SMIs occupy a significant position in Malaysia's economy as
they comprise 84 percent of the country's companies in the
manufacturing sector which shares about 36 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
As statistics show, the share of the SMIs in GDP amounts to
13.8 percent and they share 18.5 percent of the total exports.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, the new definition of the SMIs drawn up by the
International Trade and Industry Ministry is an organization with
annual sales of not more than 25 million ringgit (about 6.578
million U.S. dollars) and not more than 150 workers.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the important role of the SMIs in
industrialization, the government has taken a number of supportive
measures for them in the recent years to help expand their
businesses and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures is to ensure sufficient funding for their
development. According to SMI Consultative Center here, there have
been many financing facilities, more than a dozen in number, being
provided by the government and financial institutions to cater for
the different needs of the SMIs scattering at every corner of the
country.
</P>
<P>
These facilities include credit guarantee corporations' loan
schemes such as Small Entrepreneur Fund, Small Entrepreneur
Financing Fund, New Principal Guarantee Scheme and Integrated
Lending Scheme; Industrial Development Finance Institutions' Loan
Schemes such as SMI Promotion Program, Project Loans, Machinery
Loans, Factory Mortgage Loans, Modernization &AMP; Automation Scheme
for SMIs and Industrial Adjustment Fund; Commercial Loans for SMI
as well as Special Sectors Loan Schemes such as Fund for Food,
Special Fund for Tourism and Special Scheme for Furniture and Food
Industries.
</P>
<P>
However, at the time when the country is caught in an economic
downturn resulting from the prevailing regional financial crisis,
financing facilities for SMIs in the country were squeezed, and
financing through the capital market became difficult, putting the
SMIs in a tight spot.
</P>
<P>
To help the SMIs get back on their feet, the Malaysian
government set up two special funds for SMIs last year -- the
Small- and Medium- Industry Fund (SMI Fund) set up early January
1998 with an allocation of 1.5 billion ringgit (about 394.736
million U.S. dollars) and the Small- and Medium-Industry
Rehabilitation Fund set up in November last year with an
allocation of 750 million ringgit (about 197.368 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Till December 31, 1998, loans totaling 882 million ringgit
(about 232.105 million U.S. dollars) from the SMI Fund were
approved to 873 applicants, according to Entrepreneur Development
Minister Mustapa Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
But, Mustapa said there were still delays in the disbursement
of loans caused by the processing of documents, on-going
negotiations between entrepreneurs and their business partners,
urging the participating banks to speed up the loan lending from
the new funds.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the country's SMIs to increase exports is another
area the government stresses for. As early as 1996, the government
established the Small and Medium Industries Development
Corporation to help SMIs venture into export markets by using big
enterprises as a channel towards overseas markets through setting
up closer linkages between the SMIs and big enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The SMIs also enjoy several export financing facilities such as
Buyer Credit Facilities, Overseas Investment Credit Facilities,
Buyer Credit Guarantee Facilities, Supplier Credit Guarantee
Facilities and Export Financing Facilities.
</P>
<P>
The ranking of the top 50 small and medium enterprises in the
country or enterprises 50 in 1998, points to high export-oriented
operations.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government also attaches importance to the
technical upgrading of the SMIs and provides incentives for the
SMIs' technical research and development.
</P>
<P>
The incentives in this regard include Industrial Technical
Assistance Fund, Commercialization of R&AMP;D Fund, Technology
Acquisition Fund and Industry R&AMP;D Grant Scheme.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's SMIs are also encouraged to adopt automation to
increase productivity. For that, the government has set up the
Human Resources Development Fund from which enterprises can obtain
100 percent subsidy for their employees for automation training.
</P>
<P>
All these aim at facilitating the development of a modern,
efficient and robust small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in
the country to well position them for the future.

<HEADLINE> Government Eyes 80 Percent Share of Marcos Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
considering the possibility of getting up to 80 percent of the
assets it will recover from the family of the late president
Ferdinand Marcos through negotiations, an official disclosed here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said that
the 80-20 settlement formula in favor of the government involves a
"universal settlement" and includes Marcos assets that are
"clearly legitimately acquired."
</P>
<P>
The 80-20 percent sharing would be realistic for the Marcoses,
whom he said have yet to speak with one voice in dealing with the
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Joseph Estrada said that his administration
will consider a 75-25 percent formula in favor of the government
as a starting point in its talks with the Marcoses on a possible
compromise agreement involving their alleged ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
Zamora dismissed claims that the Marcoses cannot deal with the
government any more as most of their assets have already been
entrusted to their cronies.
</P>
<P>
The claims have already been disproved by former first lady
Imelda Marcos in recent interviews, he said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 350 Mln Dollars for Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved a
loan of 350 million U.S. dollars for Pakistan in its Executive
Board meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan
Friday, the World Bank approved the full amount of 350 million
dollars in the name of the Structural Adjustment Loan requested by
the Pakistani government to help its external financing, restoring
investors' confidence and improving credit worthiness.
</P>
<P>
The single tranche loan is repayable in 20 years with a grace
period of five years and will be released immediately, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Agha Ghazanfer, Economic Minister of Pakistan, on behalf of the
Pakistani government and Sadik Ahmed, representative of the World
Bank, signed the loan agreement shortly after the Board's meeting,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a World Bank official as saying that the loan
would improve fiscal and financial governance, extension of
reforms aimed at improvement in efficiency in three key areas
including banking, energy and taxation.
</P>
<P>
The official further said that the loan has been approved after
the Pakistani government initiated major programs of homegrown
reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is the second series of such loan. Earlier, such a loan was
given to Pakistan for the banking structural reforms in November
1997.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Sending Young Administrators Overseas for Training (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang Guoguang, Liaoning's governor, says that qualified
personnel are badly needed as pressures and competition grow with
the reforms at large and medium-size state-owned enterprises and
as the economy develops.
</P>
<P>
Only 61 administrators at the prefecture commissioner's level
have a good knowledge of a foreign language, meaning only 4.4
percent of the total number of such administrators. Zhang says
that the provincial government is determined to stick to the
project and help their people earn a Master's degree in either
administration or business management after a year of training.
It will also set up longer-term training programs with foreign
countries.

<HEADLINE> Timber Industry to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's timber industry is
expected to remain stable this year despite implementation of the
nationwide logging ban, according to a State Forestry
Administration official.
</P>
<P>
As sustained logging along the upper reaches of major rivers
has caused serious soil erosion, raising water levels and silting
water channels, the government decided to give up traditional
dependence on forestry and develop other businesses, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the country will reduce timber production
by 12-15 million cubic meters a year, some 25 percent of the
total annual timber resources provided by forestry departments.
The timber resources of 1999 thus will be reduced to some 40
million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
However, the robust development of the residential housing,
decoration and furniture industries, and the ongoing restoration
and water conservation projects following last summer's
devastating floods, will expand the timber industry significantly.
</P>
<P>
Estimated timber demand now stands at some 57 million cubic
meters in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country's timber in stock amounts to 9 million
cubic meters, and annual imports of timber are about 5 million
cubic meters. Therefore, the country's timber resources can
basically reach the supply level that existed before the logging
ban.
</P>
<P>
Increased imports and the use of substitute materials should
be able to fill in any remaining gaps.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of timber production will not have a strong
impact on the two large timber markets of eastern and southern
China, as these two areas are strongly dependent on imported
timber.
</P>
<P>
However, the nationwide logging ban will put great pressure on
timber markets in northern and central China, where timber prices
are expected to rise along with the prices of related building
materials such as steel and cement.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM to Visit Britain, Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley is leaving for Britain and Germany Friday tonight,
vowing to lobby hard for two New Zealand politicians to take up
top international positions.
</P>
<P>
The two New Zealanders are Labor MP Mike Moore, who is in the
running to head the World Trade Organization, and Foreign Affairs
and Trade Minister Don McKinnon, who hopes to be the next
Commonwealth Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local press a few days ago, Shipley
said seeking support for the two men from European leaders would
be an important aspect of her week-long trip to Britain and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Promoting New Zealand's trade with the two European countries
is also one of the important purposes of Shipley's trip.
</P>
<P>
In a statement announcing her visit to Britain and Germany,
Shipley said that Britain and Europe are very important trade
destinations for New Zealand, taking 30 percent of its exports and
providing 20 percent of the imports.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining and strengthening this relationship with Britain

<HEADLINE> Consumers Welcome Environment-Friendly Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer electronics
market is producing more environment-friendly products to meet
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Consumers list the quality of freshness preservation as their
primary consideration and refrigerator manufacturers are
redoubling efforts to upgrade related technology to answer the
trend, according to the China Machinery and Electronics Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Meiling Co. Ltd. was the first manufacturer to develop
refrigerators featuring high standard freshness preservation,
with major producers such as Chunlan, Xileng, Hualing, Huari and
Little Swan following suit in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Hai'er, a leader in the field, introduced a germ-free
refrigerator in December 1998. A germ elimination agent added to
plastic materials and a highly effective odor remover enable the
refrigerators to maintain air freshness for as long as 10-15
years, according to the Daily.
</P>
<P>
Producers are also improving the quality of washing machines.
For example, Hai'er has introduced magnetized sterilization
technology and various other new technology to improve the
cleaning efficiency of a new model washer by several-fold.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are delighted with the introduction of new
televisions which provide vision protection.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are also exhibiting a preference for Hai'er's new
line of air conditioners which provide health protection by
emitting electrically charged particles.
</P>
<P>
Telephone owners have also exhibited a preference for new
models which feature transmitters with sterilization components.

<HEADLINE> Oil Giant Sinks Huge Funds into Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The China National Petroleum
Corp. (CNPC) plans to inject 10.4 billion yuan (1.25 billion U.S.
dollars) into strengthening exploration for oil and natural gas
resources in eastern and western China, Jiang Jinchu, deputy g
eneral manager of CNPC, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The oil giant has set the goal of verifying 360.5 million tons
of oil reserves and 94 billion cubic meters of natural gas
reserves this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, CNPC discovered three oil fields each with more tha
n 100 million tons of reserves in the Tarim, Jungar and Erdos
basins, thus adding 485 million tons of oil reserves, and 223.2
billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves to the country's
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said his company will also intensify efforts to develop
the oil and natural gas fields in the east, since these fields
will remain the major producers of onshore oil until sometime
early next century. It is estimated that by year 2000, the annual
oil output of the eastern oilfields will reach about 115 million
tons, accounting for over 80 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Though these old oilfields will inevitably face production
declines, the application of new technology can ensure a fairly
high output from these fields during the first 20 years of the
new millennium, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Through the technology of stabilizing oil production by
injecting water into the oil wells, the old oilfields in the east
have successfully controlled the annual output drop rate within
14 percent. Meanwhile, the strengthened exploration and
development have added crude oil production capacity by 64
million tons.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Exposure of Shoddy Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China intends to use the media
to expose more cases involving shoddy goods, especially those
that affect people's lives and the national economy, according to
an official with the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Sup
ervision.
</P>
<P>
Pan Yue, deputy director of the bureau, said in a meeting with
reporters from Xinhua and other major Beijing-based newspapers on
Thursday, that along with punishing those who make and sell
shoddy goods, his bureau will also cooperate with the media to
expose more major cases, which are becoming a great public
nuisance in China.
</P>
<P>
Pan stressed that media supervision is of great importance for
cracking down on fake goods, and his bureau will establish a
quality system to warn people against certain brands of shoddy
goods.
</P>
<P>
China began regularly issuing results of product-quality
surveys in Beijing newspapers in April 1997, and from these
reports people have been kept informed about poor-quality goods.
</P>
<P>
Pan said that media exposure of these products has triggered
strong reactions among the public.

<HEADLINE> Pavilion Built for Dead Giraffe in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Tourists entering the
Shanghai Zoo, the second largest zoo in China, are usually
surprised to see a giraffe standing perfectly still in a huge
glass pavilion near the gate.
</P>
<P>
Being curious, many go up to it, only to find that it is but a
replica.
</P>
<P>
"This is Shanghai-Yokohama. She was killed by plastic bags
discarded by visitors," said Shi Xinquan, former director of the
zoo. "Now she is here calling for people to love animals and
respect nature."
</P>
<P>
An inscription on a marble tablet beside the newly established
pavilion tells the whole story of Shanghai-Yokohama.
</P>
<P>
As the name implies, the giraffe was born in Yokohama, Japan
in 1978, and was sent to Shanghai in 1980 as an envoy of
friendship.
</P>
<P>
One July morning in 1993, Shanghai-Yokohama was found hitting
her head against the shed wall, her body trembling all over.
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians did everything they could, but could not save
the animal, who left behind a 28-day-old baby giraffe.
</P>
<P>
An autopsy found that two large bundles of plastic bags filled
the giraffe's stomach and caused her death.
</P>
<P>
Local residents showed great concern after the media
highlighted the event, and they donated money to build the
pavilion and named it the Pavilion of Love. The local Jiuzhou
Shopping Center offered to support the baby giraffe with funds
for its entire life.
</P>
<P>
Parents and teachers now come with children in a steady stream
to mourn for the dead giraffe and draw a lesson.
</P>
<P>
"Animals are companions for human beings. We should protect t
hem and treat them like friends," said Luo Jun, a student from
the Changqing Middle School, who was visiting the zoo with her
classmates.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Zoo has over 600 animal species, second only to
the Beijing Zoo, and hosts about 1.8 million visitors a year.

CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- British sixth seed Tim Henman
became the ninth men's seed to fall when he was dumped from the
Australian Open by Switzerland's Marc Rosset in Melbourne on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rosset blasted down his 14th ace of the match to clinch
victory in three sets 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 7-5. The No. 31 Rosset hit
47 winners, twice as many as Henman who was always too cautious.
</P>

Rosset will play Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic who
came from one set down to beat American wild man Jeff Tarango
1-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean FM Urges NGOs to Protect Basic Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge has urged non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
human rights groups to strive to protect all rights instead of
concentrating on political rights alone.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said this here Thursday night when opening a
conference on Pan-Commonwealth Advocacy for Human Rights, Peace
and Good Governance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that selecting which rights to
pursue at the expense of others would leave a lot of
international declarations on human rights unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
"We in the South believe in human rights," the Herald daily
newspaper Friday quoted Mudenge as saying. "However, at times the
definition of such rights is very narrow on the part of some
NGOs."
</P>
<P>
The rights to life, shelter, clean water, employment, and a
better quality of life are important rights which nearly 80
percent of the Zimbabwean population are striving to achieve,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that some even go to the extent of fanning ethnic
tensions in order to create what they see as strong opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
"I need to reiterate that at the present stage of development,
developing countries need, very badly, to promote national
cohesion and stability at the national and regional levels,"
the Zimbabwean foreing minister noted.

<HEADLINE> Government Expects Better Labor-Management Ties at PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
expects improved relations between the labor and the management in
the Philippine Airlines (PAL) with a new management, a senior
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said
the strategic management move Thursday would further lessen the
conflict between some PAL employees and PAL Chairman Lucio Tan.
</P>
<P>
Tan handed over management control of PAL to a new set of
officers Thursday in a major shakeup of the national flag carrier,
whose debts have amounted to over 2.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that Tan informed President Joseph Estrada before
he decided to step down as chief executive officer of PAL.
</P>
<P>
"Tan told the president that he is stepping down to allow the
entry of the new group of advisers formerly connected to Cathay
Pacific," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some creditors objecting to PAL's rehabilitation plan wanted
the airline to have a group of professional managers, Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem has now been resolved with the
appointment of a new chief executive officer and four former
Cathay Pacific executives, who will be acting as principal
advisers to PAL.
</P>
<P>
Labor dispute last year rocked PAL and forced the management to
close down operations last September, but President Estrada
persuaded Tan to keep the airline flying. One week later, PAL
resumed operations.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Get 177 Mln Dollars from WB for Traffic Improvement </HEADLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has agreed to
lend Bangladesh 177 million U.S. dollars to improve traffic
circulation in the capital city of Dhaka, the official BSS news
agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be spent to rebuild the city's sidewalks and
major inter-sections, and to improve traffic flow by installing
traffic lights and building lanes reserved for non-motorized
traffic to reduce risks to pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mentioned the interest rate of the
loan.
</P>
<P>
Traffic problems in Dhaka, with a population of over nine
million living on an area of 815 square kilometers and 630,000
vehicles and nearly one million rickshaws plying in the streets,
have reached "crisis proportions."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Snubs Thai Official's Bid to Become WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States has expressed
support for the Canadian candidate as the new director-general of
the World Trade Organization, Thai foreign ministry officials said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the second count at the WTO headquarters in Geneva earlier
in the week, the U.S. named Roy Maclaren, Canada's high
commissioner in London, in the first preference list and former
New Zealand premier Michael Moore in the second, according to
earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. did not express its view on the two other candidates
-- Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and former
Moroccan trade minister Hassan Abouyoub.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position was conveyed to the Thai ambassador in
Washington, Nitya Pibulsonggram by U.S. deputy trade
representative Richard Fisher. The U.S. official was said to have
expressed Washington's regret at being unable to vote for
Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Thai foreign ministry officials said the U.S. choice may put
pressure on Supachai to withdraw his candidacy, as a number of
countries might gradually follow Washington's lead.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry, while acknowledging that the intentions
of most member states of the WTO remained unclear, issued a
statement on Thursday to the effect that the ministry and other
concerned agencies would continue to lobby support for Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Ambassador William Rossier, who has been sounding out the
opinions of member states, said in remarks published Friday that
40 of the 133 WTO members made Supachai their first choice in the
first count. Abouyoub had 23 first preferences, Maclaren 15 and
Moore 13.
</P>
<P>
In the second count, Moore came out at the top of the list with
26 supporting members, Supachai was second with 19, Abouyoub third
with eight and Maclaren fourth with five. A total of 28
delegations have given no indication of their views.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Rossier's consultations, now under way for three
months, is to establish which candidate can be appointed by
consensus. Only if that cannot be established could a formal vote
be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer to
avoid such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general has
to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure whose
appointment is opposed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
The new WTO chief will replace Renato Ruggiero who steps down
at the end of April after four years in the post.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Department Store Fire Found in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- An electric frying pan whose
owner forgot to unplug it caused a fire in a department store in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, killing 10 people and leaving
20 others injured, local investigators announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out in the Tongzhou Department Store
in the city of Dachuan at around 2:25 a.m. on January 10,
destroyed some 13,760 square meters of buildings and caused
direct economic losses of over 31.6 million yuan (nearly 4
million U.S. dollars), said local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the local government, public security
and firefighting departments found that the fire began with some
flammable materials inside the overheated frying pan, which
belonged to a snack-food outlet on the ground floor of the
department store, and then spread to other parts of the building.
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out it was not reported immediately,
and the city has only one poorly equipped and under-staffed fire
brigade, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
The fire raged for more than four hours and trapped nearly
200 people in the store and neighboring buildings before the
firefighters, with assistance from local police and volunteer
citizens, extinguished it completely.
</P>
<P>
The investigators also accused the owners of the department
store of neglecting hidden fire dangers stemming from the
imperfect design and misuse of the building, as well as a poor
fire-alarm system and inadequate firefighting facilities.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government of Sichuan today made the
fire-investigation report public, and issued a circular to
governments at all levels across the province, urging them to
launch comprehensive inspections of fire prevention and
firefighting capabilities in all local buildings, especially
hotels, stores, restaurants and entertainment facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Local governments must also take effective steps to
increase investment in improving firefighting facilities and
updating firefighting equipment," the circular added.

<HEADLINE> Australia Claims No connection Between ad Job and Sydney Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- An international Olympic
official's son, who secured a job at an advertising agency and
was later employed by Sydney Games organizers, had no connection
to the city's successful bid, a spokesman for the host state's
Olympics Minister Michael Knight said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the son of Finnish International Olympic
Committee (IOC) member Peter Tallberg began work as a project
director at George Patterson Bates, an ad company, in 1993, a
week after Sydney won the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
All three sons of Tallberg, the second Finnish IOC member
linked to the bribes scandal, had been given jobs in cities
bidding to host the Olympics, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Knight, Olympics minister for the state of New
South Wales, whose capital is Sydney, said George Patterson Bates
began working for the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic
Games (SOCOG) after it employed Tallberg's son Mathias.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about the other places, but for here, the person
got the job with a company that had nothing to do with the bid,"
the spokesman told the Australian Associated Press (AAP).
</P>
<P>
"That company started working with SOCOG years later, so
where's the connection between the IOC and him getting a job and
the bid company when they had nothing to do with it?"
</P>
<P>
He said Knight saw no connection between the Sydney bid and
Mathias Tallberg securing the job, as the agency had nothing to
do with the bid.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Finnish newspaper, Mathias Tallberg
said his position had nothing to do with the Sydney bid, the
Sydney Morning Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Tallberg later told a Finland television station all
three of his sons worked in cities bidding for the Games.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no IOC rules against using normal family
friendships as long as no money changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Peter Tallberg was a member of the IOC's inquiry commission
into the Sydney bid, the Sydney paper said.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Joan Kirner, former premier of Australia's second
largest state Victoria, said the Olympic bidding process left
itself open to claims of corruption and bribery.
</P>
<P>
Kirner said he was stunned by the wheeling and dealing while
in Tokyo for an International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in
the lead up to the 1990 vote.
</P>
<P>
Kirner, who was then premier of Victorian state, whose capital
is Melbourne, was with Melbourne's unsuccessful team bidding for
the 1996 games.
</P>
<P>
"I was just amazed. I have never seen a process more open to
corruption in my life," Kirner told Australian Broadcasting
Corporation radio Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Presents were being moved everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Claims of bribery by bidding cities eager to woo IOC members
have rocked the Games establishment, with up to 13 members
implicated in allegations of misconduct by IOC delegates stemming
from Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Melbourne and Athens lost the Centenary games to Atlanta,
which is home city to corporate giants Coca Cola, Delta Airlines
and CNN.
</P>
<P>
"The big issue I heard when I was over there was that people
were going to be given scholarships," Kirner said.
</P>
<P>
"And this is now coming out: if they voted for a certain
country,which was mainly Atlanta because they had the money to
give."
</P>
<P>
"Athens and us didn't have the money and wouldn't have given it
."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, it was revealed the Melbourne team had sent
a 9,000 U.S. dollar Aboriginal dot painting to a European museum
after a suggestion from IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, and
arranged for a South Korean delegate's daughter to play with the
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in front of a full house, AAP
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kirner said she approached IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch with her concerns.
</P>
<P>
"We said we thought the process should be made more
accountable, he nodded and nothing happened."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Accepts Thailand's Hotline Proposal-- Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has agreed to a Thai
proposal for setting up a hotline for communications at the
ministerial level to prevent future naval clashes, Thai major
newspapers reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's Foreign Minister U Win Aung expressed his consent
over the direct channel linking the Thai and Myanmar foreign
ministries in a letter to his Thai counterpart Surin Pitsuwan, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The letter followed a meeting between Thai Deputy Permanent
Secretary for Foreign Affairs Sawanit Knogsiri and Myanmar
Ambassador Hla Maung earlier in the week to discuss a series of
naval clashes in disputed waters since last December, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
In the latest clash, four Myanmar navy officers were killed,
but there was no report of the casualties on the Thai side. The
first clash on December 19 claimed the lives of two Thai navy
officers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has asked Myanmar to consider Thai proposals for joint
patrols, the setting up of the hotline, and the stationing of
Myanmar liaison officials at the border coordination center in
Ranong Province to prevent future clashes.
</P>
<P>
But aside from establishing the hotline, U Win Aung did not
state the Myanmar's position on the two other proposals, Thai
foreign ministry deputy spokesman Kitti Wasinond was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kitti said recent clashes were "undesirable," and both sides
should "exercise restraint to prevent similar incidents and
misunderstanding between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
He also said the Myanmar foreign minister agreed to visit
Thailand at Surin's invitation.

<HEADLINE> Thai Export Jump Offset by Rise in Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's trade surplus in
December was little changed from the previous month as a rise in
imports offset a slight increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus was 1.13 billion U.S. dollars, from a revised
1.16 billion U.S. dollars in November. Still, the surplus was
about double that in the same month a year earlier, according to
figures released by the Customs Department available Friday.
</P>
<P>
Exports in December were 4.68 billion U.S. dollars, an increase
of 2.7 percent over November, but down 5.1 percent from December
1997, showed the figures.
</P>
<P>
Imports in December rose 4.6 percent to 3.55 billion U.S.
dollars compared with November but fell by a third from a year
earlier, reflecting Thailand's worst recession in three decades.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has now posted trade surpluses for 16 months, after
running deficits through most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance swung into the black after the baht plunged
in value in July 1997, causing demand for foreign products to
drop.

<HEADLINE> Chile Denies Anti-Torture Treaty Affects Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chilean
government official on Thursday disagreed that the country's
decision to sign an international anti-torture treaty in 1988
meant British courts had jurisdiction over the case of former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Presidency Minister John Biehl argued that the treaty did not
enable a foreign court to judge crimes committed in Chile.
</P>
<P>
"These cases are judged here," he said, referring to Chief
Lord Justice Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson's statement that since
Chile had signed the treaty, it could not claim a British court
had no jurisdiction over international crimes.
</P>
<P>
Browne-Wilkinson said the disagreement is over whether
Pinochet as a former foreign head of state has immunity.
Pinochet's lawyers insists that his arrest is illegal.
</P>
<P>
On the third day before the House of Lords in London, lawyers
for Britain and Spain are seeking to uphold Pinochet's arrest by
citing decades of legal decisions, arguing that international law
made it impossible for any country to consider the use of torture
merely as an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
But Biehl said that Browne-Wilkinson's statements were "not a
rejection of the Chilean government's stand."
</P>
<P>
"Chile is part of a series of international conventions, and
we promote in future a world where a series of crimes can be
prosecuted in international (courts), since we believe this will
contribute to peace and understanding, but this must be done with
the peoples' agreement and not be imposed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in London October 16 on a Spanish
warrant alleging he ordered murders, kidnappings and tortures of
over 3,100 people, including Spaniards, during his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
In November, the House of Lords voted against Pinochet's
immunity, but the ruling was annulled last month by the court
which recognized that one of the judges had close ties with the
human rights watchdog Amnesty International, which is campaigning
to put Pinochet on trial.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, seven Law Lords will hear the case. A simple
majority of 4-3 is all that is necessary for a ruling to allow
extradition to proceed, or to free Pinochet.

YANGON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen members of an

Malaga. Police said he came to Spain for contacts with
international drug-trafficking rings and crime organizations.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Court Repeals Clause on Political Affiliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-eight members of the
opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Euro-Left approached
the Constitutional Court requesting that a total of eight
regulations of the country's Administration Act be declared
unconstitutional. Four were approved by the court and the rest
were turned down.
</P>
<P>
By a 7-5 vote, the Bulgarian Court on Thursday repealed a
clause in the Administration Act which required that candidates
for senior positions in government could not have held senior
positions in the Communist Party or have been a collaborator with
the State Security Service of the pre-1989 era.
</P>
<P>
The court said the clause violated basic legal principals
recognized by international agreements and restricted citizens'
rights to maintain political affiliations.
</P>
<P>
Following the cancellation of this regulation, the requirement
for officials to file a declaration of "a clean past" no longer
exists, the court said.
</P>
<P>
Five judges were opposed to repealing the clause. One of them
said that in his opinion, everyone is free to decide whom he
wants to work under by introducing certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight regulations being challenged, another three were
also declared unconstitutional. Under previous regulations, the
Council of Ministers could repeal acts of ministers only at the
proposal of the Prime Minister, and not by the Council of
Ministers itself, as the constitution requires; also, the control
over the performance of regional governors was exercised by the
Prime Minister, rather than by the government; and the
appointment of regional governors was by the Prime Minister
rather than the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Svetoslav Louchnikov, chairman of the parliamentary legal
committee and parliament member of the Union of Democratic
Forces, said the parliament "shall readily obey the decision of
the Constitutional Court."

<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia is the skin cancer
capital of the world with rates of melanoma continuing to rise
despite public health campaigns, a new survey revealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
(AIHW) found that the rates of skin cancer were continuing to rise
in Australia despite "campaigns to slip, slop, slap and stay out
of the sun."
</P>
<P>
Queensland reported the highest incidence rate for all cancers
among men and women, while the Northern Territory (NT) recorded
the lowest for men and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) the
lowest for women.
</P>
<P>
"The incidence rate in Queensland has been consistently high
since the early 1980s," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Queensland had 60 new skin cancer cases per 100,000 people in
men and 44 for women - almost double those of Victoria - while the
NT had 30 new cases in men and 20 for women.
</P>
<P>
"The incidence figures were worrying enough, (but) the fact
that melanoma rates were continuing to rise was potentially of
greater concern," AIHW Disease Registers Unit chief Paul Jelfs
said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government urged to Boost Asia Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australia government has
been urged to boost trade to the Asian region after a big drop in
the latest valuation of Australian exports.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's trade spokesman Bob McMullan said Friday that
the slump in export prices showed the government needed to do more
to bolster trade with Australia's Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of our farmers and industries ... this government
must shift onto the front foot, and play a leading role in
handling the Asian crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) figures
released Thursday, the export price index fell by 5.0 percent in
the December quarter, and it was down 2.3 percent over the year to
the same quarter.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration in Australia's terms of trade is expected to
be amplified Friday when the ABS releases December quarter figures
for the import price index.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said the appreciation of the Australian dollar against
the U.S. dollar contributed to the decrease in export values.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said wool and cotton fibers fell by 12.4 percent on the
index while base metals dropped 7.7 percent, live animals by 2.7
percent, vegetable products by 9.3 percent, gold, diamonds and
coin by 2.2 percent and machinery and mechanical appliances by 0.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
There were also falls in wheat, iron ore and metal prices, it
said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Reiterates Warning of Force in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Thursday again warned Yugoslavia that it
might use military force to seek an end to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
If the unarmed monitors of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were forced to leave Kosovo, NATO
would be left with no options but force, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said in Oslo after a meeting with OSCE Chairman
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek.
</P>
<P>
Solana repeated the warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that NATO would not hesitate to use military action to
push for an end to violence in the southern Serbian province,
where ethnic Albanian guerrillas are fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
"If the only language Mr. Milosevic understands is force, then
he will get force," he said. He did not elaborate on what form of
force NATO was considering.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, NATO increased its military strength in the
Adriatic Sea and put some 200 fighter-bombers on alert, getting
ready to intervene in Kosovo within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Solana also said the OSCE, the European Union and the
six-member Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia would all hold
meetings in the coming days on ways to solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Solana, Norwegian Foreign Minister
Vollebaek left for Belgrade to meet Yugoslav leaders in the
capacity of OSCE chairman, in a bid to persuade them to withdraw
the expulsion order against OSCE mission leader William Walker.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Oil Workers to Lose Jobs in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 15,000 Venezuelan oil
workers will lose their jobs due to the closing of some oil
production facilities, an oil workers union leader said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Oil Workers Federation President Carlos Ortega said on TV that
the plants would be closed down due chiefly to Venezuela's output
cuts of 525,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Ortega said that the government's production cuts and the
possible slashing of the budget of the state-run oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
He said Venezuela's Energy and Mining Minister Erwin Arrieta
had admitted that the output cuts pledged by Venezuela to hike
world prices had failed to lift crude prices.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to end a world slump of oil prices, Venezuela cut its
output three times in 1998, cutting down a total of 525,000
barrels a day, following agreements with OPEC and non-OPEC
producers.

<HEADLINE> 13 Bulgarian Officers Decorated for Joining U.N. Peace Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- As many as 13 Bulgarian officers
who took part in United Nations' peacekeeping missions in Angola
and Tadjikistan were awarded the distinction of providing
"Service to the Colours" by the general staff of the national
armed forces on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The participation of Bulgarian officers in these missions is
part of Bulgaria's efforts toward the integration of global and
regional security cooperation systems, said General Miho Mihov,
chief of the general staff.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the officers of the above-mentioned two peacekeeping
operations were decorated with U.N. medals for their successful
performance, said Major Anton Anchev, a participant in the Angola
mission.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has taken part in three U.N. peacekeeping operations
in Cambodia, Angola and Tadjikistan. The mission in Cambodia was
the largest one. A Bulgarian infantry battalion, several staff
officers and a group of civilian policemen were involved.
</P>
<P>
Now 17 Bulgarian military observers are participating in the
U.N. peace-keeping operation in Angola, with another eight in
Tadjikistan, and one in Albania as a member of the mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The country is also taking part in the NATO-led multinational
stabilization force (SFOR) actions in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
with an engineering platoon included in the Dutch contingent, and
a transport platoon operating as part of the reinforced group
"BELUGA" under Greek command.
</P>
<P>
A national law on Bulgaria's participation in international
peacekeeping operations has already been drafted. The document
specifies the objectives, the tasks and the conditions for
sending Bulgarian representatives abroad for such missions.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Rejects Switching Currency to U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government has
rejected a possible replacement of its currency by the U.S.
dollar, saying that "it is not yet time" to implement the change.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Thursday after a meeting of the 3rd L
atin American Conference, held in the Caribbean resort of Cancun,
Central Bank President Guillermo Ortiz Martinez said the
country's economic prospects this year will not be good due to
the effects of the crises in Asia and Russia and to the financial
problems in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Mexico had showed its real economic
strength and become one of the best options for international
investors in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing which failed to satisfy the Bank of Mexico was
a high inflation rate in 1998, a fact due chiefly to
international turbulence, higher prices and tariffs and the
increase of prices of fruit and vegetables," he said.
</P>
<P>
On January 12, Nobel Economy Prize laureate Garry Becker
recommended that Mexico adopt the U.S. dollar to avoid future
financial crises that could result from the country's unstable
exchange rate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economist attributed Mexico's 1995 crisis to its
exchange rate problems.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka's Parties Accuse Each Other Over Election Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main political
parties, the ruling People's Alliance (PA) and the main opposition
United National Party (UNP), have tried to hold each other
responsible for the unabated election-related violence in North
Western Province during the past month.
</P>
<P>
The PA issued a statement Thursday charging that the UNP
attempted to sabotage the election, as the alliance was going to
win the poll, due to be held next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Instructions have been given to police officers to arrest all
those who are suspected of election violence, said the statement
signed by D.M. Jayaratne, secretary general of the PA.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, on the other hand, alleged that the government was
adopting the "Mafia type of politics" in the province.
</P>
<P>
UNP's chief spokesman Karunasena Kodituwakku said the
government had moved police officers to prepare the ground for the
violence.
</P>
<P>
Police said that since nominations were received in
mid-December for the North Western Provincial Council elections,
incidents of election-related violence have risen to 611 up to
noon Thursday, including two cases of murder and nine attempted
murders.
</P>
<P>
As election-related violence escalated, various organizations
and prominent citizens have appealed to the political parties to
cease their campaign of violence and ensure a free and fair
election.
</P>
<P>
Police fear that violence will escalate even further during and
after the poll.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Becomes Biggest Recipient of Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The economic crisis plaguing
Indonesia since July 1997 made the country the world's biggest
recipient of food aid in 1998, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
From the time when the economic crisis began until the end of
1998, Indonesia had secured food aid commitments, in the form of
grants and soft loans, worth 168 million U.S. dollars from donor
countries and international institutions, State Minister of Food
Affairs and Horticulture A.M. Saefuddin has said recently.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest donor is the World Food Program (WFP), providing
us with a grant worth 90.5 million U.S. dollars, mostly in the
form of foodstuff for babies," the Jakarta Post daily Friday
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Indonesia had also received food aid commitments
from Australia, the United States, Canada and the European Union,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The country also received aid commitments from the
International Committee of the Red Cross, the Office of the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the U.N. Development Program
and the World Food program, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Indonesia also received grants and soft loans in
the form of rice, including that from Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Saefuddin said the food aid was directed to Indonesia because
the crisis had forced many Indonesians to live below the poverty
line and created dire food shortages.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, the number of people living
below the poverty line in Indonesia at the end of 1998 had reached
80 million, more than 40 percent of the country's total
population.

<HEADLINE> China's Telecom Monopoly Heads For Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications
giant, China Telecom, is about to undergo substantial reforms,
according to Shanghai Securities News.
</P>
<P>
The plan to split the gigantic company into four independent
sectors -- conventional telephone, mobile communications,
satellite data transmission ,and paging -- is about to get the
go-ahead from policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the cable network, telecommunications
network, and computer network are expected to be integrated
sooner or later as the telecommunications sector opens up and
information technology expands. If this happens, analysts say, it
will mean that China has entered the digital world.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications sector is one of fastest growing
worldwide and China's telecommunications industry grew 36.1
percent last year, far greater than its 7.8 percent growth
overall.
</P>
<P>
But, the longtime monopoly has resulted in inefficiency and
high costs in the sector, which proves to be unfavorable to its
long-term development. In Beijing alone, telephone installation
fees once hit a record high of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan and the
average per-minute cost of a long distance international call was
about 29 yuan, or six times the cost in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the public switch-board telephone network was
100 million lines by 1997, the second largest network in the
world. The number of mobile phone users had almost doubled to
22.63 million by November of last year, from 12.23 million in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Salinas Sentenced to 50 Years in Prison for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 21 (Xinhua) -- After a four-year trial,
Raul Salinas, the elder brother of Mexico's former President
Carlos Salinas, was sentenced to 50 years in prison for murdering
a rival politician.
</P>
<P>
Salinas, 52, is accused of having masterminded the September
1994 murder of his former brother-in-law, Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu, secretary general of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
Salinas has denied all involvement in the killing.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented decision marked a change in Mexico's
political system, where a single-party had ruled for nearly 70
years, and former presidents and their relatives had always
enjoyed impunity despite suspected wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
Many Mexicans also believe Raul is paying for his brother,
Carlos Salinas, who left the country in disgrace after his
1988-94 term and is currently living in self-imposed exile in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz Massieu was killed by one bullet to the neck outside a
Mexico City hotel on September 28, 1994. The killer, Daniel Ag
uilar Trevino, was arrested almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
Trevino said he had been hired and armed by four men who later
implicated Salinas. But the suspects never met Salinas directly,
dealing instead with ruling party congressman Manuel Munoz Rocha,
who has since disappeared and is believed to be dead.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said that Salinas and Ruiz Massieu, who was
once married to a sister of Raul and Carlos Salinas, had had
personal and political differences.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts believe that the case is built on
circumstantial evidence and that the prosecution has failed to
establish sound motives.
</P>
<P>
Salinas has been serving time since 1995 in the high-security
prison of Alomoloya, on charges of homicide, illegal enrichment
and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Swiss authorities recently seized 114.4 million dollars worth
of Salinas' bank accounts in Geneva and London as probable
laundered drug money.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses under a U.S. protection program have testified that
Raul Salinas had received a total of 500 million dollars in
protection money by Colombian and Mexican drug lords.

<P>
Wang's service may help in the cyberspace, but it will be
quite another thing if the virus is intentionally inserted into a
computer program at the workplace.
</P>
<P>
In what appears to be Beijing's first crime involving
computers, a computer technology company's former employee has
planted "logical bomb" in more than 160,000 sets of computer
educational software programs. The virus has been designed to
erase data on computer hard disks if the software is operated on
every 27th day after March 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
The company said yesterday that it warranted the educational
software distributed in its nationwide distribution networks
after January 4 were free from any virus.

<HEADLINE> South Pole Ice Cap Shows Global Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A crack has recently been
found in the ice cap of the South Pole, which is possible proof
that the global air temperature had risen, said Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi, director of the pole-area exploration office under
the State Oceanographic Administration, said that if all the ice
sheet in the South Pole area melted, the world's sea level would
rise 65 to 70 meters.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, a national report on global
atmospheric changes based on data collected in the Antarctic will
be compiled and presented by the China 15th South Pole
Exploration Team.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say a rise of 1.5 centigrade degrees in average
temperature around the globe will result in a 2.5 centigrade rise
in the South Pole area's air temperature.
</P>
<P>
Because of the fragile ecology in the South Pole area, slight
changes elsewhere can expert a great influence in the South Pole,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The ice sheet at the South Pole contains records of the
changes in the ancient environment and air of the earth.
</P>
<P>
Samples drilled from the sheet can help scientists explain
atmospheric changes on earth over the past 100 years and allow
them to forecast what will happen in the earth's air for the
coming century, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
China's 15th South Pole Exploration Team successfully
traversed the highest part of the pole on January 8, and
scientists have obtained a large number of ice-sheet samples from
the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is exploring ways to
cure malaria by using traditional medicine instead of western one.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the Health Department applied Western medicine in
taking measures to control the disease, and now it is time to find
out whether the use of traditional medicine can cure malaria or
not," Major-General Ket Sein, Myanmar Minister of Health, told a
meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day inter-sectoral meeting on treatment of malaria
by traditional medicine, Ket Sein said malaria is causing trouble
to those taking up national defense duties in remote border areas
and working in exploration and production of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
He urged the participants to develop potent traditional
medicines through holding similar meetings and doing research.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italy Says No Special Alert at Naval Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The commander of Italian Naval
Bases Giovanni Capone said Thursday no special military alert had
been sounded over the Kosovo crisis in its Brindisi naval base.
</P>
<P>
The base, which is located near the Adriatic port city of Br
indisi, in southern Italy, is the first port on call for the
military build-up of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) flotilla, the commander said.
</P>
<P>
He said no orders have been received from NATO, adding "We are
used to these kinds of operations in an area as delicate as the
Adriatic."
</P>
<P>
Military experts said the Italian units at Brindisi need only
12 hours to go into action. "But this can be cut even further in
case of need," said Capone, who pointed out that the port has
been a center of active naval operations since the international
community imposed sanctions against former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> China is cautious on Viagra Introduction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new drug has been found, however, in the medical markets
of Beijing, Guangzhou, and Zhengzhou, and in all cases it has
been dealt with as fake medicine by local public health
departments.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, an official with the
Ministry of Health, who refused to give his name, disclosed that
the ministry "is rather cautious on the import of this medicine".
</P>
<P>
Sources with the State Drug Administration explained that
according to laws and regulations relating to medicine, China
will monitor the efficiency of any imported drug by conducting
clinical test before allowing it into the market.
</P>
<P>
Dr.Jiang Hui of the Beijing Medical Sciences University said
that Viagra, produced by the Pfizer corporation in the United
States, is the first drug of its kind to cure the sexual
disability in men by acting on the blood vessels of the penis,
and is considered by many medical experts to be a scientific
revolution in the treatment of impotence.
</P>
<P>
The cure rate for most such drugs is only 20 percent, while
that of the Viagra is said to be as high as 80 percent. However,
Viagra's side effects have also drawn worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the drug can cause allergies and poisoning
reactions in cardiac blood vessels and the digestive and
respiratory systems. Some countries have prohibited the sale of Vi
agra, as over 130 patients in foreign countries have died from
taking the drug.

JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank said
its net foreign exchange reserves rose by 358.3 million U.S.
dollars to 14.322 billion U.S. dollars on January 15 from the
previous week's level of 13.964 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Unhealthy Telephone Service Comes Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Criticism of telephone
companies offering bad information that affects both the minds
and the pocketbooks of customers in China has been mounting.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Evening News recently reported on the case of two
employees who fell in love with paid information over the phone
and managed to run up an incredible amount of phone bills for
their employer. The paper reported that the Environmental
Protection Bureau of Beijing's Haidian District was stunned when
it got its December and January phone bills for 37,000 yuan
(4,450 U.S. dollars) and 38,000 yuan. Its monthly phone bills
usually run around 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed that the bulk of the money was spent
on information services. Between October 21 and November 20, they
were billed for 32,296 yuan by the 262 Information Station. The
longest call lasted 4 hours and 27 minutes and cost 803 yuan.
</P>
<P>
It turned out that a Mr. Chen and a Mr. Wu, two security
guards hired by the work unit, were the culprits. In their conf
ession, they said that they just could not resist the temptation
of the young, sweet, and feminine voices who would chat with them
about any topic at all and listen to their songs.
</P>
<P>
Central authorities approved this business in 1993 and the
number of telephone information services has grown. In Fujian
Province alone, there are now 32 of them.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the then Ministry of Post and Telecommunications
prohibited the providing of pornographic, superstitious, or
gambling information over the phone, but as the competition
heated up, all sorts of information services were created,
including "sex talk show", fortune telling, and "night talk on
sexual life" and sometimes the distinction between sex advice and
pornography got blurred, an analyst says.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, many newspapers and radio and television
stations have expressed their doubts about the practice and have
criticized it and have called for clearer standards.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's GDP to Drop 4.4 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's gross domestic
product (GDP) will go down 4.4 percent this year, Merrill Lynch,
a U.S.-based investment firm, was quoted as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the recession in Brazil will be more serious
than previously believed and will affect the entire Latin
American region, the Brazilian newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch had earlier predicted a 1.5 percent drop in
Brazil's GDP, but the figure was increased due to a 25 percent
devaluation of the Brazilian currency against the dollar recently.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist Francis Freisinger also predicted the
country's inflation rate could soar to 13 percent, instead of the
0.7 percent rate previously expected.
</P>
<P>
He said the main victim of the crisis could be Argentina,
Brazil's chief partner in the Mercosur trade bloc, adding that
Argentina's expected 2.1 percent GDP growth in 1999 had been
downgraded by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, or the Southern Common Market, also groups Uruguay
and Paraguay, with Chile and Bolivia as its associate members.
</P>
<P>
Freisinger said that other countries in the region will also
suffer since Brazil and Argentina together represent 60 percent
of Latin America's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch, which earlier predicted a growth of about 0.8
percent for the region, is now saying Latin America will be
affected by a recession this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economic Observer Criticizes IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian economic observer
has criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for
misreading the severity of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The acknowledgment has come too late. The failure was actually
seen as the IMF was handling the financial crisis in Latin
America," Arif Arryman, managing director of the Econit
(economics, industry and trade) Advisory Group, said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arif made the remarks in connection with the assessment
contained in a report which the IMF described as its first
systematic analysis of the crisis in the East Asian economies in
1997 and the IMF's response. The 147-page report conceded that it
had "badly misgauged" the Asian financial meltdown of 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Arif, the approaches used by the IMF were actually
unsuitable as they failed to notice economic and social factors of
the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the IMF revamp its aid packages, especially
in applying approaches to certain countries by taking economic and
social factors of a country into consideration.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is the 182-nation lending agency
should not repeat similar mistakes in coping with the financial
and economic crises hitting a country," he was quoted by Antara
News Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, analyst Didik J. Rachbini expressed pessimism that the
IMF could adjust itself to the changes in the global economic and
monetary system, technology, and political scenes.
</P>
<P>
These shortcomings have made the fund unable to anticipate the
developments in Indonesia's social and political conditions since
it first stepped in to rescue the country's economy in late 1997,
Didik was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Acquire Sprewell for Mills, Starks, Cummings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Latrell Sprewell's second
chance will be with the New York Knicks, who likely will make him
the third option in a suddenly potent offense.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks made it official today, acquiring the NBA's most
controversial player from the Golden State Warriors for guard
John Starks and forwards Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.
</P>
<P>
A three-time All-Star with a history of trouble with
teammates, coaches and management, Sprewell has not played since
he was suspended without pay for the final 68 games of the
1997-98 season for twice attacking Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo
during a practice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell still has to meet with NBA commissioner David Stern
and union's director Billy Hunter and provide assurances that he
will control his temper. Sprewell is expected to join the Knicks
in the next several days, Grunfeld said.
</P>
<P>
Starks, 33, is returning to the Warroirs. The nine-year
veteran began his career with Golden State in the 1988-89 season
but spent a season in the CBA before blossoming in New York.
</P>
<P>
Mills, 29, joins his fourth team in less than two years. The
forward spent four seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers before
signing a five-year deal with the Boston Celtics last summer.
</P>
<P>
Cummings, 37, joins his seventh team and fifth in three
years. He is not nearly the player he was earlier this decade
but still can be effective and is a positive force in the locker
room.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Freezes Expulsion Order for Chief OSCE Monitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government has
decided to freeze an expulsion order for William Walker, head of
the Western verification mission in Kosovo, Tanjug news agency
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government said in a statement, distributed by
Tanjug, that the expulsion order "remains in force and will be
frozen until the consequences of Walker's conduct are thoroughly
investigated".
</P>
<P>
Walker is the American head of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitoring mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Walker outraged the Yugoslav and Serb authorities by blaming
Serbian security forces for what he said was a massacre of 45 eth
nic Albanians in Kosovo at a village near Pristina last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government declared him persona non grata and
ordered him to leave by around 8:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) Thursday.
Walker defied the order and stayed past the deadline.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the government decision followed talks in
Belgrade between Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic and
current OSCE chairman Knut Vollebaek, who is also Norway's
foreign minister. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic also met
with Vollebaek on Thursday evening.

WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman announced
Wednesday on his website that he had changed his mind and decided
not to retire.

<P>
His agent, Dwight Manley, confirmed today that Rodman wants to
play in the NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
Manley plans to return to Los Angeles on Friday and speak to
Rodman again.
</P>
<P>
"I have been reviewing my options," Rodman wrote in his
website message, "and those options still include playing in the
NBA this season with a contender. Chicago, New York and L.A. are
all cities I'd like to play in. Playing overseas could be pretty
cool, too."
</P>
<P>
Rodman annoucned Tuesday he would rest for a year. "OK, so
here's the deal," Rodman wrote his note. "I've had some long
discussions with the people I love, the ones whose opinions ma
tter most to me, and I've decided not to retire after all.
</P>
<P>
"I know yesterday I said I was history, and with the NBA
lockout and everything going on, I really thought I should stop
playing."
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old also added: "There's one thing I have always
told my fans I would do in my last game that I still haven't
done. I'm sure you know what it is, but I still have to come back
for at least one more game so that I can get buck naked on the
court."
</P>
<P>
Manley said Tuesday there were several teams still interested
in signing the Rodman. Rodman won championships with Chicago in
1996, 1997, 1998, and titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and
1990.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with former senator's remarks Clinton's Lawyer Wraps up Defense in Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's private lawyer David Kendall told senators Thursday
that evidence used by House prosecutors to allege obstruction of
justice was "profoundly ambiguous" and that senators had an
obligation to restore fairness to the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up White House's three-day defense of Clinton in the
Senate impeachment trial, Kendall denounced the Whitewater
investigation that led to the impeachment inquiry as "tortuous
and meandering" and said he was before the trial to rebut the
"rhetoric" of the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles
of impeachment in connection with his relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were
approved by the House along partisan lines on December 19 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Kendall focused his attack on the impeachment article accusing
Clinton of obstruction of justice, saying it was "based on
circumstantial evidence, and that evidence is at best profoundly
ambiguous."
</P>
<P>
"The evidence plainly shows that the president did not
obstruct justice in any way and there is nothing in this article
that would warrant his removal from office," he added.
</P>
<P>
Defending a longtime friend, former Democratic Senator Dale
Bumpers said after Kendall's defense that Clinton was guilty of a
"terrible moral lapse" with Lewinsky but not of conduct
warranting or even permitting his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
"You can censure Bill Clinton. You can hand him over to
prosecutors. But you cannot convict," Bumpers said.
</P>
<P>
The president should have thought of the consequences of his
marital infidelity beforehand, "just as Adam and Eve should have,
just as you and you and you and you and millions of other people
who have been caught in similar circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
With each utterance of the word "you," Bumpers nodded in the
direction of senators listening carefully to his remarks -- men
and women he knows well.
</P>
<P>
Bumpers' remarks marked the end of one phase of the
impeachment trial in which senators sat silently through hour
after hour of opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a team of 13 prosecutors spent three days making
the case that Clinton is no longer fit to hold the presidency and
must be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday, the senators will be permitted to ask
questions of House prosecutors and Clinton's legal team --
through Chief Justice William Rehnquist who is presiding.
</P>
<P>
After that, Clinton's allies are expected to seek a dismissal
of the charges, and Republicans are expected to seek permission
to question witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the three-day defense presentation by the
president's team, some Democrats said they were increasingly
optimistic the trial could be brought to an end in the next
several days.
</P>
<P>
"Continuation after this excellent summation ... would be an
embarrassment to the U.S. Senate," Senator Edward Kennedy told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Republican lawmaker Henry Hyde, the leading prosecutor,
said, "I think a lot of people wish we would just go away. But we
can't. We're going to see this thing through until they shut the
door on us." He held a news conference to renew the House call
for witnesses, Lewinsky among them.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in the United States to be
subjected to a trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped
conviction by one vote in 1868. A two-thirds Senate vote is
needed to convict Clinton and remove him from office. At the
moment, no one believes there are enough votes in the Senate to
remove Clinton.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Probes Mitchell Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- International athletics chiefs
have launched an inquiry into why American sprinter Dennis
Mitchell escaped a track ban after failing a drugs test.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation suspended
Mitchell when he tested positive for testosterone last April,
pending an appeal to the US Track and Field doping panel.
</P>
<P>
He was cleared last month, but the US panel did not make the
reasons for its decision public.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Daily Telegraph claimed on Thursday that Mitchell
escaped a ban by claiming the high level of testosterone in his
sample was the result of having sex at least four times the night
before and drinking five bottles of beer.
</P>
<P>
British team doctor Pat Milroy told the newspaper:
"Testosterone levels will rise after sex, but only to the body's
normal limits."
</P>
<P>
Testosterone is a hormone which occurs naturally in the body,
but can enhance performance by building muscle and reducing the
recovery time after training.
</P>
<P>
IAAF media director Giorgio Reinieri said the case would not
be studied by their own doping commission, which will then submit
a report to a full IAAF council meeting in May.
</P>
<P>
He said the US panel made their decision on the basis that
they were "not sure from where the testosterone came, if it was a
product of the body itself or the result of something wrong".
</P>
<P>
Reinieri added: "That was the explanation sent. There are some
special situations that can justify this high level of
testosterone, according to the USATF panel."
</P>
<P>
Mitchell began running at the age of six and won bronze medals
in the 100 meters at the 1991 World Championships and 1996
Olympic Games in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> British Sports Minister: IOC Must be Clean Before UK Bids Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- British sports minister Tony
Banks threatened on Thursday that Britain should not bid for any
more Olympic Games before the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) has cleared up a bribery scandal over the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
The IOC will decide on Saturday whether more than a dozen
members broke rules on receiving gifts before Salt Lake City won
the right to stage the 2002 Games in a vote in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The growing crisis has prompted questions about how previous
cities won the right to host Summer or Winter Games. The British
cities of Manchester and Birmingham have between them made three
failed bids to win past Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
Banks said he would make his displeasure known to IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch at a meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going say to him that what has happened up to now is
totally unacceptable and we're looking to the IOC to clear their
act up otherwise we won't be interested in making any bids," he
told British television.
</P>
<P>
"I think cities like Manchester who competed fairly for
previous Olympic Games have the right to feel very, very upset
tonight that they were not competing on a level playing field,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC is presently investigating allegations that members
received around 600,000 U.S. dollars worth of goods and services
from Salt Lake. The investigation concerns only the U.S. city's
bid but it plans to widen the probe to other campaigns.
</P>
<P>
"We have to clean this process up and until it's cleaned up
and our own British Olympic Associations's recommendations are
put into place, I would not be in favour of any city in this
country bidding for any of the Olympic Games in the future," the
sports minister said.
</P>
<P>
London has been rumoured to be interested in making a bid for
the Summer Games in 2012. The IOC vote for those Games will take
place in 2005.

WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must do more
than let a top international envoy remain in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider this problem resolved. On the contrary, we
continue to consult with NATO allies about next steps," U.S.
State Department James Rubin said after Belgrade announced that
it had decided to freeze an order expelling OSCE ambassador
William Walker, head of the Western verification mission in
Kosovo.
</P>

He said Washington regards President Milosevic's move to
suspend his expulsion of Walker as "a necessary but not

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson, who knocked
down Francois Botha of South Africa on Saturday, is likely to
fight Axel Schulz of Germany on April 24 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
A Showtime television executive producer Jay Larkin confirmed
the date Thursday but said an opponent would be selected next
week.
</P>
<P>
Possible opponents for Tyson also include Michael Moorer, but
the fight can be carried on only when Tyson can escape from jail
sentence next month.
</P>
<P>
Tyson knocked down Botha in the fifth round but lost every
round on the scorecards of two of the three judges.
</P>
<P>
Larkin said some 750,000 homes bought the fight at an average
price of $45, beneath the 1 million or so he had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
"It's still the biggest pay-per-view event since Tyson-Holyfi
eld fight," Lakin said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges IOC Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The chief executive of the
British Olympic Association believed Salt Lake City should not be
allowed to stage the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
But Simon Clegg acknowledges there is not enough time left for
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to find a new host, the
BBC reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clegg's comments followed further damaging revelations about
the bidding process which resulted in the US city being awarded
the event by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Fennbach, a member of the Salt Lake City bid team, has
alleged that a suitcase containing 5,000 U.S. dollars was used to
provide hospitality for members of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
"When an IOC member came to town there was an incredible
effort to wine, dine and impress," said Fennbach.
</P>
<P>
The scandal has already witnessed the resignation of Pirjo
Haggman of Finland and another 12 IOC members are set to be
implicated in a report due to be published at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The British Olympic Association has called for a complete
overhaul of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Clegg said: "The IOC is considering a number of different
options. We have put our own thoughts forward and we think there
should be a complete reform of the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
"It would reduce costs, simplify the system and eradicate any
misuse of the power of IOC members."
</P>
<P>
He said guidelines given to cities had clearly been broken and
some IOC members had "acted improperly".
</P>
<P>
Clegg added: "In a perfect world, Salt Lake City wouldn't be
allowed to host the 2002 Games but the practicalities of the s
ituation mean that finding an alternative at such short notice
would be almost impossible."
</P>
<P>
Ken Bulloch of the Salt Lake City bidding team agrees that it
is time to revise the terms and conditions which were negotiated
during the battle to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It is one thing to welcome people into your homes, city and
state. It is another to bend over backwards to give them anything
their hearts desire and which their rules prevent them from
taking,"said Bulloch.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is determine how we can put the Olympic
movement back on track."
</P>
<P>
A report into the Salt Lake City scandal is expected to reveal
that bribery within the Olympic movement has been going on for
decades.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal claimed the confidential report said
the US city spent more than 400,000 U.S. dollars on gifts and
payments during the bidding for and after winning the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
The IOC meets this weekend to decide what action to take
against members linked with the Salt Lake City affair.

<HEADLINE> ECB Says Money Markets Functioning Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
expressed on Thursday its satisfaction with the functioning of the
new single European currency, the euro, saying the money market in
Euroland was running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The ECB eased its lending corridor, setting a 2 per cent
deposit rate and a 4.5 per cent marginal lending rate.
</P>
<P>
As a transitory measure, the deposit rate was initially set at
2.75 per cent and the marginal lending rate at 3.25 per cent. The
temporary narrowing of the corridor was aimed to ensure a smooth
launch of the new euro money market.
</P>
<P>
But the ECB said Thursday the narrow corridor was no longer
needed.
</P>
<P>
As had been anticipated the ECB governing council at its
meeting in Frankfurt Thursday left the benchmark interest rate in
the 11 nations of the euro zone unchanged at 3 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The ECB has been in charge of setting the interest rates for
the whole euro zone since the start of the euro his year.

NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Stocks dropped sharply on Wall
Street Thursday, triggered by a sell-off in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,264.08, down 71.83,
the consecutive plunge in two days. The Dow got as low as
9,228.55, down nearly 103 points during the trading session.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq index opened lower and investors
intensified their sellings after an influential analyist said the
"bubble" in those stocks is close to an end. The index finished
down 70.77 at 2,344.72.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNBC, Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment
strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. said "there is market risk in the
Internet stocks right now." The selling spread to the blue chips
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The sell-off was also caused by the worries about the financial
troubles in Brazil. Despite the approval by Brazilian congress of
an austerity measure, stocks and currency values plummeted in the
country Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broad blue chips were also lower. Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and the United States President Bill Clinton on Thursday discussed
the crisis over Kosovo and agreed that both sides should work to
find a political solution, British officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had spoken by telephone for half an hour and
mainly focused on the situation in the Serbain province of Kosovo,
a Blair spokesman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their concern and agreed that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic should be brought back to line to the deal he
signed last October on ending the clashes between his force and
the Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"They reviewed preparations on the military side, should the
military option prove necessary. They equally agreed that it was
vital to inject new life into a political process aimed at
bringing both sides to the table," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia, consists
of U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, will meet in
London on Friday to discuss the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, 45 ethnic Albanians were found dead in Kosovo.
Western monitors in that region accused the Yugoslav government
forces of killing the plain civilians while Milosevic said that
those killed were terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The situation is still intense as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization threatened to strike Yugoslavia military bases in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But even before last Friday's killing, Western negotiators had
been unable to persuade the feuding political and military leaders
of the Kosovo Albanians to come to the table.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Cease-fire in Southern Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday welcomed an agreement to extend a cease-fire in southern
Sudan and urged the Khartoum government and southern rebels to
ensure their forces observed the truce.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Movement (SPLM) agreed to extend the suspension of
fighting in the Bahr el Ghazal region to at lease April 15 as the
previous six-month cease-fire agreed last July 15 has expired.
</P>
<P>
"The United States welcomes the agreement," a State Department
statement said. "We urge the government of Sudan and the SPLM to
ensure that all forces under their control abide by the
cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the truce had played a crucial role in
permitting the delivery of relief supplies to victims of the
famine in southern Sudan, but the area would still need high
levels of assistance until at least October 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the government of Sudan and the SPLM, therefore, to
extend the cease-fire in Bahr el Ghazal beyond April 15," the
State Department added.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire should be the first step toward a political
solution to the long war, which broke out in 1983, it said.
</P>
<P>
The SPLM has been fighting for greater autonomy or
independence for the Christian and animist south of the country
from the Moslem and Arabized north.

<HEADLINE> Barshefsky Urges Japan to Open Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. trade representative
Charlene Barshefsky Thursday urged Japan to open its market in an
effort to ease the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Asia Society in New York, Barshefsky said, "Japan
must act with speed and decision."
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky asked Japan to serve as a market for its neighbors
during the crisis, saying that Japan's contribution to IMF rescue
packages for the crisis is welcome, but financial aid cannot
replace the losses suffered by East Asian countries in their
exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
East Asian exports to Japan last year fell by 20 billion U.S.
dollars -- nearly a fifth of Asia's exports to Asia's largest
economy and this includes a loss of over 1 billion U.S. dollars in
Thai exports, 4 billion dollars in Chinese exports and 3.5 billion
dollars in Indonesian exports, she said.
</P>
<P>
The market opening in Japan is also in the U.S. interest.
Barshefsky also urged Japan to open its markets to the U.S.
products and stop its dumping in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
She said U.S. goods exports to Japan fell by over 7 billion
dollars last year and Japan should work with the United States to
stop noneconomic surges of exports in areas like steel and ensure
fair trade.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said the Japanese government must begin with fiscal
stimulus and financial reform and at the same time make a decisive
break with the regulatory webs and closed markets.
</P>
<P>
"Trade tensions in our relationship are rising," she said,
adding that "from rice and flat glass to autos and insurance,
Japan faces renewed friction and mistrust."
