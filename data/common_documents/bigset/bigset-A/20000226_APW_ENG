<HEADLINE> Virginia company tops Entergy's offer for two nuclear plants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The New York Power Authority is finding that it has
two suitors for its two nuclear power plants.
<P>
	   The Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Resources made an unsolicited bid Friday
for the plants which it said is more than 12 percent higher than what the New
Orleans-based Entergy Corp. has offered.
</P>
<P>
	   The $686 million bid for the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear power plant north
of Syracuse and the Indian Point 3 plant in New York City's northern suburbs
comes nearly two weeks after NYPA announced a $638 million agreement in
principle to sell the plants to Entergy.
</P>
<P>
	   NYPA, which provides more than a quarter of the state's electricity and is
currently the largest state-owned power organization, is in the process of
unloading power-generating plants as part of New York's electricity deregulation
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominion's offer will be considered, said power authority spokesman Mike
Petralia. But he added that NYPA is comfortable with the deal it has already
negotiated with Entergy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel we're under obligation to review it, but I have to emphasize that
we are not soliciting," Petralia said. "One of the reasons we went into
exclusive negotiations (with Entergy) rather than a bidding process is we didn't
want to be disruptive to our employees."
</P>
<P>
	   NYPA does have the option of accepting Dominion's offer, despite its
agreement in principle with Entergy.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy, Petralia said, had met a series of objectives set by NYPA in the
negotiations, including the ensured retention of the 1,700 NYPA staffers now
employed at both plants and the continuation of low-cost power purchase
agreements with public entities such as the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominion has reviewed NYPA's proposed contract with Entergy and is prepared
to match the terms, but pay 12 percent more, Dominion spokesman Jim Norville
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy had offered $50 million for the two plants on closing a purchase
deal followed by seven annual installments of about $84 million. Counting fuel
purchase, NYPA values Entergy's total offering at $805 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Both firms have indicated a desire to become players in what industry
officials call the "main domain" - the swath of Eastern Seaboard states which
consumes 40 percent of the nation's power.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating multiple plants in a region is a trend among independent power
companies, Petralia said, as they can then streamline operations, purchase in
bulk, and transfer employees. NYPA's owning just two plants was akin to
operating a "mom and pop" store rather than a grocery store chain, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominion currently owns and operates the North Anna Power Station, which has
two 950-megawatt pressurized water reactors, and the Surry Power Station, which
has two 850-megawatt pressurized water reactors. Both are in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   It serves 4 million retail gas and electric customers in five states, with a
20,000-megawatt generating capacity, and an additional 6,000 megawatts under
development. Dominion is also one of the largest independent oil and natural gas
exploration and production companies in North America, with 3 trillion cubic
feet of reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   For Entergy, the purchase would be the second in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   In July, Entergy bought the Pilgrim Nuclear Station at Plymouth, Mass., from
Boston Edison for $81 million, the first nuclear plant sale by a utility in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy also operates four nuclear plants, including Arkansas Nuclear One in
Russellville, Ark.; Waterford 3 at Taft, La.; the River Bend station near St.
Francisville, La.; and Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Port Gibson, Miss. It is
also managing the decommissioning of the Maine Yankee plant near Wiscasset,
Maine, and Northeast Utilities' Milestone Unit 1 station near Waterford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the NYPA board and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission would have to
approve either deal.
</P>
<P>
	   NYPA's board is expected to review both offers at its monthly meeting next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope and expect that NYPA's board in its meeting next Tuesday will
conclude that Entergy Nuclear has the most comprehensive and competitive offer
to buy the NYPA plants, run them safely and economically and provide a bright
future for NYPA's 1,700 nuclear employees," Entergy spokesman Carl Crawford
said.

<HEADLINE> Bush stresses "Reaganesque" tax cut; Gore soars in poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush has launched a pre-primary
television blitz in New York, including an ad stressing his "Reaganesque" tax
cut plan "worthy of a new president."
<P>
	   The ad, airing in other states that are also have primaries on March 7,
calls Bush "a once-in-a-generation leader with a bold agenda" who comes with a
"fresh leadership style."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's New York campaign team, headed up by Gov. George Pataki, said Friday
that the ad offensive was part of a $1.5 million effort by the Texas governor to
sweep New York's March 7 GOP primary and blunt Sen. John McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush ad appeared designed to battle McCain for the Ronald Reagan mantle.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the McCain camp launched a new ad that said: "You can't turn on
your TV without seeing an ad from the establishment trying to fool you about me.
Here's some straight talk: I'm a proud Reagan Republican."
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown McCain closing fast on Bush in New York or having
already caught up to the Texas governor who has the backing of most of the
state's GOP hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, a new statewide poll showed Al Gore with a massive
and widening lead over Bill Bradley in New York among enrolled Democrats.
Nonetheless, the poll found the vice president's lead among those who definitely
plan to vote in the state's March 7 Democratic primary had narrowed.
</P>
<P>
	   New York, where Bradley once starred for the New York Knicks basketball
team, is considered a must-win state for the former senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion poll found that among
registered Democrats, Gore led Bradley, 56 percent to 32 percent, up from the
15-point lead the vice president held in a Marist poll released Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   Among likely primary voters, Gore led Bradley, 59 percent to 33 percent, in
the new poll, up from a 21-point lead in the Feb. 8 poll.
</P>
<P>
	   But among those Democrats considered definitely set to vote in the
Democratic primary, Gore led, 53 percent to 38 percent, a slip from the 25-point
margin the vice president enjoyed among such voters in the earlier poll.
</P>
<P>
	   It is all a far cry from December, when the Marist poll showed Gore and
Bradley in a statistical tie among New York Democrats. In that poll, Gore was
favored by 43 percent of voters to 40 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I were Gore, I would be spending a lot more time in California and the
Pacific Northwest," than in New York, veteran Democratic campaign consultant
Hank Sheinkopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest poll, Gore's favorable rating among New York Democrats rose to
74 percent, up from 68 percent in December. Bradley's favorable rating stood at
69 percent in the new survey, statistically unchanged from the 67 percent
positive rating he enjoyed in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Marist telephone poll of 526 enrolled Democrats was conducted
Feb. 20-22 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton vows that Diallo verdict won't be the end  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - An Albany jury may have aquitted four New York City
policemen for shooting Amadou Diallo, but the fight for justice for the West
African immigrant will continue in the nation's federal court, Rev. Al Sharpton
vowed to the victim's parents.
<P>
	   "We said from the beginning that we would pursue this in the federal
courts," the New York City activist said as Diallo's parents stood nearby in the
rain. "We had to take a detour to Albany. That detour is over."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton has continually condemned the New York Police Department since the
four officers fired 41 times at the African immigrant, hitting him 19 times.
Diallo was killed after reaching for a wallet that the officers said they
thought was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton plans to press federal officials to seek civil rights charges
against the police. "Let it be clear, we will not rest until we see justice,"
Sharpton said, who plans to hold a rally today at his National Action Network
headquarters in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "They brought us to Albany," he said. "They did what we expected. Now the
next round will belong to the people."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials have previously announced that the FBI was investigating
the Diallo case for possible civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're on our way to dealing with the federal government so we can clear up
in this land that any man has the right to stand on his doorstep," Sharpton
said. "Any man in this nation has the right to look down his street. Any man has
the right to expect the police are protecting him, not shooting him. Diallo will
be the symbol and will be the substantial case. And we believe the federal
government must turn this around."
</P>
<P>
	   Following Friday's verdict, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White released a statement
in Manhattan promising to review evidence in Diallo's killing to determine
whether his civil rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   A state appeals court panel, acting on defense complaints that the police
officers could not get a fair trial in New York City, moved the trial from the
Bronx to the majority-white state capital. Sharpton told reporters Friday he had
been expecting an acquittal ever since the trial was moved to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "The foundation of these venue changes made it where we had no chance, in
our opinion, for real justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton also called for peace in Albany and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those that believe in Amadou should not betray his memory by acting like
the ones who killed him," he told a surrounding crowd that had earlier scuffled
with the Albany police. "Don't be a traitor. Be one that is willing ... to go
for the long haul for justice."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton then turned his attention to addressing a growing crowd of
supporters who had gathered near the courthouse in the driving rain to support
the Diallo family.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to talk to the people," he muttered as he left the microphones.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton told the crowd that the trial would only be the beginning of the
fight for justice in the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't take defeat," he said to massive cheers. "This is just the
beginning of the story."
</P>
<P>
	   Inspired, the crowd began marching toward nearby state Capitol chanting
Sharpton's trademark chant, "No justice, no peace."

<HEADLINE> With PM-NY--Diallo Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two strategies by defense lawyers - one before the trial
opened, the other near its finish - helped four New York City police officers
win acquittals Friday in the killing of an unarmed West African immigrant.
<P>
	   The first was winning a change of venue from the Bronx to upstate Albany,
where the case had not assumed the massive symbolic proportions that it had in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The second was putting the four officers on the stand, one after the other
as the centerpiece of their case, to repeat the defense mantra this was a tragic
mistake rather than a murder.
</P>
<P>
	   "What made the difference is the boys themselves," said Stephen Worth,
attorney for Edward Officer McMellon, after the verdicts were returned. "What
they had to say is the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no disputing the trial's central facts: The officers had fired 41
shots at Amadou Diallo, striking him 19 times. Diallo, who was unarmed, was
killed in the early hours of Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense, once it relocated the case upstate, then focused on allowing
the jurors a look at the officer's mindsets that night. While the typical murder
trial defendant would never testify - think O.J. Simpson - the four officers
were almost compelled to take the stand.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of public demonization, the defense was able to present the
defendants in a different light on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "The defense was able to humanize them," said Timothy M. Donohue, a defense
attorney who followed the case. "In a case like this, it's important to humanize
the defendants."
</P>
<P>
	   Officer Sean Carroll, who mistook Diallo's wallet for a handgun, broke down
weeping on the stand while recounting the last few moments of Diallo's life.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll told the jury how he held the mortally wounded Diallo's hand, rubbed
the dying man's face and begged, "Please don't die."
</P>
<P>
	   The jury apparently focused on the officers' testimony. During their three
days of deliberations, they asked to rehear each officer's version of what
happened as they moved in on Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll's lawyer, John Patten, agreed with Worth on the importance of the
officers' testimony. The four cops had refused to testify before the grand jury,
which led to the initial murder indictments.
</P>
<P>
	   But it also prevented prosecutors from impeaching the officers under oath
with any previous statements that the defendants had made about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our best evidence," Patten said, "was always our clients. That was the most
powerful evidence we had."
</P>
<P>
	   It was in December, two months before the trial began, that the defense team
made its other big move - winning an extremely rare change of venue motion from
the Bronx to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   An appeals court agreed with the defense contention that finding an
impartial Bronx jury would be impossible. Attorney Ed Hayes, a former Bronx
prosecutor and a Court TV anchor, said that was the key to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was everything, the whole case," Hayes said. "There's no way they
could have had a fair jury trial in the Bronx. That made all the difference in
the world."

<HEADLINE> Census Letters Mislabeled Addresses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau, responsible for making an accurate
count of all Americans this year, mailed 120 million misaddressed letters to
inform people they would soon receive a questionnaire for the 2000 Census, The
Washington Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   An extra digit was printed at the beginning of each street address, the Post
said in its editions Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A contractor caused the mistake, the newspaper quoted Census Bureau Director
Kenneth Prewitt as saying, but he added the government's quality control
procedures should still have been caught the error. The Postal Service will
still be able to get the letters to the correct addresses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do consider this a mistake that is extremely unfortunate from the point
of view of public response,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mistake will not affect the $6.8 billion 2000 Census, and the forms to
be sent to most Americans next month have the right addresses, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters, being sent for the first time to reverse declining public
response to the count, offer people the option of receiving a form in Spanish,
Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese or Tagalog.

<HEADLINE> Feds, Diallo family lawyers eye acquitted officers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The four New York City policemen cleared of
murdering an unarmed black man may not have long to savor the jury's finding.
<P>
	   Despite being acquitted of state criminal charges after a month-long trial
150 miles away from the city, the officers face a daunting array of legal
challenges at home. Among them: a possible federal civil rights case, likely
disciplinary action by the police department and a wrongful death lawsuit - all
stemming from the shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the end," said Anthony Gair, an attorney for Diallo's mother,
Kadiatou, said after the verdict Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Within the next few weeks, family attorneys are expected to file a civil
suit on behalf of Diallo's estate, seeking millions of dollars in damages from
the city and perhaps the officers themselves. The suit will claim Diallo was a
victim of illegal racial profiling by a roving police unit that specializes in
tracking down armed street criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadiatou Diallo told reporters she would fight to keep her son's case alive
"not for Amadou only, but justice means for all the people."
</P>
<P>
	   But the Albany jury - four black women, one white woman and seven white men
- saw a different justice.
</P>
<P>
	   They got the case after an appeals court decided there was no way the
accused officers could get a fair trail in New York. And after deliberating for
more than 20 hours over three days, the jury forewoman - who once lived in the
Bronx - told the court she and her colleagues had decided the officers were
innocent of all 24 charges against them, ranging from second-degree murder to
reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers - Sean Carroll, 37; Edward McMellon, 27; Kenneth Boss, 28; and
Richard Murphy, 27 - were members of the elite Street Crime Unit when they
crossed paths with Diallo in the early morning hours of Feb. 4, 1999. They were
looking for a violent criminal, and fired 41 bullets at him because they thought
he had a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the defendants dropped their heads in relief when the verdict was
read, another looked dazed. They hugged one another and their lawyers after
learning the jury agreed with their repeated contention that the slaying was a
tragic case of self-defense, not murder.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're relieved, but not rejoicing," Carroll's attorney, John Patten said
outside court.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the verdict, however, Justice Department officials and federal
prosecutors in Manhattan confirmed they would review the case to see if federal
charges should be filed. To prosecute, they must find the evidence shows the
officers used their positions to willfully deprive Diallo of his constitutional
rights because of his race, or that they conspired to violate his constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been monitoring the trial," Justice Department spokesman Myron
Marlin, said. "Now we will review the case to see what, if any, federal action
is required."
</P>
<P>
	   There are well-known precedents for filing federal charges when local
prosecution fails in police brutality cases. The most famous came in 1991, in
connection with the videotaped beating of motorist Rodney King - who is black -
by four white Los Angeles policemen.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Justice Department's decision to pursue the Diallo matter is not a
foregone conclusion. As Attorney General Janet Reno said last year when asked
about the case, "When to shoot and when not to shoot is one of the most
difficult decisions in some circumstances that anybody could make."
</P>
<P>
	   Either way, Boss, Carroll, McMellon, and Murphy still face administrative
charges within the police department. The charges - alleging they violated
department policies - could still result in their firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-nine witnesses testified at the Albany trial, but the most important
were the officers themselves. Each told a similar tale of Diallo acting
strangely as they combed the neighborhood for violent suspects after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, they said, ignored repeated warnings by Carroll and McMellon to stop
and show his hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the 5-foot-6, 150-pound Diallo darted into the dimly lighted
entrance of his building and drew a black object. Boss recalled that Diallo was
in a "combat stance." The officers, fearing for their lives, opened fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon, the first to shoot, emptied their 16-shot guns. Boss
fired five times and Murphy four while backing up their partners. Diallo was hit
with 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   The black object turned out to be a wallet.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Presses for Tobacco Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department says its massive lawsuit against
the tobacco industry should be kept alive because the cigarette companies "pose
a continuing threat to the health and well-being of the American public."
</P>
<P>
	   In documents filed Friday with U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler, the
department argued that cigarette companies made "multiple legal errors" in their
motions last December to dismiss the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The government accuses cigarette makers of conspiring for 45 years to
mislead the public about the dangers of smoking and seeks to recover billions of
dollars spent by Medicare and other federal health programs treating
smoking-induced illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   In filing the lawsuit last September, Attorney General Janet Reno said
federal health plans spend more than $20 billion a year treating smoking-related
illnesses, which take 400,000 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry lawyers contended no court has ever recognized the government's
right to recover payments made under the Medicare health program. But the
Justice Department said, "That argument asks the court to ignore the plain
statutory language of the Medical Care Recovery Act ... (which) authorizes the
United States to recover all medical costs that it is 'authorized or required by
law to furnish or pay for."'
</P>
<P>
	   Rebutting an industry complaint that the lawsuit was unprecedented, the
department said, "What makes this suit unique is the conduct of these
corporations, which for decades have deliberately and successfully addicted
millions of citizens to a product that defendants have long known causes
suffering and death. ... Defendants cannot rely on the sheer massiveness of
their wrongdoing to defeat this suit."
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the industry reached settlements with all 50 states. It agreed to
pay states $246 billion to settle lawsuits they filed to recover the cost of
treating sick smokers in the Medicaid program, which serves poor and disabled
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco lawyers argued that many of the federal government's nonmonetary
demands already are required by the state settlements, such as a ban on attempts
to target children in advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department replied that the state settlements "did not speak to
the far greater costs that the same unlawful conduct has imposed on Medicare,
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the Indian Health Service, the
health care programs of the military branches and the Department of Veterans
Affairs."
</P>
<P>
	   And the state settlements "did not impose restraints that will definitively
end the defendants' unlawful conduct, prevent them from improperly profiting
from the conduct or eliminate the severe future public health consequences of
that conduct," the department added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Some Soup Kitchens Reject Census  </HEADLINE>
   By GENARO C. ARMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau knows that counting America's homeless
population will be a tough task. The Salvation Army could make it even tougher.
</P>
<P>
	   The charity organization says it will keep census takers looking to compile
information from homeless people from entering over 500 of its soup kitchens,
claiming the presence of government workers could scare the homeless away from
services they desperately need.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy could hurt the Census Bureau's already difficult job of counting
that population. The bureau is relying on advocacy groups, shelters and soup
kitchens for help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The legal counsel has said that we will drive people away who desperately
need to be fed,'' Lt. Col. Tom Jones, national community relations and
development secretary for the Salvation Army, said Friday. ``We've been in the
business of feeding people over 125 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Salvation Army, one of the country's largest service providers to the
homeless, is concerned about the Census count ``but obviously our primary
concern is to feed people,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   Census officials said it was unclear if the bureau was previously notified
of the Salvation Army's decision, and declined additional comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The census occurs every 10 years. The first forms will be delivered to homes
in early March, and households are asked to mail them back to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   The process is different for the homeless since they have no permanent
addresses. Census workers will instead fan out to shelters, soup kitchens and
street corners for three days in late March to count that population.
</P>
<P>
	   The Salvation Army policy affects 520 temporary housing shelters that also
serve food. Census workers will be able to talk to residents of the facility,
but not to those people who use it solely for meals, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayors across the country consider the homeless survey an important factor
to producing a more accurate count of city populations. The more people a city
has, the bigger chunk of federal funding it gets.
</P>
<P>
	   Census officials estimate it undercounted about 1.4 percent of the
population in 1990. They presume that most of the undercounted are minorities,
inner-city residents, and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the Salvation Army said it housed 622,867 people in its shelters,
and served over 32 million people total, including both homeless people and
those needing emergency assistance because of fire or natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has estimated there are about 600,000 people in
the country without fixed addresses.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureau has a difficult task ahead even if the Salvation Army did allow
access into its dining facilities, said Mary Ann Gleason, director of the
National Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we really have to be clear about is that it's not an actual count of
the homeless population. It's a service-based enumeration that counts people who
receive some services some of the time,'' Gleason added.

<HEADLINE> Strategies Offered for State Growth  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the nation's governors expect their states to stay
competitive in the information age, they must overhaul taxes and regulations
that could hamper the growth of technology-based companies, said a report
released today.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, released at the winter meeting of the National Governors'
Association, said state governments must reinvent themselves to keep skilled
workers, entrepreneurs and private investment within their borders as the
foundation of the U.S. economy shifts from manufacturing to technology.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is appropriate at our first meeting of the 21st century that we examine
the extraordinary opportunity governors have to create a dynamic new government
that reflects the technological era we are living in today,'' Utah Gov. Michael
O. Leavitt, the association's chairman, said in a written statement. ``Whether
we meet the challenge and seize this opportunity will define America's future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Suggestions from the report include turning over some government functions
to private companies; establishing sites on the Web to provide government
information and services to citizens; and re-evaluating taxes and regulations
that could hamper business expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The tax system administered by most state and local governments continues
to reflect a 1930s economy,'' said the report, titled, ``State Strategies for
the New Economy.'' ``As states begin the next century and the output of services
and intangible goods continues to grow, they need to revamp their outdated tax
systems.''
</P>
<P>
	   At their meeting, the governors will attend sessions and share ideas on how
to spur state economies with technology, ensure broadband Internet access and
examine the impact of a technology-based economy on the environment and natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors are scheduled to meet with President Clinton on Monday and
with senators on Tuesday, the final day of the four-day conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Some other recommendations for state governments in the report:
</P>
<P>
	   --Decentralize decision-making by getting local groups and institutions
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   --Consider forming partnerships with business, unions, nonprofit
organizations, churches and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   --Invest in higher education in a way that ensures it is market-driven and
responsive to the needs of state businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   --Create opportunities for development and research within the state's
university systems and facilitate commercialization of the products that result
by establishing business ``incubators.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Support work force training to improve skills and help citizens rise to
higher-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   --Enhance infrastructure to ensure that transportation and
telecommunications systems can keep up with growth.

<HEADLINE> Airline Crash Rate Said Up in 1999  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen people died in U.S. airliner accidents last year,
a step back from the perfect safety record of 1998 when there were no
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the National Transportation Safety Board reported Friday a rise in
the number of accidents and fatalities involving U.S.-registered airline and
commuter aircraft in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 12 people who died last year in accidents involving commercial
aircraft, 11 were aboard American Airlines Flight 1420 when it crashed in Little
Rock, Ark., in June.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of air-taxi accidents fell by one in 1999 to 76, and fatalities
dropped from 48 to 38. Accidents involving general aviation -- typically small,
private planes -- dipped by one, to 1,908, and the number of fatal accidents
dropped from 365 to 342.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the number of general aviation accidents decreased, total
fatalities increased slightly, from 623 to 628. There were 12 commuter airline
deaths in 1999; there were none in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Some critics took issue with the NTSB report, saying it does not reflect the
full range of American air accidents that took place last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The numbers we have are strictly U.S. What about the hundreds of foreign
crashes where Americans are on board, or military crashes?'' said Gail Dunham,
president of the National Air Disaster Alliance, a Washington-based group. ``I
think plane crashes are far more frequent than people realize.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're working to continue to raise the bar on aviation safety,'' said
Frazier Jones, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman. ``The FAA takes all
accidents seriously, and takes steps to see what can be done to prevent them in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, foreign-registered aircraft were involved in only
six accidents, down from 18 the previous year, and no deaths. Since only crashes
that occur on U.S. soil are included in the report, those numbers do not reflect
the 100 Americans who died in the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which took off
from an American airport but crashed in international waters.
</P>
<P>
	   Also not reflected are the American servicemen who died in a string of
military aircraft accidents last year, mostly during training exercises.

<HEADLINE> Census Letters Mislabeled Addresses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A mistake in the addresses on millions of letters sent out
by the Census Bureau presents something of a public relations problem, but
officals say it won't affect this year's national head count.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post reports today that the bureau, responsible for making an
accurate count of all Americans, mailed 120 million misaddressed letters to
inform people they would soon receive a questionnaire for the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
	   An extra digit was printed at the beginning of each street address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do consider this a mistake that is extremely unfortunate from the point
of view of public response,'' said Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
	   A contractor caused the mistake, Prewitt told the Post, but he added the
government's quality control procedures should still have been caught the error.
The Postal Service will still be able to get the letters to the correct
addresses.
</P>
<P>
	   The mistake will not affect the $6.8 billion 2000 Census, and the forms to
be sent to most Americans next month have the right addresses, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters, being sent for the first time to reverse declining public
response to the count, offer people the option of receiving a form in Spanish,
Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese or Tagalog.

<HEADLINE> Shock and relief, anger and frustration at Diallo verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - On the street where Amadou Diallo died in a barrage of
41 police gunshots, there was outrage and frustration.
<P>
	   In front of the Albany courthouse where the four officers who killed him
were acquitted Friday, Diallo's parents hid their sorrow under a veil of dignity
and the patrolmen's lawyers said justice had been done.
</P>
<P>
	   At New York's City Hall, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir praised the jury for rejecting what the mayor called a rush to
judgment by those who condemned the officers in months of protests last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadiatou Diallo, the mother of the slain West African immigrant, called on
supporters to control their emotions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is in the name of Amadou and his parents that I ask for your calm and
prayers," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of protesters heeded her calls for peace as they gathered in front
of Diallo's Bronx apartment after news of the acquittals spread. Many were
angry, and some yelled "Murderers!" but the crowd diminished within a few hours.
Some complained that the verdicts told police that violence against black and
Hispanic New Yorkers would go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
	   "This community is going to be hurting for a while," said one area resident,
Freddie Montalvo. "It sends the wrong message to young cops: They can get away
with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Two people held up black wallets. "It looks like a gun!" someone shouted
sarcastically. Diallo had a black wallet in his hand when he was shot, but the
police defendants said they thought it was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen people were arrested Friday for disorderly conduct and resisting
arrest as they ran through streets in the Bronx. In Albany, 15 demonstrators
were charged with disorderly conduct for blocking a downtown road.
</P>
<P>
	   At City Hall, a visibly tense Giuliani said the acquittals confirmed his
belief that Diallo's death was "a great tragedy," but not a crime. The mayor's
administration suffered some of its worst days after Diallo's death, which
sparked months of massive protests and strained the mayor's already cool
relationship with the black community.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an eminently fair trial under very, very difficult circumstances,"
Giuliani said at a hastily convened news conference after the verdict was
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this jury reaffirms our confidence in the American system of
justice. There are going to be people who have very, very different viewpoints
of this case. That's to be expected."
</P>
<P>
	   Safir praised the jury and said a police department review board would do
its own examination of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that anybody who's fair-minded believes that those four
police officers left their homes that morning with any intention of shooting
anybody," he said. "I think that the verdict in this case is the proper one."
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett Epstein, a lawyer for acquitted Officer Sean Carroll, blamed the
post-shooting protests for prompting prosecutors to indict the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The prosecutors heard the yelling and the guys were indicted for murder,"
he said outside the Albany courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Others said the case highlighted major problems in police relations with
minority communities and pointed to a need for much better officer training.
</P>
<P>
	   "The courts have made a very clear decision that the taking of a life of an
African-American because of the created fears of white officers is permissible
in the state of New York," said Lt. Eric Adams, co-founder of the group 100
Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care.
</P>
<P>
	   Many critics blamed the verdict on an appeals court's decision to move the
trial to Albany because of intense publicity here.
</P>
<P>
	   "We said from the beginning that the change of venue was set up for this,
and it was," said the Rev. Al Sharpton. Diallo's father, Saikou Diallo, said the
move was "the second murder" for his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton called for supporters to eschew violence and urged federal
officials to file criminal civil rights charges against the acquitted officers:
Carroll, 37; Edward McMellon, 27; Kenneth Boss, 28; and Richard Murphy, 27.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not want to tarnish his (Diallo's) name with any violence," Sharpton
said. "Let not one brick be thrown, not one bottle be thrown, not one evidence
of violence come from us."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said she would review the case and decide
whether to file civil rights charges, as prosecutors did when a white suburban
jury acquitted the officers in the videotaped beating of black Los Angeles
motorist Rodney King. White said in a statement that such a review was a matter
of course.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, said federal charges would be
inappropriate, since the state trial was clearly fair.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know those rules like the back of my hand," he said. "This case doesn't
fall within those rules. The crux of those rules is a conclusion ... that a
person did not receive a fair trial."

<HEADLINE> Caribbean AIDS Explosion Examined  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE RELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- It was a meeting to express
solidarity with AIDS victims, and not a single AIDS victim showed up.
</P>
<P>
	   At the most far-reaching AIDS event ever organized in the Caribbean -- with
simultaneous meetings on five islands -- the nearly empty hotel conference room
in Charlotte Amalie was a stark reminder of exactly what organizers want to end:
the denial and stigmatization of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what we're talking about: denial -- the fear of being 'outed' with
AIDS," said Dale Garee, 54, a Virgin Islander who has lost friends and relatives
to the disease. "There's a whole concept here: That these people choose this and
they deserve to get AIDS."
</P>
<P>
	   He was among five people -- none of them suffering from the disease or the
HIV virus -- who turned up at the "affinity" meeting for AIDS victims -- one of
the last events at the two-day conference organized by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health in hopes of stirring debate and awareness about the
long-taboo subject.
</P>
<P>
	   Peggy McEvoy, the top United Nations official on AIDS in the Caribbean, said
the number infected with the HIV virus in the region likely exceeds 500,000 and
could reach 700,000 -- double the previously reported figure.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is definitely an epidemic, and in the Caribbean we have the second
largest (infection) incidence in the world after Africa," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2,300 health officials, AIDS activists and victims met here and in
Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and the Bahamas as part of the conference, which was
a high-profile departure for a region unused to open talk of sex and its
consequences.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts at the conference called for government action to improve reporting
and treatment -- as well as changing societal factors from homophobia to
ignorance that help spread the disease and deepen the suffering it causes.
</P>
<P>
	   A pastor at the failed affinity meeting acknowledged that many islanders,
including relatives, would cut ties with an AIDS victim due to unfounded fears
of contracting the incurable disease by being touched, scratched, breathed on,
or even sharing a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
	   Baptist Rev. Will Woods said that while no members of his congregation had
admitted to having AIDS, he knew some did.
</P>
<P>
	   "The community is so small," said the conservatively dressed cleric. "If
someone who was married said he had AIDS, everyone would think he was fooling
around, or homosexual or taking drugs through a needle."
</P>
<P>
	   Some of that might even be true: experts at the conference cited infidelity
by men who don't use condoms as a key factor in the growing spread of AIDS to
women in the Caribbean. They also cited chauvinistic attitudes that approved of
male infidelity and homophobia that encouraged homosexuals to marry women while
hiding their male love relationships.
</P>
<P>
	   "Married women (here) don't have the negotiating power within a marriage to
insist on a condom," said McEvoy, Team Leader for the Caribbean program for
Geneva-based UNAIDS, which handles AIDS policy issues, education and research.
"Their husbands would kick them out."
</P>
<P>
	   A third of reported AIDS cases in the Caribbean are among women and the
percentage seems likely to grow, according to the Ministry of Health in Trinidad
and Tobago. It reported last year that seven out of eight youths being infected
between the ages of 10 and 19 are female.
</P>
<P>
	   Sex tourism, fueled in part by poverty, was seen as another major factor.
</P>
<P>
	   "The islands with tourism are the ones that don't want to talk about it very
much," McEvoy said. "There's a tremendous amount of sexual activity involved
with tourism. There's a lot of fear that if tourists are aware they're not going
to come."
</P>
<P>
	   One dire statistic presented -- from a survey of nearly 9,000 schoolchildren
in four English-speaking Caribbean islands -- has 42 percent experiencing sex
before the age of 10. The figure rises to 62 percent by age 12. That survey,
conducted by the Washington-based Organization of American States' Pan American
Health Organization, could reflect a high rate of child molestation.
</P>
<P>
	   One AIDS patient who attended the conference in Jamaica said the first step
to prevention was eradicating unfounded fears.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fear in most quarters is very unrealistic: the belief that it is
transmitted by kissing, touching, by just sharing a bed," said Ainsley Reid,
director of the support group Jamaica Network of Seropositives.

</P>
<P>
	   Emotions ranged from anger and shock to frustration and relief after an
Albany jury returned with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's death last February sparked months of demonstrations outside City
Hall calling for murder charges against the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the Albany courthouse Friday, about 40 people gathered to show their
support for Diallo, taunting police with shouts of ``Don't shoot!'' and chants
of ``No justice, no peace.''
</P>

nearly $2 million in fines because it didn't recall a product eight months ago
as expected by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal highway safety officials on Friday said Columbus, Ind.-based Cosco
Inc. must proceed immediately with the recall.
</P>
<P>
	   Tests almost four years ago indicated the buckles in the Touriva convertible
child-safety seat were too difficult for adults to unfasten.
</P>
<P>
	   The buckles on car seats are required by law to withstand a child's efforts
to get free but must also not be so secure that an adult has trouble freeing the
child in an emergency, such as after a wreck.
</P>
<P>
	   Cosco maintains the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never
gave the approval needed to proceed with a planned recall that has been in the
works since last July.
</P>
<P>
	   The NHTSA last month gave Cosco until Feb. 4 to submit recall plans or face
civil penalties. The agency could fine Cosco about $800,000 for the original
substandard product and as much as $900,000 more if it determines a recall
wasn't conducted promptly, said Kenneth Weinstein, associate administrator for
safety assurance at the NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency also will investigate whether Cosco should have submitted its
detailed plans and launched a recall as early as last July, shortly after the
NHTSA officially notified Cosco it had denied its petition to rule the buckle
problem ``inconsequential'' to motor vehicle safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The recall would include 200,000 Touriva seats made from May 1, 1996,
through Nov. 26, 1997. Cosco, which is owned by Dorel Industries Inc. of Canada,
plans to ship owners extra parts and tools to adjust the buckle within the next
two weeks, spokeswoman Carol Dingledy said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Touriva seats have not been associated with any reported injury or
death, Dingledy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Reynolds, Cosco's executive vice president and general counsel,
issued a statement saying the company acknowledged the petition denial in July
1999 ``and began finalizing the recall details, pending input from the NHTSA.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cosco has been working with and continues to work with NHTSA on these
issues, but recalls, if any, are not ordinarily announced until remedies are
approved by NHTSA and are available to customers,'' Cosco said in the
statement.

<HEADLINE> Ex-President Bush To Leave Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By MEGAN K. STACK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Doctors, playing it safe, have recommended that former
President George Bush spend another night at a Texas hospital to undergo more
testing for his irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, 75, was expected to be released today from Methodist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheerful and joking on Friday, he called his condition ``much ado about not
much.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel good. There's too much to do, too many exciting things to be doing
in our lives,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had complained Thursday afternoon about lightheadedness at a photo
opportunity in Naples, Fla., and spent the night at Naples Community Hospital,
where he underwent tests and was given intravenous blood thinners and other
medication.
</P>
<P>
	   Slipping in a familiar Bush-ism, he said there were other tests ``that seem
prudent to follow up on'' at Methodist.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors, who said Bush's heart still is beating irregularly, said they will
investigate whether the condition his being caused by his thyroid disorder,
called Graves' disease. The disease was blamed for a similar episode Bush
suffered while jogging in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   The irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation, happens when the
upper chambers of the heart contract extremely rapidly -- meaning they don't
pump blood properly into the heart's lower chambers, which themselves speed up
as they struggle to pump blood out of the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley also suffers from atrial
fibrillation, a condition he has known about since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Mark John Hausknecht of Methodist said a ``laundry list'' of factors can
cause irregular heartbeat, which he said rarely preludes a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be important to ascertain whether the thyroid is improperly
balanced, and we need to do some testing on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hausknecht also listed dehydration among possible causes, a diagnosis Bush
seemed to suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had a long reception, long dinner, and I gave a long speech,'' Bush
said, referring to the Florida investors conference he attended. ``Then there
was a photo opportunity. It was pretty hot, and after literally 110 photos and
me just standing there, I started feeling sweaty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I sat down, got up and started taking photos again. What apparently
happened was, I lost a lot of water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's wife, Barbara, also has Graves' disease, which can be controlled with
medication.
</P>
<P>
	   While remaining relatively private since leaving office in 1993, Bush
recently campaigned for his son's presidential bid. He also captured worldwide
attention in 1997, and again last June, by skydiving.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Friday, he vowed to jump again in 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked (Barbara), `What about my 80th birthday?''' Bush said. ``She said,
`Sure, that would be OK.' So, I'm going to do it then.''
</P>
<P>
	   While in the Florida hospital, Bush spoke by phone to his wife and their
governor-sons, George W. Bush of Texas and Jeb Bush of Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was assured that everything was fine,'' George W. Bush said from Austin.
``Had there been a real problem, I can assure you we would have all been up in
arms.''

<HEADLINE> Rival Muslims Gather in Chicago  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two Muslim leaders who once fought over the legacy left by
late Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad are making peace a quarter century
after his death.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and Muhammad's son, W. Deen Mohammed,
stood together at a traditional Muslim prayer service on Friday -- the 25th
anniversary of Muhammad's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Theirs was a message of unity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Twenty-five years later, I know that your father wanted this. I know it in
my heart,'' Farrakhan told the more than 2,500 members of the Nation of Islam
and other Muslim groups who attended.
</P>
<P>
	   The appearance, part of several scheduled during the Nation of Islam's
annual Saviour's Day weekend, may signal an unprecedented unification between
orthodox Muslims in this country and the followers of Farrakhan's American-born
group.
</P>
<P>
	   Sayyid Syeed, secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America,
said he will speak today about fundamental principles of Islam and the need for
the Nation of Islam to join an Islamic alliance in the United States. He says
his Indiana-based group represents 4 million orthodox Muslims, many of them
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed, however, has vowed to stay away from today's events because of a
scheduled speech by Moammar Gadhafi. The Libyan leader is scheduled to address
the Saviour's Day conference via satellite. Mohammed disagrees with Gadhafi's
politics and the Nation of Islam's decision to affiliate itself with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nation of Islam, whose membership is estimated at about 200,000, has
previously held its own interpretation of the Muslim creed, ``There is no god
but God and Mohammed is his prophet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan's group has believed that God became incarnate in W. D. Fard of
Detroit, who was Elijah Muhammad's teacher, and that Muhammad is the final
prophet to mankind. Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of
Mecca, who founded Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah Muhammad led the Nation of Islam for decades. After his death in 1975
his son, W. Deen, led the movement toward orthodoxy. Farrakhan reestablished the
Nation of Islam in 1978 and followed Muhammad's original doctrines.
</P>
<P>
	   Some, including W. Deen Mohammed, believe Farrakhan's bout with prostate
cancer has hastened his wish to reconcile. The 66-year-old Nation of Islam
leader himself says a ``near death experience'' last year left him a changed
man.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, the Nation of Islam has begun to embrace orthodox traditions,
including observance of Friday prayers and the Muslim holiday Ramadan, a period
of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan on Friday urged all Muslims to bury their differences and focus on
fighting everything from crime and drug abuse to poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're here because this is the last frontier,'' Farrakhan told Friday's
cheering crowd. ``It's going to take all of us working together to establish
Islam in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed, who leads the more than 2 million black orthodox members of the
Muslim American Society, told the prayer attendees he, too, remains hopeful for
unity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will support each other in all good things,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Slave With Lewis &AMP; Clark Cited  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM McCALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The names Lewis and Clark have been branded into
history, along with Sacagawea, the Shoshone woman who helped guide their
expedition across the uncharted American continent.
</P>
<P>
	   How about York? Remember him? If not, you're not alone. York was a slave --
the property of Capt. William Clark.
</P>
<P>
	   Now a group of historians says York has not been given the attention he
deserves for his role in the Corps of Discovery's journey across America. They
want to rectify that as the bicentennial of the 1803-1806 journey nears.
</P>
<P>
	   Scholars scheduled a conference in Portland today to discuss York's
contribution to history.
</P>
<P>
	   They hope the conference will Americans understand the true history of the
expedition, and celebrate its diversity without trying to demonize anybody, or
turn anyone into heroes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This man was one of the most famous African-Americans in the early part of
the nation's history and yet hardly anybody knows him,'' said James Holmberg,
curator of special collections at the Filson Club Historical Society in
Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
	   York is believed to be the first black to cross the American continent. Yet
there are no coins or stamps with his image. There is one known statue of York,
standing on a bluff at the University of Portland, where he overlooks the long
Columbia River valley that stretches to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmberg says York was a valuable member of the expedition, helping smooth
relations with Indian tribes, hunting and sharing the burdens of travel with men
who otherwise may not have shared so much as a drink of water with York because
of his color.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmberg is the editor of a collection of letters that Clark wrote his elder
brother, Jonathan. The cache, found in 1988 in the attic of a Louisville home
owned by Jonathan Clark's descendants, provided the first detailed look at York.
</P>
<P>
	   York had been William Clark's slave since both were boys. But York became
like any other member of the expedition, said Ron Craig, who's producing a
documentary about York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's carrying guns, he's talking with native tribes, he's interacting with
white people,'' said Craig. ``We're talking 1804 or 1805, and that's incredible
for that era.''
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the Corps of Discovery reached their westward journey's end near
the mouth of the Columbia River in 1805, Clark documents a vote among expedition
members to decide where to camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And they're actually asking York,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Holmberg: ``Not only is he by now pretty much an equal in the
expedition, he is superior not only to the 'red man' but the 'white man,' in the
eyes of the tribes.''
</P>
<P>
	   It must have been a ``heady experience ... for him to go from a subservient
position in a slave society to a superior position as a figure of idolatry among
the tribes,'' Holmberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Millner, a Portland State University history professor who is
speaking at the conference, said the story of York has not been so much ignored
as shaped to fit each generation's racial biases.
</P>
<P>
	   During Jim Crow segregation of the early 20th century, said Millner, York
was viewed as a subservient ``Sambo.'' Though some modern-day historians see
York as something of a hero.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, unlike Sacagawea, he still is relatively unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Sacagawea, who accompanied the expedition along with her French trapper
husband and their child, received similar treatment as York. But she was turned
into a hero early in the 20th century by the women's suffrage movement.
</P>
<P>
	   And York?
</P>
<P>
	   Scholars say he remained a slave after the expedition returned to St. Louis
in 1806. It took nearly a decade after the expedition before York could convince
Clark to grant his freedom so he could stay in Kentucky near his wife.

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Sues IRS  </HEADLINE>
   By SONJA BARISIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The Christian Coalition is suing the Internal Revenue
Service, alleging the agency unfairly denied its application for tax-exempt
status because it disagreed with the conservative group's politics.
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for the coalition cites tax-exempt status granted to ``liberal''
groups such as the Democratic Leadership Council and the Planned Parenthood
Action Fund as examples of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The basis of our complaint is that the IRS is applying two standards --
one for the organizations they think are politically palatable and one for the
organizations they don't think are politically palatable,'' said Jay Sekulow,
chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, which is representing
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendants listed in the lawsuit include Attorney General Janet Reno and
U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey of Alexandria. The Justice Department had no comment
on the lawsuit, said spokesman Charles Miller.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition, founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, became a
major force in Republican politics in the 1990s by mobilizing conservative
voters through grassroots activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRS concluded in a ruling revealed last year that some of the
activities, such as the distribution of voter guides at churches across the
country, were too partisan for the coalition to enjoy tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit contends the coalition's activities provide educational
information, are nonpartisan and promote social welfare. It also says the IRS
discriminated against the coalition based upon the content of the group's speech
and viewpoint.

<P>
	   Showers spread through eastern New York and much of lower New England today
while blizzard conditions remained in western parts of South Dakota, North
Dakota and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   Dense fog lifted in Wisconsin today after socking in Milwaukee's airport on
Friday, causing flights to be grounded. Unseasonably warm weather caused the
cancellation of today's American Birkebeiner cross country ski race for the
first time in its 28-year history due to poor snow conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Harsh conditions in the Dakotas and western Nebraska were forecast to
continue, with heavy snow and gusty winds over 40 mph bringing near-blizzard
conditions to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The Eastern showers were expected to dissipate as they pushed into the
Atlantic, trailing off to freezing rain and sleet over Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   High pressure was forecast to keep skies partly cloudy to fair with dry
conditions from the Gulf Coast north to the Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
	   Thunderstorms, some of them severe, were expected to move into the Great
Lakes, Mississippi and Tennessee Valley. Fog was forecast to linger late into
the morning in sections of the Appalachians, lower Atlantic and Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong storm system was expected in the nation's midsection, bringing
gusty winds to through the Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes and parts of the
Plains. Severe thunderstorms were possible from southern Wisconsin and Michigan
to Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Fair and dry conditions were forecast to continue through the Southwest.
Meanwhile, more showers were expected to move in off the Pacific, bringing rain
and mountain snow to Washington state, Oregon and Northern California.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Draft Evader Defends Flight  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLIOTT MINOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Preston King told supporters his flight to England 39
years ago was an act of civil disobedience prompted by racial inequalities, not
an attempt to avoid the draft.
</P>
<P>
	   King, who refused induction into the Army because the all-white draft board
wouldn't address him as ``Mr.'' as they did whites, had lived in exile since
1961 after leaving the United States to avoid punishment for draft evasion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only sensible thing to do when faced with nonsense is to say no,''
King said Friday at a 1 1/2-hour welcome home ceremony attended by about 250
well-wishers. ``It's acceptable to say no when what you're asked to do is
heinous.''
</P>
<P>
	   King did not return to the United States until Wednesday, two days after
President Clinton pardoned him so he could attend the funeral of his oldest
brother.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, King visited Macon and the home of the judge who had imposed
the 18-month jail sentence for draft evasion and recently pushed for a
presidential pardon on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   When King and another family member arrived at U.S. District Judge William
A. Bootle's house, the 97-year-old judge greeted them from his front steps:
``Mr. Preston King, welcome back to America and to my home. Do you remember
me?''
</P>
<P>
	   King replied, ``I remember you.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under different circumstances,'' the judge responded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important for people to see that we do not detest each
other,'' said King, who lunched on cold cuts with Bootle. ``I want to salute
Judge Bootle for his strength of character.''
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said King's trial and sentencing was carried out in accordance
with the law. But, he said, King had suffered enough by missing the funerals of
his parents and three brothers. He compared King to other blacks who stood up
during the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The lady on the bus in Montgomery -- Rosa Parks -- it took them both to
show us just how wrongful racial discrimination was,'' Bootle said.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Under Fire on Return to MIT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Some professors at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology have criticized former CIA director John Deutch's return to a
teaching position there in light of accusations he mishandled classified
information after leaving the security agency in 1996, The Boston Globe reported
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, who served as MIT provost from 1985 to 1990, now works at the
university as one of about a dozen ``institute professors.'' The lucrative
positions are awarded to top professors, who are allowed to essentially do as
they please.
</P>
<P>
	   Molecular biology professor Jonathan King, an MIT professor for 30 years,
described Deutch as a ``Washington operative, skilled in the federal
bureaucracy,'' who should not have been allowed to return to academia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> LAPD Whistleblower Gets Five Years  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He once was a tough police officer, part of a unit
cracking down on gangs.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the end Rafael Perez, who helped spawn the worst police corruption
scandal of the city's history, was reduced to a tear-filled apology, warning
other officers chasing monsters to ``not become a monster'' themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The disgraced police officer, who has admitted framing innocent people,
doctoring crime scenes and lying in court, apologized for unforgivable acts and
was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for cocaine theft.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, 32, was sentenced under a plea bargain that grants him immunity for
other crimes he has admitted to investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The atrocities that were committed by me and those who stand accused are
unforgivable acts,'' said Perez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will tell you with every inch of my heart and soul, I am truly, truly
sorry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez was arrested in August 1998 for stealing eight pounds of cocaine from
an evidence room. His first trial ended in a hung jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking leniency, he began telling investigators about alleged misconduct
among fellow officers, contending they beat, framed, stole from and shot
innocent people in the city's crime-ridden Rampart area, near downtown.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal became public in September. In all, 20 officers have been
relieved of duty and 40 tainted convictions have been overturned since Perez
began talking. Several hundred more cases are under review. The FBI and U.S.
attorney's office have recently joined the Los Angeles Police Department in
investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have estimated the financial toll on the city could exceed $125
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the plea agreement, Perez was spared a potential 12-year
prison term and also received credit for time served. Prosecutors said he could
be released in mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The local police union said it believes Perez's sentence wasn't harsh
enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will not tolerate a crooked cop,'' the Los Angeles Police Protective
League said. ``We believe that Mr. Perez should have received the maximum amount
of time in prison for his gross violations of the law ... and the betrayal of
the community-police trust.''
</P>
<P>
	   Perez stood before Superior Court Judge Robert Perry and read a statement he
said he had scribbled in his jail cell overnight. He spoke softly and broke down
at the end when he praised the loyalty of his wife, Denise, who has stood by
him. She was seated in the courtroom front row and also cried.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his career began with idealism, but it deteriorated into corruption.
He also warned rookie cops of being seduced by power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They need only to look to me and to my pending prison sentence to remind
them, that for whatever reason they might have to consider placing the finger on
the scales of justice, it is morally indefensible and contrary to our
Constitution,'' said Perez.

<HEADLINE> 6-Year-Old Mo. Boy Mourned  </HEADLINE>
   By JASON STRAIT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) -- Hundreds of mourners packed a church to say
goodbye to a 6-year-old boy who died after being dragged along a highway as his
mother's car was stolen.
</P>
<P>
	   About 800 people attended Friday's service for Jake Robel at St. Mark's
Catholic Church. They dabbed their eyes as soft music played in the background
and slides of Jake were shown -- from when he was an infant in the hospital to a
recent Halloween outing when he dressed up as a werewolf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jake has been described as a constant ball of energy, a bright light
always shining,'' the Rev. Kevin Cameron said. ``That light continues to
shine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recalling the Halloween picture, pastor James Healy said, ``That spark, that
energy did not end on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Jake's death has prompted a police review of a policy which
allows a freed prisoner to catch a ride back to Independence from out-of-town
jails.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim L. Davis, who has been charged in Jake's death, had been given a ride to
Independence after his release from the Carroll County Jail. The officer dropped
Davis off about a mile from where Christy Robel's sport utility vehicle, with
Jake still inside, was stolen.
</P>
<P>
	   Robel had stopped Tuesday in Independence and left Jake inside the car while
she went into a sandwich shop. Davis allegedly got into the vehicle and took
off.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Davis tried to shove the boy out, but Jake became tangled in the
seat belt outside the car instead. He was dragged about five miles at speeds of
more than 80 mph as other drivers watched in horror.
</P>
<P>
	   The ordeal ended when motorists surrounded the stolen vehicle, then wrestled
the man to the ground and waited for police to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis, 34, was charged Wednesday with second-degree murder, second-degree
robbery, child abuse and kidnapping. He is being held without bail.

<HEADLINE> Court Sends Editor to Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RED BLUFF, Calif. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has refused to halt the
jailing of a journalist charged with contempt for not wanting to reveal his
sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Crews, editor, publisher and lead reporter of the Sacramento Valley
Mirror in Glenn County, is scheduled to report to jail this morning to serve a
five-day sentence ordered by Superior Court Judge Noel Watkins.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews had refused to divulge his sources for a story about a former Highway
Patrol officer accused of stealing a handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Crews' appeal without comment
Friday. During the past week, a state appellate court, the state Supreme Court
and a lower federal court refused to block the sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview from his two-room newspaper office in Artois, a
community of 260 about 100 miles north of Sacramento, Crews said that while he
believes the contempt ruling is wrong, he won't appeal it any further. And he
said he will continue withholding his sources.
</P>
<P>
	   A June 8 Mirror article by Crews reported a 1995 allegation against Dewey
Anderson, that accused him of stealing a gun from a law enforcement drug unit in
which he worked. Anderson later became a highway patrol officer and an
undersheriff, and was charged with the theft last year after the gun turned up
at a local high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews published the story after the gun surfaced and charges were filed. Its
sources were two unidentified patrol officers who read the reporter part of a
written report on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's attorneys want to question the sources to determine if the
statute of limitations on the theft charges had expired.

<HEADLINE> Slater Lauds Japan Airline Progress  </HEADLINE>
    By SCOTT STODDARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NARITA, Japan (AP) -- U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said
Saturday that he is satisfied with Japan's progress in opening air routes to
American carriers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're beginning to see wonderful results from the liberalization agreement
we signed in 1998," Slater told reporters at Tokyo's main international Narita
Airport. "We have service to more destinations."
</P>
<P>
	   Lower air fares have also made Japan a more attractive destination for
travelers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington has long criticized Japan for restricting access of U.S. airlines
to Narita and preventing them from flying on to other destinations in the
country and the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   To rectify the problem, Japan is adding a new runway at Narita so that
foreign airlines can expand their operations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   "The improvements to address space limitations will be resolved by the new
construction," Slater said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airport, 40 miles northeast Tokyo, originally hoped to build a new 1.6
mile runway, but had to settle for a shorter strip because of opposition from
local farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   The farmers, who have been opposing expansion of Narita for decades, have
said it is unlikely they'll ever sell the plots, many of which lie in the path
of the planned second runway.
</P>
<P>
	   The new runway will be long enough for 767 jets, but too short for 747s,
which will continue to use the airport's original 2 1/2 mile strip.
</P>
<P>
	   Slater was in Japan for talks with Japanese Transportation Minister
Toshihiro Nikai.

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Hopes For Stronger Winds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Balloonist Kevin Uliassi was back on course in his effort to
make the first solo hot air balloon trip around the world after deliberately
descending nearly 10,000 feet early today, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi dropped his balloon from 24,000 feet to 14,800 feet over the
mid-Atlantic to avoid an air current that would take him too far south, said
spokesman Peter Fay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he stayed at his original altitude, he would be swung toward South
America, rather than remaining on course for Africa,'' Fay said.
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman said Uliassi was about halfway between the Bahamas and the
African coast at 3 a.m., CST, and was moving northeastward at 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than dodging thunderstorms that kept him up for 28 straight hours, the
36-year-old engineer and architect from Scottsdale, Ariz., has had relatively
smooth flying since leaving Tuesday from his native Illinois. He hopes to
complete the journey in 14 to 20 days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems like we've worked the kinks out,'' Uliassi said this morning.
``But I'm knocking on wood -- luckily we have some wood in the capsule.''

<HEADLINE> 9 People Reported Dead in Algeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Nine people, including six young shepherds and three
communal guards, have been killed in Algeria during the past three days, local
media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Islamic militants killed six shepherds ranging from 15 to 21 years old,
mutilating them and then slitting their throats, the Liberte daily reported
Saturday. The massacre occurred Thursday near Ben Allel, 75 miles west of
Algiers, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate attack Thursday, militants killed three communal guards at a
roadblock near Chiffa, 45 miles south of the capital, Le Matin daily reported.
The insurgents jumped out from both sides of the road, opening fire on the
guards' vehicle as it paused at the roadblock, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Media also reported that seven police officers were injured in two other
militant attacks on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   An Islamic insurgency began in the North African country in 1992, when the
government canceled legislative elections the Islamic Salvation Front was poised
to win. More than 100,000 people have died since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a government peace plan, Islamic insurgents were eligible for amnesty
if they turned in their weapons by Jan. 13 and were not guilty of rape, murder
or bombings. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika repeatedly warned there would be a
tough crackdown on those who refused the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Although some groups have turned themselves in and even disbanded, the Armed
Islamic Group, the most radical during the insurgency, has not officially
accepted the peace plan.

<HEADLINE> Mongolians Await Livestock Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANCOIS TURON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- Thousands of herdsmen on Mongolia's barren
pastures are piling up dead sheep and cattle near their tents and waiting for
international help.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four people have died from the unusually severe cold and snow that
followed a summer of drought. Officials warn the disaster will worsen this
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 44,500 households have lost some 850,000 head of livestock, their
main means of survival, according to figures today from the International Red
Cross. The Red Cross has appealed for $510,000 for emergency food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to buy more animals but I have no money. I feel that I may not
survive, either,'' said Sharaa, 70, a herdsman who lost 80 percent of his cattle
and his horse.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharaa told Associated Press Television News he had to burn some of the
supports for his ger, the round Mongolian tent his family of six lives in, to
keep warm.
</P>
<P>
	   The herdsmen's main foods are meat and dairy products, and they buy
vegetables with money they earn from the sale of their animals. Dung from
livestock is burned for heating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are physically and psychologically very much exhausted'' after
coping with the heavy snows and livestock losses since October, said Rabdan
Samdandobji, secretary general of the Mongolian Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Casualties were difficult to assess in vast Mongolia, a country north of
China where many people live in very remote areas.
</P>
<P>
	   March and April usually are the months when most animals die after harsh
Mongolian winters, said Stev Byambaa, the minister of agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The loss of human life is limited at this stage, but the full impact will
be apparent when spring comes,'' said Enkhtuya of the United Nations Development
Program in Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital. Like many Mongolians she uses only
one name.
</P>
<P>
	   Poor herdsmen, who have no horses, camels or vehicles, have searched for
their dead or weakened animals on foot, Enkhtuya said. Some have suffered
snow-blindness and many lacked food, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow covered many areas, and in others the wind swept the ground bare.
Vultures, crows and dogs fed on piles of livestock carcasses. Temperatures have
dropped to minus 49 Fahrenheit, and the extreme cold was expected to last for
three more months.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuban diplomat Jose Imperatori said today he will defy a
U.S. expulsion order and go on a hunger strike to clear his name of allegations
that he was a contact of a U.S. immigration official charged with spying for
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have become the victim of a major slander,'' Imperatori told reporters
at a news conference. ``I have been wrongly accused of doing intelligence work
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori spoke to reporters less that three hours before the 1:30 p.m. EST
deadline set by the State Department for his departure. After that hour, he was
to have been stripped of his diplomatic privileges and immunities. But
Imperatori said he resigned his post as consular officer at 7 a.m. this morning,
thus voluntarily eliminating his immunity 6 1/2 hours before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton administration officials have said it is unprecedented for a
diplomat to ignore an expulsion order. The White House has not responded.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials were notifying the State Department today of Imperatori's
intentions. Imperatori could have sought refuge in the Cuban diplomatic mission
in Washington, where he would have been beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he said, ``I shall remain in the same apartment where I have lived, and
as of this moment I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have been
absolutely cleared of the accusation brought against me.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and jailed. My
morale and my truth will be my shield.''
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori, 46, said his wife and 3-year-old son left Friday night for Cuba,
since they, too, would have been deprived of diplomatic immunity had they stayed
on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing with Imperatori was former Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, a
lawyer who was retained by the Cuban interest section to represent him.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmoke said Imperatori, who spoke through a translator, intends to limit
himself to a liquids-only diet and does not intend to endanger his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori, a resident of Bethesda, Md., suggested a link between the arrest
of the immigration official accused of spying for Cuba and a custody battle
involving Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban child who arrived unaccompanied in South
Florida on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that the State Department expulsion order was handed down just
three days before a federal court hearing was to have been held on the case. The
hearing has since been postponed.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori said Cuban Interests Section officials have been ``categorically
and precisely instructed not to do intelligence work in the United States''
since the mission was opened 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such instructions have been strictly observed and with absolutely no
exceptions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was asked to leave the country after the FBI concluded he was the
Washington contact for Mariano M. Faget, a Miami-based official of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service who was arrested a week ago on charges of
spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernando Remirez, Cuba's top diplomat here, was expected to hold a news
conference today to explain Cuban thinking on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart declined comment Friday on what steps the
administration plans to take. He said there are a ``number of legal remedies
that will become available to us after the deadline passes.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We, for today, are going to continue to make clear to the Cuban government
that this gentleman should leave, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said it would be highly unusual
for a state not to remove a diplomat under these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, Cuba must either
recall the diplomat or terminate his functions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials have said they are determined that Imperatori will remain in
the United States to prove that the allegations against him have no basis in
fact.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government has said its diplomatic mission in Washington has not
engaged in intelligence activities since it opened in 1977.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RED BLUFF, Calif. (AP) -- A journalist charged with contempt for refusing to
reveal his sources walked into jail today to begin a five-day sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Crews, the editor, publisher and lead reporter of the Sacramento Valley
Mirror in Glenn County, had refused to release the name of two Highway Patrol
officers he spoke with for a story about a former patrolman accused of stealing
a handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews had argued that he had the right to keep his sources confidential
under the state's shield law and said revealing them would damage his ability to
report behind-the-scenes activities.
</P>
<P>
	   But Superior Court Judge Noel Watkins, who ordered the sentence, said that
right is a qualified privilege, not an absolute one, and in Crews' case, it was
denying someone a defense in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected Crews' appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   A June 8 Mirror article by Crews reported a 1995 allegation against Dewey

	   Anderson's attorneys want to question the sources to determine if the
statute of limitations on the theft charges had expired because officials knew
about the allegations more than four years ago.
</P>

	   Crews, who publishes his twice-weekly paper in Artois, a community of 260
about 100 miles north of Sacramento, said he believes the contempt ruling is
wrong and he will continue withholding his sources.
</P>
<P>
	   In a similar case, the student newspaper editor at California State
University, Sacramento, is appealing a contempt order issued after he refused to
release unpublished notes and photos of a fan arrested at the school's football
stadium and charged with resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The editor, David Sommers, 20, also cited the state's shield law for his
refusal to comply with the court's order and could face a fine or jail time. A
judge on Friday granted him 30 days to appeal the contempt of court ruling.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Militants Vow Revenge  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Islamic militants threatened Saturday to
avenge the slaughter of 14 villagers in Pakistan-held Kashmir, where officials
say Indian soldiers slipped across the disputed border and carried out a
massacre.
</P>
<P>
	   India has denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
	   The killings late Thursday in Lanjod, a few hundred yards from the border,
were preceded by a heavy artillery assault from Indian soldiers, Pakistani
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan each control part of the Himalayan region of Kashmir, the
flashpoint of two wars between them since they gained independence from Britain
in 1947. The nuclear-armed rivals routinely trade fire over the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pakistan army flew journalists Friday to see 13 of the victims laid out
in a school room, awaiting burial. Three of the bodies had been decapitated.
</P>
<P>
	   Militants did not believe the Indian denial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will kill Indian soldiers in occupied Kashmir to avenge the blood of
our people. We are not cowards like Indians, who slaughter innocent people,''
said Farooq Kashmiri, a leader of the militant Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen group.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry lodged a protest with the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of India was asked to desist from such provocative acts
which constitute a serious threat to regional peace and security,'' a ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-ruled Kashmir, all the markets,
business centers and government offices were shut and the national flag flew at
half-staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 12 people were killed in their homes in the Samani district of
Pakistan-ruled Kashmir in an attack that Pakistan also blamed on Indian
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmir is the only Muslim-majority state in Hindu-dominated India. Muslim
militants there are waging a bloody war for independence or merger with Islamic
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ishaq Zafar, a minister in Pakistan's Kashmir Cabinet, said Indian commandos
killed civilians to intimidate people living close to the border who they
believe help the militants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want us to stop helping the freedom fighters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed Zaman, a laborer, was outraged by the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a great tragedy. We should all protest and try to help our Muslim
brethren who have been enslaved by India,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Papers Refuse Pro-Gay News  </HEADLINE>
   By LOUINN LOTA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A group of weekly newspapers distributed free to 126,000
households and businesses has created an outcry with its refusal to publish news
favorable to gay or pro-choice viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen editorial employees of two of the papers have quit since
the policy was enforced.
</P>
<P>
	   The papers, which circulate in San Luis Obispo, Paso Robles and Atascadero,
have received about 400 cancellation requests. And last week, about 100 people
protested outside the San Luis Obispo County courthouse, some carrying signs
that read ``No Bigotry in My Town.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, however, the papers have picked up 13 new advertisers
because of their stand, says chief operating officer Todd Hansen. ``We've
received 400 e-mails this week that are just positive and supportive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy stems from a community calendar listing for Parents, Friends
and Family of Lesbians and Gays, Bisexuals and Transgendered Persons.
</P>
<P>
	   It ran in the Atascadero Gazette from Nov. 25 until Feb. 17, when editor Ron
Bast was told the owner had ordered the listing pulled. Bast said he was told
there were to be no stories that showed gays or abortion in a favorable light.
</P>
<P>
	   He has since quit, saying he believes the paper failed in its mission to
provide unbiased coverage of the community.
</P>
<P>
	   Gay rights activists said they were appalled by the action of owners Mary
and David Weyrich.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has the right to do this, of course, but the part that upset me
personally is that he had a great deal of support starting out because he was
representing this as a true community newspaper,'' said Robyn Murphy, past
president of the Central Coast Gay and Lesbian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Weyrichs published a statement about their philosophy in Thursday's
editions:
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue has everything to do with integrity and nothing to do with
journalistic ethics. ... Call us old-fashioned, but it hasn't been too many
years since our professed beliefs were the accepted norm in America. Society has
changed to the detriment, we believe, of us all as a people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hansen said the Weyrichs are not dictating content, ``just our philosophy,
which has been clear from day one.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Gazette papers also refuse advertising from nightclubs and
tobacco companies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Obtains Russia Emigre's Memoir  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon investigators have obtained the memoir of a
Russian emigre who claims to have learned while in internal exile in the former
Soviet Union that dozens of American servicemen from World War II and the Korean
War were detained in Siberian labor camps.
</P>
<P>
	   The assertions, while not confirmed, appear to support, and in some
important respects strengthen, a case the Pentagon has been building for several
years: U.S. servicemen in the 1940s and 1950s were silently swallowed up in the
U.S.S.R.'s brutal Gulag system of forced labor, never to be heard from again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has to be something to this,'' said Norman Kass, who helped
translate the unpublished personal memoir from Russian and interviewed the
author on behalf of the Pentagon agency in charge of prisoner of war and missing
personnel affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Kass said in an interview that the information fits a pattern of anecdotal
reports received during the 1990s that American servicemen were seen in remote
labor camps.
</P>
<P>
	   He is executive secretary of a U.S.-Russian commission that has pursued the
matter since former President Boris Yeltsin disclosed in 1992 that Soviet forces
had taken a dozen U.S. airmen captive in the 1950s after shooting down their
planes. The commission meets periodically, and its staff has done extensive
research and interviewed Russian veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kremlin has backtracked on Yeltsin's statement and challenged U.S.
officials to find proof. Armed with the Russian emigre's memoir, the Pentagon
hopes to pursuade the Russians to provide access to archives at numerous former
Siberian labor camps where U.S. servicemen were said to have been held.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not expecting an easy time,'' Kass said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Kass disclosed the memoir's existence at a meeting of the U.S.-Russian
commission last November, the Russians were skeptical but agreed to study it, a
U.S. summary of the proceedings said.
</P>
<P>
	   The memoir is exceptional because it provides names of individual
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, it identifies by name 22 men said to have been held in late
1951 at the Kirovskij mining camp near the Kamenka River in the sub-Arctic pine
forests of the Krasnoyarsk region. The memoir's author cites secondhand accounts
of area residents seeing the prisoners, ``wearing bare threads and
half-frozen,'' being led from the Kirovskij camp along a road to an undetermined
destination -- ``a dead-end.''
</P>
<P>
	   A witness described as the daughter of the manager of a nearby town told the
author that on Christmas Day 1951 she saw ``frostbitten prisoners being led and
driven like cattle by the NKVD,'' the former Soviet internal security agency.
``They did not speak Russian. They only said `American, American,' and `eat,
eat.' They wanted food,'' the author quoted the woman as recounting to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Kass said that although the events described by the author have not been
independently verified, he believes the man is credible. Kass said the man's
identity and his present country of residence are being kept secret for his
protection, but there is no question that he spent many years in the Gulag
network of forced labor camps. The man, now in his late 70s, was exiled to
Siberia and worked as a permafrost engineer in the early 1950s near the
Kirovskij mining camp where the 22 Americans were said to have been held.
</P>
<P>
	   The 22 names were provided by a woman who the author said worked in the
Kirovskij camp during the winter of 1951-52. The author said she had the men
write their names on scraps of newspaper with pieces of a pencil she sneaked
into the camp's toilets, then put the paper in a jar and buried it.
</P>
<P>
	   In the translation from Russian, only one of the 22 names can be matched
with a missing American servicemen. He is listed in Army casualty records as
Chan Jay Park Kim, a Hawaiian of Korean descent.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim was a private first class in the 24th Infantry Division's 34th Infantry
Regiment, captured by North Korean forces on July 8, 1950. On that day, the 34th
Infantry collapsed in its defense of the town of Ch'onan south of Seoul, giving
the advancing North Korean army entry to most of the rest of southern Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Pentagon records, fellow members of the 34th Infantry who
survived captivity in Korea told Army debriefers that once he became a POW, Kim
tried to mask his ethnic background by using the name George Leon. It is that
name which appears among the 22 on the list from the Soviet labor camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Army casualty records list Kim as having died in Korea in January 1951, but
his body was not recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   The author of the memoir says that he saw only one American in the Gulag.
That was in January 1953 at a camp called Rybak far above the Arctic Circle, and
a prisoner described as a demolition expert appeared at a mining operation where
the author was dispatched to handle a technical problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He also openly identified himself as a citizen of the United States of
America, Allied Officer Dale,'' the author wrote. He said he was not allowed to
talk to the man.
</P>
<P>
	   Another section of the memoir describes the fate of 10 members of a 12-man
crew of a U.S. Air Force B-29 reconnaissance plane, which was shot down by
Soviet forces over the Sea of Japan on June 13, 1952.
</P>
<P>
	   American search and rescue teams recovered no remains from the plane, and in
July 1956 the U.S. government appealed to Moscow for information about the crew.
The State Department note said an officer believed to have been a member of the
crew was seen in October 1953 in a Soviet hospital north of the Siberian port of
Magadan. The Soviets replied that no American servicemen were on Soviet
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian emigre said that in the 1980s he was told by an associate with
extensive experience in the far eastern reaches of Siberia that he had learned
the names of two of the captured B-29 fliers: ``Bush and Moore.''
</P>
<P>
	   The B-29's commander was Maj. Samuel Busch. A crew member was Master Sgt.
David L. Moore.
</P>
<P>
	   The memoir indicates that Busch and Moore were killed -- possibly beaten to
death -- in the Siberian city of Khabarovsk, apparently a short time after their
capture. Eight surviving crew members were put in solitary confinement in a
prison in Svobodnyi, a city northwest of Khabarovsk near the Chinese border, it
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte Busch Mitnik, a sister of Samuel Busch, said in an interview that
the memoir ``reinforces what I believe'' happened to him and jibes with
unconfirmed rumors her family heard shortly after her brother's capture.

<HEADLINE> Studies Find Ex-Farmers Bounce Back  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALLS, Texas (AP) -- All Aunie Sellers ever wanted to do was be a farmer, as
were his father and grandfather before him. But two years ago, $140,000 in debt
and with four growing children, he declared bankruptcy and got out of the
business.
</P>
<P>
	   What a relief.
</P>
<P>
	   "I woke up at night sometimes, and I was in a sweat," Sellers said as he
steered his pickup along the side of a mesquite-covered canyon where he now
manages 55 oil wells. "I said, 'This ain't no good. This isn't worth living."'
</P>
<P>
	   Sellers, 50, is one of the thousands of farmers, burdened by debt and unable
to keep up with the relentless pressure to cut costs and expand production, who
give up on agriculture each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some studies are finding that once they get over the trauma of quitting,
they are glad that they did, or at least that life after farming is less
stressful and more financially secure.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers forced out of business in Iowa during the 1980s wound up with higher
incomes than their neighbors who stayed in agriculture and showed less evidence
of stress and depression, according to a study published in February's issue of
Rural Sociology.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dreams may have been shattered, but most were able to recover in measurable
ways," researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Families who left farming in the middle to late 1980s saw their income rise
from $5,670 to $9,820 per person from 1989 to 1992, according to the study. At
the same time average per capita earnings for families still in agriculture
dropped from $10,870 to $7,950 per person. Per capita income for families in the
region who had never farmed remained relatively flat, at about $8,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Symptoms of depression dropped sharply among both men and women who left
farming. In 1992, in fact, the men were less likely to be depressed than either
farmers still in the business or people who had never farmed at all.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 350 families in rural northern Iowa took part in the study, which was
conducted by researchers at Iowa State University and the University of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, a series of surveys found few regrets among Wisconsin farmers who
quit the dairy business in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of every four farmers surveyed said they quit at the right time and
most of the rest said they should have left sooner. Nearly two-thirds of the
ex-farmers said they were glad they made the change. Others were sad or
ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
	   In a booming economy, most ex-farmers have little trouble finding work, said
Douglas Jackson-Smith, a University of Wisconsin sociologist. "It's important to
appreciate that folks who are forced or choose to get out of farming land on
their feet most of the time."
</P>
<P>
	   Some 67,000 farmers leave the business each year. While a lot of those are
retirements, an estimated 5 percent of farmers under age 35, the most
financially vulnerable period for a producer, quit each year, according to the
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
	   For farmers who are forced out of business, the anguish can be devastating.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a terrible, traumatic deal, like a divorce or loss of a family
member," said Gary Moore, a Tulia, Texas, farmer who has watched several
neighbors go through the experience.
</P>
<P>
	   One neighbor, Jack Hill, who now drives heavy equipment for his county
government, does not like to talk about the ordeal. "I liked it (farming). I
still like it, but sometimes in life you don't get what you want."
</P>
<P>
	   To the south, 70 miles away, coyotes howled in the early morning light and a
stiff, cold wind blew through the canyon. Sellers was starting work one day
recently, checking on the pumping rigs, tanks, lines and other equipment he is
responsible for maintaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly into his rounds, Sellers will discover black crude gurgling up
through a dirt road where an underground pipe has burst. He will have to both
clean up the mess and fix the pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   At $30 a barrel, every bit of oil these wells produce is important. Some
yield as little as a barrel a day, and that is only after the salt water and
impurities that come out of the ground with the oil are removed through the use
of chemicals and systems of tanks and heaters that Sellers manages.
</P>
<P>
	   The job pays $7,000 to $8,000 a year less than he made farming, and it
requires him to work seven days a week. Still, "It's been a relief in a lot of
ways, not dealing with the headache. Not near as much stress, not near," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He knew nothing about oil field work when he started the job.
</P>
<P>
	   His grandfather arrived near here in 1919 on the edge of the Texas High
Plains, a vast plateau that has become one of the biggest cotton-producing
regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Sellers started growing cotton after getting a degree in agricultural
economics in 1971. But in what may have been a critical mistake, he never bought
his own land. He was fearful, he said, of the extra debt it would entail. After
all, he was already borrowing heavily just to operate year to year.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, a neighbor bought and took over half the 1,200 acres that Sellers
had been farming. Unable to find other land to rent, and calculating that there
was no way to make ends meet on the remaining acreage, Sellers called it quits.
His two brothers also have given up their farms.
</P>
<P>
	   "You feel like a failure. ... You have to deal with that," Sellers said. "I
debate that in my mind, whether I was a failure or just getting smart."

<HEADLINE> Pope Prays Amid Modern and Ancient  </HEADLINE>
   By MORT ROSENBLUM AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. CATHERINE, Egypt (AP) -- Pope John Paul II came to Mount Sinai on
Saturday, a jet-age pilgrim revering ancient origins, with prayers that all
peoples whose faith begins here remember the covenant between God and Moses was
eternal.
</P>
<P>
	   Too frail for even a symbolic trek up the steep stone steps from the
Monastery of St. Catherine, the ailing pontiff could only circle the 6,500-foot
summit on man-made wings, in a military aircraft from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   He later prayed silently inside the Greek Orthodox monastery's church by
thorny branches said to be remnants of the blazing bush from which God told
Moses to free Jews from the pharaohs and take them to their promised land.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, under a huge pink-flowering almond tree and a giant olive tree, John
Paul spoke to hundreds of Catholics, Copts and Muslims crowded into the monks'
orchard in the shadow of Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Ten Commandments are not an arbitrary imposition of a tyrannical
Lord,'' he said. ``They were written in stone; but before that, they were
written on the human heart as the universal moral law, valid in every place and
time.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 1,500-year-old monastery and the profane sprawl around it bear witness
to his words.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, God could e-mail commandments via a cell phone relay at a
tourist complex nearby. Air-conditioned buses from Cairo hurtle down paved roads
across what one early pilgrim called a ``terrible and waste-howling
wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors speak a Babel of tongues at distracting volume. The Catherine Plaza
hotel has a pool and a fountain that throws precious water into the desert wind.
A shop called Bazar Moses offers graven images, cheap kitsch made in Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   But Archbishop Damianos, superior of St. Catherine who has spent 40 years
contemplating the holy summit, said in an interview that the papal visit would
refresh the ancient spirit of sanctity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pope has come to this place made holy so many years ago and with
modern communications he will spread from here his message of peace around the
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Book of Exodus says God gave Moses the commandments atop Mount Sinai,
but sticklers for fact argue that no one can be certain of the mountain's
location.
</P>
<P>
	   For millennia, Jewish leaders have focused less attention on the location of
Mount Sinai than on the meaning of what transpired there.
</P>
<P>
	   Long tradition holds that this is the place. Those who ascend the nearly
vertical paths up the brooding and mysterious rock -- the devout and curious
alike -- witness a mystical power few can describe.
</P>
<P>
	   Only fierce resistance from Archbishop Damianos a decade ago stopped a
government project to run a cable car up Mount Sinai. Desperate monks found
allies abroad, including Time magazine essayist Lance Morrow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Egyptians ... seem ready to sacrifice a powerful, living mountain that
is in their care,'' Morrow wrote. ``Perhaps they will make the cable cars in the
shape of calves and gild them. The golden calves can slide up and down Mount
Sinai and show God who won.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the monastery's olive orchard on Saturday, such temporal controversy
seemed far away. Past mingled with present, and the pope talked of a hopeful
future.
</P>
<P>
	   The 79-year pope walked slowly from the monastery and settled into a chair,
a small spot of immaculate white among the black robes of the Greek Orthodox and
Copts.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeatedly, the crowd chanted in English, ``John Paul II, we love you.'' At
one point, the pope took a microphone and replied, ``John Paul II, he loves you,
too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vivian Avakian, an Egyptian-Armenian and a Catholic, wept as she watched
from the crowd with her four children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I cannot explain,'' she said. ``He is our father, who lives so far away
and now he is here among us. He means peace, tolerance for everyone. We all feel
that. When you see it with your eyes, you cry from happiness.''
</P>
<P>
	   As John Paul left, a guitar-backed choir from Cairo sang a prayer in Arabic,
in old words that sounded almost exactly like Hebrew. Christians, Muslims and
Jews share the same watchword: ``Our Lord is God, and God is One.''

<HEADLINE> Bus Bombings Kill 41 in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZAMIS, Philippines (AP) -- A series of bombings aboard Super Five Express
buses in the southern Philippines has left at least 41 people dead in one of the
country's worst attacks against civilians, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 45 people were injured and in hospitals Saturday, many of them in
critical condition, having suffered third degree burns on 60-80 percent of their
bodies, said Mayor Benjamin Fuentes, who is also a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   Suggesting a link between the bombings, Army Brig. Gen. Narciso Abaya said
all three buses were owned by the company, Super Five Express.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the second biggest terrorist attack against civilians so far,''
Abaya said, without naming the group he suspected was responsible. ``They are
targeting innocent and helpless civilians.''
</P>
<P>
	   No group has admitted responsibility for the attacks. But suspicion fell on
suspected Muslim separatist rebels in Lanao del Norte province, who in January
seized and burned a Super Five bus. That attack was apparently planned to avenge
the death of a rebel commander's son who died after being hit by one of the
company's buses last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cagayan de Oro, a mortar was found late Friday inside a bag under a seat
on another Super Five bus preparing to leave for Ozamis.
</P>
<P>
	   A digital timer showed it was set to explode Saturday afternoon, at 3 p.m.,
said Maj. Salih Indanan, spokesman of the military's Southern Command. Police
and the army set up checkpoints along roads to search vehicles and passengers
for bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 36 of the dead in Friday's attack were in two buses and other
vehicles aboard a ferry, where bombs went off minutes before the ferry was to
dock in Ozamis City, Fuentes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Panicked ferry passengers jumped into the sea following the explosions,
which triggered a fire aboard the vessel and damaged other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Five others were killed when a third explosion ripped through a bus at about
the same time in the nearby town of Rizal, said Abaya, commander of the 1st
Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
	   The death toll from Friday's attacks rose to 41 on Saturday, but authorities
gave few details, saying only that some victims in serious condition had died in
the hospital. Other bodies were counted Saturday after being taken to the
morgue.
</P>
<P>
	   Coast guard Commodore Herbie Esutin said the death toll from the ferry alone
could reach at least 45, based on the number of bodies recovered by his men from
the scene. He said divers were searching the waters around the port for at least
two others reported missing.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 30 people with severe burns remained in the hospital in Ozamis on
Saturday, and more than 15 others were injured in the Rizal town bus bombing.
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the most critical would be flown to other
cities with better hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   Abaya said seven members of a military medical team sent to airlift the most
critical victims were injured when their helicopter crashed in a wooded area in
Labangan, Zamboanga del Sur province near his division headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Five buses on the ferry originated in Cagayan de Oro city, in
Misamis Oriental province. They had traveled to Kolambogan town in nearby Lanao
del Norte province, where they boarded the ferry to cross Pangil Bay to Ozamis,
about 480 miles south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
	   One survivor, Verna Oberes, said she jumped into the water after the
explosions, even though she did not know how to swim. She said she saw other
people engulfed in flames following her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was crying, 'Lord, Lord, help me,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A male passenger helped her cling to a barnacle-covered pier before a group
of fishermen rescued her, she said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Watch Philippines Volcano  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM GOMEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUNGA, Philippines (AP) -- Each time vegetable farmer Antonio Esquivel treks
to his farm, he gazes at nearby Mayon volcano for signs of unrest that could
endanger his life.
</P>
<P>
	   He knows the risks. Mayon, one of the Philippines' most active volcanoes,
killed his two brothers, a nephew and about 70 other people with super-hot ash
in a sudden eruption in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always feel threatened in my farm but I have to tend to my vegetables,
otherwise, my children won't eat,'' said Esquivel, 56. He says many farmers like
him are forced to live in constant danger on land near Mayon because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the volcano roared back to life and began ejecting molten
rocks, some the size of small houses, and lava, forcing authorities to evacuate
more than 47,000 villagers, including Esquivel's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of men stayed behind to guard abandoned villages. Many women also
return each day during daylight with their children to check their houses and
farm animals, take a bath and get drinking water or firewood.
</P>
<P>
	   After a day of relative calm, the volcano spewed lava and ash again Saturday
in several new eruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   In some villages, residents rang church bells during each eruption to warn
others.
</P>
<P>
	   The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said a new supply of
lava is rising to the crater and warned of more eruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   More dangerous than the slow-moving lava are pyroclastic flows --
superheated clouds of ash and other debris that travel 50 miles per hour and can
incinerate anything in their path.
</P>
<P>
	   In Matanag, an impoverished village near Mayon's foothills, about a dozen
men acted as lookouts beside a white concrete cross they erected years ago to
ward off Mayon's wrath.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to stay and guard our houses. We have nothing else,'' said Ricky
Abelano, a 24-year-old construction worker whose father was killed in Mayon's
1993 eruption.
</P>
<P>
	   Villagers in nearby Bunga, where Esquivel lives, fight boredom while
guarding their houses by listening to a group of men belting Western songs with
an old guitar and plastic containers serving as drums.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence of Mayon's fury are everywhere. Boulders ejected by the volcano
surround the village, which lies about 5 miles from Mayon's crater.
</P>
<P>
	   Esquivel's wife, Divina, regrets that many don't understand their
predicament and call them stubborn because they refuse to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The small earnings they make from growing vegetables on Mayon's slopes
enable them to send some of their 12 children to school, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who wants to live near a volcano?'' she asks. ``If we had money, we
wouldn't be in this place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mayon, about 215 miles southeast of Manila in Albay province, is famous for
its near-perfect conical shape despite 47 eruptions since 1616. Its most violent
eruption in 1814 killed more than 1,200 people and buried an entire town in
volcanic mudflows.

<HEADLINE> Pope Makes Pilgrimage to Mt. Sinai  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN MURPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. CATHERINE, Egypt (AP) -- Pope John Paul II reached the foot of Mount
Sinai today, making a long-desired pilgrimage to the land where God is said to
have bestowed the Ten Commandments upon Moses.
</P>
<P>
	   He and others who have made their way here over the centuries were
``pilgrims in the footsteps of God,'' the pope told about 1,500 people who had
come to his prayer service at the Monastery of St. Catherine. The ancient
religious complex at the foot of Mount Sinai seemed to merge with the brown,
craggy hills of this part of eastern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope addressed an enthusiastic crowd in English in the monastery's
Garden of Olives. The faithful waved handkerchiefs emblazoned with John Paul's
portrait and chanted: ``John Paul II, we love you! John Paul II, we love you!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Paul II, he also loves you,'' the pope responded, drawing cheers and
laughs.
</P>
<P>
	   Paths worn clean by millions of pilgrims lead from the fortified walls of
the monastery toward the heights of Mount Sinai. John Paul would go no farther
than the monastery. At 79, he is too old and ailing to attempt even a small
segment of the trek.
</P>
<P>
	   But even the pope's brief stop at this Greek Orthodox outpost is seen as a
sign of his unyielding determination to see places so far absent from his
globe-trotting itinerary: some of the most important sites in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope's arrival brought extraordinary activity to the usually tranquil
mountain perch, surrounded by sawtooth ranges reaching above 6,600 feet and
yellow-ochre outcrops sculpted smooth and round by the wind.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the prayer ceremony in the monastery's Garden of Olives, he toured
the complex and viewing some of its historic religious documents and other
treasures.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope flew back to Cairo later in the day and from there headed back to
Rome after being seen off by President Hosni Mubarak and religious leaders from
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope had hoped to bring together Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders at
the site, but the plan didn't materialize. Vatican officials haven't said why.
However, Bishop Makarios, an Egyptian Catholic, said the pope is first seeking
``to prepare the minds'' -- implying that the climate wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech at the monastery, the pope repeated an invitation for dialogue
``between the followers of the great monotheistic religions.'' His address and
tour of the monastery televised live across Egypt, as were other major events of
his three-day pilgrimage, which was on its last day today.
</P>
<P>
	   The monastery, about 200 miles southeast of Cairo, was the first major stop
in the pope's planned millennium travels to biblical sites. Next month, he is
scheduled to visit Jerusalem, Bethlehem and other places in Israel and the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
	   A collection of huts and gardens first formed the monastic community in a
protected valley, which monks believed was the site of the burning bush through
which the Bible says God spoke to Moses and commanded him to lead the Israelites
to the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
	   Byzantine Emperor Justinian ordered the monastery's 10-foot-thick walls
built in 527 to protect against raiders. A thorny evergreen, considered by the
monks to be the remnants of the burning bush, lies behind the apse of the
monastery's church.
</P>
<P>
	   The monastery also holds an important collection of ancient manuscripts,
14th- and 15th-century icons and relics believed to be those of St. Catherine of
Alexandria, who converted to Christianity in the 4th century and was beheaded
for directly accusing the Roman emperor of idolatry for worship of their gods.
</P>
<P>
	   During his tour, the pope prayed silently for about 10 minutes before the
evergreen. He also performed a traditional ceremony before the skeleton of St.
Catherine, placing his own ring on her finger bone, touching it to her skull,
kissing it and then replacing it on his hand.
</P>
<P>
	   But the most powerful element of the monastery is its location and
connection with one of the most pivotal passages of the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Bible, the Commandments set down direct heavenly guidance
for the Israelites, but also vividly displayed God's wrath. A plague was sent to
wipe out all of Moses' followers who did not renounce their worship of the
golden calf, an idol crafted from the jewelry of those who grew impatient during
Moses' 40-day solitude on Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
	   The images of breaking free from slavery -- the overarching theme of the
chapters of Exodus -- were used also by the pope at a Mass in Cairo on Friday to
urge for different faiths to ``put aside our different forms of slavery'' that
promote intolerance and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Catherine's visit could help ease friction with Greek Orthodox
leaders, who have generally opposed efforts by other Orthodox churches to close
the nearly 1,000-year rift with the Vatican.

<HEADLINE> 'Town for Motor Age' thrives, but rarely emulated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   FAIR LAWN, N.J. (AP) - Back then, they called it the town for the motor
age.
<P>
	   Developers of Radburn, one of the nation's first and most ambitious planned
communities, boasted in 1928 that they would build a place where people could,
for the first time, live happily and safely with both their families and their
cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy years later, the cars are the last thing to make an impression in
this neighborhood of cul-de-sacs, pedestrian walkways, green playgrounds and
connecting lawns.
</P>
<P>
	   Modest, one-car garages are tucked away like afterthoughts on narrow
streets, and walkers seem as common as motorists among the hundreds of homes
built over spinach farms and pasture.
</P>
<P>
	   Radburn is a historic landmark today, a regular spot on urban planning tours
and a thriving community with few vacancies, yet its legacy remains uncertain.
It has yielded few complete imitations, which some say reflects the struggle
between community and privacy in America's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an innovative concept, but it only works communitywide," says
Louise Orlando, a resident and manager of the corporation that runs Radburn. "If
people want cathedral ceilings and a large parcel of land, then you can't build
a Radburn."
</P>
<P>
	   Radburn's homes, which include about 500 houses, 50 townhouses and a 93-unit
apartment complex, are clustered close together on tiny lots. Cars are parked on
dead-end, narrow streets outside back doors, called service entrances. Most car
traffic travels around Radburn's perimeter, and gets to the service lanes on a
few secondary roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Front yards connect to neighbors on three sides. And a few steps from
everyone's door, pedestrian pathways lead to 150 acres of parkland, tennis
courts, two swimming pools, ballfields, playgrounds and a community center. A
small square of businesses is also within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
	   The community within the Bergen County city of Fair Lawn was initially
planned to be 10 times the size by architects Clarence Stein, Henry Wright and
builder Alexander Bing, but the development company went bankrupt during the
Depression and the last homes were built in 1936.
</P>
<P>
	   They envisioned a town within a town of 25,000 people who would make eye
contact with each other daily in the park, playground or community center,
focusing on shared spaces.
</P>
<P>
	   That vision survives today, residents say, although residents still maintain
some privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like commune living," said Lois Friedman, who lived here for 32
years. "It's community living."
</P>
<P>
	   Friedman, who is leaving Radburn to be closer to her grandchildren in
Florida, said she will miss knowing everyone's names and the feeling of safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "We still don't lock our doors," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Louise Orlando moved to Radburn in 1973 when she was pregnant with a third
child and spending most of her time shuttling her two children back and forth to
school. An elementary school sits in the center of Radburn.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was looking for a house near a school where my children could get there
safely," she said. She never realized, she said, that "there could be such
wondrous safety."
</P>
<P>
	   Radburn has a 30-foot pedestrian tunnel that links two of its three parks,
and allows children to walk to school in minutes without crossing traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   "Raymond and Amy didn't cross the street until they were about 8," Orlando
said of her two older children.
</P>
<P>
	   She can point to every house and name the occupant and, in some cases, who
lived there last. These homes, which range in price to in the low $100,000 range
to $350,000, don't stay vacant long.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you put a Radburn house on the market and it is fairly priced," Orlando
said, "that house will sell in 48 hours."
</P>
<P>
	   Some homeowners, like Ellen Alavi, grow up in Radburn and returned to raise
families. Alavi and her husband looked at homes in central and southern New
Jersey for themselves and their 6-month-old daughter, and found Radburn's homes
a little small. But there are a number of larger things she says she can't live
without.
</P>
<P>
	   "The kids with other kids. The school," said Alavi, hugging her daughter on
a stoop near the pool. "Knowing the families, and everyone helping each other
out."
</P>
<P>
	   Radburn has its costs. For one, the dues residents must pay to maintain the
common property, up to 50 percent of the borough's property tax rate. And
residents complain about a lack of parking and the need for bigger garages.
</P>
<P>
	   James Hughes, dean of the urban planning and public policy school at Rutgers
University, says parts of Radburn have been duplicated many times over.
Radburn's dead-end streets with homes at the end were the first cul-de-sacs, and
the concept of linking common open space that weaves through a housing
development is an integral part of townhouse or condominium complexes today,
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Radburn also became a jumping-off point for planned communities like Reston,
Va., Columbia, Md., and Disney's Celebration, near Orlando, Fla. But it was
never completely recreated, in part because such a community would be too
large-scale for the diverse tastes of suburban residents, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people want to live in a Westfield or Princeton where they can walk
downtown," Hughes said. "Other people, having a three-car garage is more
important to them on a big lot."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Rockland, an American Studies professor at Rutgers who has studied
the concept of community, says America needs more Radburns.
</P>
<P>
	   "Americans have always had a problem building community," Rockland said.
They want to live on their own land in a privacy that can be isolating, turning
to the Internet rather than a next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   "People have a tremendous craving to belong and to be part of a viable
community," he said. "We need it more than we ever did."

<HEADLINE> Mexico Campus Protests Turn Radical  </HEADLINE>
   By AMPARO TREJO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEPATEPEC, Mexico (AP) -- Students at a rural teachers college tie up 65
riot policemen, strip them to their pants and parade them through town. Students
at Mexico City's largest university seize the campus and hold it for nearly 10
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Is Mexico on the cusp of a new student rebellion, a radical movement of the
sort that broke out across the globe in the late 1960s? The government says no.
The radical students and some experts say maybe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real base for the protests and for the expansion of the
movement,'' said Hugo Aboites, an education expert at the Autonomous
Metropolitan University, one of Mexico's top public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   In colleges and universities across Mexico, students are striking, marching
and taking over campuses to demand more money for public education.
</P>
<P>
	   Their demands have expanded to include greater democracy in Mexico, an end
to the brutality and impunity of security forces that for decades have gone
largely unchallenged, and even changes in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The movement's biggest conflict, appropriately, has been at Latin America's
biggest university, the National Autonomous University in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   Radical students, initially striking over a tuition increase, quickly
expanded their demands and took over the campus, holding it for nearly 10 months
before police moved in to arrest the strikers early this month.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, students in a rural teachers college known as ``The
Spider'' in the Otomi Indian language, occupied their campus in the town of
Tepatepec, 100 miles north of Mexico City, to protest diminishing state aid and
what they call misallocated money.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 19, state police took back the campus, beating students and nearby
residents. Outraged students and townspeople seized it again later in the day
and took 65 officers hostage, stripping them to their pants -- in some cases to
underpants -- tying them up and putting them on display in the town's central
square.
</P>
<P>
	   After a few hours, they freed the officers in exchange for the release of
most of the arrested students.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say there is evidence the events are not isolated, that students in
public higher education across the country are joining forces in an independent
movement as radical as it is unbeholden to any established political force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are united by the repression and by our defense of free public
education,'' said Victor Soto Lugo, a graduate of ``The Spider'' who returned to
his alma mater to support the protests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican government denies there is a movement afoot and insists schools
aren't being shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   President Ernesto Zedillo said Wednesday that education spending has
increased by 24 percent during his five years in office and that there is no
crisis in the higher education system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To those people who say that public universities are in a critical stage
... you have to remind them that there is not one, but 240 universities in our
country,'' Zedillo said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
	   But Aboites, an independent researcher, said that higher education spending
has been declining steadily -- 8 percent this year alone -- and that is fueling
protests across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week alone, students occupied colleges and universities in five states,
universities were on strike in five other states, and students demonstrated in
at least 15 states to protest brutality in Mexico City and at ``the Spider.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the heart of the radical movement is Mexico City's National Autonomous
University and the 16 rural teachers colleges spread across the country. It is
held together by an independent network of teachers who have a presence in
almost all public colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   The radical students shun all political parties -- none of which have tried
to embrace them, for that matter. The strike in Mexico City made almost all
established political groups nervous.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling party drew strong criticism because the strike went on so long.
The leftist opposition initially supported the campus seizure but was rebuffed
by the students, and was humiliated by its inability to stop the students'
traffic-clogging marches in Mexico City, which it governs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``History is repeating itself'' from the 1960s, Aboites said. ``These groups
have strictly educational support bases that have nothing to do with political
parties or political groups.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some experts warn that the student movement could become a training ground
for new members of rebel groups operating in southern and western Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These situations can lead, in the worst-case scenario, to students joining
the ranks of the guerrilla,'' said Laura Bolanos, who had close contact with
rebel groups when she was president of the Mexican League for the Defense of
Human Rights.

building projects.
<P>
	   That's the conclusion of the newest school construction survey commissioned
by the New Jersey School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the survey, which reported results of 1999 school referenda,
more renovation or repair projects passed voter muster than projects planned
from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 70 percent of questions related to school additions or expansions
passed in 1999, and 67 percent of those calling for renovation or repairs
passed. But only 56 percent of those that proposed brand new buildings won a
majority of voters, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters are seeing more and more renovation and addition questions, according
to association officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Association spokesman Frank Belluscio said that is especially true in the
more populated northern reaches of the state. There, vacant land is more
valuable and scarce, and it is easier and cheaper to renovate or add than build
anew, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Schools are first considering doing additions, renovations or repairs
before they really look at new school building. If they can accomplish their
goal without going through the added expense, they will," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But such a trend may result in a pent-up demand for new school buildings to
replace antiquated ones in the cities or provide for booming enrollments in the
suburbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of 1999's $1.15 billion in proposed school construction comprised
additions, renovations and repairs. Such projects include roof replacement,
heating, plumbing and electrical repairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 19 percent of the referenda, however, sought approval for a new school
building, the association reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Association President Charles V. Reilly said such data is relevant in the
current debate over state aid for school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman has proposed a plan to provide up to $10 billion in
funds for new buildings and renovations, but lawmakers are not yet in agreement
over the details.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is important information for Gov. Whitman and the Legislature to
consider," Reilly said, noting renovations are often costlier on a per square
foot basis than new construction.
</P>
<P>
	   "To be effective, that plan has to make allowances for the higher cost of
renovations and repairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks in part to the robust economy, the overall approval rate also
increased in 1999 compared to previous years, according to the survey. The
approval rate last year was nearly 70 percent, compared to 60 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "However, it is still not easy for school districts to gain approval,"
Reilly said, noting the lower passage rate for new construction.
</P>
<P>
	   More than one-third of the referenda on the ballot in 1999 represented the
second, third or fourth attempt of a school district to gain voter approval.
Many schools found it necessary to downsize a project after their initial
failure to attract enough voter support, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
	   In all 84 school construction projects appeared on the ballot in New Jersey
in 1999, nine more than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> GOP Battle Moves to National Stage  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now things get serious.
</P>
<P>
	   The topsy-turvy Republican presidential race, fought thus far on tiny or
quirky battlegrounds, moves to the national stage with two weeks of voting in 25
states.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush hopes to hobble Sen. John McCain's campaign on the
March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' and put him away March 14, when six Bush-friendly
Southern states conduct GOP elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator hopes to clean up March 7, survive March 14 and drag the
nomination fight deep into the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Both hope to get a running start Tuesday, when Republicans make their
choices in three states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Conventional wisdom is that Bush is still in the strongest position for
the long haul,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire GOP. ``But we
all know how shaky conventional wisdom is this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign already has passed through the first-test states of Iowa, New
Hampshire and Delaware. Ultraconservative South Carolina went to Bush. And
Michigan voted McCain, although the primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain holds a slight lead over Bush in the hunt for the 1,034 delegates
needed to win the nomination. Bush holds a narrowing lead in the money chase.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going national,'' Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
	   And so are the candidates, starting with voting Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
	   NORTH DAKOTA. Bush has a clear advantage in state caucuses. McCain has not
campaigned for the state's 19 delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA. Bush leads McCain by 11 points in a recent poll. Bush's local
supporters, however, are complaining that his national brain trust is
micromanaging the campaign. Worried that Democrats and independents can upset
Bush in the open primary, his team is contacting people who voted in 1996 for
moderate Republican Sen. John Warner, who is popular in independent-minded
northern Virginia. Gov. James Gilmore, a Bush backer, has a rock-solid political
operation that will be put to the test. After Gov. John Engler's vaunted
``firewall'' collapsed in Michigan, Bush can't afford to be scorched by McCain
in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON STATE. Both campaigns say polls show them in a tight race. McCain
hopes to avail of Washington voters' independent streak. The Arizonan has a
strong organization, but Bush's is deeper.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Bush has been on the air longer, McCain is spending almost as much as
Bush on TV ads in the run-up to Virginia and Washington, a reflection of how the
Texan's financial advantage has been virtually erased. After spending a
record-shattering $50 million, Bush now has less than $13 million in the bank.
McCain, once at a 5-to-1 disadvantage to Bush, has nearly as much money.
</P>
<P>
	   That will come in handy on March 7, when 13 states hold GOP contests:
</P>
<P>
	   CALIFORNIA. The Big Kahuna, California awards 162 delegates to the winner.
Half of McCain's ``Super Tuesday'' schedule and at least $2 million of his TV
budget are dedicated here. Bush has spent less, but plans to increase his buy.
</P>
<P>
	   News coverage may be more important than pricey advertising time, and McCain
generated a lot of attention with his Michigan victory. Working to Bush's
advantage is a closed primary, meaning only the votes of registered Republicans
will count. McCain, who won New Hampshire and Michigan with non-GOP votes, is
trying to broaden his appeal by talking about his conservative credentials. Both
candidates are airing ads comparing themselves to native son Ronald Reagan. As
elsewhere, Bush has the endorsements of the political elite, but McCain has
narrowed the governor's wide lead in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic consultant Bill Carrick of Los Angeles predicted that McCain will
get more votes than Bush but will lose the delegates when non-Republicans are
sifted out. ``Bush could lose California and win the delegates,'' Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK. The state's Byzantine election laws favor Bush and his
establishment backers, but polls show the race is not out of McCain's reach. The
Arizonan won a highly publicized ballot-access fight. Delegates are awarded to
the winner of each of the state's 31 congressional districts, thus neither
campaign is likely to leave empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be surprised if either candidate goes 31-zip,'' said New York GOP
consultant Kieran Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW ENGLAND. McCain's victory in New Hampshire gives him the edge in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Bush's team expects only Maine and
Vermont to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   GEORGIA. Bush proved in South Carolina he is popular among southern
conservatives. McCain is targeting four suburban Atlanta congressional districts
to cherry-pick delegates but won't bother elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   MARYLAND. McCain just spent $220,000 to air ads in the TV market that
straddles Virginia and Maryland. The latest poll gives Bush a wide lead, but
McCain still may make a run at the Texan with a quick visit to the state.
</P>
<P>
	   MISSOURI. Bush may be too strong. McCain tentatively plans to stay out of
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   OHIO. A critical state because all its delegates go to the winner. Bush has
another governor in his camp, Bob Taft, and polls suggest a large lead for the
Texan. It's harder than in Michigan for voters to cross over, and the state
doesn't have a history of party-switching that could help McCain. McCain will
match Bush's homestretch advertising budget and plans to make two trips to the
state. ``Bush has the edge,'' said John C. Green, political scientist at the
University of Akron. ``Of course, Bush had the edge heading into Michigan. So I
can easily see McCain winning, but he's got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   MINNESOTA. A nonbinding straw poll is drawing little attention.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON STATE. After campaigning with an eye toward Tuesday's primary
here, McCain and Bush hope to pick up an additional 25 delegates awarded in
March 7 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain believes he needs to sweep the New England states, earn a majority of
the New York delegates and win all California's delegates to offset Bush's
advantage March 14. Six states hold GOP primaries on that date, including Texas
and the home state of his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandwiched between the two big Tuesday primaries are March 10 contests in
Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Territories To Hold GOP Votes  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   More than two dozen delegates to the Republican national convention this
summer will be chosen in four presidential contests being held this weekend in
U.S. territories.
</P>
<P>
	   Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands each will have four delegates at
stake during separate caucuses Saturday. Republicans from Puerto Rico will
commit 14 delegates on Sunday at their winner-take-all primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was expected to win all the delegates from this
weekend's contests, despite growing support for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
particularly in Puerto Rico. Bush had 67 delegates heading into the weekend
races, compared to the 96 earned by McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   A candidate needs 1,034 delegates to win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While residents of the U.S. territories may participate in primaries and
caucuses, they are not allowed to vote in the presidential general election.

<HEADLINE> GOP Studies Rules of Split Results  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Republican Party officials are poring over their rule
books as the political world ponders a once-unthinkable scenario: What happens
if John McCain wins the popular vote in California, but George W. Bush captures
more GOP votes and is declared the victor?
</P>
<P>
	   Such conflicting outcomes are possible in the California primary March 7.
Elections officials will report dual results: Voters who stick with their party
as well as all voters, including ``crossover'' Democrats who vote for
Republicans, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
	   In keeping with its rules, the Republican Party will ignore the latter count
of all voters. It will award delegates to its nominating convention based on
which candidate wins the most Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Non-Republicans helped carry McCain to victories in New Hampshire and
Michigan, while core GOP voters have gravitated to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   If that trend repeats itself in California, where polls show McCain surging,
Bush could take all the state's delegates with a win among GOP voters, while
losing the total vote. California's 162 delegates are the largest prize in the
nominating season.
</P>
<P>
	   So when the Republican National Committee convened a conference call for
reporters Friday to discuss its rules, one topic dominated: Could the party
ignore its own rules and hand the delegates to McCain if he won the popular
election, but lost among Republicans?
</P>
<P>
	   Highly unlikely, RNC officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain could file a challenge to the election results, said a top RNC
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's contest committee would consider evidence in the challenge,
vote, and then send its findings to the full RNC, which would rule when it meets
the week before the convention.
</P>
<P>
	   If McCain lost the challenge, he could appeal to another panel -- the
credentials committee. That appeal could wind up before the full convention in
Philadelphia this July.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McCain and Bush have both signed affidavits pledging not to
challenge the primary's results, said Jon Fleischman, executive director of the
California GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   There will be 2,066 delegates at the convention. If a majority approves,
they could vote to toss the 162 delegates pledged to Bush, and replace them with
McCain delegates, RNC officials say.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Probing Toy Monkey Complaints  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- After hearing dozens of complaints, the Massachusetts
Commission Against Discrimination has opened an investigation into whether a
tavern's display of toy monkeys was meant to mock Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Licensing Board received 41 formal complaints about the bar's
display on Friday alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The owner of Tom English's Cottage, Tom English Jr., denied that the
monkeys, hanging from vines, were set up as a racist joke. He said the display
was no different than the clowns, fish and cartoon characters he puts up during
the year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My only intent was to make my bar a better place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But a bartender told the Boston Herald that the display was for Black
History Month, and that it included a toy gorilla wearing a crown for Martin
Luther King. The Herald did not identify the bartender in stories published
Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation was announced Friday by Charles Walker Jr., chairman of
the Commission Against Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This kind of conduct is deeply offensive to all decent Americans, as well
as being illegal, and if our investigation confirms these allegations, we will
take appropriate action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Licensing Board, which licenses bars and restaurants, is expected
to vote Thursday to hold a public hearing to determine if any action should be
taken against the bar, said spokeswoman Kathleen McNally.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement apologizing for any ``misconception'' was hung in the bar Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please accept my apology for any insult allegedly made by one of my
bartenders,'' English said. ``There was no intent for this at all.''

<HEADLINE> Group Claims Abuses in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOZDOK, Russia (AP) -- A human rights group said Saturday it had medical
evidence that Russian troops had tortured Chechen civilians, the latest charge
to taint Russia amid a new wave of international criticism of the Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials denied the accusations. Moscow was still smarting from
television footage aired Friday that suggested Russian soldiers had committed
atrocities against Chechens.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary findings from a random survey of refugees by Physicians for
Human Rights revealed Chechen civilians had systematically faced summary
executions, illegal detention or torture, the group said in a report released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston-based volunteer group interviewed 326 Chechens at refugee camps
in Ingushetia, a Russian republic on Chechnya's western border. Nearly half said
they had seen civilians killed by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia's federal forces are brutally and arbitrarily detaining
civilians,'' said Doug Ford, who coordinated the survey. The group has done
similar monitoring work in other war zones.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the group had medical evidence that nine people were tortured at a
so-called filtration camp in Chernokozovo. The camp was set up by Russia to
filter out rebels trying to escape from Chechnya disguised as civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Two detainees who were released from the camp and examined by the group's
doctors recounted severe beatings and torture by electric shock, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
	   One detainee, identified only as Ruslan, told the group he was beaten
unconscious four times in one week. Another was examined and found to have
suffered a broken nose, bruised ribs and pain on the soles of his feet -- all
symptoms ``consistent with blunt trauma,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian Justice Ministry on Saturday denied that atrocities had taken
place at Chernokozovo, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Questioning the anonymous sources quoted in many reports on alleged abuses,
the ministry said that interviews with a ``Ruslan or a Naur or a disgruntled
soldier'' have unfairly put the international spotlight on Chernokozovo.
``Ruslan'' and ``Naur'' are common first names in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Abuyazit Sangeriyev, the deputy prosecutor in Chechnya's provisional,
pro-Moscow government, said Saturday he also had heard prisoners at Russian
camps describe beatings and rapes, but said he had no solid evidence of abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're afraid to write an official statement saying so because they fear
something will happen with them,'' he said in Mozdok, just northwest of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone held at a camp will come out and say he saw how fellow prisoners
were beaten. Then after more questions he changes his story, and says he only
heard that other people were mistreated, but never saw it himself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sangeriyev has been visiting filtration camps around Chechnya -- he says
there are at least six. He said he has released 160 prisoners in the last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a videotape aired Friday prompted new demands from President
Clinton and other world leaders that Russia investigate allegations of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel said Saturday that world powers should unite in
a ``firm and loud'' reaction to the Russian offensive in Chechnya, saying the
military campaign could now, without hesitation, be labeled as ``killing off a
nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The grisly television footage, provided by the German station N-24, showed a
pile of male bodies in a pit, their legs bound in wire. At least one of the
bodies was shown to have an ear cut off.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the footage showed no direct evidence of atrocities or how the men
died. Russia claimed the film was propaganda. The Russian newspaper Izvestia
said Saturday that the video was by its correspondents in Chechnya and given to
the German television station.
</P>
<P>
	   What the German television company presented as atrocities by the Russian
army developments were nothing of the sort, Izvestia said in a front-page
article. ``Soldiers were burying the dead bodies of gunmen, whom local residents
could not identify,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chechnya, rebels penned in the southern mountains ambushed Russian troops
in an attempt to break out of their last major stronghold, the town of Shatoi,
but the military claimed Saturday to have pushed the militants back.

to cherry-pick delegates but won't bother elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   MARYLAND. McCain just spent $220,000 to air ads in the TV market that
straddles Virginia and Maryland. The latest poll gives Bush a wide lead, but
McCain still may make a run at the Texan with a quick visit to the state.
</P>
<P>
	   MISSOURI. Bush may be too strong. McCain tentatively plans to stay out of
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   OHIO. A critical state because all its delegates go to the winner. Bush has
another governor in his camp, Bob Taft, and polls suggest a large lead for the
Texan. It's harder than in Michigan for voters to cross over, and the state
doesn't have a history of party-switching that could help McCain. McCain will
match Bush's homestretch advertising budget and plans to make two trips to the
state. ``Bush has the edge,'' said John C. Green, political scientist at the
University of Akron. ``Of course, Bush had the edge heading into Michigan. So I
can easily see McCain winning, but he's got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   MINNESOTA. A nonbinding straw poll is drawing little attention.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON STATE. After campaigning with an eye toward Tuesday's primary
here, McCain and Bush hope to pick up an additional 25 delegates awarded in
March 7 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain believes he needs to sweep the New England states, earn a majority of
the New York delegates and win all California's delegates to offset Bush's
advantage March 14. Six states hold GOP primaries on that date, including Texas
and the home state of his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandwiched between the two big Tuesday primaries are March 10 contests in
Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.

	   The Pentagon wants Russian help in searching records of forced labor camps
from the Arctic Ocean to central Siberia and the Soviet Far East. Among camps
cited by a Russian emigre as having detained World War II or Korean War GIs:
</P>
<P>
	   --Peveka, near Strelka along the Angara River in the Krasnoyarsk region of
Siberia. Four unidentified Americans were said to have been held at Peveka,

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Rally Around Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rallying around one of their own, Republican governors
say they remain confident in their colleague from Texas, even as they brim with
free advice for George W. Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In town for their winter meeting, GOP governors gave Bush early and powerful
backing -- even before he declared he was running. That support helped rally the
Republican establishment around the Texas governor as the party's best chance
for taking back the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, in the face of Sen. John McCain's unexpectedly strong challenge,
governors show no sign of bolting. They say Bush has made mistakes but argue he
has time to correct them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're a pretty solid bunch. Once they're on board, they're on for the
long haul,'' said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, where Bush lost a hard-fought
race with McCain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush obviously will have to right himself, and he will,'' Gov. Mike
Leavitt, R-Utah, chairman of the National Governors' Association, said Saturday.
``It yet will turn out the way we want it to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Governors of both parties are meeting this weekend with an agenda filled
with policy issues. But politics tops the unwritten agenda, particularly for
Republicans, who are watching Bush try to regain his footing as McCain shreds
the assumption that Bush's nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors' advice ranged from staying focused to allowing them to carry
more of the campaign's message.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Set the rules, but let us do it our way at home,'' said Gov. Ed Schafer of
North Dakota, chairman of the Republican Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota's primary is Tuesday, but Schafer can't figure out why he
hasn't been more involved in the Bush campaign. ``How come I'm not doing a radio
spot encouraging people to go out and vote, and using my image or my trust or
whatever I have with the voters to spread the Bush message?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Schafer plans to deliver a cautionary message to his colleagues. Too many
governors assumed that it was enough to turn over lists of party activists and
volunteers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's entire operation has been second-guessed since he lost primaries in
Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday. Supporters questioned, among other things,
spending $1 million on ads in Arizona, McCain's home turf. And Connecticut Gov.
John Rowland bluntly said that it was stupid to visit Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, which lost its tax exempt status for failing to admit blacks and
whose namesake once labeled the Catholic Church a ``satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like other GOP governors, New Jersey's Christine Todd Whitman is confident
Bush will win the GOP nomination. But she worries that the visit to Bob Jones
University and other efforts to appeal to the most conservative voters will come
back to bite Bush in the general election, when candidates will be fighting for
voters in the political center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to put together a coalition that can win in
the fall,'' Whitman said. ``It can be dangerous if you start to marginalize
yourself in any way.'' Asked if Bush has done just that, she said: ``I don't
think that's happened in any kind of irretrievable way.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, governors say, these controversies, along with constant
bickering over which candidate is most guilty of negative campaigning, have
distracted Bush from his core messages on taxes, education and opportunity for
all.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush lost Michigan, Schafer said, ``because we were fighting about who said
what first and who hit who first in the sandbox.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign may be getting the message, Engler said. He applauded the move
late this week to have Virginia's Gov. Jim Gilmore talk about the McCain camp's
phone calls to voters suggesting that Bush is anti-Catholic, freeing Bush to
talk about his core issues. Still, Bush talked more about those calls on Friday,
again denouncing McCain for them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our message to him,'' Leavitt said, ``is to stay focused on his message of
reform and not to get caught up in the sidebar stories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then again, he remembered in 1996 when Republican nominee Bob Dole met with
the 17 Republican governors, each of whom took a turn at offering advice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By the time you got around to all 17, there' s just no way he could have
even remembered all the advice, let alone accepted it,'' Leavitt said. ``We're
probably compulsive advice givers. We can't stop ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Cops Break Up Burundi Protest March  </HEADLINE>
   By HRVOJE HRANJSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Anti-riot police and soldiers wielding guns and
clubs forcibly dispersed a thousand, mainly Tutsi, demonstrators Saturday,
breaking up a defiant protest against the government's peace talks with Hutu
rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Waving placards calling Hutu political and rebel leaders ``perpetrators of
genocide'' against minority Tutsis, the protesters had gathered outside
Bujumbura's central market.
</P>
<P>
	   As policemen pummeled the demonstrators, about a dozen were whisked away in
police cars. Shop owners closed their doors and onlookers fled to their houses.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest was the clearest sign yet of the nervousness among many
middle-class Tutsis, the cornerstone of President Pierre Buyoya's political
support, about sharing power with the Hutu majority. Power-sharing proposals are
under discussion in Arusha, Tanzania, in talks led by former South African
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People want those responsible for genocide tried in a court of law, not
having to negotiate peace with them,'' said Bonaventure Gasutwa, one of the
anti-Buyoya organizers of the demonstration, which the government had banned.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army has killed at
least 200,000 people, most Hutu civilians, since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected president, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, Mandela urged 18 Burundian political parties, civic and
government groups meeting in Arusha to quickly reach agreement on a timetable
for elections, the integration of rebels into the national army and an amnesty
for those responsible for the worst atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   The two main rebel groups, blamed for much of the recent attacks around the
capital, Bujumbura, stayed away from the talks. Mandela is expected to meet in
South Africa in the near future with representatives of the two forces,
according to his aides.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters said they wanted those responsible for attacking both Hutu
and Tutsi civilians tried for genocide. Negotiations should only occur, they
said, with those who have not carried out violence, most of which is blamed on
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Public support for Buyoya is crucial for the success of negotiations, which
have yet to produce a cease-fire, considered the first step in ending the
violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters on Saturday said the president was selling them out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Buyoya is not representing Burundi. He is representing himself and he
wants to keep power,'' Gasutwa said. ``Until the impunity of genocide in Burundi
is addressed, there cannot be peace.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Focuses on Washington State  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA COOK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley pressed on with his efforts
to woo Washington state's independent-minded voters, saying he's a more genuine
reformer than Republican candidate John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In highlighting differences between McCain's record and his own Friday,
Bradley tried a relatively new strategy to separate himself from the Republican
senator heading toward Washington's presidential primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain is a reformer and I'm a reformer,'' Bradley said. ``We both want
campaign finance reform. There's no question about it. But when it comes to the
environment, there's a vast difference between John McCain and me.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Spokane early today, Bradley didn't mention his opponents. Instead, he
urged 400 supporters at the ornate, historic Davenport Hotel to vote for him at
Tuesday's nonbinding state primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tuesday is the time for the state of Washington to step forward and send a
message to the rest of the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will be the launching pad and you can be the rockets that lift this
campaign and make it take off.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley on Friday addressed about 1,000 people packed into stairwells and
standing on chairs at the Alaska ferry terminal here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Washington state will give me the boost to go on to March 7th (the Super
Tuesday primaries), and then win this nomination,'' the former New Jersey
senator said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet even those in the crowd who plan to vote for Bradley wouldn't bet on his
odds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a longshot,'' said Karl Thomas, 39, of Bellingham. Thomas, who
usually votes Republican, said he plans to vote for Bradley. ``He seems to be
more independent-minded and has more integrity. ... (while McCain is) a little
too intense.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley entered the terminal, loudspeakers blasted the Rolling Stones
song ``Between a Rock and a Hard Place.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the rock may be Al Gore, and the hard place McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley criticized McCain for calling a West Coast salmon-recovery effort
``pork barrel'' spending, and said he had an 84 percent vote rating from the
League of Conservation Voters, compared with McCain's 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't spare Gore, either, saying the vice president ``never saw a dam he
didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was endorsed by local environmental leaders as a champion of Pacific
Northwest concerns such as pipeline safety, salmon restoration and prevention of
oil tanker spills.
</P>
<P>
	   It remained to be seen whether Bradley's decision to shoot for a symbolic
victory in Washington's nonbinding Tuesday primary and ignore the delegate-rich
states with March 7 primaries would pay off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' said California-based Democratic consultant
Bill Carrick. ``He should be spending all his time here or New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   After a campaign swing in eastern Washington today, including the Spokane
rally, Bradley was returning to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley made pitstops in Seattle, Everett, Mount Vernon and
Bellingham, Gore took off for a week of hopscotching states with big primary
jackpots, picking up liberal endorsements on his way.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's smooth sail, buoyed by a growing lead in polls, was delayed slightly
Friday when the plane chartered for his campaign press entourage was grounded at
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., because of hydraulic failure.
</P>
<P>
	   The mix of campaign and government showed up again when reporters were
handed ``Gore 2000'' press releases bearing the stamp of the official fax
machine in Gore's White House communications office.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spokesman Chris Lahane later called it ``an inadvertent mistake by
a junior staffer.''
</P>
<P>
	   One release trumpeted his endorsement by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del. Another
promoted Gore's campaign stop Friday at Cleveland's Eliza Bryant Center, the
first senior citizens housing center in Cleveland to accept black residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's endorsements by Biden and by Jerry Brown, the Oakland, Calif., mayor
and three-time failed presidential candidate, were expected to help dampen some
of Bradley's most barbed criticisms of Gore -- that he's a closet conservative
who pays lip service to campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   In the next week, besides Washington state Gore plans to visit Colorado,
Arizona, Georgia, New York and Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> Pope Urges Tolerance at Mount Sinai  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN MURPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. CATHERINE, Egypt (AP) -- Realizing a personal dream of making a biblical
pilgrimage, Pope John Paul II prayed Saturday for religious tolerance in a
simple tree-shaded garden under the peak revered as the place where Moses
received the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit to Mount Sinai was the highlight of his trip to Egypt and the
first major stop of his planned millennium travels to biblical sites. It drew
strongly on the ancient religious legacy of the land. It also pointed out the
contemporary obstacles to the pope's appeal for unity among Christians and with
other faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   Doing as millions of pilgrims before him, the pope entered the
1,500-year-old Monastery of St. Catherine and prayed for 10 minutes before the
thorny evergreen that the monks revere as the remnants of the burning bush that
the Bible says was used by God to summon Moses and ask him to lead the
Israelites to the Promised Land. The pope softly spoke the words God told Moses:
``I am who I am.''
</P>
<P>
	   The pontiff also performed a traditional rite before the remains of St.
Catherine of Alexandria, who converted to Christianity in the 4th century and
was beheaded for directly accusing the Roman emperor of idolatry. The pope
removed his ring and placed it over the finger bones and upon the skull before
returning it to his own finger.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope, at the end of a three-day trip to Egypt, said he had finally
joined the other pilgrims who have walked ``in the footsteps of God.'' Next
month, the pontiff is scheduled to visit Jerusalem, Bethlehem and other places
in Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
	   He flew back to Cairo later Saturday and from there headed back to Rome
after being seen off by President Hosni Mubarak and religious leaders from Egypt
and elsewhere in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   The ailing, 79-year-old pope appeared to draw strength from the stark
surroundings of sawtooth summits reaching above 6,600 feet and yellow-ochre
outcrops sculpted smooth and round by the wind about 200 miles southeast of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   His spirits were high, even playful. Examining a gold bejeweled crown that
was among the monastery's treasures, he said: ``You needed a hard head to wear
that.''
</P>
<P>
	   His voice grew strong and clear as he spoke to about 1,500 people about the
need for understanding and dialogue ``between the followers of the great
monotheistic religions'' -- Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I pray that in the new millennium the Monastery of St. Catherine will be a
radiant beacon calling the churches to know one another better and to rediscover
the importance in the eyes of God of the things that unite us in Christ,'' the
pope told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   But the head of the Greek Orthodox monastery, Archbishop Damianos, declined
to pray alongside the pope because of ecclesiastical differences dating from the
split of the Vatican and Orthodox churches nearly 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Damianos also insisted Roman Catholics must make the greater concessions --
a significantly different message than the strong calls for brotherhood from
Muslim and Coptic Christian leaders during earlier meetings in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   The Roman Catholic pope once exercised authority over all Christendom, and
still claims to do so. At an ecumenical prayer service in Cairo Friday, the pope
repeated an offer to discuss the Roman Catholic primacy, but did not elaborate
on what powers he would be willing to relinquish.
</P>
<P>
	   The Orthodox reception was nonetheless gracious and stood in contrast to
snubs of the pope by some Orthodox groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope also had hoped to bring Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders
together at Mount Sinai, but the plan didn't materialize and Vatican officials
haven't given an explanation. Bishop Makarios, an Egyptian Catholic, said the
pope is first seeking ``to prepare the minds'' -- implying that the climate
wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those gathered outside the monastery were many refugees from religious
tension in neighboring Sudan. Christian and animist rebels in southern Sudan
have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy from the Arab, Muslim-dominated
government in the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good the pope speaks about religious tolerance, but as you can see
I'm far from my home because some people do not listen to this message,'' said
Natale Ali, 37, who fled the southern Sudanese town of Wau in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Racial Violence Is Common in Prison  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) -- When a group of inmates stepped out of their
concrete cellblocks and into the exercise yard at Pelican Bay State Prison, many
were ready to fight -- for their race and for their own survival.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards had kept them from mingling for almost six months, since an August
riot, fearing another eruption of the racial tension that is a fact of life
behind bars in California.
</P>
<P>
	   They couldn't keep them apart forever.
</P>
<P>
	   When fighting broke out Wednesday, it escalated into the state's worst
prison riot in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   As many as 150 inmates joined in. Hispanics converged on a smaller group of
black inmates, most paying no heed to the guards' pepper spray, tear gas or
rubber bullets. Guards finally used lethal force and shot 16 prisoners, killing
one and critically wounding another. At least 32 others were stabbed or slashed
by fellow inmates. No guards were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Prison officials say most of the inmates probably felt they had little
choice but to join the fight, that their social code demands they take sides in
racial conflicts or suffer retaliation from other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A large part of the problem is a fraction of 1 percent of the inmate
population that pushes their beliefs on the rest of the population,'' said
prison spokesman Lt. Ben Grundy.
</P>
<P>
	   Pelican Bay, one of California's two maximum security prisons, is filled
well past capacity with the state's most violent criminals -- 3,326 inmates in a
facility built to house 2,280 -- and has a history thick with violence.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, six inmates were killed in clashes between cellmates. Three were
killed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, two former guards were indicted on charges they violated
prisoners' civil rights by arranging assaults on prisoners, one of them fatal.
Another guard was convicted on civil rights charges for shooting a prisoner
after a fight in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmate advocates argue the violence stems at least in part from
mismanagement, noting that in 1995 a federal judge found prison officials had
endorsed the use of excessive force.
</P>
<P>
	   At a National Prison Project conference in Washington, D.C., last week, some
participants called for an independent investigation of the Pelican Bay riot.
The FBI, which already is investigating allegations of civil rights violations
at Pelican Bay, said it will closely monitor a state Corrections Department
review of the riot.
</P>
<P>
	   Some critics said Pelican Bay officials should do more to protect inmates
from one another.
</P>
<P>
	   Grundy said the officials will punish the riot instigators and intensify
their searches for weapons. They are reviewing videotapes of the brawl, hoping
to identify the leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to do whatever we have to do to lock those perpetrators up.
So if they want be a tough guy or violent person, they can be a violent person
all by themselves,'' Grundy said.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics say increasingly severe punishment is what sparks riots in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you label somebody the worst of the worst and you tell them they're the
worst of the worst, and you put them in and treat them like animals, they tend
to live up or live down to those labels,'' said Jenni Gainsborough, a prison
policy analyst with the Washington-based Sentencing Project.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison is rife with handmade weapons, typically a sharpened scrap of
metal or hard plastic from a cup or toothbrush. After the latest brawl, guards
found 88 such weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody who says they are not scared to work inside an institution like
this is probably a fool,'' said Corrections Officer Chuck Alexander, president
of the local guards' union and a guard at Pelican Bay since it opened.
</P>
<P>
	   After fighting broke out between blacks and whites on Aug. 31, the inmates
were locked down, kept in their cells except to shower under guard once a day.
The fight instigators were sent to a stricter section within the prison where
they spend 22 1/2 hours a day in their cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the leaders removed, prison officials didn't feel safe allowing
inmates to mingle in the exercise yard. A week after they were allowed to
return, Wednesday's riot broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   In the yard, prisoners tend to gather with members of their race or ethnic
group. There is some mixing in times of peace, Alexander said, but the social
code demands they band together.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If one of them gets in a fight with another person, all their homies come
to their rescue,'' he said. ``That's the way it was before I came in. That will
probably be the way it is when I leave.''

<HEADLINE> Hunt leads cops from South Bronx to South America to success  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The chase went on and on, always moving south.
<P>
	   It began on a stretch of 149th Street in the South Bronx, shifted down the
coast to south Florida, proceeded across the Caribbean into South America.
</P>
<P>
	   The pursuers came from the Bronx Homicide Task Force, veteran police
investigators headquartered off a dingy highway. The prey was Los Colombianos, a
reputedly murderous gang from Bogota by way of sunny Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   In the high-profile home of the Latin Kings and the Gambino family, Los
Colombianos attracted little New York media attention. But authorities knew them
as a sophisticated, cold-blooded gang with an amazing attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
	   They operated with impudence for four years, pulling dozens of robberies
with lightning precision in a half-dozen states, authorities said. The nine
gun-toting South American nationals hit lucrative targets: banks, jewelers,
couriers.
</P>
<P>
	   They had come to the United States from Colombia and Ecuador, but were now
based in Miami. The gang's reputed leader was 25-year-old Alex Restrepo; at his
side were his sisters, Paola and Mabel. Its youngest member was just 17.
</P>
<P>
	   They allegedly robbed a New Jersey jeweler of $500,000 in diamonds. A brazen
midtown Manhattan heist netted $1.2 million in jewelry and left a Hong Kong man
with a bullet in his chest, police said. An investigator trying to arrest one
member in Queens wound up ducking gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   The gang seemed bulletproof, untouchable - until last August, when they
targeted a South Bronx business. One of its employees was a balding, slightly
pudgy ex-cop: retired detective Donald Pagani Sr., who spent 25 years with the
New York Police Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Pagani now worked two days a week at his cousin's meat distribution
business, his way of keeping busy in retirement. He was well-liked by fellow
workers, quick to grab a check at the local coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
	   The 69-year-old grandfather was off to deposit $52,000 in a nearby bank when
he was gunned down in front of a horrified co-worker on East 149th Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder case went from there to the homicide cops on the Cross-Bronx
Expressway.
</P>
<P>
	   It was their job to catch killers, but this case was personal: Pagani was
very much one of theirs. The detective had followed his father, Louis, into the
department; Pagani's son, Donald Jr., had followed him.
</P>
<P>
	   Other agencies joined the case, but the Bronx detectives remained
territorial, even when the chase led into strange territory: through a
hurricane, around an erupting volcano, across Florida, Texas, Mexico, South
America.
</P>
<P>
	   "They promised us," recalled Pagani's cousin, Michael DiPasquale, "that they
would get these guys."
</P>
<P>
	   The cat-and-mouse chase pitting the relentless cops and the Colombians went
on for months. The suspects were literally running for their lives; they faced a
possible death penalty if arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   The detectives, far from New York's familiar city streets, were trying to
keep their promise to Donald Pagani's family.
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   It was Feb. 1, 1996 - a New York winter evening, shortly after 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Lap Koon Chow, a Hong Kong salesman attending a Manhattan jewelry show, was
walking outside the New York Hilton with a friend. They had just exited a car;
each carried a bag filled with jewels.
</P>
<P>
	   It was then, according to a federal indictment, that they met Los
Colombianos.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men with knit masks pulled over their faces appeared from the darkness,
snatching the jewels. When the 36-year-old Chow resisted, one of the men simply
shot and wounded him.
</P>
<P>
	   The criminals escaped in a waiting car, firing gunshots into the air like
Dodge City cowboys. It was typical of the gang's style: fast, violent,
successful. The haul was $1.2 million in diamonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The gang, authorities said, netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in
jewelry and cash in 50 robberies between 1996-1999. They carried handguns and
walkie-talkies, wore bulletproof vests. They used various aliases and assorted
fake passports; some reportedly had plastic surgery to alter their looks and
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
	   They were based in Miami, but police said their crimes were often committed
outside Florida - targets were hit in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, Ohio.
By jumping between states and jurisdictions, they managed to avoid authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "They knew what they were doing," said police Lt. Al Katcher of Union, N.J.,
where the gang pulled off a $500,000 jewelry heist in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Katcher, the gang surprised two men at precisely 4:57 p.m. -
the time the pair typically walked through their business' parking lot with
jewelry-laden briefcases.
</P>
<P>
	   The bandits stuffed guns in the men's faces, escaping in a matter of
minutes. While fleeing, they twice changed cars to avoid detection. Police
recovered the abandoned cars, but not the jewelry.
</P>
<P>
	   Only several weeks later was a link was made between the Union heist and the
other robberies, Katcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities provided few details on most of those heists, including an
Atlanta holdup and a theft of cash and checks at a Queens supermarket. But
investigators were open about the gang's brutal efficiency, their knowledge of
their victims.
</P>
<P>
	   "They do basic investigative work on you," New York Detective Benny Tirado
observed. "They know where you work and who your kids are."
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Pagani's kid, Donald Jr., became a police lieutenant in the Sixth
Precinct. Los Colombianos didn't know that on Aug. 27, 1999, when the
high-rolling gang hit the South Bronx on a Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The elder Pagani was 69; the detective had retired from the NYPD in 1983
after a quarter-century on the job, including a stint as one of the department's
first Internal Affairs officers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1990s, he began working part-time at his cousin's South Bronx
business - something to keep him busy between his annual September hunting trips
with his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Pagani, who also had a daughter, became a father figure of sorts to many of
his younger co-workers at the American Sirloin Meat Co. "He was more like family
than a friend," remembered Abdul Tawab, an Afghani immigrant who became a Pagani
favorite.
</P>
<P>
	   At 11 a.m. that summer morning, with the weekend just hours away, Pagani
volunteered to join another employee headed to make a bank deposit of $52,000 in
cash and checks.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair made plans to grab lunch on the way back.
</P>
<P>
	   Five minutes later, Pagani was dead. A federal indictment described the
scene this way:
</P>
<P>
	   The two men climbed into a car outside the company's East 149th Street
office. A truck was double-parked alongside. They were suddenly under siege by
Restrepo and two gun-toting sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Colombianos grabbed the money pouch. Pagani pulled his .32 caliber
handgun and swapped bullets with the assailants, a cacophony of pop-pop-pops
that lasted less than 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Gangster Fernando "Fercho" Colorado was fatally wounded. Restrepo and fellow
Colombian Nelson Baez blasted at Pagani, then opened fire on bystanders in an
effort to kill any potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   When the shooting stopped, the case belonged to the Bronx Homicide Task
Force.
</P>
<P>
	   There were two immediate leads: Colorado's address book with the names of
five co-conspirators, and a license plate number, provided by an eyewitness,
from the getaway van.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder of an ex-cop finally put Los Colombianos in the newspaper. Within
days, the gang members bolted New York. That meant nothing to their new
pursuers, who were determined to close this case.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were very daring," said one of the Bronx investigators. "If we didn't
track them down, it was obvious this wouldn't be their last murder or last job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was obvious someone else would get hurt."
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   Los Colombianos returned to Florida. "Something bad happened," a police
informant later quoted gang member Pepe Mirand as saying before their abrupt
departure. Mabel Restrepo, 23, wasn't as quick as her siblings, and was arrested
on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bronx detectives, with agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration,
headed south. Within 10 days of the Pagani slaying, they were on the trail in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   As they followed leads, they encountered a dilemma unseen in the typical
Bronx homicide probe: a hurricane. The investigation was stalled as Hurricane
Floyd blew through Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The fleeing gang split up, kept on the move. Three suspects were headed for
their homeland, Ecuador. The other five were likely headed to their native
Colombia, authorities believed.
</P>
<P>
	   The fugitive suspects zipped across the southern United States to Texas,
then down into Mexico. At one point, a Coast Guard cutter was called in to chase
a ship wrongly believed to hold some of the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ecuador, there was another unfamiliar problem: a volcanic eruption that
stranded some detectives.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities were by now using wiretaps and leaks from informants to track
the suspects through South America. Days became weeks became September, October,
November. The weather in the Bronx grew cold, but the trail of the fugitives
heated up.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspects were ultimately tracked to a home in Bogota, Colombia. The
NYPD, confident it had the suspects, reached out for help.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 1, 1999, acting on a request from the Bronx cops, Colombian
officials and the DEA made their move. They arrested Restrepo and his sister,
Paola, along with Mirand and two other suspects. Their hideout held a stash of
gold chains, rings and bracelets, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   During Christmas week, officials at the U.S. Department of Justice in
Washington drafted extradition papers for the five suspects, who were indicted
for racketeering, armed robbery, attempted murder and the slaying of Donald
Pagani Sr.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other suspects remain at large, said Justice Department spokesman John
Russell.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear how long extradition will take. But when the suspects finally
head north again, four of them face the death penalty for Pagani's murder. The
other option: life without parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Pagani's family remains shaken by the slaying; his son went hunting without
his father last September, and Pagani's six grandchildren are still upset that
he no longer visits their Sunday basketball games. For the Bronx detectives,
closing the case was the best they could do for the Pagani family - and the
family appreciates it.
</P>
<P>
	   "They did a tremendous job," said his cousin, DiPasquale. "They got them."

<HEADLINE> Mayor says jury process worked in Diallo shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Saturday praised the trial
that ended in an acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of an
unarmed West African immigrant, suggesting those protesting the verdict watch a
videotape of the trial.
<P>
	   "I hear people saying the same things after the verdict as before, as if the
trial didn't take place, as if the truth didn't come out," Giuliani said during
a brief news conference at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani and police Commissioner Howard Safir, who stood behind him,
defended the police department a day after a jury found the officers innocent in
the Feb. 4, 1999 death of Diallo, who was hit 19 times as officers fired 41
rounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor said he feels "terrible for the Diallo family" but said an
appellate court was right to move the trial to Albany because hundreds of
protesters arrested as pressure grew for indictments in the case had muddied any
chance of objectivity among New York City jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   He conceded that the police department that each day faces the "enormous
complexity of policing the most diverse population in the world" could sometimes
do a better job of understanding the cultural differences in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added: "Nobody has ever done the job of policing as well as the New
York Police Department in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "That doesn't mean they don't make terrible, horrific mistakes. It doesn't
mean some of them aren't criminals who have to go to jail. But there are lawyers
who are criminals. There are doctors who are criminals," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he still recalls calling Diallo's father after the shooting from his
City Hall office to tell him that the police officers "had made a terrible
mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt the kind of pain for him as I would feel if I lost one of my own
children," Giuliani said. "I wish we could go back and undo what happened to
him."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the shooting had resulted in numerous changes within the police
department, including a more aggressive recruitment effort in minority
communities where residents had applied for jobs as officers in greater numbers
last year than ever before in city history.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said the racial division in the city was "considerably less than 10
years ago" but said there were people who wanted to exploit the divisions which
do exist.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that only five of 15 people arrested during protests on the streets
surrounding Diallo's home Friday night were from the Bronx and that none of the
incidents leading to disorderly conduct charges were serious.
</P>
<P>
	   "The people of the Bronx sent a message of how people should react to a
verdict," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor also praised District Attorney Robert Johnson for saying he
believed the judge in the Diallo case had conducted a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
	   A former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, Giuliani said, "When you lose a
difficult case like that, it's hard to have that objectivity."
</P>
<P>
	   After Giuliani left the podium, Safir promised to begin a department review
of the evidence in the case against the officers to see if departmental charges
should be brought. Prosecutors had asked the department to wait until criminal
prosecutions were completed before doing a review.
</P>
<P>
	   He said people should not get the wrong idea from the 41 bullets shot at
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "We shoot less, we fire less rounds than any other large city police
department," Safir said. "There's not a department in the United States that is
as restrained as the New York Police Department."

<HEADLINE> UN Sees No Change in US-Iraq Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite the Clinton administration's pledge to start
easing restrictions on sending some industrial equipment to Iraq, diplomats
doubt the goods Iraq most desperately needs will get there.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials, analysts and western diplomats say they have seen no
indication that Washington has changed its hard-line position in the U.N.
committee that reviews contracts for humanitarian supplies to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   At the last committee meeting, in fact, the United States blocked 20 to 30
items, including fork lifts and car batteries, from being included on a list of
humanitarian goods that could automatically be sent to Iraq through the U.N.
humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
	   A State Department official said U.S. concerns that such items could be used
for military purposes hadn't changed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The dual-use standard is what it is,'' the official said Friday on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, however, is reviewing its way of doing business in the
U.N. sanctions committee in light of a December resolution that called for
faster delivery of aid to Iraq, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has been barred from selling its oil on the open market since a
sweeping U.N. trade embargo was imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
U.N. humanitarian program, created in 1996 to get food and medicine to needy
Iraqis, allows Iraq to export oil through U.N.-controlled sales provided the
proceeds be used for humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. sanctions committee for Iraq, composed of the 15 members of the
Security Council, reviews contracts for the supplies, but any member can place a
contract on ``hold'' at any time for any reason.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $1.78 billion worth of contracts in limbo, the United States is
responsible for more than 75 percent, with Britain making up the rest, a U.N.
official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the disputed contracts are for equipment to improve Iraq's
dilapidated oil industry, power grid and water sanitation infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said Friday that the United States was reviewing ways to
get more goods to Iraqis, provided they don't help Saddam Hussein rearm. A U.S.
official in Washington said that included ``gray area'' exports such as
chlorine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post, reporting the U.S. position in a story Friday, cited an
$80 million electricity contract that Washington recently allowed to go through
as evidence of its softening position.
</P>
<P>
	   But with hundreds of millions of dollars still held up, U.N. officials and
western diplomats cautioned that such token measures would do little to have any
real impact on the lives of Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they have lifted some electricity contracts, the backlog is so huge
that to have an effect on the humanitarian situation on the ground, there has to
be much more,'' a sanctions committee member said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.N. official said she had no information that the United States had
released any other major holds recently.
</P>
<P>
	   Raad Alkadiri, an analyst with the Washington-based Petroleum Finance Group,
said it appeared the administration was merely trying to deflect some of the
criticism of its hard line without making any significant changes in its policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. has decided to back down on an issue it probably was going to
come out looking the worst on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomats noted the leaked story to the Post came on the heels of demands by
70 U.S. congressmen earlier this month to lift sanctions. In addition, the
United States is gearing up for criticism of its policies with the arrival in
New York of the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, Hans von Sponeck.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Sponeck resigned earlier this month to protest the sanctions and the
politics that had prevented the oil-for-food program from working. The German
diplomat arrives at U.N. headquarters Monday and plans to meet with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Annan, who has been outspoken about the need for the number of
``holds'' to be released, ``of course would be pleased to see some of the
backlog of these contracts on hold thinned out,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Dye Blamed for Romanian 'Red' River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- The Environmental Ministry reported a mysterious
red color in a northern river Saturday, but said later that the cause was a sack
of red dye tossed into the river.
</P>
<P>
	   The pollution scare came just four weeks after cyanide spilled at a Romanian
gold mine and polluted several eastern European waterways.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Friday, villagers along the northern river Crasna became alarmed when
they noticed the red spill, 1 1/4 miles long, on the surface of the river.
</P>
<P>
	   Ceptimius Mara, a ministry official, said Saturday that a large plastic sack
of dye had been located in the river.
</P>
<P>
	   Mara said the dye was soluble in water and may have been placed there as a
stunt to coincide with a U.N. investigation into the earlier cyanide spill.
</P>
<P>
	   He did not say if the dye was potentially dangerous to marine life.
</P>
<P>
	   The Crasna flows 46 miles in northern Romania before entering Hungary. The
river meets the Tisza, which suffered widespread pollution from the Jan. 30
cyanide spill when water containing poisonous cyanide flowed into it from the
Romanian Somes tributary.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Saturday, local authorities in Romania's northwestern counties of
Salaj and Satu Mare opened flood gates damming up water in drainage channels to
raise the flow in the Crasna to over 741 cubic foot per second to help dilute
the then unidentified substance.
</P>
<P>
	   Romanian officials had earlier notified their Hungarian counterparts of the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Italy Shootout Blamed on Gangs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROTONE, Italy (AP) -- A shootout between mobsters and police in southern
Italy left three suspected mobsters and an elderly bystander dead Saturday,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   A paramilitary Carabinieri officer was wounded by gunfire in the attack in
Strongoli, in the province of Crotone near the Ionian Sea coast in Calabria, the
region which forms the ``toe'' of the Italian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   Calabria is home turf for the 'ndrangheta, an organized crime syndicate
whose activities include extortion rackets, drug and weapons smuggling and
kidnapping. Turf wars among feuding crime clans often are blamed for shootouts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Italian news agency AGI quoted police as saying the three slain mobsters
from Strongoli -- two of them 24 years old, the other 39 -- had escaped unharmed
from a gunfire attack a week earlier on another road in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The man caught in the cross fire was a 79-year-old resident who was sitting
on a bench near the street.

<HEADLINE> Mayor urges swift federal review of Diallo evidence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A former federal prosecutor himself, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani Saturday urged a speedy Justice Department review of the Amadou Diallo
shooting, saying the tragedy had dragged on long enough.
<P>
	   "I would ask them to do it swiftly," he said at a City Hall news conference.
"This has gone on for a very, very long time."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor commented a day after a state jury in Albany found four police
officers innocent of criminal charges for shooting Diallo 41 times, hitting him
19 times in a February 1999 encounter at Diallo's Bronx doorstep.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department in Washington and U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in
Manhattan announced shortly after the verdict that federal prosecutors would
review the evidence for possible civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Friday, White said her office and the Civil Rights Division
of the Department of Justice "as in cases of this kind" would review all
evidence, including what was gathered by state prosecutors in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The purpose, she said, would be "to determine whether there were any
violations of the federal criminal civil rights laws."
</P>
<P>
	   A telephone message left with federal prosecutors Saturday was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement by White was no surprise, since she had announced previously
that FBI agents and federal criminal and civil rights prosecutors had been
working with the district attorney since the day after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The possibility of a federal trial clearly bothered Giuliani, who said he
watched much of the Diallo trial on television and found the airing of facts in
the case to be "full, complete and fair."
</P>
<P>
	   He said federal prosecutors were "really being asked to do something that
the federal government has the power to do but is highly unusual and
extraordinary."
</P>
<P>
	   He said federal prosecutors, "to try these men a second time for the act
which they've been acquitted, have to have found a gross miscarriage of
justice."
</P>
<P>
	   To proceed, federal prosecutors must find that the officers purposefully
deprived Diallo in some way of his Constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutions have worked in the past when state prosecutors have
failed, the most striking example perhaps coming in the 1991 videotaped beating
of black motorist Rodney King by four white Los Angeles policemen.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal jury acquitted two of the officers but convicted Sgt. Stacey Koon,
who supervised the arrest, and Officer Laurence Powell. They were sentenced to
30 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   White has succeeded in one high-profile prosecution of an officer acquitted
in state court.
</P>
<P>
	   That officer, Frank Livoti, was found innocent by a state judge of
criminally negligent homicide in the December 1994 death of Anthony Baez.
</P>
<P>
	   Baez was a 29-year-old from Orlando, Fla., visiting his family in the Bronx.
A football being tossed between him and his brothers struck Livoti's car,
leading the officer to arrest Baez by placing an illegal choke-hold on the
269-pound asthmatic man as he forced him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   White later brought federal civil rights charges against Livoti, leading to
a jury conviction in June 1998 and a 7-1/2 year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   At sentencing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin berated
Livoti, saying: "Mr. Livoti, you killed an innocent man and you will always have
to live with that. You decided that you were the law and that you were above the
law. You were terribly wrong on both counts."

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Douglas may have a difficult time relating to
his latest role.
</P>
<P>
	   In "Wonder Boys," he portrays a fading writer and college professor
struggling with personal and creative confusion seven years after writing a
great novel.
</P>
<P>
	   At 55, Douglas appears to be far from struggling.
</P>
<P>
	   He is engaged to actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, 30, and they are expecting
their first child, and "Wonder Boys" is earning rave reviews 25 years after
Douglas earned critical acclaim as a young producer of the Academy Award-winning
movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas attributes his success to understanding his "screen image."
</P>
<P>
	   "I've watched too many actors be more concerned with their images rather
than making the picture work," he told the Daily News of Los Angeles for
Saturday's editions.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Dismayed at Diallo Verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) -- On the crumbling streets of this seaside city, the
acquittal of four U.S. police officers in the death of one of their own was
received Saturday with dismay.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial half a world away was closely followed in Guinea, where many tuned
in late Friday to hear the verdict read on international radio and satellite
television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's inexplicable,'' said Alhassane Camara, a pharmacist. ``I don't know
if it's a racial problem, but I think they should have condemned those
policemen.''
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Amadou Diallo in a barrage of 41 police gunshots last February
triggered a wave of emotion in his poverty-stricken West African homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people met the airplane that returned his body to Conakry,
including the country's entire Cabinet. And thousands swarmed to his village in
the hills of central Guinea to bury him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has touched all of us here,'' said Aboubacar Bah, a Conakry-based
journalist. It is very shocking to hear the policemen were released. Justice has
not been done.''
</P>
<P>
	   The officers had all contended that they fired in self-defense after Diallo,
22, reached for an object they thought was a gun while standing in the vestibule
of his Bronx apartment building. The object turned out to be a wallet. Diallo
was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   It's an argument that many here find hard to accept.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Forty-one bullets, that's too many for four policemen,'' said Mohamed
Lamine Diallo, who sells electronic appliances and is not related to the victim.
``They must redo this trial.''

<HEADLINE> The Diallo trial is over, but the case goes on  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - With a cascade of 24 "not guiltys," the Amadou Diallo
murder trial ended in an upstate courtroom. But the highly-publicized case, with
its overtones of racism and police brutality, promises to linger long past the
verdict.
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant by four police officers
will echo in the way that the New York Police Department identifies possible
suspects. The Bronx night when 41 bullets ricocheted through a cramped vestibule
will be relived in a civil trial.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal probe of the shooting is already underway, with the chance of yet
another trial for the four acquitted cops. Departmental charges against the
officers, who remain on the job, stand as another possibility.
</P>
<P>
	   The case looms as a likely issue in this year's U.S. Senate race between
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who made a misstep
by calling the Diallo case a "tragic murder" before the trial began.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, most of the major party presidential candidates felt compelled
to issue statements after Friday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the slain 22-year-old's name - Diallo - has become synonymous with
police brutality to many, and will be invoked as a symbol of animosity toward
the minority community by police.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquittals won't affect that.
</P>
<P>
	   "This news reopens the wounds of distrust," the Rev. Jesse Jackson said
after the verdict. "And the healing process that had begun turns to mourning
once again."
</P>
<P>
	   The Diallo shooting joined Howard Beach, Bensonhurst and Abner Louima as
shorthand for racial problems in the nation's largest city. Protests began
almost immediately after the Feb. 4, 1999, shooting of Diallo, with movie stars,
politicians and protesters lining up to get arrested outside Police
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The case warranted attention not only in New York, but around the country
and the world. Even as protesters rallied Saturday in the Bronx, people in
Diallo's native Guinea were questioning the verdict as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's inexplicable," said Alhassane Camara, a pharmacist in the Guinea
capital of Conakry.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, officials in the Justice Department were reviewing the case
for a possible federal civil rights trial, much like the Rodney King case in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Worth, attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, said Saturday that the
officers wanted to meet with officials from the federal civil rights division to
discuss the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to ask them to come to a speedy resolution on the case," Worth said
optimistically.
</P>
<P>
	   The fatal shooting also focused attention on the police Street Crime Unit,
an elite group of investigators whose unofficial motto was "We own the night."
Critics have charged - and a report from the state attorney general indicated -
that racial profiling is a factor in the NYPD's stop and frisk operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the Diallo family have already said they will file a
multi-million dollar lawsuit against the city, charging that Amadou Diallo was a
victim of illegal racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the end," Diallo family attorney Anthony Gair said after
Friday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings will also linger forever with the four acquitted cops:
McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy. They must live every
day with the knowledge that they shot and killed an unarmed man.
</P>
<P>
	   "Time will tell," Worth said of the four. "They have to make a decision on
whether they even want to be cops anymore."

<HEADLINE> Armani Leaves Mark on Moda Milanese  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIELA PETROFF AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Leave it to Giorgio Armani to put the final touch on
the lady-like chic that has marked this round of "moda Milanese."
</P>
<P>
	   His collection, presented Saturday at the end of the week-long preview
showings for the fall-winter 2000-2001, had all the elements of the new
sophisticated look, from the pretty coat and jacket to the twinkling evening
wear.
</P>
<P>
	   But everything at Armani was refined, stripped of the excess of fabric
mixture, busy patterns, furry and gilded styles which at times have weighed down
the new millennium "signora."
</P>
<P>
	   Instead the designer showed ultralight fabrics and styles so pared down that
they fit like a glove on the body. Daytime is all about feminine-tailored suits
with trousers so soft they look like a second skin, and jackets that are well
defined but as soft as a shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   Pointy, flat-heeled shoes or stiletto pumps also with a point complete his
sophisticated "signora" look. Also in the accessory department wide patent
leather belts define a tiny waist, while beaded pochettes are so small they
serve more as jewelry than carryall.
</P>
<P>
	   The proper knee length coat which has shown up all over the Milan runway is
very much at home at Armani in princess style or trench coat lined in satin.
</P>
<P>
	   Motto of this winter's evening wear is if it shines it must be good, which
in some cases produced an overload in the amount of sparkling stuff that was
stuck on to fabric just to make it look rich.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead Armani's beading for sheer chiffon pants and delicate evening skirts
glowed rather than glared.
</P>
<P>
	   No wonder that Lady Helen Taylor, a niece of England's Queen Elizabeth, and
Princess Alexandra of Greece, in front row seats, applauded with noble
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday Donatella Versace presented her version of the new millennium
chic, more daring and less dainty than the Armani look, but equally lady-like.
</P>
<P>
	   The lastest Versace collection harked back to the heydays of her slain
brother Gianni, with accordian-pleated halter dresses, bright colors and bold
prints.
</P>
<P>
	   In keeping with this season's fabric mixtures, she presents fur skirts and
bustiers under a silk velvet coat, and embroiders her chiffon evening wear with
strips of crocodile leather.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike at Armani, where the winter palette at its brightest is midnight
blue, the Versace color scheme ranges from peach pink to cherry red, from aqua
blue to emerald green.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Saturday, Alberta Ferretti and Miuccia Prada for her second line,
Miu Miu, also opted for next winter's lady-like tone.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferretti's show was simply very pretty. Pretty daytime coats, pretty fur
jackets, and pretty chiffon evening gowns combined to define the wardrobe of a
woman looking for a demure rather than sophisticated look.
</P>
<P>
	   Miu Miu aimed at the younger set played with funky hats that were midway
between a Robin Hood cap and a bonnet and lots of new bags from modern carpet
bags to roomy little trunks.
</P>
<P>
	   In the clothes department, Miuccia who was super upscale for her signature
collection, preferred a more relaxed look of leather skirts and short-cropped
tops.
</P>
<P>
	   Her new horizontal striped princess coat is sure to be a winter hit.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Tout Education Plans  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offering a lesson plan for failing schools, President
Clinton urged Congress on Saturday to approve $250 million to help states
radically improve troubled public schools or shut them down and start over.
Critical Republicans quickly countered with their own formulas for improving
education.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also offered the option of permitting a student at a ``chronically
failing'' public school to transfer to a public school with a better record of
achievement. But he emphasized efforts to transform the schools now doing a poor
job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Too few of these failing schools ever get enough help to turn around,''
the president said in his weekly radio address. ``With today's action we are
declaring as a nation that we will not fail our children by tolerating failing
schools ... Students can't aim high in schools that perform low.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, meanwhile, pushed the GOP plan for education savings accounts
to pay the costs of transferring to private, parochial or public schools, an
idea Clinton has twice vetoed, in part as a threat to the nation's system of
public school education.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the Republican Conference, faulted
Clinton for offering ``only baby steps of reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota, chairman of the Republican Governors
Association, called Clinton's comments on permitting students to transfer out of
failing public schools ``tricky.'' He said the option to transfer from a failing
school to a public or a charter school already exists in law and he believes the
president is trying to narrow it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds like he's coming out with rules that make it harder for kids to
transfer out of a failing school,'' Schafer said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter, Schafer and two other GOP governors, Jim Gilmore of Virginia
and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, asked Clinton to make clear that the option of
transferring out of a poorly performing school is ``available to every student
who attends one of the 7,000 identified failing schools in our nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House education committee, said
Clinton's action is, at least, ``a start toward providing the stepping stone for
thousands of children to be able eventually to join mainstream America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced state-by-state allocations from an existing $134 million
fund that states and cities can tap for struggling schools, and released
guidelines on how the money can be used most effectively.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also asked Congress to approve the $250 million he requested
for the accountability fund in his fiscal 2001 budget proposal, so that states
can make targeted, concentrated efforts to fix schools that no longer perform
for their students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fixing a failing school isn't easy, but communities are proving every day
that it can be done,'' Clinton said. ``We must continue to invest more and
demand more.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton guidelines suggest ways to strengthen curricula, improve teacher
training or close schools entirely and then reopen them with stronger leadership
and teaching staffs or reestablish them as charter schools with community
support.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate is expected to begin voting next week on a bill that would allow
parents to place as much as $2,000 per year, per child, in educational savings
accounts. The tax-free interest could be used for expenses, including
transportation and tutors, associated with any school -- public, private or
parochial -- from kindergarten through the 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The point is that it is the parent's choice,'' Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,
the plan's chief sponsor, said in the GOP radio address. ``And why shouldn't it
be? After all, it is their money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Coverdell said Clinton should consider the education accounts because they
represent the type of targeted relief he has advocated for middle-class
families.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said if ``the
president now is actually changing his mind and truly favors school choice and
accountability, we welcome him to that cause.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``However, Republicans know that when the accountability is in Washington
and the choice is between one failing school and another, our children are being
short changed.''

<HEADLINE> Young Designers Open Paris Shows  </HEADLINE>
    By SUZY PATTERSON AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Early offerings on Saturday for the upcoming week of
fall-winter 2000-2001 ready-to-wear were surprisingly quiet and modestly
creative, generally showing off the talents of younger designers and featuring
attractive, commercial clothing rather than show-off pieces.
</P>
<P>
	   French designer Christian Tournafol, showing for the first time in the
Louvre's Carrousel space, concentrated on his favorite tight pullover and skirt
looks.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes the 32-year-old Tournafol goes back to his roots in the
northwestern French region of Brittany for inspiration. This time it was mainly
in the turtleneck toppers and the skirts draped in back rather like Breton
great-grandmothers' -- but lightened and perky.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a wonderful contrast of fuzzy mohair toppers and shiny "tech"
taffeta fabrics, with mohair worked into lacy or feathery styles for toppers or
long skirts.
</P>
<P>
	   Reds, blacks and tweed took up some of the day wear. And the dressy longer
clothes in plum, Bordeaux or browns looked just right for a dressy fisherman's
dinner along Brittany's coast, or maybe a firelight supper up in Celtic Wales or
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   For John Ribbe, showing in a small hotel space near the Louvre, fashion was
a snap. The 41-year-old German-born designer, now working in Paris after stints
in Minneapolis and New York, used snaps to turn many of his reversible clothes
upside down and inside out.
</P>
<P>
	   One model took off a beige trench coat in a pleasant striptease, leaving
black synthetic pants and a vest underneath. Another model was meanwhile busily
changing skirt, jacket and trousers around to make another outfit.
</P>
<P>
	   The black synthetic "tarred" fabric was among several "tech" gems here, like
fake fur for jackets and coats, patterned in bas-relief caiman alligator style.
</P>
<P>
	   One good idea for people confused about skirt lengths: the "modulable"
dress, a kind of sleeveless, easy sheath that can unsnap and be let out from
mini- to midi- to maxi- length. In synthetics or a cotton gabardine blend, it's
a good bet for all seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Snaps went all the way to the floor here in skirts that unsnap their snaffle
tabs to reveal bright panels underneath.
</P>
<P>
	   Like other showings Saturday, Ribbe's prices are still moderate compared to
big-name labels like Chloe or Yves Saint Laurent. One of his jackets retails for
less than $500, and dresses run for about $350.
</P>
<P>
	   Danish designer Bjorn Bruun's presentation in the Louvre's Carrousel area
was a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   Models came out in red felted jersey short to-the-knee dresses with scoop
necks, red tights and slick heeled shoes. Wonderful off-white long jersey skirts
and easy tunics or T-shirts painted with shell motifs set the low-key tone.
</P>
<P>
	   Clay-shaded outfits went into a dreary note, though they were pepped up with
turquoise shoes and tights. An excellent new trouser look from Bruuns' Bazaar is
the red herringbone tweed tunic and easy, slightly flared pants.
</P>
<P>
	   Faded jeans, though paired with interesting tops, looked bland. But at least
Bruun has an eye to what the hoi polloi and kids are wearing on the streets. And
his toppers -- including both poplin overblouses and smooth shearling coats --
are quite good.
</P>
<P>
	   After this quiet beginning, the fashion mavens are awaiting true excitement
during a week that offers nearly 100 shows on the official calendar and more
than 50 outside the schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   Following New York, London and Milan shows, with mixed reviews, will Paris
score for highest hype and creativity? Watch this space.

<HEADLINE> Floods Trap Thousands in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Rapidly rising floodwaters in central Mozambique
swept bodies down a swollen river Saturday and threatened to drown thousands of
other people clinging to trees and rooftops.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials hoped to get rescue helicopters Sunday to the Save River Valley.
The government estimated 17,000 people in the valley were in danger from water
levels that reportedly rose several feet in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Aid workers, hampered by washed-out bridges and roads everywhere, can't cope
with the scale of the disaster. Three weeks after rains began drenching southern
Africa -- and four days after Cyclone Eline roared through -- human tragedies
are still unfolding.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just reached a point that's incredible and it's going to get much
worse,'' said Michelle Quintaglie, spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
	   To the east, the Indian Ocean was brewing another tropical storm for
Mozambique. To the west, swollen rivers in Zimbabwe and South Africa were
expected to dump much of the overflow in downstream Mozambique by Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Zimbabwe, floodwaters Friday night shoved a bus carrying an unknown
number of passengers off a bridge and into a raging river. No survivors were
found Saturday, but rescuers did find six tourists missing from another bus that
had stalled in floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
	   Lines of cars up to two miles long formed at gas stations in Zimbabwe, where
flooding prevented trucks from bringing fuel to the landlocked nation. The
official death toll in Zimbabwe was 29 and likely to climb.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Africa, parts of hard-hit Northern Province -- where 76 people have
died -- were cut off from aid and communication, said National Defense Force
Col. Flip le Roux.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There must be far more people in danger than we know of,'' Le Roux told
Cabinet ministers who flew over the province. Overflowing rivers had smashed
bridges into pieces. Roads were converted into streams. Streams had become
rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Malawi, a sliver of a country bordering Mozambique, storms have blown off
roofs, downed power lines and trees and flattened crops. There were no reported
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mozambican government estimates that more than 200,000 people are
homeless and at least 70 have died -- a toll expected to rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Aid workers who flew over the Save River Valley said they saw several
thousand people in trees, on thatched roofs and huddled on narrow strips of
land, apparently marooned by floodwaters since Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These people are very, very desperate. It must be a nightmare for them,''
said Carol Collins of the British charity Save the Children. ``The water is
moving very, very rapidly. I'm sure some of them were swept away.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two pilots and World Food Program officials saw several bodies being swept
along by the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
	   The international response to appeals by Mozambique's government and U.N.
agencies for $65 million in aid was growing.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. Air Force plane carrying tents, blankets and other supplies, and an
Italian aid plane were headed for Mozambique, as were two military helicopters
from Malawi. The World Bank announced a $2.5 million grant for flood victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Five South African Air Force helicopters have already plucked more than
3,000 people to safety in southern Mozambique over the past two weeks, and were
heading to the Save River, 620 miles north of Maputo, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Several trucks carrying emergency aid became stuck Friday in the rising
flood waters near the town of Save (pronounced sah-VAY). Only two buildings
protruded from the muddy water in the town of Nova Mambone, where the Save River
enters the sea.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Health Organization has warned that 800,000 are at risk from
cholera, malaria and other diseases because of the floods.

<HEADLINE> Mayor urges swift federal review of Diallo evidence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A former federal prosecutor himself, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani Saturday urged a speedy Justice Department review of the Amadou Diallo
shooting, saying the tragedy had dragged on long enough.
<P>
	   "I would ask them to do it swiftly," he said at a City Hall news conference.
"This has gone on for a very, very long time."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor commented a day after a state jury in Albany found four police
officers innocent of criminal charges for shooting Diallo 41 times, hitting him
19 times in a February 1999 encounter at Diallo's Bronx doorstep.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department in Washington and U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in
Manhattan announced shortly after the verdict that federal prosecutors would
review the evidence for possible civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Friday, White said her office and the Civil Rights Division
of the Department of Justice "as in cases of this kind" would review all
evidence, including what was gathered by state prosecutors in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The purpose, she said, would be "to determine whether there were any
violations of the federal criminal civil rights laws."
</P>
<P>
	   A telephone message left with federal prosecutors Saturday was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement by White was no surprise, since she had announced previously
that FBI agents and federal criminal and civil rights prosecutors had been
working with the district attorney since the day after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The possibility of a federal trial clearly bothered Giuliani, who said he
watched much of the Diallo trial on television and found the airing of facts in
the case to be "full, complete and fair."
</P>
<P>
	   He said federal prosecutors were "really being asked to do something that
the federal government has the power to do but is highly unusual and
extraordinary."
</P>
<P>
	   He said federal prosecutors, "to try these men a second time for the act
which they've been acquitted, have to have found a gross miscarriage of
justice."
</P>
<P>
	   To proceed, federal prosecutors must find that the officers purposefully
deprived Diallo in some way of his Constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutions have worked in the past when state prosecutors have
failed, the most striking example perhaps coming in the 1991 videotaped beating
of black motorist Rodney King by four white Los Angeles policemen.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal jury acquitted two of the officers but convicted Sgt. Stacey Koon,
who supervised the arrest, and Officer Laurence Powell. They were sentenced to
30 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal prosecutor in Brooklyn began a civil rights investigation in
1997 after police brutalized Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, rupturing his
bladder and colon with a broken broomstick after he was arrested outside a
Brooklyn nightclub.
</P>
<P>
	   Officer Justin Volpe was sentenced to 30 years in prison after he admitted
to the attack. A second officer, Charles Schwarz, was convicted by a federal
jury and awaits sentencing on charges carrying a possible life sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz and two other officers are now on trial in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn on charges that they conspired to obstruct justice in the case. The
charges carry a potential sentence of up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   White has succeeded in one high-profile prosecution of an officer acquitted
in state court.
</P>
<P>
	   That officer, Frank Livoti, was found innocent by a state judge of
criminally negligent homicide in the December 1994 death of Anthony Baez.
</P>
<P>
	   Baez was a 29-year-old from Orlando, Fla., visiting his family in the Bronx.
A football being tossed between him and his brothers struck Livoti's car,
leading the officer to arrest Baez by placing an illegal choke-hold on the
269-pound asthmatic man as he forced him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   White later brought federal civil rights charges against Livoti, leading to
a jury conviction in June 1998 and a 7-1/2 year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   At sentencing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin berated
Livoti, saying: "Mr. Livoti, you killed an innocent man and you will always have
to live with that. You decided that you were the law and that you were above the
law. You were terribly wrong on both counts."

<HEADLINE> Cuba Envoy Defies Departure Order  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuban diplomat Jose Imperatori said today he will defy a
U.S. expulsion order and go on a hunger strike to clear his name of allegations
that he was a contact of a U.S. immigration official charged with spying for
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have become the victim of a major slander,'' Imperatori told reporters
at a news conference. ``I have been wrongly accused of doing intelligence work
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori spoke to reporters less than three hours before the 1:30 p.m. EST
deadline set by the State Department for his departure. After that hour, he was
to have been stripped of his diplomatic privileges and immunities. But
Imperatori said he resigned his post as consular officer at 7 a.m. this morning,
thus voluntarily eliminating his immunity 6 1/2 hours before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton administration officials have said it is unprecedented for a
diplomat to ignore an expulsion order. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined
to speculate about possible law enforcement action but an administration
official suggested that steps against Imperatori would be taken quickly. The
official, asking not to be identified, declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials were notifying the State Department today of Imperatori's
intentions. Imperatori could have sought refuge in the Cuban diplomatic mission
in Washington, where he would have been beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he said, ``I shall remain in the same apartment where I have lived, and
as of this moment I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have been
absolutely cleared of the accusation brought against me.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and jailed. My
morale and my truth will be my shield.''
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori, 46, said his wife and 3-year-old son left Friday night for Cuba,
since they, too, would have been deprived of diplomatic immunity had they stayed
on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing with Imperatori was former Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, a
lawyer who was retained by the Cuban interest section to represent him.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmoke said Imperatori, who spoke through a translator, intends to limit
himself to a liquids-only diet and does not intend to endanger his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori, a resident of Bethesda, Md., suggested a link between the arrest
of the immigration official accused of spying for Cuba and a custody battle
involving Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban child who arrived unaccompanied in South
Florida on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that the State Department expulsion order was handed down just
three days before a federal court hearing was to have been held on the case. The
hearing has since been postponed.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori said Cuban Interests Section officials have been ``categorically
and precisely instructed not to do intelligence work in the United States''
since the mission was opened 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such instructions have been strictly observed and with absolutely no
exceptions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was asked to leave the country after the FBI concluded he was the
Washington contact for Mariano M. Faget, a Miami-based official of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service who was arrested a week ago on charges of
spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernando Remirez, Cuba's top diplomat here, was expected to hold a news
conference today to explain Cuban thinking on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart declined comment Friday on what steps the
administration plans to take. He said there are a ``number of legal remedies
that will become available to us after the deadline passes.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We, for today, are going to continue to make clear to the Cuban government
that this gentleman should leave, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said it would be highly unusual
for a state not to remove a diplomat under these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, Cuba must either
recall the diplomat or terminate his functions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials have said they are determined that Imperatori will remain in
the United States to prove that the allegations against him have no basis in
fact.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government has said its diplomatic mission in Washington has not
engaged in intelligence activities since it opened in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Reformists Gain Control in Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- President Mohammad Khatami said Saturday that the
social and political reforms he started will not come at the expense of Islam,
and it doesn't matter ``what others say or want.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reforms are ``part of the essence'' of the 1979 Islamic revolution that
installed the clergy's rule in Iran, the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami's remarks to Foreign Ministry officials came as his allies took firm
control of parliament after the final count in the Feb. 18 elections was
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments appeared to be an attempt to strike a conciliatory tone toward
the hard-liners who, though ousted from control of parliament for the first time
since 1979, still wield power. The hard-liners control the judiciary as well as
key institutions that can override the legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his landslide victory in 1997, Khatami has loosened the clergy-imposed
restrictions in the daily lives of Iranians, increased press freedom and
generally decreased the influence of hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami said the Islamic revolution ``is introducing an Islam in which the
people enjoy freedom.'' At the same time, Iran is committed to the revolution,
he said, adding that ``reforms never mean giving up principles.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reforms are moves toward materialization of the demands of the Islamic
revolution. ... It is not important what others say or want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to final results, Khatami's allies, campaigning on a platform to
boost his programs, won 170 seats in the 290-seat parliament. Hard-liners and
conservatives won 45 and independents 10; the remaining 65 seats will be decided
in run-offs in April.
</P>
<P>
	   In the crucial district of Tehran, reformists led by Khatami's younger
brother, Mohammadreza Khatami, won 29 of the 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami was the highest vote-getter, followed by Jamileh Kadivar, a popular
columnist who is the sister of jailed dissident Mohsen Kadivar. The
third-highest was Alireza Nouri, who has called for a national referendum to
decide whether to open a dialogue with the United States. Nouri's brother,
Abdollah, is another prominent dissident.
</P>
<P>
	   Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani secured the 30th place in Tehran with
the least number of votes among the winning candidates. Once considered a
moderate, Rafsanjani has increasingly been identified as a conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   His slim victory margin -- he barely surpassed the 25 percent minimum needed
to avoid a run-off -- is a blow to the conservatives and to his own political
future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He got more (votes) than he deserved,'' said Karin Zadourian, an airline
employee from Tehran who said she supports the reform movement. ``When he was
president, he didn't do any good.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reformist victory has raised hopes that Iran would try to improve
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech, Khatami said Iran's foreign policy is to have fewer enemies
``every moment'' and add them to the ``list of our friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   Without naming the United States, he said making new friends ``is not
contradictory to our principles. ... We should move from the era of a
rapprochement to the era of confidence building.''
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami has encouraged increased people-to-people contact with the United
States but has stopped short of calling for talks.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright renewed an offer for
talks about U.S. concerns with Iranian policies. The United States accuses Iran
of sponsoring terrorism, trying to sabotage Middle East peacemaking and seeking
to amass weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran rejects the accusations and says there can be no talks until the United
States treats Iran with respect and releases Iranian assets valued at $12
billion frozen in U.S. banks.

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor: Diallo Trial Was Fair  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that the trial of four
police officers who killed an unarmed West African immigrant was fair, and he
suggested that critics review a videotape of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hear people saying the same things after the verdict as before, as if
the trial didn't take place, as if the truth didn't come out,'' Giuliani said
during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need some of them to back off a little, to say `Maybe we were wrong in
rushing to judgment before we had a trial,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said he watched much of the televised trial -- which ended Friday
with the officers acquitted of all charges -- and believes that the facts of
Amadou Diallo's shooting were presented fairly before a jury that was mixed
racially. Eight of the jurors were white and four were black.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, who fired 41 bullets into the vestibule of Diallo's
apartment building Feb. 4, 1999, hitting him 19 times, testified that they
thought Diallo had a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel terrible for the Diallo family,'' Giuliani said. ``But I also have
strong feelings about what was done to the police officers in this case.''
</P>
<P>
	   The police could do a better job of understanding the cultural differences
in a city with ``the most diverse population in the world,'' he said, but added,
no one else has ever done the job better.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That doesn't mean they don't make terrible, horrific mistakes,'' Giuliani
said. ``It doesn't mean some of them aren't criminals who have to go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the verdict was read, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of
Diallo's apartment building, some yelling ``Murderers!'' and other complaining
that the verdicts told police that violence against blacks and Hispanics would
go unpunished. Fifteen protesters were arrested.

<HEADLINE> Israel Strikes Lebanon After Ambush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli jets raided suspected guerrilla hideouts in
south Lebanon Saturday hours after an Israeli-allied militia patrol was
ambushed, inflicting ``several casualties,'' the Hezbollah guerrilla group said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese security officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity
from this southern port city, said Israeli jets struck twice at a valley near
the village of Blatt on the edge of the Israeli-occupied enclave in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army confirmed the airstrikes and said all planes returned
safely to their bases.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lebanese officials had no casualty report and could not pinpoint whether
the raid was in retaliation for an ambush by Hezbollah guerrillas against
Israeli-allied militiamen in the village of Houla, some 25 miles southeast of
Blatt.
</P>
<P>
	   The fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a statement that
Saturday's 4:30 p.m. ambush on a mountain road inside the occupied zone
``destroyed allied-enemy armor and inflicted several casualties inside an M-113
tank.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla war aimed at driving the Israelis from the
border zone they have occupied since 1985. U.N. resolutions call for Israel to
withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon, a move Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak says will take place by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli-Lebanese border, the last active Arab-Israeli war front, saw a
major escalation in fighting early February. Seven Israeli soldiers have been
killed in guerrilla attacks in the south since Jan. 25. Israeli warplanes on
Feb. 8 destroyed three power stations in Lebanon, wounding at least 15
civilians. Barak said his army will strike again at Lebanese targets to
retaliate for casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   The spiraling hostilities in the south have prompted the United States to
call on all parties to exercise restraint and avoid derailing peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Peace talks between Israel and Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, have
been stalled since December.

<HEADLINE> German Party Bickers Ahead of Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's conservatives squabbled Saturday about which
candidates for party leadership would best lead them out of a campaign finance
scandal, illustrating their weakness on the eve of a state election.
</P>
<P>
	   Volker Ruehe, a former defense minister running for governor Sunday in
Schleswig-Holstein, has picked up support from several Christian Democratic
lawmakers as the party prepares to elect a new leader in April.
</P>
<P>
	   But party general secretary Angela Merkel made it clear she also remained in
the running, despite complaints by Bavarian ultra-conservatives that she was too
liberal to lead the party.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's ballot in the North German state bordering Denmark is the first
electoral test since the scandal erupted in December with former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's admission that he accepted illegal campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruehe, a centrist, lost an early lead in the race because of the scandal. He
is now given slim chances of unseating Governor Heide Simonis, a Social
Democrat. Recent polls show her party with 45 percent support to the Christian
Democrats' 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet if the 57-year-old Ruehe defies expectations, he could get a boost in
the wrangling to succeed Wolfgang Schaeuble, who announced this month he would
step down as the party's chairman and floor leader in parliament. Schaeuble
faced criticism inside the party for his handling of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bavaria-only Christian Social Union renewed warnings to the Christian
Democrats on Saturday to choose a leader conservative enough to keep voters from
drifting to extreme-right parties.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning clearly was aimed at Merkel, who is from former communist East
Germany and is viewed by the CSU as too liberal on abortion and immigration. But
in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, she insisted the party could
not ``limit itself to one direction'' and should view diversity of opinion as an
asset.
</P>
<P>
	   Merkel also has distanced herself from Kohl, whose admission of accepting up
to $1 million in off-the-books donations in the 1990s triggered the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   His refusal to name the donors has fed speculation that donations were given
in exchange for favors from his government -- something Kohl has repeatedly
denied. Kohl led the Christian Democrats for 25 years, including 16 as
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   German prosecutors have reportedly received a tip that Kohl removed files
from the chancellery after his 1998 election defeat, but Kohl's office denied
Saturday that he concealed any official records.
</P>
<P>
	   The claim was made in an anonymous letter sent to Bonn prosecutors, who have
been weighing charges against Kohl since he admitted accepting the illegal
campaign donations, the newsweekly Der Spiegel reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At no time did Kohl remove government files or documents of the Christian
Democratic Union or order their removal,'' the statement from Kohl's office
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It said the only materials Kohl transferred to the party office in his home
state were books from his private collection -- one shipment in 1998 and a
second in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton's high profile in Diallo case prompts political courting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A decade ago, the Rev. Al Sharpton leaped into the
spotlight with his allegations that a white gang raped Tawana Brawley, creating
controversy and prompting the political establishment to keep its distance.
<P>
	   Today, Sharpton is seen as a well-respected leader of New York's black
community, and has been a constant fixture in the Amadou Diallo police shooting,
often appearing with the victim's parents, inside the courtroom and at various
rallies.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, still known for quick punch lines and his pompadour hairdo, is now
being courted by mainstream political heavyweights such as first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   But has he really changed? Sharpton himself thinks so, saying he's been
trying for years to forge closer ties with whites and others outside the black
community. Sharpton was not immediately available for an interview Saturday, but
in a conversation last year with The Associated Press, he spoke of how he's
modeled himself after his mentor and friend, the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pattern of my life is almost the same as his," Sharpton said. "He grew
from a controversial activist ... to becoming a presidential candidate and a
major force in the Democratic party."
</P>
<P>
	   Others say Sharpton, 45, is still as bombastic and divisive as ever.
</P>
<P>
	   What's changed about Sharpton is the way he's been portrayed by the media,
said Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The turning point for Sharpton was in 1992, when he first ran for office,
seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, said Meyers. That was
four years after he charged that a group of white men raped Brawley. In 1998, a
jury ordered Sharpton to pay $65,000 to the former prosecutor he accused of
raping her.
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since the 1992 campaign, the media began to see Sharpton in a different
light, Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And ever since then, the media has resurrected him, reinvented him and
recycled him," Meyers said. "The media needs Al Sharpton. He's the stereotype of
a black leader. He's a boisterous, noisy guy, quick with a quip."
</P>
<P>
	   Meyers, who is black, does not believe Sharpton is the "leader" of the black
community in New York. And he says the majority of black residents agree with
him.
</P>
<P>
	   "They see Al Sharpton as a media creation, which he is," Meyers said. "He
doesn't represent the point of view of the majority of blacks, Latinos, whites,
most New Yorkers. Who elected Al Sharpton the black leader? Who?"
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion,
also says Sharpton's transformation began during the 1992 Senate campaign, a
nasty battle featuring Geraldine Ferraro, Liz Holtzman and Robert Abrams.
</P>
<P>
	   "During the debates, Rev. Sharpton really took the conciliatory road, using
the 'I can't believe these guys are throwing mudpies' routine," Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   And it worked, but only for some New Yorkers, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "For many New Yorkers, it's too late for Rev. Sharpton to have a second
chance to make a first impression," Miringoff said. "But clearly he has charted
a very different course, one that is working within the political structure."
</P>
<P>
	   The proof of that, Miringoff says, is Sharpton's starring role in the recent
debate between Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley at Harlem's Apollo Theatre,
where Sharpton was given the honor of asking the first question.
</P>
<P>
	   But Meyers believes Sharpton won't help any political candidate with the
black vote.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it may very well help sink their ship," he said. "When they
misunderstand and misread black people as they do in the terms of thinking Al
Sharpton is the black peoples' representative, I think black people reject that
and see it as pandering."

<HEADLINE> Rape Victims Worry About AIDS  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- When Annie Newton puts her twins to bed, there are no
goodnight kisses after nightly prayers. She washes her hands before hugging the
10-year-old girls, and won't let them in the kitchen while she's cooking, for
fear they might touch her blood if she cuts herself.
</P>
<P>
	   Newton doesn't have AIDS and she has tested negative for HIV, but, like
millions of other sexual assault victims, she constantly fears the man who raped
her gave her the deadly virus, which may not show itself until years after
contact.
</P>
<P>
	   While Newton has been told that her attacker had AIDS, many other rape
victims are left knowing only that the possibility exists.
</P>
<P>
	   Privacy laws prevent some states from releasing inmates' HIV test results or
causes of death, even to their victims. In recent years, some state
legislatures, including Arizona, Hawaii, Kentucky, South Carolina and Wisconsin,
have amended their laws to give victims access to such records. In Georgia, the
district attorneys is allowed to inform the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Many victims say their inability to find out their attacker's status makes
their ordeal even worse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm constantly thinking that I may have survived the attack, but he might
eventually murder me with HIV, and not knowing is just eating me up right now,''
said Kellie Greene, an Orlando, Fla., woman who was attacked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene has sued Florida to get the medical records of her attacker but has
been told several times she can't access them due to privacy considerations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why does he have any privacy rights?'' Greene said. ``He certainly
disregarded mine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Newton's attacker recently died in prison after a long bout with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On the one hand, I was happy he died after what he did to me,'' she said.
``But then I started thinking that my time might come soon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Victim advocates say Newton's chance of infection is greater than that of
women who have normal sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive man because the
brutal nature of the attack led to more blood contact.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's something that crosses every victim's mind,'' said Debbie Andrews,
executive director for the Rape Abuse &AMP; Incest National Network. ``You have to
go through that struggle of not knowing for sure, even if the first test is
negative.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates there are as many as
900,000 people infected with HIV in the United States. Doctors say it can take
five years for the virus to appear after sexual contact.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates say few statistics have been compiled on the number of women who
contract HIV through rape. A 1990 study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine showed that less than 1 percent of victims surveyed contracted the
disease through the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Liz Flowers, executive director of the Georgia Network to End Sexual
Assault, said that percentage probably wasn't accurate because many women aren't
tested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many attacks are by someone they know or a former sex partner,'' Flowers
said. ``That brings the fear level about HIV and AIDS way down, even though the
risk is just as high.''
</P>
<P>
	   That wasn't the case for Newton and other victims of Joseph Patrick
Washington. He died in prison last October while serving a life sentence in
conjunction with five separate Augusta area attacks in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington forced the women into his car at gunpoint, drove to a remote
location, shot them and then raped, prosecutors said at his 1995 trial. One
witness testified that Washington had said he wanted to infect as many women as
he could because his former girlfriend had given him HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   But fearing lawsuits for breach of privacy by Washington's family members,
state corrections officials would only say he died from ``natural causes.''
Georgia Department of Corrections spokesman Scott Stallings said that all
incoming inmates are tested for HIV, but the results are not made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Newton was told Washington had AIDS by Augusta's district attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Victims advocates say the specter of AIDS makes it hard for women to recover
after an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rape produces post-traumatic stress syndrome, and if you can't put some
distance between yourself and the attack, it will never go away,'' Flowers said.
``And the longer possibility of AIDS just keeps hanging there, so will the
effects of the attack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Baxley, 44, was attacked by Washington in 1993 and has been tested
three times since then. All have turned up negative, but she still can't shake
the fear of contracting HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I might have escaped dying the first time, but there's no telling if it
will come back around again.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor: Diallo Trial Was Fair  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that the trial of four
police officers who killed an unarmed West African immigrant was fair, and he
suggested that critics review a videotape of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hear people saying the same things after the verdict as before, as if
the trial didn't take place, as if the truth didn't come out,'' Giuliani said
during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need some of them to back off a little, to say `Maybe we were wrong in
rushing to judgment before we had a trial,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said he watched much of the televised trial -- which ended Friday
with the officers acquitted of all charges -- and believes that the facts of
Amadou Diallo's shooting were presented fairly before a jury that was mixed
racially. Eight of the jurors were white and four were black.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, who fired 41 bullets into the vestibule of Diallo's
apartment building Feb. 4, 1999, hitting him 19 times, testified that they
thought Diallo had a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said he still recalls calling Diallo's father after the shooting
from his City Hall office to tell him that the police officers ``had made a
terrible mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt the kind of pain for him as I would feel if I lost one of my own
children,'' Giuliani said. ``I wish we could go back and undo what happened to
him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel terrible for the Diallo family,'' Giuliani said. ``But I also have
strong feelings about what was done to the police officers in this case.''
</P>
<P>
	   The police could do a better job of understanding the cultural differences
in a city with ``the most diverse population in the world,'' he said, but added,
no one else has ever done the job better.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That doesn't mean they don't make terrible, horrific mistakes,'' Giuliani
said. ``It doesn't mean some of them aren't criminals who have to go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the verdict was read, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of
Diallo's apartment building, some yelling ``Murderers!'' and other complaining
that the verdicts told police that violence against blacks and Hispanics would
go unpunished. Fifteen protesters were arrested.

<HEADLINE> Pope Urges Tolerance at Mount Sinai  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN MURPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. CATHERINE, Egypt (AP) -- Realizing a personal dream of making a biblical
pilgrimage, Pope John Paul II prayed Saturday for religious tolerance in a
simple tree-shaded garden under the peak revered as the place where Moses
received the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit to Mount Sinai was the highlight of his trip to Egypt and the
first major stop of his planned millennium travels to biblical sites. It drew
strongly on the ancient religious legacy of the land. It also pointed out the
contemporary obstacles to the pope's appeal for unity among Christians and with
other faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   Doing as millions of pilgrims before him, the pope entered the
1,500-year-old Monastery of St. Catherine and prayed for 10 minutes before the
thorny evergreen that the monks revere as the remnants of the burning bush that
the Bible says was used by God to summon Moses and ask him to lead the
Israelites to the Promised Land. The pope softly spoke the words God told Moses:
``I am who I am.''
</P>
<P>
	   The pontiff also performed a traditional rite before the remains of St.
Catherine of Alexandria, who converted to Christianity in the 4th century and
was beheaded for directly accusing the Roman emperor of idolatry. The pope
removed his ring and placed it over the finger bones and upon the skull before
returning it to his own finger.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope, at the end of a three-day trip to Egypt, said he had finally
joined the other pilgrims who have walked ``in the footsteps of God.'' Next
month, the pontiff is scheduled to visit Jerusalem, Bethlehem and other places
in Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
	   He flew back to Cairo later Saturday and from there flew to Rome after being
seen off by President Hosni Mubarak and religious leaders from Egypt and
elsewhere in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   The ailing, 79-year-old pope appeared to draw strength from the stark
surroundings of sawtooth summits reaching above 6,600 feet and yellow-ochre
outcrops sculpted smooth and round by the wind about 200 miles southeast of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   His spirits were high, even playful. Examining a gold bejeweled crown that
was among the monastery's treasures, he said: ``You needed a hard head to wear
that.''
</P>
<P>
	   His voice grew strong and clear as he spoke to about 1,500 people about the
need for understanding and dialogue ``between the followers of the great
monotheistic religions'' -- Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I pray that in the new millennium the Monastery of St. Catherine will be a
radiant beacon calling the churches to know one another better and to rediscover
the importance in the eyes of God of the things that unite us in Christ,'' the
pope told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   But the head of the Greek Orthodox monastery, Archbishop Damianos, declined
to pray alongside the pope because of ecclesiastical differences dating from the
split of the Vatican and Orthodox churches nearly 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Damianos also insisted Roman Catholics must make the greater concessions --
a significantly different message than the strong calls for brotherhood from
Muslim and Coptic Christian leaders during earlier meetings in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   The Roman Catholic pope once exercised authority over all Christendom, and
still claims to do so. At an ecumenical prayer service in Cairo Friday, the pope
repeated an offer to discuss the Roman Catholic primacy, but did not elaborate
on what powers he would be willing to relinquish.
</P>
<P>
	   The Orthodox reception was nonetheless gracious and stood in contrast to
snubs of the pope by some Orthodox groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope also had hoped to bring Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders
together at Mount Sinai, but the plan didn't materialize and Vatican officials
haven't given an explanation. Bishop Makarios, an Egyptian Catholic, said the
pope is first seeking ``to prepare the minds'' -- implying that the climate
wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those gathered outside the monastery were many refugees from religious
tension in neighboring Sudan. Christian and animist rebels in southern Sudan
have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy from the Arab, Muslim-dominated
government in the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good the pope speaks about religious tolerance, but as you can see
I'm far from my home because some people do not listen to this message,'' said
Natale Ali, 37, who fled the southern Sudanese town of Wau in 1998.

<HEADLINE> NATO Tries To Ease Kosovo Tensions  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The commander of the NATO-led
peacekeeping force on Saturday assured Serbs in this ethnically divided Kosovo
town that his troops want to protect them to avoid ``another exodus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt of Germany met with local Serbs in Kosovska Mitrovica,
where violence escalated recently between the ethnic communities segregated on
opposite banks of the Ibar River. At least nine people have been killed and
dozens injured in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Reinhardt told townspeople that the peacekeeping force ``is here to protect
you, to prevent another exodus of Serbs. ... The situation will be better, and
the key thing is that it's in your interest and in my interest to keep all of
you here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in Kosovska Mitrovica, Sven Erik Larsen, the regional head of U.N.
police, complained about a lack of manpower and equipment and the absence of a
functioning judicial system for his men to carry out normal police work.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 17,000 Serbs, including about 6,000 who fled here from other
parts of Kosovo, live on the north bank and in the hinterlands to the north and
west of the industrial and mining city.
</P>
<P>
	   About 70 ethnic Albanian families have now registered their wish to return
to their homes in the northern part of the town, and Albanian community leader
Bajram Rexhepi will meet with officials on Monday to discuss their return.
</P>
<P>
	   But every day, many Serbs wait at the northern edge of the main bridge over
the Ibar, waiting to do battle with the ethnic Albanians if they try to cross
into the Serb part of the city. For many Serbs, defense of the bridge means the
difference between remaining in their homeland or being forced into an uncertain
life in the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``KFOR is not here to throw you out. KFOR is here to ensure that you can
stay here. ... My forces are here to help you and you know that,'' Reinhardt
told the crowd, using the acronym of the Kosovo Force under his command.
</P>
<P>
	   Reinhardt was scheduled to meet the chief leader of the Serb community in
Mitrovica, Oliver Ivanovic, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, in the provincial capital Pristina, a fire raging all night
destroyed the city's landmark sports center, firefighters said Saturday. No one
was injured, and the cause of the blaze was unclear.

<HEADLINE> Anger, determination in wake of Diallo verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Anger and frustration seethed in parts of the city
Saturday as New Yorkers struggled to absorb news that the four police officers
who killed an African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets were acquitted of all
criminal charges.
<P>
	   Many of the 350 people who crammed into the Rev. Al Sharpton's National
Action Network headquarters in Harlem for an emotional rally a day after the
verdicts expressed fury that Amadou Diallo's death had gone unpunished.
</P>
<P>
	   "Murderers!" they shouted. "Racist cops!" "We want justice!"
</P>
<P>
	   But a hush fell over the packed room when Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo,
approached the podium. As she began to thank the audience in a soft voice for
the support they had given her family, listeners cried out "Thank you!" and "We
love you!"
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Diallo said that after sitting through nearly a month of trial
testimony and arguments, she still could not understand why her son died. The
defense argument that her son's actions had drawn the officers' attention and
led them to believe he had a gun caused her particular anguish, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The crime that they committed is to consider my son suspicious," she said.
"That was the first crime. ... Our whole family are wondering why they said that
everything that happened was because of Amadou's fault. Because we know he was a
nice kid."
</P>
<P>
	   Most painful, she said, was listening to graphic medical testimony that
focused on the timing of her son's 19 bullet wounds, the nature of his injuries
and the possibility that he might have remained standing through much of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Although frustrated by the acquittals, she expressed hope that some good
might come of her son's death if it inspired people to fight against police
brutality and improve understanding between police and citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's about justice," she said. "Nothing can replace Amadou, ... but if his
cause can help clarify this situation, ... so that the people can live in peace,
I think that would be a great honor for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Many at the rally - where speakers included Rep. Charles Rangel, Rep. Jose
Serrano, Sharpton and New York Civil Liberties Union executive director Norman
Siegel - echoed Mrs. Diallo's assertion that her son was a victim of racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton vowed to press on with legal action in the case, calling for
federal criminal civil rights charges against the officers and saying he hoped
Diallo's death would help improve the way police forces deal with black and
Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to use this Amadou Diallo case to stop this in these United
States once and for all," he said. "Just like we needed the federal government
to come into Alabama and Mississippi 30 years ago, we need the federal
government to come into New York to deal with the police today."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton compared the case to the 1991 videotaped beating of black Los
Angeles motorist Rodney King, where federal prosecutors won convictions of two
officers. If federal charges were appropriate in that case, where no shots were
fired, they were even more necessary in Diallo's death, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was Rodney King multiplied by lead," he shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton announced plans for a Sunday rally at the United Nations and
another demonstration Thursday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, more than 200 people gathered in midtown Manhattan to
protest. And outside Diallo's Bronx home, where several hundred gathered after
the verdicts were announced, 50 or so people milled, burning with indignation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a different set of justice, some for us, some for them," said a man
who lived in Diallo's neighborhood and identified himself only as Lamarr H.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I say us, I mean people of color," he continued. "Somebody has to pay
for this. If not, it's like saying 'Anytime you feel threatened by a black man,
you shoot first and you ask questions later.' I'm feeling the pain. I'm feeling
all the anger. ... That could have been me."
</P>
<P>
	   In Harlem, Rangel said the officers never would have shot Diallo if he'd
been white, but he assured Kadiatou Diallo that her son's death would not be for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This man died so that we can have a better America," said the congressman.

	   Washington forced the women into his car at gunpoint, drove to a remote
location, shot them and then raped, prosecutors said at his 1995 trial. One
witness testified that Washington had said he wanted to infect as many women as
he could because his former girlfriend had given him HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   But fearing lawsuits for breach of privacy by Washington's family members,
state corrections officials would only say he died from ``natural causes.''
Georgia Department of Corrections spokesman Scott Stallings said that all

	   Newton was told Washington had AIDS by Augusta's district attorney.	  
Victims advocates say the specter of AIDS makes it hard for women to recover
after an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rape produces post-traumatic stress syndrome, and if you can't put some
distance between yourself and the attack, it will never go away,'' Flowers said.
``And the longer possibility of AIDS just keeps hanging there, so will the
effects of the attack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Baxley, 44, was attacked by Washington in 1993 and has been tested
three times since then. All have turned up negative, but she still can't shake
the fear of contracting HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I might have escaped dying the first time, but there's no telling if it
will come back around again.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Rally Around Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rallying around one of their own, Republican governors
say they're confident in their colleague from Texas, even as they brim with free
advice for George W. Bush's struggling presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In town for their winter meeting, GOP governors gave Bush early and powerful
backing -- even before he declared he was running. That support helped rally the
Republican establishment around the Texas governor as the party's best chance
for taking back the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, in the face of Sen. John McCain's unexpectedly strong challenge,
governors show no sign of bolting. They say Bush has made mistakes but argue he
has time to correct them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're a pretty solid bunch. Once they're on board, they're on for the
long haul,'' said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, where Bush lost a hard-fought
race with McCain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush obviously will have to right himself, and he will,'' Gov. Mike
Leavitt, R-Utah, chairman of the National Governors' Association, said Saturday.
``It yet will turn out the way we want it to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Governors of both parties are meeting this weekend with an agenda filled
with policy issues. But politics tops the unwritten agenda, particularly for
Republicans, who are watching Bush try to regain his footing as McCain shreds
the assumption that Bush's nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic governors are relishing the intense GOP fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just absolutely delighted that the Republicans are having the
opportunity to discuss all their shortcomings,'' said Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton.
``I just hope they go right down to the wire. It looks like they are.''
</P>
<P>
	   From Republican governors, advice ranged from staying focused to allowing
them to carry more of the campaign's message.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Set the rules, but let us do it our way at home,'' said Gov. Ed Schafer of
North Dakota, chairman of the Republican Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota's primary is Tuesday, but Schafer can't figure out why he
hasn't been more involved in the Bush campaign. ``How come I'm not doing a radio
spot encouraging people to go out and vote, and using my image or my trust or
whatever I have with the voters to spread the Bush message?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Schafer plans to deliver a cautionary message to his colleagues. Too many
governors assumed that it was enough to turn over lists of party activists and
volunteers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's entire operation has been second-guessed since he lost primaries in
Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday. Supporters questioned, among other things,
spending $1 million on ads in Arizona, McCain's home turf. And Connecticut Gov.
John Rowland bluntly said that it was stupid to visit Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, which lost its tax exempt status for failing to admit blacks and
whose namesake once labeled the Catholic Church a ``satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like other GOP governors, New Jersey's Christine Todd Whitman is confident
Bush will win the GOP nomination. But she worries that the visit to Bob Jones
University and other efforts to appeal to the most conservative voters will come
back to bite Bush in the general election, when candidates will be fighting for
voters in the political center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to put together a coalition that can win in
the fall,'' Whitman said. ``It can be dangerous if you start to marginalize
yourself in any way.'' Asked if Bush has done just that, she said: ``I don't
think that's happened in any kind of irretrievable way.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, governors say, these controversies, along with constant
bickering over which candidate is most guilty of negative campaigning, have
distracted Bush from his core messages on taxes, education and opportunity for
all.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush lost Michigan, Schafer said, ``because we were fighting about who said
what first and who hit who first in the sandbox.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign may be getting the message, Engler said. He applauded the move
late this week to have Virginia's Gov. Jim Gilmore talk about the McCain camp's
phone calls to voters suggesting that Bush is anti-Catholic, freeing Bush to
talk about his core issues. Still, Bush talked more about those calls on Friday,
again denouncing McCain for them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our message to him,'' Leavitt said, ``is to stay focused on his message of
reform and not to get caught up in the sidebar stories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then again, he remembered in 1996 when Republican nominee Bob Dole met with
the 17 Republican governors, each of whom took a turn at offering advice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By the time you got around to all 17, there' s just no way he could have
even remembered all the advice, let alone accepted it,'' Leavitt said. ``We're
probably compulsive advice givers. We can't stop ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Cops Suspended for Haircut Arrest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The city suspended three police supervisors who charged
an 11-year-old girl with assault and weapons violations for using a pair of
scissors to cut a lock of another girl's hair.
</P>
<P>
	   After the mother of the girl whose hair was cut filed a complaint, Raquyda
Nichole Harris was arrested Thursday, handcuffed and held for two hours until
she was released to her mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that the officers involved did not follow proper procedures
and the complaint did not warrant the actions of the officers involved,'' said
police Director Joseph Santiago.
</P>
<P>
	   Santiago extended ``sincere regrets'' to the Harris family. Lt. Gary D.
Vickers, Sgt. Noemio Oliveria and Sgt. Amilkar Velez were suspended Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident occurred Tuesday during a gym class at the Rafael Hernandez
school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were sitting in gym, and these girls were telling me to cut her hair,''
Raquyda said. ``One girl gave me the scissors and I cut a little bit of her
hair. It was just a joke.''
</P>
<P>
	   Raquyda was suspended from school for five days.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Society Using Ads To Educate  </HEADLINE>
    By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The American Cancer Society has launched an aggressive $12
million ad campaign in an effort to convince the public it does more than drum
up donations for research.
</P>
<P>
	   But some critics, while they support the nonprofit agency's efforts, say the
money would be better spent helping patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACS is using about 2 percent of the donations it takes in annually to
pay for the campaign, which began Feb. 15 and runs through March. That's a
considerable amount, epecially for a nonprofit organization, said Dean Krugman,
a University of Georgia advertising professor.
</P>
<P>
	   ACS already enjoys widespread name recognition. A May 1998 Gallup poll
showed 96 percent of Americans recognize the organization's name.
</P>
<P>
	   But the same poll found that only 5 percent of about 1,000 adults surveyed
know what the Atlanta-based organization does.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a deep understanding that we fund research," ACS vice president
Greg Donaldson said. "There's a lack of clarity around the fact that we do so
much more."
</P>
<P>
	   The ACS wants to highlight community programs that perform services such as
encouraging women to get mammograms and men to have prostate-cancer screenings.
</P>
<P>
	   The nationwide ads, which include billboards and radio and television spots,
are themed "Hope. Progress. Answers." They promote the ACS' toll-free hotline
and Web site, selling the organization as a source of unbiased cancer
information and comfort for patients.
</P>
<P>
	   By purchasing ad time, the ACS can ensure that its message will be aired
during times when a large audience is watching. Relying on public-service
announcement time would put that control in the hands of TV stations.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've done a lot of great things for a lot of years, but the criticism is
basically that they could do a lot more good if they spent their money a little
differently," said Thomas DiLorenzo, an economics professor at Loyola College in
Maryland. "That money could have been spent helping individual patients."
</P>
<P>
	   DiLorenzo's book "Unhealthy Charities: Hazards to Your Health and Wealth"
depicts the ACS as a money-hungry organization that spends donor money meant for
patients on administration and real estate.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACS raised more than $556 million in fiscal year 1998, according to
organization records.
</P>
<P>
	   It spent about $100 million each on research and prevention, about $70
million on detection and about $85 million on patient services. The company
reported it spent roughly $140 million on administration and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. John Kelly, ACS' national chairman of the board, said informing the
public of specific programs is crucial to the organization's goal of reducing
cancer deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not something that the American Cancer Society can wave a magic
wand and have happen," he said. "We need to make them aware what they can expect
at the community level."
</P>
<P>
	   The goal isn't to solicit donations but to educate the public about what it
does, ACS officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly, who said his organization is more efficient than ever, said the ads
are already a success.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has generated a kind of excitement that I have never seen," Kelly said.
"I think the American public will thank us."

<HEADLINE> Ex-President Bush Leaves Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By MEGAN K. STACK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Former President George Bush checked out of the hospital
Saturday after spending a second night undergoing tests for an irregular
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, 75, was discharged from Methodist Hospital about 9:30 a.m., said his
spokeswoman, Jean Becker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was released in good condition. He was walking under his own power and
in good spirits,'' said hospital spokesman Denny Angelle..
</P>
<P>
	   Bush made no statement on his departure, but Dr. Ben Orman, his personal
physician, said the former president continues to be treated with medication for
an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is in excellent health overall,'' Orman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush went directly to his Houston office to catch up on some work and read
some e-mail, said Becker. ``Then, he'll take the rest of the weekend off.''
</P>
<P>
	   He planned to return to his office Monday before leaving Tuesday on an
overseas trip, Becker said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was cheerful when he checked into the hospital on Friday, joking that
his condition was ``much ado about not much.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had complained Thursday afternoon about lightheadedness at a photo
opportunity in Naples, Fla. He spent the night at Naples Community Hospital,
where he underwent tests and was given intravenous blood thinners and other
medication, before checking in at Methodist.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors had said they will investigate whether the condition is being caused
by Bush's thyroid disorder, called Graves' disease. The disease was blamed for a
similar episode Bush suffered while jogging in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   The irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation, happens when the
upper chambers of the heart contract extremely rapidly -- meaning they don't
pump blood properly into the heart's lower chambers, which themselves speed up
as they struggle to pump blood out of the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush recently has campaigned for his son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is
seeking the Republican presidential nomination.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Case Isn't Over Yet  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY McSHANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- With a cascade of 24 ``not guiltys,'' the Amadou Diallo
murder trial ended in an upstate New York courtroom. But the highly publicized
case, with its overtones of racism and police brutality, promises to linger long
past the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting joined Howard Beach, Bensonhurst and Abner Louima as shorthand
for racial problems in the nation's largest city. Protests began almost
immediately after Diallo died Feb. 4, 1999, with movie stars, politicians and
protesters lining up to get arrested outside Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, by four white
police officers will echo in the way that the New York Police Department
identifies possible suspects. And the firing of 41 shots in Diallo's cramped
apartment house vestibule will likely be relived in a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal investigation is already underway, and departmental charges
against the officers, who remain on the job, are also possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The case looms as a likely issue in this year's U.S. Senate race between
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who made a misstep
by calling the Diallo case a ``tragic murder'' before the trial began.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, most of the major party presidential candidates and others felt
compelled to issue statements after Friday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This news reopens the wounds of distrust,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said.
``And the healing process that had begun turns to mourning once again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other New York City communities have drawn national attention for racial
strife, including Bensonhurst, where a black youth was killed by a white mob in
1989, and Howard Beach, where a gang of whites attacked a black man in 1986,
chasing him onto a highway where he was killed by a car. In the summer of 1997,
Haitian immigrant Abner Louima was sodomized with a broomstick in a Brooklyn
police station.
</P>
<P>
	   The Diallo case drew attention around the country and the world. Even as
protesters rallied Saturday in the Bronx, people in Diallo's native Guinea were
questioning the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's inexplicable,'' said Alhassane Camara, a pharmacist in the Guinea
capital of Conakry.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Justice Department officials were reviewing the case for a
possible federal civil rights trial, much like the Rodney King case in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Worth, attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, said Saturday that the
officers wanted to meet with officials from the federal civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to ask them to come to a speedy resolution on the case,'' Worth
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Diallo shooting also focused attention on the police department's Street
Crime Unit, an elite group of investigators whose unofficial motto was ``We own
the night.'' Critics have charged -- and a report from the state attorney
general indicated -- that racial profiling is a factor in the NYPD's
stop-and-frisk operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Diallo's family have said they will file a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit against the city, charging that he was a victim of illegal racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not the end,'' said Diallo family attorney Anthony Gair.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings will linger forever with the four acquitted officers:
McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy. They must live every
day with the knowledge that they killed an unarmed man.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Time will tell,'' Worth said of the four. ``They have to make a decision
on whether they even want to be cops anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Approval of Arms Treaty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin urged Russian parliament
leaders Saturday to ratify the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty, which
lawmakers have balked at approving since it was signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin discussed the treaty during a three-hour meeting with the party
leaders in parliament, and urged them to hold debate on START II at this
spring's session, Russian news reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of two of the parties, Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces, have
said they would support ratification.
</P>
<P>
	   The Communists, parliament's largest party, long frustrated Boris Yeltsin by
refusing to approve it, saying it threatens Russia's security. But the
Communists lost several allies in parliament in December elections, and the
pro-government party Unity won the second-largest number of seats, encouraging
hopes for START-II ratification.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord halves U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to 3,000 to 3,500
warheads each. It was signed by both countries' presidents in 1993 and ratified
by the U.S. Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin and the parliament leaders also discussed Chechnya. Putin reiterated
that peace talks were unlikely because there were no feasible Chechen
negotiating partners, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting also addressed introducing open land sales -- seen as a key
stage in democratic reforms -- and the beleaguered Russian military.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin is the clear front-runner among 11 candidates for March 26
presidential elections. He launched his election campaign Friday with promises
to build a strong state, combat crime, streamline the government and lower
taxes.

   SILVERPLUME, Colo. (AP) -- Deputies say as long as stupidity is not a crime
they won't charge college students who use skis and snowboards to jump over
traffic on mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathon Soquet, 20, of Boulder, this week suffered minor injuries when he
crashed into a snow embankment while jumping Highway 6. He and other students
had built a jump along a slope about 40 feet above the highway. The have to fly
60 feet to clear the road.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know exactly what we'd charge them with -- other than stupidity --
but I'm sure there's a chargable offense in there,'' said sheriff's Capt. Derek
Woodman. ``The sheriff says we could charge them for not having a pilot's
license.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Colorado State Patrol, which has jurisdiction over traffic issues,
doesn't plan to file charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it would have involved a vehicle, all of them would have been cited,
more than likely, for reckless endangerment,'' said trooper Jason Manspeaker.
``We'll let it be a learning experience and hope that other people would learn
from the mishap.''
</P>
<P>
	   Manspeaker said Thursday's injury was the second time troopers had been
called to the same spot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said at one point in time, there were almost 50 people watching,''
Manspeaker said. ``They said they had watchouts for traffic, but either way, as
we found out, it's real dangerous.''

<HEADLINE> Sharpton Seen As NYC's Black Leader  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA DE LA CRUZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A decade ago, the Rev. Al Sharpton leaped into the
spotlight with his allegations that a group of white men raped black teen-ager
Tawana Brawley, stirring controversy and prompting the political establishment
to keep its distance.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Sharpton is often seen as a respected leader of New York's black
community. And he has been a constant fixture in the case of the police killing
of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo, often appearing with the victim's parents
before Friday's acquittal of four officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, still known for quick punch lines and his pompadour hairdo, is now
being courted by mainstream political heavyweights such as first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   But has he really changed? Sharpton himself thinks so, saying he's been
trying for years to forge closer ties with people outside the black community.
Sharpton was not immediately available for an interview Saturday, but in a
conversation last year with The Associated Press, he spoke of how he's modeled
himself after his mentor and friend, the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pattern of my life is almost the same as his,'' Sharpton said. ``He
grew from a controversial activist ... to becoming a presidential candidate and
a major force in the Democratic party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others say Sharpton, 45, is still as bombastic and divisive as ever.
</P>
<P>
	   What's changed about Sharpton is the way he's been portrayed by the media,
said Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The turning point was 1992, when Sharpton first ran for office, seeking the
Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, said Meyers.
</P>
<P>
	   That was four years after he charged that a group of white men raped
Brawley. A grand jury eventually concluded that Brawley's story of abduction and
rape was a hoax, perhaps concocted to avoid punishment for staying out late. And
in 1998, a jury ordered Sharpton to pay $65,000 to the former prosecutor he
accused of being among the alleged rapists.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning with the 1992 campaign, Sharpton was seen in a different light,
Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And ever since then, the media has resurrected him, reinvented him and
recycled him,'' Meyers said. ``The media needs Al Sharpton. He's the stereotype
of a black leader. He's a boisterous, noisy guy, quick with a quip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meyers, who is black, does not believe Sharpton is the ``leader'' of the
black community in New York. And he says the majority of black residents agree
with him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They see Al Sharpton as a media creation, which he is,'' Meyers said. ``He
doesn't represent the point of view of the majority of blacks, Latinos, whites,
most New Yorkers. Who elected Al Sharpton the black leader? Who?''
</P>
<P>
	   During the recent debate between Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley at
Harlem's Apollo Theatre, Sharpton was given the honor of asking the first
question.
</P>
<P>
	   But Meyers believes Sharpton won't help any political candidate with the
black vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it may very well help sink their ship,'' he said. ``When they
misunderstand and misread black people as they do in the terms of thinking Al
Sharpton is the black peoples' representative, I think black people reject that
and see it as pandering.''

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Balloonist Kevin Uliassi descended nearly 10,000 feet over
the mid-Atlantic on Saturday to get on course in his effort to make the first
solo hot air balloon trip around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi dropped his balloon from 24,000 feet to 14,800 feet to avoid an air
current that would take him too far south, said his spokesman, Peter Fay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he stayed at his original altitude, he would be swung toward South
America, rather than remaining on course for Africa,'' Fay said. Scott Lorenz,
another spokesman, said Uliassi will probably reach Mauritania on the African
coast by Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lorenz said Uliassi was south of the Tropic of Cancer and moving towards
Africa at 34 mph Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi, 36, an engineer and architect from Scottsdale, Ariz., has traveled
more than 4,000 miles since leaving Tuesday from his native Illinois. He hopes
to complete the journey in 14 to 20 days.

<HEADLINE> 3 Americans Die in Guatemala Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Three U.S. tourists died and the American pilot was
injured when their plane crashed in eastern Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
	   The single-engine Cessna nose-dived Friday into a river as it was making its
descent into the airport in Izabel state, said rescuer Williams de Leon. The
plane took off from Guatemala City, 110 miles northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot, identified as Steven Hecht, reported having trouble with the
aircraft's steering mechanism, media reports said. De Leon said Hecht was in a
hospital Saturday afternoon, but his condition was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   Byron Chacon said he saw the plane's wheels strike a tree, sending it
nose-diving into the Rio Dulce.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was going to a tourist area in eastern Guatemala, said Chacon,
mayor of Livingston, a hamlet near the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims were identified as the pilot's wife, 50-year-old Robin Hecht,
Frank Hazard, 47, and Florens Winton, 50.

   MONROE, La. (AP) -- A woman convicted of abusing three of her eight children
has been ordered to undergo medical sterilization or face 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Kathy Looney, 29, of Monroe, has proved she cannot raise or care for
children, District Judge Carl V. Sharp said Friday as he issued a 10-year
suspended sentence and place Looney on five years of probation.
</P>

	   Looney was convicted of three counts of cruelty to juveniles for beating the
children -- ages 6, 7 and 10 -- with an extension cord. She missed three
sentencing dates, once so she could give birth to her eighth child. She no
longer has custody of any of her children.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Missing Reporter in Russian Custody  </HEADLINE>
   By NABI ABDULAYEV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Radio Liberty reporter Andrei Babitsky, whose
disappearance in Chechnya prompted international concern, said in television
footage aired Saturday that he had traded himself into Chechen hands in exchange
for Russian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky looked weary but spoke clearly and confidently in the interrogation
conducted Friday by a Russian officer in Makhachkala, the capital of the Russian
republic of Dagestan, on Chechnya's eastern border.
</P>
<P>
	   After not contacting family or colleagues for weeks, Babitsky turned up
Friday in Makhachkala when he was detained for having a forged Azerbaijani
passport, Dagestan Interior Minister Adilgerei Magomedtagirov told reporters
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky, who is Russian, said he used the fake passport because ``I had no
other documents, and I was afraid to reveal my location.'' He did not say who or
what he was afraid of.
</P>
<P>
	   He was charged with document forgery, Russian news reports said. He was
being held at Dagestan's Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's reporting from the rebels' side of the war has angered Russian
officials. He was detained by federal forces in Chechnya in January, after which
Russia said it exchanged him for two Russian prisoners captured by Chechens.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky said on the tape, shown on state-run RTR television, that a Russian
official came to see him Jan. 31 at a Russian detention camp in the Chechen town
of Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said that Chechen field commander Turpal Atgeriyev ... was ready to
exchange me for Russian servicemen,'' Babitsky said, smoking heavily. ``I
thought for 10 minutes, then agreed, since I knew Atgeriyev.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official promised that Atgeriyev would then release him, Babitsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Radio Liberty correspondent Oleg Kusov said Saturday that, when the
exchange took place on Feb. 3, Babitsky realized he was being handed not to
Atgeriyev, but to masked Chechens he did not know. He tried to protest but it
was too late, said Kusov, who was staying with Babitsky at the Interior Ministry
in Makhachkala. Babitsky went into Chechen custody for weeks, during which time
family and friends feared he was dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have denied any wrongdoing, and insisted that the swap
took place on Babitsky's free will.

<HEADLINE> Anger Seethes After Diallo Verdict  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Anger and frustration seethed in parts of the city Saturday
as New Yorkers struggled with the acquittal of four white police officers who
killed an unarmed African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Amadou Diallo's mother told a crowd in Harlem she hoped her son's death
would inspire people to fight against police brutality and improve understanding
between police and civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about justice,'' Kadiatou Diallo said a day after the verdicts.
``Nothing can replace Amadou, ... but if his cause can help clarify this
situation, ... so that the people can live in peace, I think that would be a
great honor for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 people gathered in midtown Manhattan to protest the verdicts.
And 50 or so people gathered Saturday outside Diallo's Bronx home, where several
hundred had demonstrated after the verdicts were announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The same indignation was evident in many of the 350 people who crammed into
the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters in Harlem for an
emotional rally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Murderers!'' they shouted. ``Racist cops!'' ``We want justice!''
</P>
<P>
	   But a hush fell over the packed room when Diallo's mother approached the
podium. As she thanked the audience in a soft voice for the support they had
given her family, listeners cried out ``Thank you!'' and ``We love you!''
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo said that after sitting through nearly a month of trial testimony and
arguments, she still could not understand why her son died. The defense argument
that her son's actions had drawn the officers' attention and led them to believe
he had a gun caused her particular anguish, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crime that they committed is to consider my son suspicious,'' she
said. ``That was the first crime. ... Our whole family are wondering why they
said that everything that happened was because of Amadou's fault. Because we
know he was a nice kid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most painful, she said, was listening to graphic medical testimony that
focused on the timing of her son's 19 bullet wounds, the nature of his injuries
and the possibility that he might have remained standing through much of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Many at the rally -- where speakers included Democratic U.S. Reps Charles
Rangel and Jose Serrano, Sharpton and New York Civil Liberties Union executive
director Norman Siegel -- echoed Diallo's mother's assertion that her son was a
victim of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton promised to press on with legal action in the case, calling for
federal criminal civil rights charges against the officers and saying he hoped
Diallo's death would help improve the way police forces deal with black and
Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to use this Amadou Diallo case to stop this in these United
States once and for all,'' he said. ``Just like we needed the federal government
to come into Alabama and Mississippi 30 years ago, we need the federal
government to come into New York to deal with the police today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton compared the case to the 1991 videotaped beating of black Los
Angeles motorist Rodney King, where federal prosecutors won convictions of two
officers. If federal charges were appropriate in that case, where no shots were
fired, they were even more necessary in Diallo's death, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was Rodney King multiplied by lead,'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton announced plans for a Sunday rally at the United Nations and
another demonstration Thursday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said the officers never would have shot Diallo if he'd been white,
but he assured Kadiatou Diallo that her son's death would not be for nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This man died so that we can have a better America,'' Rangel said.

<HEADLINE> Settlement gives Summit boy burned near NJ Transit tracks $2.4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - A jury has awarded the family of a Summit boy
severely burned in an explosion near NJ Transit railroad tracks $2.4 million.
<P>
	   Brandon Shea, now a Summit High School junior, was burned in August 1996
while he was on an unsecured catwalk over electrical equipment. His attorney,
Raymond Gill, said the boy suffered second- and third-degree burns from an
explosion, and will need more surgery as he grows older.
</P>
<P>
	   NJ Transit claimed Shea had dropped something onto wires that caused the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors in the case, which was heard this week before Superior Court Judge
William Wertheimer, were asked to determine whether the equipment site was
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
	   Gill said it was overgrown with trees and had no fences or warning signs.
</P>
<P>
	   He said police heard the explosion and came to the boy's aid, putting out a
fire caused by 27,500 volts of electricity that surged through his body. After
the flames were extinguished, the boy "spontaneously ignited" two more times,
Gill said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shea spent 20 days at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, where he
underwent skin grafts.
</P>
<P>
	   He said local kids used the catwalk as a short cut from one side of the
tracks to the other, and also sat there frequently to watch trains go by.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush Leads McCain Nationally  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a bad day last Tuesday, George W. Bush is
maintaining large approval margins among Republicans nationally and in
all-important California, polls showed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   They also suggest that Arizona Sen. John McCain, Bush's main rival for the
GOP presidential nomination, may face trouble in coming primaries if he relies
too heavily on Democrats and independents, whose votes gave him victories over
Bush in New Hampshire and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday was McCain's biggest day of the campaign so far: He won not only the
Michigan primary but the one in his home state of Arizona as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Among likely Republican voters in California's primary, a Time/CNN poll
found Bush leading 48 percent to 23 percent. McCain held a slight but
statistically insignificant edge over the Texas governor among Democrats and
people without declared party preferences, but only registered Republicans'
votes will count in the GOP race anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll also found that California Republican voters, when asked which of
the two they thought was more likely to win the primary, 60 percent said Bush
and 25 percent McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   California, the star of the 13-state ``Super Tuesday'' voting exercise on
March 7, awards the winner 162 delegates to this summer's national convention to
nominate a candidate. Both Bush and McCain are stepping up their campaigns in
the state, with McCain emphasizing his conservative Republican credentials to
broaden his base within the party.
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek magazine poll found Bush enjoying a 56 percent to 27 percent lead
nationally among registered Republicans and those likely to vote Republican. It
found that 62 percent expected Bush to win the presidential election, down from
73 percent in the last poll in early February, compared with 27 percent for
McCain, 8 percentage points above last month's.
</P>
<P>
	   And statistics sure to give McCain pause: Only 5 percent of Democratic
voters say they will vote or have voted in a Republican primary or caucus, and
independents likely to vote in GOP primaries favored Bush by 50 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Time/CNN poll involved 1,009 likely California primary voters, contacted
Thursday and Friday, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage
points. Newsweek surveyed 750 people on the same two days, with an error margin
of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Another poll, by ABC News, found that despite McCain's surge in prominence
of recent weeks, two-thirds of Americans still know little about him.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a fourth of Americans consider McCain a conservative, while almost half
view him as a moderate and another fourth view him as either a liberal or don't
know where he stands. McCain says he is a conservative, and his voting record in
many areas has been conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   And while McCain's moderate image has given him problems drawing Republican
support, he shows great potential for crossover votes, with four in 10 Democrats
and liberals alike saying they would seriously consider supporting him. Just
over half of Americans, 51 percent, say the more they hear about McCain the more
they like him, while a third disagreed with that statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC national poll of 509 adults was taken Thursday and has an error
margin of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Students using state-issued calculators during
crucial achievement tests got incorrect answers when math problems were entered
too quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   School officials in Palm Beach County reported problems with Casio HS-10
calculators during the recent Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests. And
teachers in other counties got wrong answers when asked by The Palm Beach Post
to test some equations.

</P>
<P>
	   Casio officials in Trenton, N.J., said they would investigate.
</P>
<P>
	   About 17,500 middle and high school students used the state-issued
calculators during the FCAT. Students are not allowed to use their own
calculators.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Palm Beach County math teachers said they discovered the problem before
the test and warned students.
</P>
<P>
	   State education officials don't believe overall test scores will be
affected. The test scores are used to determine state funding for schools.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Envoy Defies Departure Order  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Cuban diplomat ignored a State Department demand that
he leave the country and proclaimed himself on a hunger strike Saturday to
contest allegations linking him with a U.S. immigration official charged with
spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have been absolutely cleared
of the accusations brought against me,'' said Jose Imperatori, 46, less than
three hours before the State Department's deadline for him to leave the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadline passed, and the Clinton administration had no official
reaction. But an official familiar with the case suggested that swift action
will be taken against Imperatori, although the official would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   This past week, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Imperatori
could be subject to arrest once his diplomatic immunity had expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori met with reporters at his apartment in a suburban Maryland
neighborhood that is home to all the small number of Cuban diplomats assigned to
Washington. His decision not to return came as no surprise, as Cuban officials
signaled all week they had no intention of abiding by the deportation order.
</P>
<P>
	   The impasse once again underscored the palpable mistrust between the two
governments, which seems to increase with time.
</P>
<P>
	   A gaunt man, Imperatori spoke in a loud, clear voice and with indignation
about his supposed illicit links with Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born 34-year
veteran of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who has been charged with
spying.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was introduced to reporters by Kurt Schmoke, a former mayor of
Baltimore who has been retained by the Cuban government to defend the diplomat.
After his remarks, Imperatori refused to take questions. Schmoke said his client
planned a liquids-only diet until his name is cleared.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at a separate news conference, Fernando Remirez, head of Cuba's
diplomatic mission, acknowledged that Imperatori had maintained contacts with
Faget but said they were no different from the kinds of aboveboard relationships
the Cuban mission maintains with many Cuban-Americans and other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   At 7 a.m. EST Saturday, Imperatori gave Remirez his resignation as consular
affairs officer, leaving him without diplomatic immunity 6 1/2 hours before the
official deadline of 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife and 3-year old son left for Cuba Friday night, as they would have
been stripped of diplomatic immunity as well by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Imperatori and Remirez were adamant in their insistence that the Cuban
Interests Section does not engage in spying and is used solely for improving
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have become the victim of a major slander,'' Imperatori said. ``The
accusation against me is totally false.''
</P>
<P>
	   Remirez also joined Imperatori in maintaining that there was a direct link
between the timing of Faget's arrest and the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez,
the six-year old Cuban who arrived unaccompanied in South Florida on Nov. 25.
Faget was arrested a few days before a scheduled court hearing on the Gonzalez
case, which was later postponed. The State Department has dismissed speculation
of such a link as ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   In their case against Faget, federal authorities said that 12 minutes after
they fed him phony information about a pending defection by a Cuban official,
they caught him passing it on to a contact with ties to the Cuban government.
Court papers also identified Imperatori as Faget's contact in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori could have used the Cuban Interests Section headquarters as a
safe haven after his diplomatic immunity lapsed. He would have been beyond the
reach of U.S. law enforcement while there, because international law proclaims
that local law does not apply at such missions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, with the concurrence and perhaps at the direction of his
government, he is remaining here as what amounts to an undocumented alien.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and jailed.'' he
said. ``My morale and my truth will be my shield.''

<HEADLINE> Sharpton's high profile in Diallo case prompts political courting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A decade ago, the Rev. Al Sharpton leaped into the
spotlight with his allegations that a white gang raped Tawana Brawley, creating
controversy and prompting the political establishment to keep its distance.
<P>
	   Today, Sharpton is seen as a well-respected leader of New York's black
community, and has been a constant fixture in the Amadou Diallo police shooting,
often appearing with the victim's parents, inside the courtroom and at various
rallies.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, still known for quick punch lines and his pompadour hairdo, is now
being courted by mainstream political heavyweights such as first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   But has he really changed? Sharpton himself thinks so, saying he's been
trying for years to forge closer ties with whites and others outside the black
community.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel I have come full circle," Sharpton said Saturday in a telephone
interview. "When you see the fact that there's been a great mixture of races at
the Diallo rallies, I feel I've been able to reach out to everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, 45, added that he is modeling himself after his mentor and friend,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   Others say Sharpton is still as bombastic and divisive as ever.
</P>
<P>
	   What's changed about Sharpton is the way he's been portrayed by the media,
said Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The turning point for Sharpton was in 1992, when he first ran for office,
seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, said Meyers. That was
four years after he charged that a group of white men raped Brawley. In 1998, a
jury ordered Sharpton to pay $65,000 to the former prosecutor he accused of
raping her.
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since the 1992 campaign, the media began to see Sharpton in a different
light, Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And ever since then, the media has resurrected him, reinvented him and
recycled him," Meyers said. "The media needs Al Sharpton. He's the stereotype of
a black leader. He's a boisterous, noisy guy, quick with a quip."
</P>
<P>
	   Meyers, who is black, does not believe Sharpton is the "leader" of the black
community in New York. And he says the majority of black residents agree with
him.
</P>
<P>
	   "They see Al Sharpton as a media creation, which he is," Meyers said. "He
doesn't represent the point of view of the majority of blacks, Latinos, whites,
most New Yorkers. Who elected Al Sharpton the black leader? Who?"
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion,
also says Sharpton's transformation began during the 1992 Senate campaign, a
nasty battle featuring Geraldine Ferraro, Liz Holtzman and Robert Abrams.
</P>
<P>
	   "During the debates, Rev. Sharpton really took the conciliatory road, using
the 'I can't believe these guys are throwing mudpies' routine," Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   And it worked, but only for some New Yorkers, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "For many New Yorkers, it's too late for Rev. Sharpton to have a second
chance to make a first impression," Miringoff said. "But clearly he has charted
a very different course, one that is working within the political structure."
</P>
<P>
	   The proof of that, Miringoff says, is Sharpton's starring role in the recent
debate between Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley at Harlem's Apollo Theatre,
where Sharpton was given the honor of asking the first question.
</P>
<P>
	   But Meyers believes Sharpton won't help any political candidate with the
black vote.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it may very well help sink their ship," he said. "When they
misunderstand and misread black people as they do in the terms of thinking Al
Sharpton is the black peoples' representative, I think black people reject that
and see it as pandering."

<HEADLINE> Bradley Tries To Regain Spotlight  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   On the northwestern-most tip of Washington state, Bill Bradley had a great
crowd -- 2,000 Bellingham residents rocking the ferry building to the Rolling
Stones' ``Start me up!''
</P>
<P>
	   Only, he needed someone to notice.
</P>
<P>
	   In the final weekend of his go-for-broke bid for Washington, Bradley found
that a year traversing the campaign trail, millions of dollars in advertising
and an almost-win in New Hampshire (he lost by 4 percent) came down to this:
</P>
<P>
	   Hardly any national reporters bothered with his Friday rally. So, on his
cell phone, he dialed one of the two dozen journalists traveling with his
Democratic presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore. ``Just wanted to say hi.
Haven't seen you in a while,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also the frustration of idling far behind in polls and name ID.
</P>
<P>
	   A new CNN/Time poll released Saturday pushed Gore even further ahead in
California, with 56 percent to Bradley's 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley? I know nothing about him. Not one thing. I don't even know what
he looks like,'' said Cleveland construction worker Rick Kekick.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, where Bradley is considered best known from his years on the
Knicks basketball team, the latest poll found that about half of Democrats
didn't know enough about Bradley to say whether they view him favorably or
unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there's Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the come-from-behind fascination who threatens to topple George W.
Bush, is honing in on Bradley's support among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's been hurt by circumstance,'' said Spokane lawyer John Etter, a
Bradley supporter. ``McCain's emergence has been unhelpful to Bradley. It's
taken him off the front pages.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley dismissed those who suggest he is wasting time in the political
wilderness of Washington. The Tuesday primary there is essentially a beauty
pageant because it elects no delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can only help ourselves,'' Bradley told The Associated Press in that
Friday phone call. ``We can't do anything but gain since everybody expects us to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
	   Everybody, including Clara Staunton, who happened upon Bradley at Seattle's
Discovery Park. She said she will vote for Bradley because ``he makes a lot of
sense on the issues,'' but she had little faith in his chances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He may win here, but things don't look good overall,'' Staunton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley plunged forward Saturday, rallying about 400 Spokane supporters:
``This will be the launching pad and you can be the rockets that lift this
campaign and make it take off.''
</P>
<P>
	   He enlisted Marcy Bloom, head of Aradia Women's Health Center, the oldest
women's clinic in the Northwest, in a radio ad hammering at Gore's old
anti-abortion record. ``We need a president with an unwavering and consistent
commitment to a woman's right to choose a safe, legal abortion,'' Bloom says.
</P>
<P>
	   Intent on denying Bradley a symbolic Washington win, Gore has matched
Bradley's investment in TV advertising there, aides confirmed, and added five
stops in the Seattle area this weekend, including Saturday night's NAACP dinner,
where Bradley was also speaking.
</P>
<P>
	   One new Gore ad surprisingly features his climb of Mount Rainier last summer
with his son, Albert III -- an outing Gore long insisted was a private outing
off-limits for public discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll fight like hell,'' said Gore spokesman Todd Webster.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore cruised through northern California giddily piling up official support.
``He's for you! And he's for me!'' he trilled in sing-song Friday after Oakland
Mayor Jerry Brown offered his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   At a San Jose coffee shop Saturday, Gore, a former journalist, playfully
grabbed a reporter's notebook and, without a word, scribbled out his version of
the day's story: ``In a hastily arranged and extremely significant endorsement,
Ron Gonzales, the first Hispanic mayor of a large city in modern California
history, cast his lot with Vice President Al Gore today.''
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, he promised ``to bring full Internet access to every
home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Twice in Washington and once earlier, in South Carolina, Gore partisans
pelted Bradley with missives denouncing his scrutiny of Gore's record on
abortion, gun control and campaign finance reform as destructive to the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As you continue to campaign here, please respect the voters of Washington
and the Democratic Party. Save your attacks for Republicans,'' Washington
Democratic chairman Paul Berendt wrote Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Bradley was at a South Carolina airport when he was
handed a similar letter from state chairman Dick Harpootlian, saying it was time
for Bradley to drop out and support Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is predictable. This is how the establishment operates,'' Bradley
told AP. ``Those are his supporters. They don't want to face the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign has accused Gore, who rarely entertains questions from his
traveling press corps, of trying to hide and win the nomination on the basis of
its inevitability.
</P>
<P>
	   To wit, Bradley explained his phone call to the Gore press bus: ``I wanted
to give you the chance to speak to a presidential candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Richardson Encouraged by Oil Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia will continue to review oil supply
and demand levels to ensure market stability and prevent price volatility, which
hurts consumers and producers, according to an agreement Saturday with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The joint statement was released at the end of talks between U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson and Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi. Richardson had said
earlier in the day that talks aimed at persuading oil giant Saudi Arabia to
raise production in an attempt to bring down prices were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The world is currently producing about 73 million barrels of oil a day and
consuming about 75 million barrels a day,'' Richardson said after the meeting in
the Saudi capital, Riyadh. ``Without action, we see this situation getting
worse.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said the two agreed that ``greater equilibrium between oil
production levels and consumption will help to avoid this volatility and
preserve economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson was trying to convince leading Gulf oil producers to support a
production increase to force down oil prices that have been surging near $30 a
barrel -- and that have American consumers complaining about high costs of
heating oil and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We explained our position,'' Richardson said. ``The minister and his
associates were understanding; the talks were very positive and encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
	   Saudi Arabia, the largest producer among members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has remained noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
	   Naimi said Friday it was too early to specify a stance by producers on
whether to increase production. He made no comments after Saturday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson met separately Saturday with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud
al-Faisal, who also heads the kingdom's Supreme Petroleum Council. Richardson
said the United States is pleased with Saudi Arabia's leadership on the issue of
rising global oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced Saudi Arabia is interested in price stability, and that it
sees that the international community needs economic growth,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday in Kuwait, Richardson said Washington did not want to dictate
prices and instead was looking for market stability. He said $10 a barrel would
be ``much too low,'' but $30 a barrel was too high.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York on Friday, crude oil for April delivery rose 38 cents to $30.35
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. April Brent crude rose 9 cents to $27.46 a
barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in London.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Urges Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's King Abdullah II urged Arabs and Israelis on
Saturday to resume peace talks, saying there was a ``historic'' opportunity for
a Middle East settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is imperative to consolidate efforts and contacts to resume the peace
process, move it forward on all tracks and remove all the obstacles to achieve
the just, comprehensive and lasting peace yearned for by the people of the
region,'' Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arabs and Israelis ``should make use of the historic opportunity available
now to achieve the aspired peace,'' he added in a statement read over the
official Jordan Radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The radio said the remarks were made during a meeting with U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross, who briefed the king on discussions he held this week with
Palestinian and Israeli leaders to jump-start their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordanian officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said the
meeting with Ross also focused on ways to restart Israel's negotiations with
Syria and Lebanon. They declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The radio said Abdullah praised U.S. peace efforts in the Middle East, but
called on the U.S. administration to ``play the role of a full partner in the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah has undertaken an active role in Middle East peacemaking,
maintaining the legacy of his late father, King Hussein, a tireless campaigner
for an Arab-Israeli settlement. Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross later left for Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Cops Star Witnesses in Diallo Case  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Investigators discussed shell casings and bullet holes
left by the 41-shot barrage. A coroner detailed Amadou Diallo's 19 bullet
wounds. And residents along his Bronx block told of being startled by the
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   But the trial of four police officers accused of murdering the unarmed
Diallo was largely devoid of drama until the defense turned to its star
witnesses: the officers themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants' emotional testimony -- their first public account of the
shooting -- recounted a split-second confrontation in a dingy, 5-by-7-foot
vestibule at Diallo's Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a year later, the key question in the Albany courtroom was: What
were the white officers thinking when they opened fired on an unarmed black man?
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought, my God, I'm gonna die,'' Kenneth Boss told jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury acquitted Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy of
murder and other charges on Friday, finding that the officers -- convinced that
Diallo was armed and dangerous -- acted in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors heard about three weeks of testimony dominated by six witnesses: the
coroner who performed an autopsy on Diallo, a woman who said she saw the
shooting and the four clean-cut defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution's case was compact.
</P>
<P>
	   Over four days, several of Diallo's neighbors described hearing the volley
of gunfire shortly after midnight; his roommate cried when he recalled having to
identify the victim; and a crime scene detective produced photos of his
bullet-ridden body splayed in the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors saved the coroner, Dr. Joseph Cohen, for their last witness to
try to prove their most damning allegation: that the officers were so determined
to kill Diallo that they kept pulling their triggers after he was clearly no
longer a threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys used their own medical experts to testify that Cohen's
theories were flawed.
</P>
<P>
	   Then they took a gamble. They subpoenaed a reluctant eyewitness named
Schrrie Elliott -- who had refused to meet with them -- to testify about what
she heard.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott told jurors someone yelled ``Gun!'' before gunfire erupted -- proof,
the defense contended, that the officers truly thought Diallo was armed. But the
move backfired on cross-examination when the witness claimed that while walking
home she saw the plainclothes officers jump out of a car with their guns drawn,
form a semi-circle on the sidewalk outside Diallo's door and open fire without
warning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They continued shooting while (Diallo) was down?'' asked prosecutor Donald
Levin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes,'' Elliott replied, breaking into tears.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense later produced a videotape of Elliott telling a television news
reporter that she was certain an officer yelled ``Gun!'' She also said that
Diallo appeared to be standing throughout much of the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   But the importance of Elliott's testimony paled to that of the officers, who
took the stand in succession. Their testimony proved seamless and unshakable.
</P>
<P>
	   It began with Carroll saying that he and his three partners were looking for
armed suspects when they spotted Diallo lurking near his front door. He said
instead of stopping when the officers asked to talk to him, Diallo walked
backward and pulled what appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Convinced Diallo was about to shoot McMellon, Carroll pulled out his
semiautomatic and unloaded 16 rounds. The officers said they kept firing because
Diallo remained on his feet, and were horrified to learn the object was a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was just a wallet,'' Carroll said. ``I said, `Where's the (expletive)
gun?'''
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said Diallo was still breathing, and ``I held his hand and rubbed
his face'' and pleaded: ``Please, don't die.''
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the trial's lasting images, the officer dropped his head and wept.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton Seen As NYC's Black Leader  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA DE LA CRUZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A decade ago, the Rev. Al Sharpton leaped into the
spotlight with his allegations that a group of white men raped black teen-ager
Tawana Brawley, stirring controversy and prompting the political establishment
to keep its distance.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Sharpton is often seen as a respected leader of New York's black
community. And he has been a constant fixture in the case of the police killing
of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo, often appearing with the victim's parents
before Friday's acquittal of four officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, still known for quick punch lines and his pompadour hairdo, is now
being courted by mainstream political heavyweights such as first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   But has he really changed? Sharpton himself thinks so, saying he's been
trying for years to forge closer ties with people outside the black community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel I have come full circle,'' Sharpton said Saturday in a telephone
interview. ``When you see the fact that there's been a great mixture of races at
the Diallo rallies, I feel I've been able to reach out to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton added that he is modeling himself after his mentor and friend, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   Others say Sharpton, 45, is still as bombastic and divisive as ever.
</P>
<P>
	   What's changed about Sharpton is the way he's been portrayed by the media,
said Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The turning point was 1992, when Sharpton first ran for office, seeking the
Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, said Meyers.
</P>
<P>
	   That was four years after he charged that a group of white men raped
Brawley. A grand jury eventually concluded that Brawley's story of abduction and
rape was a hoax, perhaps concocted to avoid punishment for staying out late. And
in 1998, a jury ordered Sharpton to pay $65,000 to the former prosecutor he
accused of being among the alleged rapists.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning with the 1992 campaign, Sharpton was seen in a different light,
Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And ever since then, the media has resurrected him, reinvented him and
recycled him,'' Meyers said. ``The media needs Al Sharpton. He's the stereotype
of a black leader. He's a boisterous, noisy guy, quick with a quip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meyers, who is black, does not believe Sharpton is the ``leader'' of the
black community in New York. And he says the majority of black residents agree
with him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They see Al Sharpton as a media creation, which he is,'' Meyers said. ``He
doesn't represent the point of view of the majority of blacks, Latinos, whites,
most New Yorkers. Who elected Al Sharpton the black leader? Who?''
</P>
<P>
	   During the recent debate between Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley at
Harlem's Apollo Theatre, Sharpton was given the honor of asking the first
question.
</P>
<P>
	   But Meyers believes Sharpton won't help any political candidate with the
black vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it may very well help sink their ship,'' he said. ``When they
misunderstand and misread black people as they do in the terms of thinking Al
Sharpton is the black peoples' representative, I think black people reject that
and see it as pandering.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Courts Ohio Republicans  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The invitation to John McCain's rally in Cleveland
contained a not-so-subtle suggestion from the campaign: Don't put just any
slogan on your campaign sign. Write, ``Republicans for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Moore didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of in-your-face,'' said the public relations officer, a McCain
supporter, while waiting to shake the senator's hand at Cleveland's popular West
Side Market.
</P>
<P>
	   As McCain and his Republican presidential rival George W. Bush turn their
attention to Ohio and other Super Tuesday primary states, the Arizona senator's
campaign believes it cannot afford to be subtle -- especially in its appeal to
core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   He invokes Ronald Reagan and courts non-Republicans in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a proud conservative Republican,'' he declared to several thousand
residents crammed around the market's produce tent on an unseasonably balmy day.
``But I also say to you that I want independents, Democrats, Libertarians,
vegetarians!''
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Bush has carried the vast majority of Republican support in the
primaries and polls, even as McCain racks up victories in New Hampshire, Arizona
and Michigan thanks to moderate Republicans and cross-over votes from Democrats
and independents in open contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Both McCain and Bush, who is scheduled to campaign in Washington state on
Sunday and Ohio on Monday, are airing ads that mention former President Reagan,
a GOP icon.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the Bush campaign is targeting voting blocs who have supported McCain,
too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Strategically, you're going to see us reach out and make inroads in the
center and challenge him on his claim that he's like Ronald Reagan,'' Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer said Saturday. ``He's got a real Republican problem and
he's going to have a hard time fixing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek magazine poll found Bush has a 56 percent to 27 percent lead over
McCain nationally among registered Republicans and those likely to vote
Republican. And 62 percent said Bush was more likely to beat the Democratic
nominee in the general election, down from 73 percent in a poll in early
February, compared with 27 percent for McCain, 8 percentage points higher than
before.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP race has taken on a harsh tone, with the Texas governor deriding
McCain for hiring phone banks to tell voters about Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University, a school in South Carolina that doesn't allow interracial dating and
is seen by some critics as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ronald Reagan never said one thing and then did another, and McCain has a
proven propensity to say one thing and do another, like saying you're going to
run a clean campaign and then turn around and run a bunch of anti-Catholic phone
calls,'' Bush said in Virginia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia and Washington state hold open primaries on Tuesday and North
Dakota Republicans hold caucuses, a week before coast-to-coast March 7 contests
in 13 states, including Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   In Virginia, where 56 delegates are at stake, voters must sign a non-binding
pledge not to participate in any other party's nomination process, which could
hurt McCain among Democrats and independents. In Washington, 12 delegates will
be awarded, and 19 in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain planned a long day of campaigning on Monday with stops scheduled in
Virginia, Washington state and California, where he's 25 points behind Bush in a
new Time/CNN poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, who was at McCain's side Saturday, worried that
Democrats and independents might not cross over for McCain in the GOP primary
because the Democratic voting is held the same day -- a potential March 7
problem for McCain nationwide in open contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also has organizations in each of Ohio's 88 counties, while McCain is
relying on news reports to build support and turn out voters. DeWine said
McCain's tour through Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati passed through three TV
broadcast markets that reach 80 percent of the state's residents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There really wasn't a race in Ohio until Thursday night,'' when McCain's
commercial went on the air,'' DeWine said. ``Organization doesn't matter here.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the multi-ethnic West Side Market, where vendors hawk everything from
bratwurst to butterscotch pie, McCain bought beef jerky. He and his wife Cindy
signed autographs and shook hands with residents and shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter Ehrnfelt, whose family has run a butcher shop at the market since
1912, said he'd seen Reagan, Rosalynn Carter and President Bush pass through the
market -- but not candidate Bush, so far.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They say John McCain is one of the boys, and that he speaks to you
straight, and that Bush doesn't have that same kind of feeling,'' said Ehrnfelt,
mayor of nearby Strongsville. ``We need that kind of straight talking person (as
president) given what this country's been through lately.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later at Ohio State University's St. John Arena in Columbus, McCain took on
protesters who interrupted his town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Give us a living wage!'' several men chanted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be glad to - go to work,'' McCain replied.

<HEADLINE> Mercury skyrockets in Buffalo, Rochester  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Spring fever ran rampant Saturday in the
northwestern corner of New York, with Buffalo recording an all-time February
high of 71 degrees.
<P>
	   While most places in the state stayed relatively cool, Rochester and Buffalo
and all 75 miles of countryside in between fairly sizzled this winter weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of residents in two of the snowiest cities in the nation took a
stroll in the park, bicycled along the banks of the Erie Canal or just basked on
their stoops in T-shirts and shorts.
</P>
<P>
	   The 71-degree high in Buffalo smashed the Feb. 26 record of 60 degrees set
in 1951 and topped the 70-degree record for the month of February set on Feb.
21, 1997. Rochester warmed to 65 degrees, beating a record of 61 degrees set 24
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a fantastic day!" said Matthew Weld, already in high spirits from
celebrating his 26th birthday. "We're thinking we'll go hit a bucket of golf
balls."
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rochester native knows it won't last. "This is not the first day of
spring, as many people may believe," he said, promptly predicting another foot
of snow will pile up this winter to replace the 91 inches that have melted away.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll take this every winter," said Jerry Owens, 39, a research technician
at Xerox Corp., as he stood on a bridge looking down in awe at the Genesee River
transformed by snow melt into a raging torrent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going home to cook on the grill," piped in passer-by Tanya Chubb, 26,
knowing that in a few days "we'll have to move the party indoors."
</P>
<P>
	   Provided the clouds remain dispersed, record high temperatures look set to
return in the Buffalo and Rochester regions Sunday. By Monday, however, snow
will be back in the forecast.

	   In Buffalo, "we've got everything going for us - a lot of sunshine and
southerly winds coming down the hills south of us," said Dave Sage, a
meteorologist at the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other parts of western New York, Saturday's temperatures climbed only
into the 50s. In much of eastern New York, the mercury stayed stuck in the 40s,
but even that was enough to make the Lake George Winter Carnival seem a slight
misnomer.
</P>
<P>
	   Snowmobile races in the North Country community were canceled this weekend
because temperatures in the 40s made the surface of the frozen lake too slushy
to navigate. Most other events were held.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Tries To Regain Spotlight  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   On the northwestern-most tip of Washington state, Bill Bradley had a great
crowd -- 2,000 Bellingham residents rocking the ferry building to the Rolling
Stones' ``Start me up!''
</P>
<P>
	   Only, he needed someone to notice.
</P>
<P>
	   In the final weekend of his go-for-broke bid for Washington, Bradley found
that a year traversing the campaign trail, millions of dollars in advertising
and an almost-win in New Hampshire (he lost by 4 percent) came down to this:
</P>
<P>
	   Hardly any national reporters bothered with his Friday rally. So, on his
cell phone, he dialed one of the two dozen journalists traveling with his
Democratic presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore. ``Just wanted to say hi.
Haven't seen you in a while,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also the frustration of idling far behind in polls and name ID.
</P>
<P>
	   A new CNN/Time poll released Saturday pushed Gore even further ahead in
California, with 56 percent to Bradley's 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley? I know nothing about him. Not one thing. I don't even know what
he looks like,'' said Cleveland construction worker Rick Kekick.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, where Bradley is considered best known from his years on the
Knicks basketball team, the latest poll found that about half of Democrats
didn't know enough about Bradley to say whether they view him favorably or
unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there's Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the come-from-behind fascination who threatens to topple George W.
Bush, is honing in on Bradley's support among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's been hurt by circumstance,'' said Spokane lawyer John Etter, a
Bradley supporter. ``McCain's emergence has been unhelpful to Bradley. It's
taken him off the front pages.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley dismissed those who suggest he is wasting time in the political
wilderness of Washington. The Tuesday primary there is essentially a beauty
pageant because it elects no delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can only help ourselves,'' Bradley told The Associated Press in that
Friday phone call. ``We can't do anything but gain since everybody expects us to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
	   Everybody, including Clara Staunton, who happened upon Bradley at Seattle's
Discovery Park. She said she will vote for Bradley because ``he makes a lot of
sense on the issues,'' but she had little faith in his chances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He may win here, but things don't look good overall,'' Staunton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley plunged forward Saturday, rallying about 400 Spokane supporters:
``This will be the launching pad and you can be the rockets that lift this
campaign and make it take off.''
</P>
<P>
	   He enlisted Marcy Bloom, head of Aradia Women's Health Center, the oldest
women's clinic in the Northwest, in a radio ad hammering at Gore's old
anti-abortion record. ``We need a president with an unwavering and consistent
commitment to a woman's right to choose a safe, legal abortion,'' Bloom says.
</P>
<P>
	   Intent on denying Bradley a symbolic Washington win, Gore has matched
Bradley's investment in TV advertising there, aides confirmed, and added five
stops in the Seattle area this weekend, including Saturday night's NAACP dinner,
where Bradley was also speaking.
</P>
<P>
	   One new Gore ad surprisingly features his climb of Mount Rainier last summer
with his son, Albert III -- an outing Gore long insisted was private and
off-limits for public discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll fight like hell,'' said Gore spokesman Todd Webster.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore cruised through California giddily piling up official support. ``He's
for you! And he's for me!'' he trilled in sing-song Friday after Oakland Mayor
Jerry Brown offered his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   At a San Jose coffee shop Saturday, Gore, a former journalist, playfully
grabbed a reporter's notebook and, without a word, scribbled out his version of
the day's story: ``In a hastily arranged and extremely significant endorsement,
Ron Gonzales, the first Hispanic mayor of a large city in modern California
history, cast his lot with Vice President Al Gore today.''
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, he promised ``to bring full Internet access to every
home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Twice in Washington and once earlier, in South Carolina, Gore partisans
pelted Bradley with missives denouncing his scrutiny of Gore's record on
abortion, gun control and campaign finance reform as destructive to the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As you continue to campaign here, please respect the voters of Washington
and the Democratic Party. Save your attacks for Republicans,'' Washington
Democratic chairman Paul Berendt wrote Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Bradley was at a South Carolina airport when he was
handed a similar letter from state chairman Dick Harpootlian, saying it was time
for Bradley to drop out and support Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is predictable. This is how the establishment operates,'' Bradley
told AP. ``Those are his supporters. They don't want to face the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign has accused Gore, who rarely entertains questions from his
traveling press corps, of trying to hide and win the nomination on the basis of
its inevitability.
</P>
<P>
	   To wit, Bradley explained his phone call to the Gore press bus: ``I wanted
to give you the chance to speak to a presidential candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Pelt French Premier  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ran from a
rock-throwing crowd of university students who chased him into his limousine
Saturday and then jumped on its hood before the premier was whisked to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence -- triggered by Jospin's condemnation of Lebanese guerrillas
fighting Israel -- deeply embarrassed Jospin's host, Yasser Arafat. The
Palestinian leader has been courting the international community ahead of a
declaration of Palestinian independence, which he has said would happen by
September.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat apologized to Jospin, who was slightly injured in the attack at the
West Bank's Bir Zeit University, a stronghold of the Islamic militant group
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
	   The French prime minister said he held no grudge.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jospin's criticism of the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah as
``terrorists,'' as well as Saturday's rock-throwing incident in the West Bank,
could harm France's hopes of playing a major role in Mideast peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
	   French President Jacques Chirac said he was shocked by the attack on Jospin.
But he also asked the prime minister to contact him on his return to discuss the
remarks about Hezbollah -- a request many in France saw as a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
	   In taking a pro-Israeli stance, Jospin deviated from the traditional French
position of carefully balancing support between the Arab world and Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's incident began when Jospin arrived at Bir Zeit to deliver a
speech. He was greeted by about 2,000 students, some carrying banners reading
``From Bir Zeit to Beirut, we are one people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Students chanted ``Hezbollah, destroy Kiryat Shemona,'' referring to the
Israeli border town often attacked by the Shiite Muslim group with rockets.
Hecklers accused Jospin of being a traitor and a collaborator with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   When Jospin left the auditorium, a hail of stones rained down on him.
Bodyguards quickly opened briefcases to shield the prime minister's head and
rushed him toward a waiting limousine. Angry protesters jumped on the hood, and
smashed the back windshield with stones before the limousine sped off.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve Bir Zeit students were arrested. West Bank security chief Jibril
Rajoub said the TV footage of the riot would be carefully studied to identify
the stone-throwers. Bir Zeit was shut down until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Students said followers of all factions, including Arafat's Fatah movement,
participated in the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian Legislative Council condemned the attack. ``Such acts do not
represent the Palestinian people or its leadership,'' a council statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin said he accepted with calm what happened at Bir Zeit, and that he
came to the Palestinian lands as a ``friend of the Palestinians and a friend of
Yasser Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, he canceled a visit to the Palestinian refugee camp at Khan Yunis
in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin's Mideast trip laid bare marked divisions between him and Chirac on a
key foreign policy issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Chirac, a conservative, is a strong supporter of Lebanon and is considered
close to the Arab world. Chirac and Jospin, a socialist, began their
``cohabitation'' -- or power sharing -- three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Editor Begins Jail Sentence  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RED BLUFF, Calif. (AP) -- A journalist who refused to disclose his sources
began a five-day jail sentence Saturday for contempt of court, led into custody
by a sheriff's sergeant who patted him down as friends, colleagues and reporters
watched.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm at peace,'' said Tim Crews, 57, moments before he entered the steel
gated enclosure at the rear of the Tehama County jail, about 220 miles northeast
of San Francsico.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews, the publisher, editor and lead reporter of the twice-weekly
Sacramento Valley Mirror in Glenn County, kissed and hugged his tearful longtime
companion, Donna Settle, and waived to a knot of onlookers.
</P>
<P>
	   A deputy said Crews was expected to be placed in the jail's minimum-security
wing, which has dormitory-style quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said it
would review the issues in the case, but declined to block Crews' incarceration.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Superior Court Judge Noel Watkins ordered Crews jailed, indicating
the journalist's refusal to divulge his sources for a weapon-theft story had
jeopardized the defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews, in a story based on unidentified sources, reported officials had long
been aware of allegations that former California Highway Patrol officer Dewey
Anderson stole a handgun from a county drug enforcement unit. Anderson has been
ordered to stand trial, and his attorneys seek Crews' sources in connection with
the defense's case.
</P>
<P>
	   In ordering Crews jailed, Watkins said the journalist has ``an obstinate,
wrong-headed position.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The right of a newspaper reporter (to protect sources) is not absolute,''
Watkins added.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews' June 8 article reported the 1995 allegations Anderson, who worked in
the drug enforcement unit. Anderson later became a CHP officer and an
undersheriff. He was charged with the theft last year after the gun turned up at
a local high school.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak To Add More Passenger Routes  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak intends to avert liquidation with a dramatic new
plan to expand passenger service, tap into the business of shipping refrigerated
produce and increase mail and freight service, Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov.
Tommy Thompson, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A study of the system with details of the plan, including new and expanded
passenger routes, is due for release Tuesday. But at a Washington meeting of the
National Governors' Association, Thompson insisted the study justifies extending
the railway's routes rather than curtailing them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not risky. What's risky is if we don't do anything,'' Thompson told
The Associated Press. ``There's never been a board or Amtrak management that has
ever taken a detailed, exhaustive study of all of our routes and our equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's what we've done with our market-based analysis, and we've come to
the conclusion that we can expand our services.''
</P>
<P>
	   The expansion would include a luxury, transcontinental route between New
York and Los Angeles and more Midwestern routes from the hub city of Chicago,
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   And with gasoline prices on the rise, Amtrak officials hope to serve as a
cheaper alternative for companies that currently ship products on
tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, Amtrak has relied on government subsidies to stay on track. Under
the 1997 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, Congress created the Amtrak
Reform Council to monitor the railway's performance. It imposed a 2002 deadline
for Amtrak to wean itself from government subsidies or face possible
liquidation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've tried in the past to shrink, and all we've done is irritate people,
reduce service and profits and ridership. And that's no way to run a railroad,''
Thompson said. ``The board is committed to building a national railroad system,
and this is a giant step forward to doing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Amtrak is likely to lose money at first and continue for some time
to require money from the government, Thompson said the study shows the railway
can become self-sufficient within a few years.
</P>
<P>
	   With the expansion, Amtrak projects that by the end of 2002, the railway
will generate $175 million from mail and freight service, and $54 million from
passenger service, bringing total revenues to $229 million, a net gain of $65
million, said Lynn Bowersox, Amtrak vice president of communications for the
Northeast corridor.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson said the plan would reshape Amtrak service by splitting up and
adding routes in some places but reducing the number of cars in others. The aim
would be little or no empty space on the trains. On some routes, rear cars would
be stocked with meat, produce and other goods.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rail service just can't make it on passengers alone, except in highly
dense corridors. We're looking at ways to increase our profits by mail and
express, and we're going into the refrigeration business,'' Thompson said.
``It's actually smart deployment of our inventory assets.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the expansion, Amtrak in effect would follow the path of major airlines
that risked losing money to make service available to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to do it,'' Thompson said. ``We have to generate the enthusiasm.
We have to get people going to ride our rails.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuns Continue Church Protest  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) -- An American delegation Saturday painted a grim
picture of conditions for two American nuns holed up in protest for 40 days in a
West Bank monastery.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian Authority evicted their colleagues and handed the property
over to a rival church.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the nuns, Sister Maria, formerly Maria Stephanopoulos from New York,
is the sister of former White House spokesman George Stephanopoulos. The other
nun is Sister Xenia Cesena from California.
</P>
<P>
	   Nikki Stephanopoulos, Sister Maria's mother and a member of the delegation,
told The Associated Press the nuns' living conditions were appalling and a
solution to the deadlock must be found soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have had no hot food for 40 days. The walls of their cell are
peeling. They have only an outside toilet shared by the monks. The smells are
disgusting. They have no facilities for bathing and they are two women confined
in close proximity to 10 men,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview, Sister Maria said the visit was ``positive'' but
that she would remain realistic. ``It was good to see my mom, but we are still
prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
	   The nuns belong to the ``white'' Russian Orthodox Church, founded after the
1917 revolution by anti-communist Russian exiles. On Jan. 15, Palestinian police
evicted the ``white'' monks from the Garden Monastery in Jericho, and handed the
building over to monks of the Moscow-based ``red'' Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has placed the Palestinians in an uncomfortable position --
between the United States, where the white church is based, and Russia, with
whom they are trying to strengthen ties.
</P>
<P>
	   A compromise was worked out several weeks ago that gives much of the land to
the white church and a residential building to the red one, leaving the chapel
itself locked and controlled by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   The nuns are to move into a mobile home on the property pending a final
settlement. But they have stayed put, saying the ``red'' clerics have not moved
to their designated section.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegation consisted of Stephanopoulos, three congressional aides and
Father Pavlenko, a Russian Orthodox priest in the United States. The group also
met Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian cabinet minister Saeb Erekat told the delegation the compromise
should be implemented and the situation should be handled in court.

<HEADLINE> Reconciliation Is Theme for Muslims  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD N. OSTLING AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Until a matter of weeks ago, it seemed inconceivable that
there would ever be an end to one of America's most contentious religious
rivalries: the rift between orthodox U.S. Muslims and members of Louis
Farrakhan's Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, a generation after the Nation broke away from the Muslim mainstream,
reconciliation is the theme for the organization's most important annual
gathering, Saviour's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharing the stage for the first time with Imam W. Deen Mohammed, the son of
Elijah Muhammad and head of the rival Muslim American Society, Farrakhan issued
a call for unity Friday before thousands of worshippers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From this day forward, Imam Mohammed, whatever our small problems, we'll
work them out for the glory of Allah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed also declared that, whatever their differences over the past
quarter-century, unity in the cause of Islam in America is more important.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to say, Minister Farrakhan is a great leader,'' he said. ``Our
friendship has not died, and it will not die.''
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, talk of unity has been scarce between the movements led by the
two Chicagoans, who are both 66. Farrakhan is a fiery orator who tightly
controls a paramilitary organization. Mohammed is a laid-back spiritual teacher
who has all but abandoned any national organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Mamiya, an expert on black American religions at Vassar College,
estimated the core membership of the Nation of Islam to be 50,000 to 100,000,
with a much broader cultural impact. He said the Muslim American Society has
200,000 members.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's dramatic reconciliation came almost exactly 25 years after the
death of Elijah Muhammad, who was W. Deen's father and Farrakhan's mentor.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Nation's theology, Elijah's teacher in the 1930s, W. D. Fard of
Detroit, was given divine status and Elijah is the final prophet to mankind.
Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of Mecca, who founded
Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the most important words Friday came from Farrakhan: ``Allah sent
Mohammed with the final revelation to the world. ... There is no prophet after
the Prophet Mohammed, and no book after the Koran.''
</P>
<P>
	   That seemed to indicate that Islam's founder, not Elijah, is now the ``seal
of the prophets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in 1975 his
son W. Deen led the movement toward orthodoxy. In 1978, Farrakhan broke away to
revive Elijah's teachings under the old Nation of Islam name.
</P>
<P>
	   Those teachings, including a belief that whites are ``devils,'' have kept
the movements apart.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mainstream Muslims today actively dissociate themselves from the current
Nation under the leadership of Louis Farrakhan,'' writes Jane I. Smith of
Hartford Seminary in her 1999 book, ``Islam in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the significance of Friday's joint appearance, Sayyid Syeed,
secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America, offered three
workshops on Muslim traditions.
</P>
<P>
	   This formalized a tentative link between Farrakhan and the most important
umbrella organization for non-black Muslim immigrants, who have judged Farrakhan
to be heretical.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks with Farrakhan this past year have convinced Syeed that the Nation of
Islam is beginning the same move toward mainstream belief that W. Deen Mohammed
began a generation ago, which caused the black Muslim split.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Farrakhan said a near-fatal bout with cancer had changed him
and that he would now stress unity for all races. Given his history and past
anti-Semitic remarks, Jewish groups are especially wary of the ``new''
Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
	   Malcolm X had been Elijah Muhammad's most effective spokesman, but he turned
against the Nation of Islam leader in 1964.
</P>
<P>
	   As detailed in ``The Messenger: The Rise and Fall of Elijah Muhammad,'' a
new biography by Karl Evanzz, Malcolm learned that his mentor had mistresses and
illegitimate children. Malcolm then rejected Elijah's race doctrines and
embraced orthodox Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan's ``writings and speeches helped create the conditions that led to
the assassination of Malcolm X'' 35 years ago, according to Evanzz.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, W. Deen Mohammed (then known as Wallace Muhammad) was Malcolm's
friend and agreed with his criticisms. Despite this opposition to his father,
Wallace became the leader of the group when Elijah died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan will preside over the Saviour's Day rally on Sunday, when he could
elaborate on the changes in his movement.

<HEADLINE> Anger, determination in wake of Diallo verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Anger and frustration seethed in parts of the city
Saturday as New Yorkers struggled to absorb news that the four police officers
who killed an African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets were acquitted of all
criminal charges.
<P>
	   In Harlem, 350 people crammed into the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action
Network headquarters in Harlem for an emotional rally a day after the verdicts
expressed fury that Amadou Diallo's death had gone unpunished.
</P>
<P>
	   "Murderers!" they shouted. "Racist cops!" "We want justice!"
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the day, over a thousand protesters marched down Fifth Ave., waving
signs calling for "Justice for Diallo," and "Jail Killer Cops."
</P>
<P>
	   A hush fell over the Harlem rally when Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo,
approached the podium. As she began to thank the audience in a soft voice for
the support they had given her family, listeners cried out "Thank you!" and "We
love you!"
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Diallo said that after sitting through nearly a month of trial
testimony and arguments, she still could not understand why her son died. The
defense argument that her son's actions had drawn the officers' attention and
led them to believe he had a gun caused her particular anguish, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The crime that they committed is to consider my son suspicious," she said.
"That was the first crime. ... Our whole family are wondering why they said that
everything that happened was because of Amadou's fault. Because we know he was a
nice kid."
</P>
<P>
	   Although frustrated by the acquittals, she expressed hope that some good
might come of her son's death if it inspired people to fight against police
brutality and improve understanding between police and citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's about justice," she said. "Nothing can replace Amadou, ... but if his
cause can help clarify this situation, ... so that the people can live in peace,
I think that would be a great honor for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Many at the rally - where speakers included Rep. Charles Rangel, Rep. Jose
Serrano, Sharpton and New York Civil Liberties Union executive director Norman
Siegel - echoed Mrs. Diallo's assertion that her son was a victim of racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, more than 1,000 people marched along Fifth Avenue, chanting
"killer cops have got to go," and "it's a wallet, not a gun," in reference to
the four officers assertion that they thought Diallo's wallet was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens were arrested after sitting and blocking traffic in front of St.
Patrick's Cathedral. Protesters yelled angrily and taunted police who tried to
keep them on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just outraged... this is just the most blatant shooting of an unarmed
black person, but it's not the only one," said marcher Bruce Kayton, 40. "If the
races were reversed they would have been probably calling for the death
penalty."
</P>
<P>
	   At the Harlem rally, Sharpton vowed to press on with legal action in the
case, calling for federal criminal civil rights charges against the officers and
saying he hoped Diallo's death would help improve the way police forces deal
with black and Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to use this Amadou Diallo case to stop this in these United
States once and for all," he said. "Just like we needed the federal government
to come into Alabama and Mississippi 30 years ago, we need the federal
government to come into New York to deal with the police today."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton compared the case to the 1991 videotaped beating of black Los
Angeles motorist Rodney King, where federal prosecutors won convictions of two
officers. If federal charges were appropriate in that case, where no shots were
fired, they were even more necessary in Diallo's death, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was Rodney King multiplied by lead," he shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton announced plans for a Sunday rally at the United Nations and
another demonstration Thursday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, outside Diallo's Bronx home, where several hundred gathered after
the verdicts were announced, 50 or so people milled, burning with indignation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a different set of justice, some for us, some for them," said a man
who lived in Diallo's neighborhood and identified himself only as Lamarr H.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I say us, I mean people of color," he continued. "Somebody has to pay
for this. If not, it's like saying 'Anytime you feel threatened by a black man,
you shoot first and you ask questions later.' I'm feeling the pain. I'm feeling
all the anger. ... That could have been me."
</P>
<P>
	   In Harlem, Rangel said the officers never would have shot Diallo if he'd
been white, but he assured Kadiatou Diallo that her son's death would not be for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This man died so that we can have a better America," said the congressman.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Salmon Research Halted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLENHEIM, New Zealand (AP) -- A controversy involving leaked secret
documents, deformed fish heads and gargantuan salmon has ended with a New
Zealand company agreeing to kill all its genetically engineered fish.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a year after New Zealand King Salmon Co. Ltd. was first accused of
breeding mutant chinook salmon in the so-called ``Franken-fish'' experiment, the
company announced Friday it would bury the remains of the specially grown fish
and suspend its research.
</P>
<P>
	   King Salmon's chief executive Paul Steere said the company made the decision
after it had successfully introduced an additional growth hormone gene into
chinook salmon and passed the trait down three generations.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied the decision to suspend the project was influenced by political,
ethical or scientific resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the project have fought for more than a year to stop it after
leaked secret papers showed deformed heads and other abnormalities had occurred
during the breeding program.
</P>
<P>
	   After receiving the new growth hormone gene, the salmon grew three times
faster than the normal rate. According to the company, the genetically modified
salmon could grow up to 550 pounds. Chinook, or Pacific king, the largest
species of salmon, grow to 110 pounds in the wild.
</P>
<P>
	   King Salmon has admitted some of the first-generation fish had developed
lumps on their heads due to apparent genetic deformities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All modified salmon have been killed and disposed of, in accordance with
(scientific) containment protocols,'' Steere said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it would retain frozen sperm from genetically engineered
salmon ``at a secure location'' so it was available to continue the program in
the future.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's experimental work was halted as the government prepared to
establish an inquiry into the project and its controls to prevent live salmon or
fertile eggs escaping into the wild.

<HEADLINE> GOP Handgun Raffle Raises Hackles  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID DISHNEAU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- A 66-year-old woman won a Beretta 9 mm
semiautomatic pistol Saturday in a Republican Party raffle that provoked
opposition even within the party.
</P>
<P>
	   Helen Roop, a registered Republican and retired Carroll County finance
department worker, opted for the handgun and shooting classes over the
alternative first prize of $500. She must pass a background check before getting
the pistol.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund-raiser for the rural county's Republican Central Committee
succeeded beyond organizers' dreams, raising an estimated $13,000 for the party
in Carroll County just west of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   Handgun Control Inc., a Washington-based citizens advocacy group, considered
the raffle ``tasteless'' and ``inappropriate,'' spokesman Brian Morton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The event was criticized by some of the state's Republican leaders,
including 1998 gubernatorial candidate Ellen Sauerbrey. Michael Steele, state
GOP vice chairman, said it seemed ``wrongheaded.''
</P>
<P>
	   The raffle also prompted the resignation of Betty L. Smith, vice chairwoman
of the Carroll County Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a mother of five, I cannot tell my children that I have had a part in
raffling a gun,'' she said after quitting the post last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest winner may have been the gun lobby, which gained awareness with
every $5 ticket sold.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We took a serious issue and we took a stand, and when people take a stand,
it draws support,'' said organizer Scott Hollenbeck.
</P>
<P>
	   As 270 people listened to keynote speaker John Lott, a Yale University
scholar and author of ``More Guns, Less Crime,'' while about 10 protested the
raffle in drizzly weather outside the banquet hall where the breakfast event was
held.
</P>
<P>
	   They included the parents of 18-year-old Aaron Goodrich, shot to death
during a Starbucks coffee shop robbery in the District of Columbia in 1997, and
13-year-old John Price, who was killed by a playmate in an accidental shooting
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's in bad taste. I don't think there is any place in the
Republican Party to raffle off a 9 mm handgun,'' said John's mother, Carole
Price.

<HEADLINE> Former New Britain couple gets probation in child abuse case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - A former New Britain couple who used a 30-inch
fiberglass rod to punish their children for misbehaving are avoiding jail time.
<P>
	   Carlo Krajewski, 44, and Mary Krajewski, 43, were each sentenced in New
Britain Superior Court to three years' probation. The couple are now living on a
farm in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parents entered guilty pleas to three counts each of third-degree
assault and one of cruelty to persons.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple's strict discipline come from teachings of The Twelve Tribes, a
Christian community begun in Vermont in the early 1970s that emulates the
close-knit farming communities of early Messianic Judaism.
</P>
<P>
	   "This couple lives a life that is almost from another time or era. They are
simple people, not stupid, but not very sophisticated," public defender Cynthia
Clancy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Twelve Tribes has several thousand members across the country, including
some in Bridgeport, South America and Europe. Members see their faith as a
spiritual alternative to a man-centered, technocratic, amoral world.
</P>
<P>
	   The Krajewskis lived in Twelve Tribes communities for 13 years before moving
to New Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1984, 112 children were allegedly being abused at the group's community
in Island Pond, Vt. A judge ruled the raid illegal and returned all the children
to their parents.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Krajewskis' five children, now aged 10 through 17, remain in state
care. The children were removed when the parents were arrested in August 1998.
They have supervised visits with their parents.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest agony for these parents was to have to say in court that they
are guilty," Clancy said. "They believed at the time what they were doing was
best for their children. It's very clear they love their children and want them
back."
</P>
<P>
	   When the couple were first arrested, prosecutors said the discipline left
marks on the children, which constitutes child abuse under the law, no matter
what religious teaching may say.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Kleeblatt, spokesman for the state Department of Children and Families,
said child protection laws prevented him from commenting on the case.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Emergency Law Still Needed  </HEADLINE>
   By SALAH NASRAWI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- President Hosni Mubarak asked parliament Saturday to
extend a 19-year-old state of emergency for three more years, triggering
criticism from opposition parties who say the special laws block them from real
political participation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak first imposed a state of emergency in 1981 following the
assassination of his predecessor, Anwar Sadat, by Muslim militants opposed to
his peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Under emergency law, Mubarak has sweeping powers to legislate and can refer
people to military courts and impose restrictions on political activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak's request was presented in a special session of the People's
Assembly, or parliament, by Prime Minister Atef Obeid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Terrorism exploits freedoms and has only one objective, that is to hamper
progress,'' Obeid was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying. ``So
we should be armed by alertness and the initiative to confront it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Obeid promised that the government would not use emergency law against
opposition parties or to curb freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament is dominated by Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party, which
is expected to pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition parties have urged Mubarak to lift the emergency law and called
for freedom to form political parties and associations, which can only be
created with the approval of a government committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein Abdel Razik, a coordinator for the main opposition parties, said
their representatives will reject Mubarak's request to extend emergency law and
will speed up their campaign to lift the state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   Razik disputed the government's claim that it has used the emergency laws to
stop terrorism, which has been responsible for some 1,200 deaths -- mostly
militants and police -- since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Terrorism has risen since the government imposed these laws. It should
admit that it cannot live without them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maamoun el-Hodeiby, a spokesman for the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, said
the government extended the emergency laws to block opposition parties from
political participation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is illogical and unacceptable,'' he said. ``How can a country live in
an emergency situation for twenty years?''
</P>
<P>
	   The government has used the emergency laws to refer Brotherhood members and
Islamic radicals to military courts, whose rulings cannot be appealed. Some 20
of its members are being tried now for trying to revive the Brotherhood and
infiltrating unions to make their members carry out anti-government activities.

<HEADLINE> Slumping Sales Close Saturn Plants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is suspending production this week at
four manufacturing plants to reduce inventories as the automaker struggles with
sluggish sales, a company spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The temporary shutdowns are scheduled for Monday through Saturday at plants
in Spring Hill, Tenn., and Wilmington, Del., which produce Saturn compacts;
Fairfax, Kan., which makes the Oldsmobile Intrigue and Pontiac Grand Prix, and
St. Therese, Quebec, which builds the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro,
said GM spokesman Brian Akre.
</P>
<P>
	   Production is scheduled to resume March 6. Hourly workers at the four plants
will receive their normal pay without interruption during the shutdowns, with
some of them staying on to perform maintenance, Akre said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shutdowns for "inventory adjustment" -- or giving dealers time to sell cars
already built, rather than accumulate more -- are not unusual but can't
necessarily be predicted, Akre said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We build to demand, and demand has been light over the last couple of
months," Saturn spokesman Bill Betts said.

<HEADLINE> State officials to look into why students don't attend college  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State education officials have launched a formal
study to learn why so many New Jersey college students are leaving the state,
despite its ranking among the top 10 states in merit aid.
<P>
	   The Commission on Higher Education announced Friday that the study will
focus on the higher education brain drain to learn how to keep students in the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   The topic hasn't been thoroughly examined since the last study was conducted
in 1996, and more data is needed, said Judy Savage, the commission's assistant
director of communications.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the 1996 statistics, 37 percent of New Jersey college freshmen,
including 57 percent of those attending four-year schools, chose to attend
out-of-state schools.
</P>
<P>
	   About 24,000 freshmen choose out-of-state colleges each year, compared with
only 4,400 students enrolling in New Jersey - the highest net loss of college
students in the nation, according to figures reported in Saturday's editions of
The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1996 study also indicates colleges and universities in Pennsylvania, New
York, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia attracted the most New Jersey
students.
</P>
<P>
	   The five most popular out-of-state schools were the University of Delaware,
New York University, University of Maryland-College Park, Boston University and
Villanova University. About 2,300 students from New Jersey attended those five
schools, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
	   Education officials are concerned because the students left despite nearly
$15 million in merit scholarships designed to entice them to attend one of 56
colleges and universities in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a whole marketing image that needs an overhaul," said John Kelly, a
member of the education commission.
</P>
<P>
	   When the education commission recently asked a small group of students why
they leave, most freshmen - especially top students - responded they were
attracted to the reputations of out-of-state schools and said they wanted to
attend school away from home. Many also said other colleges and universities
recruit heavily in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Heidi White, a student member of the commission, said so far she has
received only one recruitment letter from a New Jersey school - Rutgers
University - among the stack of letters she has received from out-of-state
colleges. The Burlington County College student said the state will continue to
lose students as long as local colleges don't express interest in them.
</P>
<P>
	   White, who expects to graduate from Burlington County College this fall and
transfer to a four-year college, also said she saw few New Jersey schools at a
recent college fair for community college students.
</P>
<P>
	   Another student, Camose Thomassini, who attends Essex County College, said
she had little loyalty to New Jersey in choosing a four-year college.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jersey City resident plans to study international relations and said she
will apply to Rutgers, but her top choice is New York University, which was the
second most popular school in the 1996 study.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomassini also said she will likely choose the institution that offers her
the best financial aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said an early solution to the brain drain would be to
increase recruitment efforts. Another idea would be to offer a full college
tuition to high school students graduating with a certain grade point average
who chose to attend an in-state college.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, other commission members have wondered if students are leaving the
state because of the lack of Division I college sports teams. The out-of-state
schools most popular to students who leave often have top sports programs, said
Alfred Cade, the commission's chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said they don't know when the study will be completed.

<HEADLINE> Newark protesters say Diallo verdict reinforces their own fears of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Protesters assembled on Board Street Saturday to
shout their anger about the New York verdict acquitting four police officers of
a crime in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo a year ago.
<P>
	   Some said they wanted to protest in New Jersey instead of traveling to New
York to join events there because they said they fear New Jersey police, and
they can cite their own cases of police shootings that anger them as much as the
Diallo slaying in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am here because he was a man like me, and he wasn't doing anything, and
it could have been me, it could have been my son," said Newark resident Abdul
Sharif, 44. His son is 15, and Sharif said he counsels him on avoiding conflict
with police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rally organizer Lawrence Hamm, head of the People Organized for Progress
activist group, said the Diallo shooting unifies angry Americans nationwide,
black or white.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally drew a mixed group: blacks, whites, Latinos, teenagers, fathers in
their 40s and 50s, mothers with small children, veteran activists and passersby
who joined in spontaneously to chant and cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters cited local cases like the death of Earl Faison in
neighboring Orange two months after the Diallo shooting. Faison died while in
police custody after the slaying of a police officer, a crime for which another
man has been convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to heightened tensions at some events in New York City since the
Diallo verdict was announced in Albany on Friday, there were no flare-ups or
arrests here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A cooperative tone prevailed as Hamm and Police Chief Anthony Ambrose shook
hands while planning how best to keep order and march safely down Broad Street
to the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters began by marching in a circle near Market Street outside a
boarded up Woolworth Store, a former neighborhood institution that has become a
favorite for such events.
</P>
<P>
	   After almost two hours, the rally reached a peak of some 150 people who then
formed a column and, with a tight escort of police motorcycles, moved down Broad
Street to a plaza outside the federal building. There they had room to crowd
into a semicircle to chant and listen to speeches from activists such as
playwright-poet Amiri Baraka before dispersing shortly after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordinary residents took turns at the bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark resident John Houston, 49, said, "If you don't get off your butt and
come out here, you can't criticize from the sidelines."
</P>
<P>
	   "I missed the '60s. I was serving in Vietnam," said Houston, an ex-Marine.
"This is my '60s."

<HEADLINE> Cuba Envoy Defies Departure Order  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Cuban diplomat ignored a State Department demand that
he leave the country and proclaimed himself on a hunger strike Saturday to
contest allegations linking him with a U.S. immigration official charged with
spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FBI made plans for taking the defiant official into custody, and he
was expected to be put on plane out of Washington Saturday night, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have been absolutely cleared
of the accusations brought against me,'' said Jose Imperatori, 46, less than
three hours before the State Department's deadline for him to leave the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   This past week, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Imperatori
could be subject to arrest once his diplomatic immunity had expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori met with reporters at his apartment in a suburban Maryland
neighborhood that is home to all the small number of Cuban diplomats assigned to
Washington. His decision not to return came as no surprise, as Cuban officials
signaled all week they had no intention of abiding by the deportation order.
</P>
<P>
	   The impasse once again underscored the palpable mistrust between the two
governments, which seems to increase with time.
</P>
<P>
	   A gaunt man, Imperatori spoke in a loud, clear voice and with indignation
about his supposed illicit links with Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born 34-year
veteran of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who has been charged with
spying.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was introduced to reporters by Kurt Schmoke, a former mayor of
Baltimore who has been retained by the Cuban government to defend the diplomat.
After his remarks, Imperatori refused to take questions. Schmoke said his client
planned a liquids-only diet until his name is cleared.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at a separate news conference, Fernando Remirez, head of Cuba's
diplomatic mission, acknowledged that Imperatori had maintained contacts with
Faget but said they were no different from the kinds of aboveboard relationships
the Cuban mission maintains with many Cuban-Americans and other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after Remirez spoke, Schmoke told reporters outside Imperatori's
apartment building he expected that the diplomat would be flown to an unnamed
city late Saturday and then take a separate flight to Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   At 7 a.m. EST Saturday, Imperatori gave Remirez his resignation as consular
affairs officer, leaving him without diplomatic immunity 6 1/2 hours before the
official deadline of 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife and 3-year old son left for Cuba Friday night, as they would have
been stripped of diplomatic immunity as well by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Imperatori and Remirez were adamant in their insistence that the Cuban
Interests Section does not engage in spying and is used solely for improving
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have become the victim of a major slander,'' Imperatori said. ``The
accusation against me is totally false.''
</P>
<P>
	   Remirez also joined Imperatori in maintaining that there was a direct link
between the timing of Faget's arrest and the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez,
the six-year old Cuban who arrived unaccompanied in South Florida on Nov. 25.
Faget was arrested a few days before a scheduled court hearing on the Gonzalez
case, which was later postponed. The State Department has dismissed speculation
of such a link as ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   In their case against Faget, federal authorities said that 12 minutes after
they fed him phony information about a pending defection by a Cuban official,
they caught him passing it on to a contact with ties to the Cuban government.
Court papers also identified Imperatori as Faget's contact in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori could have used the Cuban Interests Section headquarters as a
safe haven after his diplomatic immunity lapsed. He would have been beyond the
reach of U.S. law enforcement while there, because international law proclaims
that local law does not apply at such missions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, with the concurrence and perhaps at the direction of his
government, he was remaining here as what amounts to an undocumented alien.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and jailed.'' he
said. ``My morale and my truth will be my shield.''

California's primary, a Time/CNN poll found Bush leading 48 percent to 23

Thai Provinces To Ban Caffeine

Caffeine will not be listed as a controlled substance but its shipment to the
provinces in northern Thailand close to neighboring Myanmar will be prohibited.
Myanmar, also known as Burma, is believed to be the source of most of the
methamphetamine that is flooding into Thailand. In the past few years the
stimulant has overtaken heroin as the greatest drug threat to the country,
largely because it can be made and sold cheaply.

rebound after a desperation shot by Guyton and laid it up off the glass for the
winning basket. The Spartans (21-7, 11-3 Big Ten) immediately called time out,

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Head Says Woes Overstated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez denounced the media Saturday
for acting against his ``revolution'' and exaggerating the military
controversies rocking his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, Chavez has feuded with three former comrades-in-arms who
helped him stage a failed 1992 coup. The mayor of Caracas has warned of another
impending coup, and on Friday the head of Venezuela's Military Court committed
suicide under unclear circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is terrible manipulation,'' Chavez said during a speech in the
western city of Barinas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certain owners of news media are against this project of transformation,
of revolution, so they have unleashed campaigns to manipulate everything that
happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez assumed the presidency a year ago with promises to rule in favor of
the poor. He has vastly increased the role of the military, using soldiers to
build public works and appointing officers to top government posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela, unlike many Latin American countries, has a long tradition of
military subordination to civilians, and Chavez's critics accuse him of
upsetting that balance.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez has often criticized the news media for unfair coverage, but his
one-year-old administration has largely honored freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Defense Minister Ismael Hurtado called on Venezuelans to
``respect the armed forces,'' apparently in response to recent rumblings about a
possible coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired Vice Adm. Rafael Huizi Clavier told The Associated Press he thought
a coup was ``improbable,'' but called on Chavez to stop wearing his
paratrooper's uniform in public and refrain from ``including the armed forces in
political debates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a former army paratrooper, has pushed through a new constitution
that gives soldiers the right to vote for the first time in decades.

will receive their normal pay without interruption during the shutdowns, with
some of them staying on to perform maintenance, GM spokesman Brian Akre said.

already built, rather than accumulate more -- are not unusual but can't
necessarily be predicted, Akre said.

of the midsize car market. They've also had trouble getting the word out to
customers that Saturn now makes a larger car.

rose by less than 1 percent in calendar 1999, even with the introduction of the

<HEADLINE> Sudan Says Ready for Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Sudan's Islamic government has no preconditions for
starting peace talks under an Egyptian-Libyan effort to reconcile the nation's
many opposition factions, Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Osman also reiterated that the government was ready to share power and
wealth with the exiled opposition, including southern rebels who have been
fighting for autonomy since 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Sudanese government has no preconditions as to the venue, time and
agenda of talks,'' Osman said after meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
	   He was meeting with both officials from Egypt and Libya, who last year
proposed a joint initiative to end Sudan's 17-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the day Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa met with Osman and Ali
el-Tureiki, Libya's minister of state for African affairs. The ministers
discussed the situation in Sudan, the Libyan-Egyptian initiative and the
government and opposition points of view, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Libyan-Egyptian plan calls for the government and all opposition parties
in the Sudanese conflict to appoint representatives to a committee that will
convene a national reconciliation conference. But the main southern rebel group,
Sudan People's Liberation Army, has said the Egyptian-Libyan initiative should
be integrated into a peace effort that began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the Libyan-Egyptian initiative, the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development's process focuses on the southern rebels and the Khartoum
government. IGAD is a group of seven East African nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States backs the IGAD process. Libya, Egypt and Sudan have agreed
that both peace initiatives should be coordinated.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern opposition groups want democratic rule in Sudan, while southerners,
led by the Sudan People's Liberation Army, seek more autonomy for the largely
Christian and animist south. Nearly 2 million Sudanese have died in fighting or
war-related famine.

<HEADLINE> Basque Conflict Splits Protesters  </HEADLINE>
   By KERNAN TURNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched Saturday
through the streets of three major cities, some protesting recent killings
blamed on Basque separatists and others demonstrating support for the
independence the separatists advocate.
</P>
<P>
	   A car bomb Tuesday killed Fernando Buesa, a Socialist politician and
outspoken critic of the main separatist group, ETA, and his police bodyguard.
Thousands of Spaniards protested Wednesday, including an estimated 60,000 in
Vitoria, capital of the northern Basque region. Saturday's combined marches
appeared even larger.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vitoria, demonstrators Saturday split into two groups, one led by
regional President Juan Jose Ibarretxe and political parties that favor
independence, but oppose ETA's violent methods. Their banner demanded, ``We Need
Peace. Respect for Life. ETA Stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   Behind them, in the second march, Buesa's widow and three grown children
walked behind a white banner with the red-lettered slogan: ``No More. ETA no.''
</P>
<P>
	   Disagreement over the wording of the lead banner led to the split in the
demonstration, evidence of the continued divisiveness of the Basque conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain's mainstream Madrid-based parties, the governing center right Popular
Party and the leading opposition Socialist party felt Ibarretxe's banner was too
weak and drew up their alternative.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 50,000 demonstrators protested the car bomb killings in the neighboring
Navarra capital of Pamplona, which is outside the Basque region but considered
part of the Basque Country by independence advocates.
</P>
<P>
	   And further north in the coastal Basque town of San Sebastian, a
demonstration of several thousand supporters of Herri Batasuna, the political
wing of ETA, called for a boycott of Spanish national elections March 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased ties between Ibarretxe's nationalist party and Herri Batasuna
helped bring about a 14-month cease-fire by ETA, which ended in December after
talks with the government in Madrid broke off.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's car bomb attack was the second blamed on ETA since it called off
the truce. The first bombing killed an army colonel last month in Madrid. That
slaying brought more than a million mourners into the streets of Madrid and
thousands of others protested in cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA, whose initials stand in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign to establish a
sovereign state carved out of parts of northern Spain and southwestern France.

<HEADLINE> State officials to look into why students don't attend college  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State education officials have launched a formal
study to learn why so many New Jersey college students are leaving the state,
despite its ranking among the top 10 states in merit aid.
<P>
	   The Commission on Higher Education announced Friday that the study will
focus on the higher education brain drain to learn how to keep students in the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   The topic hasn't been thoroughly examined since the last study was conducted
in 1996, and more data is needed, said Judy Savage, the commission's assistant
director of communications.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the 1996 statistics, 37 percent of New Jersey college freshmen,
including 57 percent of those attending four-year schools, chose to attend
out-of-state schools.
</P>
<P>
	   About 24,000 freshmen choose out-of-state colleges each year, compared with
only 4,400 students enrolling in New Jersey - the highest net loss of college
students in the nation, according to figures reported in Saturday's editions of
The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1996 study also indicates colleges and universities in Pennsylvania, New
York, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia attracted the most New Jersey
students.
</P>
<P>
	   The five most popular out-of-state schools were the University of Delaware,
New York University, University of Maryland-College Park, Boston University and
Villanova University. About 2,300 students from New Jersey attended those five
schools, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
	   Education officials are concerned because the students left despite nearly
$15 million in merit scholarships designed to entice them to attend one of 56
colleges and universities in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a whole marketing image that needs an overhaul," said John Kelly, a
member of the education commission.
</P>
<P>
	   When the education commission recently asked a small group of students why
they leave, most freshmen - especially top students - responded they were
attracted to the reputations of out-of-state schools and said they wanted to
attend school away from home. Many also said other colleges and universities
recruit heavily in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Heidi White, a student member of the commission, said so far she has
received only one recruitment letter from a New Jersey school - Rutgers
University - among the stack of letters she has received from out-of-state
colleges. The Burlington County College student said the state will continue to
lose students as long as local colleges don't express interest in them.
</P>
<P>
	   White, who expects to graduate from Burlington County College this fall and
transfer to a four-year college, also said she saw few New Jersey schools at a
recent college fair for community college students.
</P>
<P>
	   Another student, Camose Thomassini, who attends Essex County College, said
she had little loyalty to New Jersey in choosing a four-year college.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jersey City resident plans to study international relations and said she
will apply to Rutgers, but her top choice is New York University, which was the
second most popular school in the 1996 study.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomassini also said she will likely choose the institution that offers her
the best financial aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said an early solution to the brain drain would be to
increase recruitment efforts. Another idea would be to offer a full college
tuition to high school students graduating with a certain grade point average
who chose to attend an in-state college.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, other commission members have wondered if students are leaving the
state because of the lack of Division I college sports teams. The out-of-state
schools most popular to students who leave often have top sports programs, said
Alfred Cade, the commission's chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said they don't know when the study will be completed.

<HEADLINE> Journalism Prize Winners Announced  </HEADLINE>
    By SANDRA MARTINEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A reporting team from The St. Petersburg Times in Florida
and a reporter from the Savannah Morning News in Georgia won the annual Jesse
Laventhol Prizes announced Saturday by the American Society of Newspaper
Editors.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Georgia newspaper, Leonora Bohen LaPeter won the $10,000 Laventhol
Prize for reporting on deadline by an individual for her stories about the trial
of a regionally notorious killer. "She delivered a riveting and human picture,
in a very humane and conversational tone, that was based on horrific testimony,"
the judges said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the category of deadline reporting by a team, the Times was honored for
its coverage of the murder of four people at a Tampa hotel last December. The
$10,000 prize will be shared by Times reporters Steve Huettel, Linda Gibson,
Kathryn Wexler, Leanora Minai and David Karp.
</P>
<P>
	   Each year, the society selects in addition to the Laventhol laureates four
winners of ASNE Distinguished Writing Awards, each with a $2,500 stipend. All
six awards will be presented April 14 in Washington at this year's ASNE
convention.
</P>
<P>
	   The ASNE Foundation -- supported by gifts from ASNE members, newspaper
companies and foundations -- finances the Writing Award prizes, and the Poynter
Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., administers the
competition.
</P>
<P>
	   The six winners were selected from 500 entries submitted by news
organizations throughout the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The Distinguished Writing Awards winners are:
</P>
<P>
	   --Cynthia Tucker of The Atlanta Constitution, for commentary or column
writing that included commentary on Jesse Jackson's visit to Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, and the alliance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s family with a shady
political figure.
</P>
<P>
	   --Dianne Donovan of the Chicago Tribune, for editorial writing about
subjects ranging from the blue moon to Ralph Ellison, author of "Invisible Man."
</P>
<P>
	   --Mitchell Zuckoff of The Boston Globe, for nondeadline writing. He penned a
series of articles on one family's emotional journey from prenatal genetic
testing to the birth of their Down Syndrome-afflicted child.
</P>
<P>
	   --Michael Dobie of Newsday, for diversity writing. His series, "Race and
Sports in High School," examined how sports can foster friendship between
ethnically and racially diverse players.
</P>
<P>
	   With almost 900 members, ASNE is the principal organization of American
newspaper editors. It sponsors activities in areas including open government,
freedom of the press, journalism credibility and ethics, newsroom managing,
diversity and readership.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards were for work completed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jesse Laventhol Prizes are named in honor of a Philadelphia newspaperman
and endowed by his son, David Laventhol, publisher of the Columbia Journalism
Review.

<HEADLINE> Anger, determination in wake of Diallo verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Anger and frustration seethed in parts of the city
Saturday as New Yorkers struggled to absorb news that the four police officers
who killed an African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets were acquitted of all
criminal charges.
<P>
	   In Harlem, 350 people who crammed into the Rev. Al Sharpton's National
Action Network headquarters for an emotional rally a day after the verdicts
expressed fury that Amadou Diallo's death had gone unpunished.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours later, more than 2,500 protesters marched down Fifth Avenue in midtown
Manhattan, shouting "Killer cops have got to go!" and blocking traffic at times.
About 40 people were arrested when they sat down in the street near St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Sharpton rally, shouts rose from the audience: "Murderers!" "Racist
cops!" "We want justice!"
</P>
<P>
	   But a hush fell over the room when Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo,
approached the podium. As she began to thank the audience in a soft voice for
the support they had given her family, listeners cried out "Thank you!" and "We
love you!"
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Diallo said that after sitting through nearly a month of trial
testimony and arguments, she still could not understand why her son died. The
defense argument that her son's actions had drawn the officers' attention and
led them to believe he had a gun caused her particular anguish, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The crime that they committed is to consider my son suspicious," she said.
"That was the first crime. ... Our whole family are wondering why they said that
everything that happened was because of Amadou's fault. Because we know he was a
nice kid."
</P>
<P>
	   Although frustrated by the acquittals, she expressed hope that some good
might come of her son's death if it inspired people to fight against police
brutality and improve understanding between police and citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's about justice," she said. "Nothing can replace Amadou, ... but if his
cause can help clarify this situation, ... so that the people can live in peace,
I think that would be a great honor for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have avoided the media since the verdict, but juror Thomas Knowles,
who answered the door at his upstate home, said the group was considering
issuing a statement or speaking publicly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been hell," he said, referring to the barrage of interview requests
from reporters. He would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Many at the Harlem rally - where speakers included Rep. Charles Rangel, Rep.
Jose Serrano, Sharpton and New York Civil Liberties Union executive director
Norman Siegel - echoed Mrs. Diallo's assertion that her son was a victim of
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton vowed to press on with legal action in the case, calling for
federal criminal civil rights charges against the officers and saying he hoped
Diallo's death would help improve the way police forces deal with black and
Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to use this Amadou Diallo case to stop this in these United
States once and for all," he said. "Just like we needed the federal government
to come into Alabama and Mississippi 30 years ago, we need the federal
government to come into New York to deal with the police today."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton compared the case to the 1991 videotaped beating of black Los
Angeles motorist Rodney King, where federal prosecutors won convictions of two
officers. If federal charges were appropriate in that case, where no shots were
fired, they were even more necessary in Diallo's death, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was Rodney King multiplied by lead," he shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton announced plans for a Sunday rally at the United Nations and
another demonstration Thursday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours after the Harlem rally, a small protest in midtown turned into
an impromptu Fifth Avenue march of more than 2,500. Some members of the mostly
young, multiracial crowd taunted police who tried to keep them on sidewalks.
They marched south from 59th Street to Houston Street, where some protesters
were throwing trash cans and blocking traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators chanted "Whose streets? Our streets!" and "It's a wallet, not
a gun," a reference to the officers' contention that they mistook Diallo's
wallet for a gun. Many held wallets in their air and yelled "Don't shoot!"
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just outraged," said marcher Bruce Kayton, 40. "This is just the most
blatant shooting of an unarmed black person, but it's not the only one. ... If
the races were reversed, they would have been probably calling for the death
penalty."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, outside Diallo's Bronx home, where several hundred gathered after
the verdicts were announced, 50 or so people milled, burning with indignation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a different set of justice, some for us, some for them," said a man
who lived in Diallo's neighborhood and identified himself only as Lamarr H.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I say us, I mean people of color," he continued. "Somebody has to pay
for this. If not, it's like saying 'Anytime you feel threatened by a black man,
you shoot first and you ask questions later.' I'm feeling the pain. I'm feeling
all the anger. ... That could have been me."
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said the officers never would have shot Diallo if he'd been white,
but he assured Kadiatou Diallo that her son's death would not be for nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This man died so that we can have a better America," said the congressman.

<HEADLINE> Two Step Aside From Clinton Cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Two members of an Arkansas Supreme Court committee
who could hear ethics complaints against President Clinton have stepped aside
from the cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlton Bailey and Richard Reid have notified the Supreme Court Committee on
Professional Conduct that they won't participate in matters relating to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's executive director, James Neal, released a letter Friday
making public the recusals, which usually are kept secret.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three complaints have been filed seeking a review of Clinton's law
license, citing his conduct during former Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
investigation of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, a former law professor at the University of Arkansas, has been
licensed to practice law in his home state since Sept. 7, 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Neal did not give reasons why the two were stepping aside. Bailey, 52, is an
associate professor of law at the University of Arkansas. Reid, 67, is a lawyer
in private practice.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush in Va. Campaign Frenzy  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB LEWIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- With polls indicating a tightening race, Sen. John
McCain increased up campaign appearances and advertising in Virginia in an
effort to overtake Texas Gov. George W. Bush in Tuesday's Republican
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign on Saturday added a rally Sunday evening in Alexandria to
complement a weekend television blitz. He is also scheduled to hold a town hall
meeting Monday at a Virginia Beach high school.
</P>
<P>
	   His new offensive came as a poll released Friday showed Bush leading by
eight percentage points. Another poll, released Thursday, showed Bush ahead by
11 points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's because the sweet smell of success is in the air,'' said Dennis
Peterson, McCain's Virginia campaign director. ``The polling information we have
been made aware of is extremely encouraging in that it shows continued momentum
toward McCain. We were 21 points down here at the time of the New Hampshire
primary, and since then the campaign has made nothing but progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator made a heavy weekend purchase of television time in the
Washington, D.C., area in an effort to reach its northern Virginia suburbs, the
state's most populous region. Until now, he had limited his TV advertising to
markets elsewhere in the state where airtime is less expensive, especially the
Hampton Roads region with a high percentage of veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has already been advertising heavily in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign, meanwhile, put its volunteers to work Saturday following a
barnstorming tour of the state by Bush on Friday. Former Gov. George F. Allen
exhorted Bush supporters in Richmond to personally deliver campaign brochures to
200,000 households before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor also gained the endorsement of another state GOP leader,
further solidifying Bush's strength among Virginia's GOP leadership. Morton
Blackwell, the GOP national committeeman from Virginia, had previously supported
Steve Forbes, who had quit the race.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP primary is an open one, meaning that non-Republicans also can vote.
But voters must sign a pledge that they will not take part in another party's
nominating process.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of crossover votes has been a contentious one during the Virginia
campaign. McCain's victory in Michigan was the result of a large turnout by
Democrats, all of whom overwhelmingly supported McCain. Virginia Republicans
last year voted to require the loyalty oath to discourage outsiders from
sabotaging an early-season primary that they felt would give the state more say
in the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In the poll released Thursday, by Mason Dixon Polling &AMP; Research Inc. of
Washington, Bush was favored by 48 percent of the Virginia respondents to 37
percent for McCain. Three percent supported Alan Keyes and 12 percent were
undecided. The poll was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday and had a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's poll, by the American Research Group, showed Bush with 44 percent
and McCain with 36 percent. That poll, also with a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points, was done Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Descends 10,000 Feet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Balloonist Kevin Uliassi descended nearly 10,000 feet over
the mid-Atlantic early Saturday to get on course in his effort to make the first
solo hot air balloon trip around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi dropped his balloon from 24,000 feet to 14,800 feet to avoid an air
current that would take him too far south, said his spokesman, Peter Fay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he stayed at his original altitude, he would be swung toward South
America, rather than remaining on course for Africa,'' Fay said. Scott Lorenz,
another spokesman, said Uliassi hopes to reach Mauritania on the African coast
by Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lorenz said Uliassi later ascended to an altitude of 25,500 feet and was
about 1,600 miles west of Africa, near the Tropic of Cancer. He was traveling at
51 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi, 36, an engineer and architect from Scottsdale, Ariz., has traveled
more than 4,100 miles since leaving Tuesday from his native Illinois. He hopes
to complete the journey in 14 to 20 days.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Suriname Dictator Condemns Unions  </HEADLINE>
   By LEO MORPURGO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) -- Former dictator Desi Bouterse denounced
Suriname's restless labor unions during a rally to commemorate the 1980 coup
that brought him to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Development in the South American country is being set back by frequent
strikes by government workers, Bouterse, who is now running for president, said
during the rally Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This country suffers from an ailment which is `labor union-itis,' ''
Bouterse said. ``We must stop this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strikes have shaken the government of President Jules Wijdenbosch over the
last two years as workers demand raises to match soaring prices. Even Suriname's
Supreme Court justices recently stopped work in a successful effort to get
higher wages.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouterse's rally Friday commemorated his seizure of the government on Feb.
25, 1980, with 16 other military officers. But the event also stoked excitement
for his run for the presidency in May 25 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouterse stepped down in 1987, staged another bloodless coup in 1990, and
forged Wijdenbosch's governing coalition in 1996. Relations between the two
leaders have soured since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouterse remains the leader of his National Democratic Party, despite his
being convicted last year on drug smuggling charges in the Netherlands,
Suriname's former colonial master.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouterse lashed out at the Netherlands on Friday, calling it ``the terrible
enemy'' that ``will walk over dead bodies'' -- a reference to the Dutch-funded
guerrilla war against his former government.

<HEADLINE> Blues Singer Wins San Remo Contest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN REMO, Italy (AP) -- In the temple of Italian pop songs, a
Senegalese-Sicilian woman with a passion for American-style blues and gospel has
been chosen best young singer at the annual San Remo festival.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenny B. won the award late Friday, the next-to-the-last day of the weeklong
song contest, whose overall winner will be proclaimed Saturday night in this
resort city on Italy's northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The overall winner proclaimed Saturday night was La Piccola Orchestra Avion
Travel (The Small Orchestra Air Travel), a six-man song-and-music group that has
been performing for 20 years. It won the 50th annual festival with the song
``Sentimento'' (Feeling).
</P>
<P>
	   The festival aims to promote Italian pop songs, which often draw heavily on
lyrics, not melody, and generally don't sell well abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenny B. is the performance name of Giovanna Bersola, 28, daughter of a man
from Senegal and a woman from Sicily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Italian news agency ANSA said her background makes her ``the portrait of
the politically correct fairy tale of the Italian daughter of a multi-racial
society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Italy, long a homogenous society which often portrayed minorities as
stereotypes, is now grappling with changing demographics, as immigrants, many of
them from Africa, come into Italy to take jobs, often menial ones like
crop-picking, that Italians shun, and settle in cities and small towns.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's San Remo festival's opening on Monday was marked by a rap song
called ``Cancel the Debt,'' by veteran Italian singer Jovanotti, who wants the
government to forgive loans owed by poor countries. Two days later, the singer,
joined by U2 leader singer Bono, who is also campaigning for debt forgiveness,
had a private meeting with Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Vent After Diallo Verdict  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Anger and frustration seethed in parts of the city Saturday
as New Yorkers struggled with the acquittal of four white police officers who
killed an unarmed African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Killer cops have got to go!'' shouted protesters as more than 2,500 people
upset about the verdict in the Amadou Diallo case marched down Fifth Avenue in
midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 people were arrested when they sat down in the street near St.
Patrick's Cathedral and blocked traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours earlier, Diallo's mother told a crowd in Harlem she hoped her son's
death would inspire people to fight against police brutality and improve
understanding between police and civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about justice,'' Kadiatou Diallo said a day after the verdicts.
``Nothing can replace Amadou, ... but if his cause can help clarify this
situation, ... so that the people can live in peace, I think that would be a
great honor for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Newark, N.J., about 150 people protested the verdicts. About 50 people
gathered outside Diallo's Bronx home, where several hundred had demonstrated
after the verdicts were announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The same indignation was evident in many of the 350 people who crammed into
the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters in Harlem for an
emotional rally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Murderers!'' they shouted. ``Racist cops!'' ``We want justice!''
</P>
<P>
	   But a hush fell over the packed room when Diallo's mother approached the
podium. As she thanked the audience in a soft voice for the support they had
given her family, listeners cried out ``Thank you!'' and ``We love you!''
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo said that after sitting through nearly a month of trial testimony and
arguments, she still could not understand why her son died. The defense argument
that her son's actions had drawn the officers' attention and led them to believe
he had a gun caused her particular anguish, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crime that they committed is to consider my son suspicious,'' she
said. ``That was the first crime. ... Our whole family are wondering why they
said that everything that happened was because of Amadou's fault. Because we
know he was a nice kid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have avoided the media since the verdict, but juror Thomas Knowles,
who answered the door at his upstate home, said the group was considering
issuing a statement or speaking publicly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been hell,'' he said, referring to the barrage of interview requests
from reporters. He would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   At the midtown Manhattan rally, people marched along Fifth Avenue, chanting
``killer cops have got to go,'' and ``it's a wallet, not a gun,'' a reference to
the four officers' assertions that they thought the wallet in Diallo's hand was
a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Some members of the mostly young, multiracial crowd taunted police who tried
to keep them on sidewalks. They marched south from 59th Street to Houston
Street, where some protesters were throwing trash cans and blocking traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just outraged ... this is just the most blatant shooting of an unarmed
black person, but it's not the only one,'' said marcher Bruce Kayton, 40. ``If
the races were reversed they would have been probably calling for the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many at the Harlem rally -- where speakers included Democratic U.S. Reps
Charles Rangel and Jose Serrano, Sharpton and New York Civil Liberties Union
executive director Norman Siegel -- echoed Diallo's mother's assertion that her
son was a victim of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton promised to press on with legal action in the case, calling for
federal criminal civil rights charges against the officers and saying he hoped
Diallo's death would help improve the way police forces deal with black and
Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to use this Amadou Diallo case to stop this in these United
States once and for all,'' he said. ``Just like we needed the federal government
to come into Alabama and Mississippi 30 years ago, we need the federal
government to come into New York to deal with the police today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton compared the case to the 1991 videotaped beating of black Los
Angeles motorist Rodney King, where federal prosecutors won convictions of two
officers. If federal charges were appropriate in that case, where no shots were
fired, they were even more necessary in Diallo's death, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was Rodney King multiplied by lead,'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton announced plans for a Sunday rally at the United Nations and
another demonstration Thursday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said the officers never would have shot Diallo if he'd been white,
but he assured Kadiatou Diallo that her son's death would not be for nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This man died so that we can have a better America,'' Rangel said.

<HEADLINE> Newark protesters say Diallo verdict reinforces their own fears of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Protesters assembled on Broad Street Saturday to
shout their anger about the New York verdict acquitting four police officers of
a crime in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo a year ago.
<P>
	   Some said they wanted to protest in New Jersey instead of traveling to New
York to join events there because they said they fear New Jersey police, and
they can cite their own cases of police shootings that anger them as much as the
Diallo slaying in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am here because he was a man like me, and he wasn't doing anything, and
it could have been me, it could have been my son," said Newark resident Abdul
Sharif, 44. His son is 15, and Sharif said he counsels him on avoiding conflict
with police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone getting shot (at) 41 times, we know that's murder. Ain't no way you
could say otherwise," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rally organizer Lawrence Hamm, head of the People Organized for Progress
activist group, said the Diallo shooting unifies angry Americans nationwide,
black or white. He said the racial profiling controversy over the New Jersey
State Police has triggered outrage over racial discrimination, but the issues in
a killing are more severe.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not just talking about stops on the (New Jersey) Turnpike. We are
talking about being murdered on your doorstep," Hamm said. "Yesterday's verdict
means no black man is safe."
</P>
<P>
	   The rally drew a mixed group: blacks, whites, Latinos, teenagers, fathers in
their 40s and 50s, mothers with small children, veteran activists and passersby
who joined in spontaneously to chant and cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters cited local cases like the death of Earl Faison in
neighboring Orange two months after the Diallo shooting. Faison died while in
police custody after the slaying of a police officer, a crime for which another
man has been convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to heightened tensions at some events in New York City since the
Diallo verdict was announced in Albany on Friday, there were no flare-ups or
arrests here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A cooperative tone prevailed as Hamm and Police Chief Anthony Ambrose shook
hands while planning how best to keep order and march safely down Broad Street
to the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters began by marching in a circle near Market Street outside a
boarded up Woolworth Store, a former neighborhood institution that has become a
favorite for such events.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men with raised fists shouted "defend yourself" and carried an American
flag that had 41 holes cut into it to represent the number of shots police fired
at Diallo, who was unarmed and was holding a wallet officers said they mistook
for a weapon. Many ralliers waved their wallets in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   After almost two hours, the rally reached a peak of some 150 people who then
formed a column and, with a tight escort of police motorcycles, moved down Broad
Street to a plaza outside the federal building. There they had room to crowd
into a semicircle to chant and listen to speeches from activists such as
playwright-poet Amiri Baraka before dispersing shortly after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Baraka called Diallo's shooting a "modern-day lynching" reminiscent of the
Ku Klux Klan, saying, "The Klan is wearing blue uniforms now."
</P>
<P>
	   When asked to comment on such remarks, police officers who standing by, many
of them black, smiled politely and declined.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordinary folks took turns at the bullhorn, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark resident John Houston, 49, said, "If you don't get off your butt and
come out here, you can't criticize from the sidelines."
</P>
<P>
	   "I missed the '60s. I was serving in Vietnam," said Houston, an ex-Marine.
"This is my '60s."
</P>
<P>
	   Forleasadon Harper, 32, of Newark had to divide her attention between the
speakers and her 22-month-old daughter, Faithe, bundled in a pink snowsuit on
the chilly, gray day.
</P>
<P>
	   Harper said the community is grieving over the verdict. "It is such
injustice," she said. "A man is gunned down, they just walk away. Nothing is
done."

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is making plans to take a defiant Cuban diplomat

	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Radio Liberty reporter Andrei Babitsky, whose
disappearance in Chechnya prompted international concern, said in television
footage aired Saturday that he had traded himself into Chechen hands in exchange
for Russian prisoners. Babitsky looked weary but spoke clearly and confidently
in the interrogation conducted Friday by a Russian officer in Makhachkala, the
capital of the Russian republic of Dagestan, on Chechnya's eastern border.
Babitsky's reporting from the rebels' side of the war has angered Russian
officials. He was detained by federal forces in Chechnya in January, after which
Russia said it exchanged him for two Russian prisoners captured by Chechens.

Floods Trap Thousands in Mozambique

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Rapidly rising floodwaters in central Mozambique
swept bodies down a swollen river Saturday and threatened to drown thousands of
other people clinging to trees and rooftops. Officials hoped to get rescue
helicopters Sunday to the Save River Valley. The government estimated 17,000
people in the valley were in danger from water levels that reportedly rose
several feet in a matter of hours. Aid workers, hampered by washed-out bridges
and roads everywhere, can't cope with the scale of the disaster. Three weeks

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A poll released today shows Texas Gov. George W. Bush
maintains a large approval margin over Arizona Sen. John McCain among
Republicans nationally and in all-important California, despite his loss in
Michigan and Arizona primaries last week. Among likely Republican voters in
California's primary, a Time/CNN poll found Bush leading 48 percent to 23
percent. McCain held a slight but statistically insignificant edge over the
Texas governor among Democrats and people without declared party preferences,
but only registered Republicans' votes will count in the GOP race anyway.

Amtrak To Add More Passenger Routes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak intends to avert liquidation with a dramatic new
plan to expand passenger service, tap into the business of shipping refrigerated
produce and increase mail and freight service, Amtrak officials said today. The
expansion would include a luxury, transcontinental route between New York and
Los Angeles and more Midwestern routes from the hub city of Chicago, Thompson
said. For years, Amtrak has relied on government subsidies to stay on track.
Under the 1997 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, Congress created the Amtrak
Reform Council to monitor the railway's performance. It imposed a 2002 deadline
for Amtrak to wean itself from government subsidies or face possible
liquidation.

	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush won the first four of more than two dozen
delegates to the Republican National Convention being chosen in four
presidential contests being held this weekend in U.S. territories.
</P>
<P>
	   Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands each had four delegates at stake
during separate caucuses Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush won all four in the Virgin Islands, said the territory's Republican
committeeman, Holland Redfield II.

	   Republicans met on the islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, but
Redfield declined to give a breakdown of how they voted during the closed
assemblies.

	   Republicans from Puerto Rico will commit 14 delegates on Sunday at their
winner-take-all primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was expected to win all the delegates from this
weekend's contests, despite growing support for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
particularly in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had 67 delegates heading into the weekend races, compared to the 96
earned by McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   A candidate needs 1,034 delegates to win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While residents of the U.S. territories may participate in primaries and
caucuses, they are not allowed to vote in the presidential general election.

<P>
	   His new offensive came as a poll released Friday showed Bush leading by
eight percentage points. Another poll, released Thursday, showed Bush ahead by
11 points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's because the sweet smell of success is in the air,'' said Dennis
Peterson, McCain's Virginia campaign director. ``The polling information we have
been made aware of is extremely encouraging in that it shows continued momentum
toward McCain. We were 21 points down here at the time of the New Hampshire
primary, and since then the campaign has made nothing but progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator made a heavy weekend purchase of television time in the
Washington, D.C., area in an effort to reach its northern Virginia suburbs, the
state's most populous region. Until now, he had limited his TV advertising to
markets elsewhere in the state where airtime is less expensive, especially the
Hampton Roads region with a high percentage of veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has already been advertising heavily in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign, meanwhile, put its volunteers to work Saturday following a
barnstorming tour of the state by Bush on Friday. Former Gov. George F. Allen
exhorted Bush supporters in Richmond to personally deliver campaign brochures to
200,000 households before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor also gained the endorsement of another state GOP leader,
further solidifying Bush's strength among Virginia's GOP leadership. Morton
Blackwell, the GOP national committeeman from Virginia, had previously supported
Steve Forbes, who had quit the race.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP primary is an open one, meaning that non-Republicans also can vote.
But voters must sign a pledge that they will not take part in another party's
nominating process.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of crossover votes has been a contentious one during the Virginia
campaign. McCain's victory in Michigan was the result of a large turnout by
Democrats, all of whom overwhelmingly supported McCain. Virginia Republicans
last year voted to require the loyalty oath to discourage outsiders from
sabotaging an early-season primary that they felt would give the state more say
in the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In the poll released Thursday, by Mason Dixon Polling &AMP; Research Inc. of
Washington, Bush was favored by 48 percent of the Virginia respondents to 37
percent for McCain. Three percent supported Alan Keyes and 12 percent were
undecided. The poll was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday and had a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's poll, by the American Research Group, showed Bush with 44 percent
and McCain with 36 percent. That poll, also with a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points, was done Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Matthew Shepard Show Opens in Wyo.  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- One town's reaction to the murder of Matthew Shepard was
center stage Saturday as the curtain rose on the world premiere of ``The Laramie
Project,'' a unique collaboration between a New York-based theater troupe and
the people of Laramie, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The play about the death of the gay University of Wyoming student was the
brainchild of Moises Kaufman, founder of the Tectonic Theater Project, whose
members collaborated on the drama now on view at the Denver Center Theater
through April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The production was a monumental effort involving 18 months of preparation,
including six trips by members of the company to Laramie for interviews with
scores of residents and friends of the 21-year-old Shepard. Their thoughts and
opinions were pieced together by the troupe, working under the guidance of
Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, a company member who put together the script.
</P>
<P>
	   Shepard's death in October 1998 received national attention. He was beaten,
hung on a fence in a lonely prairie field and left to die. Two young men, Aaron
McKinney and Russell Henderson, are serving life sentences for the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaufman has called the murder ``a watershed event,'' one that captured what
this nation is and where it is going as a society.
</P>
<P>
	   In that respect, it echoes, Kaufman says, his best-known work, ``Gross
Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' which had a long New York run, as
well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The play, which chronicled Wilde's downfall, was based, in part, on trial
transcripts, trials that eventually send the homosexual Wilde to prison for
``gross indecency.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that shocked me about the trials of Oscar Wilde was that in
reading the transcripts, you did not only see the story of this man's downfall
but you saw exactly where Victorian society was at in terms of class, gender,
sexuality, the monarchy, imperialism, capitalism,'' Kaufman has said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And I think that in the same way, Matthew Shepard's beating, cruel
victimization and murder, did a similar thing.''

<HEADLINE> Robots Study N.Y. Radiation Leak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Remote control robots began probing faulty steam generators
at the Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant Saturday to determine the cause and
extent of a radiation leak earlier this month, Consolidated Edison officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The robots, which are several inches long and resemble thin cylinders, were
dropped into steam generator tubes. They are expected to help determine whether
the generators should be replaced and when the plant can be reopened, said
Robert Leonard, a Consolidated Edison spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once we have a couple weeks of information and digest it, we're going to
know a lot more about our options,'' said Stephen Quinn, vice president of Con
Edison, which owns and operates the plant about 35 miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   A brief leak of radioactive steam into the air on Feb. 15 forced Con Edison
to issue an alert -- the second of four ascending levels of nuclear emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   The utility has said the accident never posed a serious public threat. But
residents have complained they weren't immediately notified of the leak.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspection of the plant is expected to take 28 days.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop Defends Pius XII Action  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Pope Pius XII was right not to publicly condemn the
Holocaust, because the Nazi reaction to such a statement could have cost even
more Jewish lives, the papal representative in the Holy Land said in an
interview broadcast Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Archbishop Pietro Sambi's statement, a month before Pope John Paul II's
planned March 20 visit here, was likely to aggravate the resentment many
Israelis, particularly Holocaust survivors, feel towards the Catholic church for
its failure to publicly condemn Nazism.
</P>
<P>
	   Sambi told Israel's Channel 1 television that the pope does not have to
apologize for Pius XII's conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Pius XII did not denounce the Nazi regime in public he was able to
save the lives of many Jews, and many Catholic institutions put themselves at
risk to do so, Sambi said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced that a great strong condemnation would have increased the
persecution of Hitler against the Jews,'' Sambi said.
</P>
<P>
	   There is a widespread feeling in Israel that the papacy could have had a
profound influence on Catholics in Germany and across Europe during the
Holocaust if it had declared that Nazism was incompatible with Christianity.
</P>
<P>
	   Television interviewer Yaacov Ahimeir said ``I'm a little stunned. In a way
you justify the conduct of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I justify totally what he (Pius XII) did to save many Jews,'' Sambi
replied without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Pope John Paul denounced Nazism in his document on the Holocaust he
did not condemn or even criticize Pius XII.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmaker Tommy Lapid, himself a Holocaust survivor, sent a reaction to
Channel 1, saying ``the Pope should apologize not only for what Pius XII did and
failed to do, but also for what Popes have done to Jews throughout the ages.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lapid, who heads a small, secularist opposition party, was referring to
persecutions including the Inquisition and the massacres of the Jews committed
by the crusaders.

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Rally Around Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rallying around one of their own, Republican governors
say they're confident in their colleague from Texas, mobilizing a show of unity
they hope will boost George W. Bush's struggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, they're brimming with free advice.
</P>
<P>
	   In town for their winter meeting, GOP governors gave Bush early and powerful
backing -- even before he declared he was running. That support helped rally the
Republican establishment around the Texas governor as the party's best chance
for taking back the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm confident we made the right decision,'' said Gov. Ed Schafer of North
Dakota, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which gathered a dozen
governors Saturday to demonstrate their unity with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all have faith and confidence in him because we know him,'' said
Virginia Gov. Gilmore, whose state holds a primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilmore said the governors backing Bush believe that his experience leading
one of the nation's largest states makes him qualified to be president.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors show no sign of bolting despite Sen. John McCain's
unexpectedly strong challenge. They say Bush has made mistakes but argue he has
time to correct them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're a pretty solid bunch. Once they're on board, they're on for the
long haul,'' said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, where Bush lost a hard-fought
race with McCain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush obviously will have to right himself, and he will,'' Gov. Mike
Leavitt, R-Utah, chairman of the National Governors' Association, said Saturday.
``It yet will turn out the way we want it to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Governors of both parties are meeting this weekend with an agenda filled
with policy issues. But politics tops the unwritten agenda, particularly for
Republicans, who are watching Bush try to regain his footing as McCain shreds
the assumption that Bush's nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic governors are relishing the intense GOP fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just absolutely delighted that the Republicans are having the
opportunity to discuss all their shortcomings,'' said Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton.
``I just hope they go right down to the wire. It looks like they are.''
</P>
<P>
	   From Republican governors, advice ranged from staying focused to allowing
them to carry more of the campaign's message.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Set the rules, but let us do it our way at home,'' said Schafer.
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota's holds its caucuses Tuesday, but Schafer can't figure out why
he hasn't been more involved in the Bush campaign. ``How come I'm not doing a
radio spot encouraging people to go out and vote, and using my image or my trust
or whatever I have with the voters to spread the Bush message?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Schafer plans to deliver a cautionary message to his colleagues. Too many
governors assumed that it was enough to turn over lists of party activists and
volunteers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's entire operation has been second-guessed since he lost primaries in
Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday. Supporters questioned, among other things,
spending $1 million on ads in Arizona, McCain's home turf. And Connecticut Gov.
John Rowland bluntly said that it was stupid to visit Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, which lost its tax exempt status for failing to admit blacks and
whose namesake once labeled the Catholic Church a ``satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like other GOP governors, New Jersey's Christine Todd Whitman is confident
Bush will win the GOP nomination. But she worries that the visit to Bob Jones
University and other efforts to appeal to the most conservative voters will come
back to bite Bush in the general election, when candidates will be fighting for
voters in the political center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to put together a coalition that can win in
the fall,'' Whitman said. ``It can be dangerous if you start to marginalize
yourself in any way.'' Asked if Bush has done just that, she said: ``I don't
think that's happened in any kind of irretrievable way.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, governors say, these controversies, along with constant
bickering over which candidate is most guilty of negative campaigning, have
distracted Bush from his core messages on taxes, education and opportunity for
all.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush lost Michigan, Schafer said, ``because we were fighting about who said
what first and who hit who first in the sandbox.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign may be getting the message, Engler said. He applauded the move
late this week to have Gilmore talk about the McCain camp's phone calls to
voters suggesting that Bush is anti-Catholic, freeing Bush to talk about his
core issues. Still, Bush talked more about those calls on Friday, again
denouncing McCain for them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our message to him,'' Leavitt said, ``is to stay focused on his message of
reform and not to get caught up in the sidebar stories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then again, he remembered in 1996 when Republican nominee Bob Dole met with
the 17 Republican governors, each of whom took a turn at offering advice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By the time you got around to all 17, there' s just no way he could have
even remembered all the advice, let alone accepted it,'' Leavitt said. ``We're
probably compulsive advice givers. We can't stop ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Courts Ohio Republicans  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The invitation to John McCain's rally in Cleveland
contained a not-so-subtle suggestion from the campaign: Don't put just any
slogan on your campaign sign. Write, ``Republicans for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Moore didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of in-your-face,'' said the public relations officer, a McCain
supporter, while waiting to shake the senator's hand at Cleveland's popular West
Side Market.
</P>
<P>
	   As McCain and his Republican presidential rival George W. Bush turn their
attention to Ohio and other Super Tuesday primary states, the Arizona senator's
campaign believes it cannot afford to be subtle -- especially in its appeal to
core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   He invokes Ronald Reagan and courts non-Republicans in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a proud conservative Republican,'' he declared to several thousand
residents crammed around the market's produce tent on an unseasonably balmy day.
``But I also say to you that I want independents, Democrats, Libertarians,
vegetarians!''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, McCain autographed copies of his autobiography at a bookstore in
Cincinnati and told reporters on his bus: ``I think we can carry New York, Ohio
and California. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Bush has carried the vast majority of Republican support in the
primaries and polls, even as McCain racks up victories in New Hampshire, Arizona
and Michigan thanks to moderate Republicans and crossover votes from Democrats
and independents in open contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Both McCain and Bush, who is scheduled to campaign in Washington state on
Sunday and Ohio on Monday, are airing ads that mention former President Reagan,
a GOP icon.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the Bush campaign is targeting voting blocs who have supported McCain,
too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Strategically, you're going to see us reach out and make inroads in the
center and challenge him on his claim that he's like Ronald Reagan,'' Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer said Saturday. ``He's got a real Republican problem and
he's going to have a hard time fixing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek magazine poll found Bush has a 56 percent to 27 percent lead over
McCain nationally among registered Republicans and those likely to vote
Republican. And 62 percent said Bush was more likely to beat the Democratic
nominee in the general election, down from 73 percent in a poll in early
February, compared with 27 percent for McCain, 8 percentage points higher than
before.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP race has taken on a harsh tone, with the Texas governor deriding
McCain for hiring phone banks to tell voters about Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University, a school in South Carolina that doesn't allow interracial dating and
is seen by some critics as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ronald Reagan never said one thing and then did another, and McCain has a
proven propensity to say one thing and do another, like saying you're going to
run a clean campaign and then turn around and run a bunch of anti-Catholic phone
calls,'' Bush said in Virginia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia and Washington state hold open primaries on Tuesday and North
Dakota Republicans hold caucuses, a week before coast-to-coast March 7 contests
in 13 states, including Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   In Virginia, where 56 delegates are at stake, voters must sign a nonbinding
pledge not to participate in any other party's nomination process, which could
hurt McCain among Democrats and independents. In Washington, 12 delegates will
be awarded, and 19 in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain planned a long day of campaigning on Monday with stops scheduled in
Virginia, Washington state and California, where he's 25 points behind Bush in a
new Time/CNN poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, who was at McCain's side Saturday, worried that
Democrats and independents might not cross over for McCain in the GOP primary
because the Democratic voting is held the same day -- a potential March 7
problem for McCain nationwide in open contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also has organizations in each of Ohio's 88 counties, while McCain is
relying on news reports to build support and turn out voters. DeWine said
McCain's tour through Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati passed through three TV
broadcast markets that reach 80 percent of the state's residents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There really wasn't a race in Ohio until Thursday night,'' when McCain's
commercial went on the air,'' DeWine said. ``Organization doesn't matter here.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the multiethnic West Side Market, where vendors hawk everything from
bratwurst to butterscotch pie, McCain bought beef jerky. He and his wife Cindy
signed autographs and shook hands with residents and shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter Ehrnfelt, whose family has run a butcher shop at the market since
1912, said he'd seen Reagan, Rosalynn Carter and President Bush pass through the
market -- but not candidate Bush, so far.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They say John McCain is one of the boys, and that he speaks to you
straight, and that Bush doesn't have that same kind of feeling,'' said Ehrnfelt,
mayor of nearby Strongsville. ``We need that kind of straight talking person (as
president) given what this country's been through lately.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later at Ohio State University's St. John Arena in Columbus, McCain took on
protesters who interrupted his town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Give us a living wage!'' several men chanted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be glad to - go to work,'' McCain replied.

	   ``I'm confident we made the right decision,'' said Gov. Ed Schafer of North
Dakota, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which gathered a dozen
governors Saturday to demonstrate their unity with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all have faith and confidence in him because we know him,'' said
Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, whose state holds a primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilmore said the governors backing Bush believe that his experience leading
one of the nation's largest states makes him qualified to be president.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors show no sign of bolting despite Sen. John McCain's
unexpectedly strong challenge. They say Bush has made mistakes but argue he has
time to correct them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're a pretty solid bunch. Once they're on board, they're on for the
long haul,'' said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, where Bush lost a hard-fought
race with McCain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush obviously will have to right himself, and he will,'' Gov. Mike
Leavitt, R-Utah, chairman of the National Governors' Association, said Saturday.
``It yet will turn out the way we want it to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Governors of both parties are meeting this weekend with an agenda filled
with policy issues. But politics tops the unwritten agenda, particularly for
Republicans, who are watching Bush try to regain his footing as McCain shreds
the assumption that Bush's nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic governors are relishing the intense GOP fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just absolutely delighted that the Republicans are having the
opportunity to discuss all their shortcomings,'' said Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton.
``I just hope they go right down to the wire. It looks like they are.''
</P>
<P>
	   From Republican governors, advice ranged from staying focused to allowing
them to carry more of the campaign's message.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Set the rules, but let us do it our way at home,'' said Schafer.
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota's holds its caucuses Tuesday, but Schafer can't figure out why
he hasn't been more involved in the Bush campaign. ``How come I'm not doing a
radio spot encouraging people to go out and vote, and using my image or my trust
or whatever I have with the voters to spread the Bush message?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Schafer plans to deliver a cautionary message to his colleagues. Too many
governors assumed that it was enough to turn over lists of party activists and
volunteers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's entire operation has been second-guessed since he lost primaries in
Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday. Supporters questioned, among other things,
spending $1 million on ads in Arizona, McCain's home turf. And Connecticut Gov.
John Rowland bluntly said that it was stupid to visit Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, which lost its tax exempt status for failing to admit blacks and
whose namesake once labeled the Catholic Church a ``satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like other GOP governors, New Jersey's Christine Todd Whitman is confident
Bush will win the GOP nomination. But she worries that the visit to Bob Jones
University and other efforts to appeal to the most conservative voters will come
back to bite Bush in the general election, when candidates will be fighting for
voters in the political center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to put together a coalition that can win in
the fall,'' Whitman said. ``It can be dangerous if you start to marginalize
yourself in any way.'' Asked if Bush has done just that, she said: ``I don't
think that's happened in any kind of irretrievable way.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, governors say, these controversies, along with constant
bickering over which candidate is most guilty of negative campaigning, have
distracted Bush from his core messages on taxes, education and opportunity for
all.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush lost Michigan, Schafer said, ``because we were fighting about who said
what first and who hit who first in the sandbox.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign may be getting the message, Engler said. He applauded the move
late this week to have Gilmore talk about the McCain camp's phone calls to
voters suggesting that Bush is anti-Catholic, freeing Bush to talk about his
core issues. Still, Bush talked more about those calls on Friday, again
denouncing McCain for them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our message to him,'' Leavitt said, ``is to stay focused on his message of
reform and not to get caught up in the sidebar stories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then again, he remembered in 1996 when Republican nominee Bob Dole met with
the 17 Republican governors, each of whom took a turn at offering advice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By the time you got around to all 17, there' s just no way he could have
even remembered all the advice, let alone accepted it,'' Leavitt said. ``We're
probably compulsive advice givers. We can't stop ourselves.''

	    Eliot A. Caplin
</P>
<P>
	   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Eliot A. Caplin, a writer who devised the plots
for a number of well-known comic strips, died Feb. 20. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Caplin cooperated with artists who produced strips like ``Heart of Juliet
Jones,'' ``Big Ben Bolt'' and ``Dr. Bobbs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Caplin was the brother of ``L'il Abner'' cartoonist Al Capp.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the brothers never collaborated on a strip, Capp conceived two
strips that he passed along to Caplin. One, ``Abbie an' Slats,'' which was drawn
by Raeburn van Burne, lasted 23 years. The other was ``Long Sam,'' drawn by Bob
Lubbers.
</P>
<P>
	   Capp shortened his name from Caplin so it would fit better in comic strips.
</P>
<P>
	   Caplin received little personal publicity because he wrote for different
feature syndicates that were not eager to promote someone who also wrote for
their competitors, his son, Donald, told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Caplin also wrote many plays, including ``Any Resemblance to Persons Living
or Dead,'' which was produced off Broadway in 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   Caplin studied at Brown University and Ohio State University. He earned a
Purple Heart in World War II after being injured aboard a minesweeper in the
Pacific.
Joji Fukushima
</P>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Joji Fukushima, the governor of Japan's southern Kumamoto
prefecture, died of a heart attack Friday, a spokesman said Saturday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
	   Fukushima died at a hospital after collapsing at a traditional Japanese inn
where he was staying, said Iwao Tsunoda, a spokesman for the Kumamoto
prefecture, or state, which is located about 550 miles southwest of Tokyo on the
island of Kyushu.
</P>
<P>
	   A member of the Liberal Democratic Party, Fukushima was elected governor in
1991 and won re-election twice, in 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming governor, Fukushima was elected six times to the national
parliament and served as labor minister in the Cabinet of former Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu.

<HEADLINE> Anger, determination in wake of Diallo verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Anger and frustration seethed in parts of the city
Saturday as New Yorkers struggled to absorb news that the four police officers
who killed an African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets were acquitted of all
criminal charges.
<P>
	   In Harlem, 350 people who crammed into the Rev. Al Sharpton's National
Action Network headquarters for an emotional rally a day after the verdicts
expressed fury that Amadou Diallo's death had gone unpunished.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours later, more than 2,500 protesters marched down Fifth Avenue in midtown
Manhattan, shouting "Killer cops have got to go!" and blocking traffic at times.
About 40 people were arrested when they sat down in the street near St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Sharpton rally, shouts rose from the audience: "Murderers!" "Racist
cops!" "We want justice!"
</P>
<P>
	   But a hush fell over the room when Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo,
approached the podium. As she began to thank the audience in a soft voice for
the support they had given her family, listeners cried out "Thank you!" and "We
love you!"
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Diallo said that after sitting through nearly a month of trial
testimony and arguments, she still could not understand why her son died. The
defense argument that her son's actions had drawn the officers' attention and
led them to believe he had a gun caused her particular anguish, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The crime that they committed is to consider my son suspicious," she said.
"That was the first crime. ... Our whole family are wondering why they said that
everything that happened was because of Amadou's fault. Because we know he was a
nice kid."
</P>
<P>
	   Although frustrated by the acquittals, she expressed hope that some good
might come of her son's death if it inspired people to fight against police
brutality and improve understanding between police and citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's about justice," she said. "Nothing can replace Amadou, ... but if his
cause can help clarify this situation, ... so that the people can live in peace,
I think that would be a great honor for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have avoided the media since the verdict, but juror Thomas Knowles,
who answered the door at his upstate home, said the group was considering
issuing a statement or speaking publicly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been hell," he said, referring to the barrage of interview requests
from reporters. He would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Many at the Harlem rally - where speakers included Rep. Charles Rangel, Rep.
Jose Serrano, Sharpton and New York Civil Liberties Union executive director
Norman Siegel - echoed Mrs. Diallo's assertion that her son was a victim of
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton vowed to press on with legal action in the case, calling for
federal criminal civil rights charges against the officers and saying he hoped
Diallo's death would help improve the way police forces deal with black and
Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to use this Amadou Diallo case to stop this in these United
States once and for all," he said. "Just like we needed the federal government
to come into Alabama and Mississippi 30 years ago, we need the federal
government to come into New York to deal with the police today."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton compared the case to the 1991 videotaped beating of black Los
Angeles motorist Rodney King, where federal prosecutors won convictions of two
officers. If federal charges were appropriate in that case, where no shots were
fired, they were even more necessary in Diallo's death, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was Rodney King multiplied by lead," he shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton announced plans for a Sunday rally at the United Nations and
another demonstration Thursday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours after the Harlem rally, a small protest in midtown turned into
an impromptu Fifth Avenue march of more than 2,500. Some members of the mostly
young, multiracial crowd taunted police who tried to keep them on sidewalks.
They marched south from 59th Street to City Hall, where the crowd was met by a
large contingent of police officers. Eventually, protesters were dispersed
without much incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators chanted "Whose streets? Our streets!" and "It's a wallet, not
a gun," a reference to the officers' contention that they mistook Diallo's
wallet for a gun. Many held wallets in their air and yelled "Don't shoot!"
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just outraged," said marcher Bruce Kayton, 40. "This is just the most
blatant shooting of an unarmed black person, but it's not the only one. ... If
the races were reversed, they would have been probably calling for the death
penalty."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, outside Diallo's Bronx home, where several hundred gathered after
the verdicts were announced, 50 or so people milled, burning with indignation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a different set of justice, some for us, some for them," said a man
who lived in Diallo's neighborhood and identified himself only as Lamarr H.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I say us, I mean people of color," he continued. "Somebody has to pay
for this. If not, it's like saying 'Anytime you feel threatened by a black man,
you shoot first and you ask questions later.' I'm feeling the pain. I'm feeling
all the anger. ... That could have been me."
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said the officers never would have shot Diallo if he'd been white,
but he assured Kadiatou Diallo that her son's death would not be for nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This man died so that we can have a better America," said the congressman.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Vent After Diallo Verdict  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of angry and frustrated New Yorkers took to the
streets Saturday to protest the acquittal of four white police officers who
killed an unarmed African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Killer cops have got to go!'' shouted a crowd of more than 2,500 people

<HEADLINE> Suspect arraigned in family attack that left two dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - After a 24-hour manhunt, police arrested a suspect
accused of a double murder and an attack on a family that left a pregnant woman
hospitalized.
<P>
	   Angel Carrasquillo, 38, was arraigned Saturday. The night before, he was
arrested when an anonymous tip led police to find him on the porch of a city
home. He ran from the officers, but was arrested without incident a few blocks
away.
</P>
<P>
	   He's been charged with two counts of second-degree murder, one count of
attempted murder, and other charges, following what police say was a seven-hour
ordeal for the victims on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrasquillo is the ex-boyfriend of Nancy Jacinto, 18, and father of her
9-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Carrasquillo stabbed Jacinto's brother, 17-year-old Rumenige
(pronounced Ru-me-nee-ge) Jacinto, to death when he tried to break up an
argument between the estranged couple.
</P>
<P>
	   Crasquillo is also accused of shooting 25-year-old Margarita Salvador in the
chest. Their bodies were found inside the apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses told police a man burst into the apartment rented by Leonardo and
Margarita Salvador, about 9 a.m. The man bound and gagged Nancy Jacinto and
Rumenige Jacinto. Nancy and Rumenige are Margarita Salvador's siblings.
</P>
<P>
	   Dalia Santos, 21, who is married to Leonardo Salvador's cousin, Julio
Salvador, 20, was confronted later by the suspect, who immediately bound and
gagged her, Syracuse police Sgt. Joe Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the suspect also stabbed Nancy Jacinto three times in the upper
chest. Jacinto, who is pregnant, escaped when the attacker chased a witness out
the back door of the apartment, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man and woman were tied up and gagged inside the apartment, and
three small children were trapped inside with them for hours, Police Capt.
Richard Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacinto was transported to University Hospital in critical condition and
underwent emergency surgery. Doctors said Friday that her condition had
stabilized and that her fetus was not injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Police believe Carrasquillo was angry about his break-up with Nancy Jacinto.
A helicopter, cruisers and police dogs combed the city looking for Carrasquillo,
who police believe lives on the west side of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   A shotgun believed to be used in the crime was found in a yard down the
street, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the normally peaceful neighborhood said the Salvadors, who have
two young children, were migrant farm workers from Mexico who had lived in the
neighborhood for six years but spoke little English.

FBI To Detain Cuban Diplomat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is planning to take defiant Cuban diplomat Jose
Imperatori into custody and put him on a plane out of Washington after he
ignored a State Department demand to leave the country. Imperatori, 46, has been
linked to a U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba. In an effort
to contest the allegation, Imperatori has declared he will be on a hunger strike
until his name is cleared. His decision not to return came as no surprise, as
Cuban officials signaled all week they had no intention of abiding by the
deportation order.

	   NEW YORK (AP)-- In his final weekend of campaigning in Washington state,
Democrat Bill Bradley is trying to regain the spotlight in the presidential
race. In New York, where Bradley is considered best known from his years on the
Knicks basketball team, the latest poll found that about half of Democrats
didn't know enough about Bradley to say whether they view him favorably or
unfavorably. Bradley plunged forward today, rallying about 400 Spokane
supporters: "This will be the launching pad and you can be the rockets that lift

Group Claims Abuses in Chechnya

	   MOZDOK, Russia (AP) -- A human rights group said Saturday it had medical
evidence that Russian troops had tortured Chechen civilians, the latest charge
to taint Russia amid a new wave of international criticism of the Chechnya war.
Russian officials denied the accusations. Moscow was still smarting from
television footage aired Friday that suggested Russian soldiers had committed
atrocities against Chechens. The grisly television footage, provided by the
German station N-24, showed a pile of male bodies in a pit, their legs bound in
wire. However, the footage showed no direct evidence of atrocities or how the
men died. Russia claimed the film was propaganda.

Stanford Study Contradicts Others

	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- A group of physicists said their Stanford
University experiment to detect so-called "dark matter" particles that hold the
universe together could contradict earlier findings by an Italian team.
Physicists have long theorized that "dark matter" particles could account for
much of the universe's mass. But new research presented yesterday by University
of California-Berkeley physicist Richard Gaitskell suggests that it is unlikely
that a Stanford University detector had found as many of the elusive particles
as an Italian experiment recorded.

today and more than 2,500 people marched down Fifth Avenue protesting the
verdict in the Amadou Diallo case. About 40 people were arrested when they sat

unarmed African immigrant, was shot down in a barrage of 41 bullets last year.
The four officers charged in the case were acquitted yesterday. Supporters of
Diallo's family promised to press on with legal action in the case, calling for
federal criminal civil rights charges against the officers.

Bahamian Resort Plan Said Harmful
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Taking his conservation battle to the Bahamas,
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said a massive resort project financed by a California
firm would damage environmental and cultural treasures in a way that would not
be allowed on the U.S. mainland. At stake are treasures ranging from two
prehistoric Lucayan Indian villages to the remains of a conch shell-walled slave
plantation and three indigenous bird species, the activist lawyer said while in
New Providence island on a three-day visit ending Saturday. The company wants to
build a luxury gated community on 600 acres on the west end of New Providence,
which encompasses 80 square miles and is the main island of the 700 that make up
the Bahamas.

	   NEW YORK (AP)-- In his final weekend of campaigning in Washington state,
Democrat Bill Bradley is trying to regain the spotlight in the presidential
race. In New York, where Bradley is considered best known from his years on the
Knicks basketball team, the latest poll found that about half of Democrats
didn't know enough about Bradley to say whether they view him favorably or

	   MOZDOK, Russia (AP) -- A human rights group said Saturday it had medical

to taint Russia amid a new wave of international criticism of the Chechnya war.
Russian officials denied the accusations. Moscow was still smarting from
television footage aired Friday that suggested Russian soldiers had committed
atrocities against Chechens. The grisly television footage, provided by the
German station N-24, showed a pile of male bodies in a pit, their legs bound in
wire. However, the footage showed no direct evidence of atrocities or how the
men died. Russia claimed the film was propaganda.

Physicists have long theorized that "dark matter" particles could account for

prehistoric Lucayan Indian villages to the remains of a conch shell-walled slave
plantation and three indigenous bird species, the activist lawyer said while in
New Providence island on a three-day visit ending Saturday. The company wants to

<HEADLINE> GOP Battle Moves to National Stage  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now things get serious.
</P>
<P>
	   The topsy-turvy Republican presidential race, fought thus far on tiny or
quirky battlegrounds, moves to the national stage with two weeks of voting in 25
states.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush hopes to hobble Sen. John McCain's campaign on the
March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' and put him away March 14, when six Bush-friendly
Southern states conduct GOP elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator hopes to clean up March 7, survive March 14 and drag the
nomination fight deep into the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Both hope to get a running start Tuesday, when Republicans make their
choices in three states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Conventional wisdom is that Bush is still in the strongest position for
the long haul,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire GOP. ``But we
all know how shaky conventional wisdom is this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign already has passed through the first-test states of Iowa, New
Hampshire and Delaware. Ultraconservative South Carolina went to Bush. And
Michigan voted McCain, although the primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain holds a slight lead over Bush in the hunt for the 1,034 delegates
needed to win the nomination. Bush holds a narrowing lead in the money chase.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going national,'' Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
	   And so are the candidates, starting with voting Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
	   NORTH DAKOTA. Bush has a clear advantage in state caucuses. McCain has not
campaigned for the state's 19 delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA. Bush leads McCain by 11 points in a recent poll. Bush's local
supporters, however, are complaining that his national brain trust is
micromanaging the campaign. Worried that Democrats and independents can upset
Bush in the open primary, his team is contacting people who voted in 1996 for
moderate Republican Sen. John Warner, who is popular in independent-minded
northern Virginia. Gov. James Gilmore, a Bush backer, has a rock-solid political
operation that will be put to the test. After Gov. John Engler's vaunted
``firewall'' collapsed in Michigan, Bush can't afford to be scorched by McCain
in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON STATE. Both campaigns say polls show them in a tight race. McCain
hopes to avail of Washington voters' independent streak. The Arizonan has a
strong organization, but Bush's is deeper. Twelve delegates will be awarded in
Tuesday's primary , 25 more in caucuses March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Bush has been on the air longer, McCain is spending almost as much as
Bush on TV ads in the run-up to Virginia and Washington, a reflection of how the
Texan's financial advantage has been virtually erased. After raising a
record-shattering $70 million, Bush now has less than $13 million in the bank.
McCain, once at a 5-to-1 disadvantage to Bush, has nearly as much money.
</P>
<P>
	   That will come in handy on March 7, when 13 states hold GOP contests:
</P>
<P>
	   CALIFORNIA. The Big Kahuna, California awards 162 delegates to the winner.
Half of McCain's ``Super Tuesday'' schedule and at least $2 million of his TV
budget are dedicated here. Bush has spent less, but plans to increase his buy.
</P>
<P>
	   News coverage may be more important than pricey advertising time, and McCain
generated a lot of attention with his Michigan victory. Working to Bush's
advantage is a closed primary, meaning only the votes of registered Republicans
will count. McCain, who won New Hampshire and Michigan with non-GOP votes, is
trying to broaden his appeal by talking about his conservative credentials. Both
candidates are airing ads comparing themselves to native son Ronald Reagan. As
elsewhere, Bush has the endorsements of the political elite, but McCain has
narrowed the governor's wide lead in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic consultant Bill Carrick of Los Angeles predicted that McCain will
get more votes than Bush but will lose the delegates when non-Republicans are
sifted out. ``Bush could lose California and win the delegates,'' Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK. The state's Byzantine election laws favor Bush and his
establishment backers, but polls show the race is not out of McCain's reach. The
Arizonan won a highly publicized ballot-access fight. Delegates are awarded to
the winner of each of the state's 31 congressional districts, thus neither
campaign is likely to leave empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be surprised if either candidate goes 31-zip,'' said New York GOP
consultant Kieran Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW ENGLAND. McCain's victory in New Hampshire gives him the edge in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Bush's team expects only Maine and
Vermont to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   GEORGIA. Bush proved in South Carolina he is popular among southern
conservatives. McCain is targeting four suburban Atlanta congressional districts
to cherry-pick delegates but won't bother elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   MARYLAND. McCain just spent $220,000 to air ads in the TV market that
straddles Virginia and Maryland. The latest poll gives Bush a wide lead, but
McCain still may make a run at the Texan with a quick visit to the state.
</P>
<P>
	   MISSOURI. Bush may be too strong. McCain tentatively plans to stay out of
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   OHIO. A critical state because all its delegates go to the winner. Bush has
another governor in his camp, Bob Taft, and polls suggest a large lead for the
Texan. It's harder than in Michigan for voters to cross over, and the state
doesn't have a history of party-switching that could help McCain. McCain will
match Bush's homestretch advertising budget and plans to make two trips to the
state. ``Bush has the edge,'' said John C. Green, political scientist at the
University of Akron. ``Of course, Bush had the edge heading into Michigan. So I
can easily see McCain winning, but he's got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   MINNESOTA. A nonbinding straw poll is drawing little attention.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON STATE. After campaigning with an eye toward Tuesday's primary
here, McCain and Bush hope to pick up an additional 25 delegates awarded in
March 7 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain believes he needs to sweep the New England states, earn a majority of
the New York delegates and win all California's delegates to offset Bush's
advantage March 14. Six states hold GOP primaries on that date, including Texas
and the home state of his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandwiched between the two big Tuesday primaries are March 10 contests in
Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.

    WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Actress Halle Berry was involved in a
hit-and-run car accident earlier this week that is being investigated by Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputies, a sheriff's spokeswoman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Berry was in a rented Chevrolet Blazer involved in a crash with another car
on Wednesday about 2 a.m., said Deputy Elisabeth Sachs.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in the other car had a broken arm and was treated at a hospital. The
31-year-old Berry sought medical treatment for undisclosed injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Sachs said it was not clear if Berry was driving or was a passenger
in the Blazer.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident was being investigated as a hit-and-run, Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a felony hit-and-run, but I don't know who was the hitter and who
was the runner," Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff's deputies impounded the rented Blazer on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sachs said neither party was arrested in connection with the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   A listing for Berry's spokesman was not available.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, Berry won for a Golden Globe for best actress in a TV miniseries
for "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge," a feature about the first black woman to be
nominated for a best actress Academy Award.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Cuban diplomat who ignored a State Department demand
that he leave the country on his own was taken into custody by U.S. authorities
Saturday evening and escorted to an airport for a flight out of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Imperatori, 46, accompanied by his lawyer, was escorted away from his
lawyer by FBI officials.
</P>
<P>
	   He was not handcuffed, or otherwise restrained.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said he was being driven to Reagan National Airport in
suburban Virginia for a flight aboard a U.S. government plane to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   From Canada, he was to catch a Sunday morning flight to Havana, the
officials said.
</P>

denounced Imperatori's pending expulsion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Down with lies! Free Elian!'' the protesters chanted at the gathering
headed by Gen. Raul Castro, Fidel Castro's brother and Cuba's Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>

mother and her boyfriend died, along with several other people, in an effort to
get from Cuba to the United States.

<P>
	   Whether he should be returned to Cuba or stay with relatives in Miami who
have taken him in has created an international furor.
</P>
<P>
	   The impasse over Imperatori's status underscored the palpable mistrust
between the U.S. and Cuban governments, which seems to increase with time.
</P>
<P>
	   A gaunt man, Imperatori spoke in a loud, clear voice and with indignation
about his supposed illicit links with Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born 34-year
veteran of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who has been charged with
spying.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at a separate news conference, Fernando Remirez, head of Cuba's
diplomatic mission, acknowledged that Imperatori had maintained contacts with
Faget but said they were no different from the kinds of aboveboard relationships
the Cuban mission maintains with many Cuban-Americans and other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   At 7 a.m. EST Saturday, Imperatori gave Remirez his resignation as consular
affairs officer, leaving him without diplomatic immunity 6 1/2 hours before the
official deadline of 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife and 3-year old son left for Cuba Friday night, as they would have
been stripped of diplomatic immunity as well by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Imperatori and Remirez were adamant in their insistence that the Cuban
Interests Section does not engage in spying and is used solely for improving
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have become the victim of a major slander,'' Imperatori said. ``The
accusation against me is totally false.''
</P>
<P>
	   Remirez also joined Imperatori in maintaining that there was a direct link
between the timing of Faget's arrest and the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez,
the six-year old Cuban who arrived unaccompanied in South Florida on Nov. 25.
Faget was arrested a few days before a scheduled court hearing on the Gonzalez
case, which was later postponed. The State Department has dismissed speculation
of such a link as ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   In their case against Faget, federal authorities said that 12 minutes after
they fed him phony information about a pending defection by a Cuban official,
they caught him passing it on to a contact with ties to the Cuban government.
Court papers also identified Imperatori as Faget's contact in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori could have used the Cuban Interests Section headquarters as a
safe haven after his diplomatic immunity lapsed. He would have been beyond the
reach of U.S. law enforcement while there, because international law proclaims
that local law does not apply at such missions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, with the concurrence and perhaps at the direction of his
government, he was remaining here as what amounts to an undocumented alien.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and jailed.'' he
said. ``My morale and my truth will be my shield.''

<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- After decades of rule by a single party, voters will
choose Sunday whether to unseat their incumbent Socialist president as signs of
unrest grow in Senegal, one of Africa's most peaceful democracies.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdou Diouf is facing seven candidates in a contest that has
sparked isolated street clashes in the past week and threatens to escalate
further.
</P>
<P>
	   For many of the bitterly poor in this West African country of 10 million
people and 2.7 million registered voters, the ballot has prompted a rallying cry
of ``Sopi!'' or ``Change!'' in the Wolof language.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet many of the European-educated elite continue to support Diouf's
Socialist Party for overseeing Senegal's transition into one of Africa's most
developed and stable nations that has held regular elections since the party
first assumed power after independence from France in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   The three main opposition leaders -- all of whom have served under Diouf's
government -- have tried to attract the masses of poor and marginalized with
promises of a better life.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition candidates say Diouf's time is up. They agree that he can
only win through electoral fraud -- a common enough occurrence in African
elections -- and accuse the president of fixing earlier votes and siphoning
millions of dollars in graft from the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdoulaye Wade, the fiery longtime rival of Diouf who was briefly imprisoned
in 1993 in connection with the killing of an electoral official, has warned of a
popular uprising if Diouf retains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Diouf has tapped into the theme of change. His campaign has posted
billboards designed by a French ad firm showing him in farmers' fields and with
smiling children with the caption: ``Changing together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police and soldiers patrolled roads Saturday and many shopkeepers were
constructing last-minute burglar bars to prevent looting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone is talking about violence. It is hard to believe that something
won't happen,'' said Aliou Ba, a local journalist in the capital of Dakar.
</P>
<P>
	   Wade's supporters clashed with police in Dakar on Friday night, radio
stations reported, saying at least one officer was wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Diouf's aides dismiss the threat of large-scale electoral violence and
predict a resounding victory, saying the opposition is divided and unorganized.
Unless one of the candidates gains a clear majority in Sunday's vote, the top
contenders will square off in a second round.
</P>
<P>
	   The other major contenders are Moustapha Niasse, the multimillionaire leader
of the Alliance of Democratic Forces, and Djibo Ka, head of the Democratic
Renewal Union party.
</P>
<P>
	   Observers from the United Nations, European Union and French-speaking
nations were overseeing the vote, although some of the candidates warned that
more observers were needed to detect wide-scale voting fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one private radio station cited electoral officials as saying
Saturday that voting materials had not been distributed yet to some parts of the
interior, meaning voting could be delayed in those regions.

<HEADLINE> Bradley backers worry that the candidate's shine is vanishing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SEATTLE (AP) - On the northwestern-most tip of Washington state, Bill
Bradley had a great crowd - 2,000 Bellingham residents rocking the ferry
building to the Rolling Stones' "Start me up!"
<P>
	   Only, he needed someone to notice.
</P>
<P>
	   In the final weekend of his go-for-broke bid for Washington, Bradley found
that a year traversing the campaign trail, millions of dollars in advertising
and an almost-win in New Hampshire (he lost by 4 percent) came down to this:
</P>
<P>
	   Hardly any national reporters bothered with his Friday rally. So, on his
cell phone, he dialed one of the two dozen journalists traveling with his
Democratic presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore. "Just wanted to say hi.
Haven't seen you in a while," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also the frustration of idling far behind in polls and name ID.
</P>
<P>
	   A new CNN/Time poll released Saturday pushed Gore even further ahead in
California, with 56 percent to Bradley's 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bradley? I know nothing about him. Not one thing. I don't even know what he
looks like," said Cleveland construction worker Rick Kekick.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, where Bradley is considered best known from his years on the
Knicks basketball team, the latest poll found that about half of Democrats
didn't know enough about Bradley to say whether they view him favorably or
unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there's Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the come-from-behind fascination who threatens to topple George W.
Bush, is honing in on Bradley's support among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been hurt by circumstance," said Spokane lawyer John Etter, a Bradley
supporter. "McCain's emergence has been unhelpful to Bradley. It's taken him off
the front pages."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley dismissed those who suggest he is wasting time in the political
wilderness of Washington. The Tuesday primary here is essentially a beauty
pageant because it elects no delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can only help ourselves," Bradley told The Associated Press in that
Friday phone call. "We can't do anything but gain since everybody expects us to
lose."
</P>
<P>
	   Everybody, including Clara Staunton, who happened upon Bradley at Seattle's
Discovery Park. She said she will vote for Bradley because "he makes a lot of
sense on the issues," but she had little faith in his chances.
</P>
<P>
	   "He may win here, but things don't look good overall," Staunton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley plunged forward Saturday, rallying about 400 Spokane supporters:
"This will be the launching pad and you can be the rockets that lift this
campaign and make it take off."
</P>
<P>
	   His perseverance earned him endorsement by The Seattle Times, which was
editorializing in Sunday editions: "Bradley is well prepared to help keep the
economic boom alive and vital. ... Inclusion is his theme - from race to the
economy and health care."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley enlisted Marcy Bloom, head of Aradia Women's Health Center, the
oldest women's clinic in the Northwest, in a radio ad hammering at Gore's old
anti-abortion record. "We need a president with an unwavering and consistent
commitment to a woman's right to choose a safe, legal abortion," Bloom says.
</P>
<P>
	   Intent on denying Bradley a symbolic Washington win, Gore has matched
Bradley's investment in TV advertising here, aides confirmed, and added five
stops in the Seattle area this weekend, including Saturday night's NAACP dinner,
where Bradley was also speaking.
</P>
<P>
	   At a state party chili fest, Gore asked voters to hand him a "clear and
decisive choice" next week. "I come here today to ask you to unite this
Democratic Party and let's get on with the task of winning the election," Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   One new Gore ad surprisingly features his climb of Mount Rainier last summer
with his son, Albert III - an outing Gore long insisted was private and
off-limits for public discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll fight like hell," said Gore spokesman Todd Webster.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore cruised through California giddily piling up official support. "He's
for you! And he's for me!" he trilled in sing-song Friday after Oakland Mayor
Jerry Brown offered his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   At a San Jose coffee shop Saturday, Gore, a former journalist, playfully
grabbed a reporter's notebook and, without a word, scribbled out his version of
the day's story: "In a hastily arranged and extremely significant endorsement,
Ron Gonzales, the first Hispanic mayor of a large city in modern California
history, cast his lot with Vice President Al Gore today."
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, he promised "to bring full Internet access to every home."
</P>
<P>
	   Twice in Washington and once earlier, in South Carolina, Gore partisans
pelted Bradley with missives denouncing his scrutiny of Gore's record on
abortion, gun control and campaign finance reform as destructive to the party.
</P>
<P>
	   "As you continue to campaign here, please respect the voters of Washington
and the Democratic Party. Save your attacks for Republicans," Washington
Democratic chairman Paul Berendt wrote Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Bradley was at a South Carolina airport when he was
handed a similar letter from state chairman Dick Harpootlian, saying it was time
for Bradley to drop out and support Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is predictable. This is how the establishment operates," Bradley told
AP. "Those are his supporters. They don't want to face the record."
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign has accused Gore, who rarely entertains questions from his
traveling press corps, of trying to hide and win the nomination on the basis of
its inevitability.
</P>
<P>
	   To wit, Bradley explained his phone call to the Gore press bus: "I wanted to
give you the chance to speak to a presidential candidate."

<HEADLINE> Slave With Lewis &AMP; Clark Recognized  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM McCALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A close look at the statute of Capt. William Clark on
a river bluff here may puzzle some people who bother to check the name of the
man standing beside him.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not the explorer Meriwether Lewis. The man is known as York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was the first African-American to cross the nation from coast to coast.
That's a heckuva an achievement, that's something to brag about,'' said James
Holmberg, a Kentucky scholar who has uncovered much of York's role in the 1803-6
expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But at the time of the expedition, he was never an official member of the
Corps of Discovery,'' Holmberg said. ``He was always William Clark's slave. He
was forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Holmberg joined other historians and a documentary filmmaker
for a conference to remember the man who had grown up with Clark and made the
journey into history with him and Lewis.
</P>
<P>
	   Known only by a single name, common for slaves in that era, York had been
Clark's personal servant since they were both boys. The explorer made a
deliberate choice to bring York along on the expedition because he valued his
skills as a hunter and woodsman, Holmberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark also used York to impress Indian tribes the expedition met along the
way. Most had never seen a black man and believed his dark skin gave him
spiritual power -- even made him superior to whites.
</P>
<P>
	   A large, strong man by historical accounts, York also helped save members of
the expedition during a flash flood in Montana that nearly swept away Clark and
Sacagawea, the young Shoshone woman who served as a guide.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the expedition returned to a hero's welcome in St. Louis in 1806
after much of the nation had given them up for dead, each man was rewarded with
land grants and money, ``except for one,'' Holmberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although he had shared in all its hardships and all its dangers, he got
nothing,'' Holmberg said, ``because he was still a slave.''
</P>
<P>
	   It took another 10 years before Clark freed York, a decade chronicled in a
cache of letters Clark sent to his older brother, Jonathan, discovered in a
Louisville, Ky., attic in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmberg, curator of special collections at the Filson Club Historical
Society in Louisville, said the letters provide a showcase for the complex
relationships created by a slave society, and its sheer cruelty.
</P>
<P>
	   York was treated nearly as an equal on the expedition, yet was expected to
return to the status of slave upon his return, unable to share in the lavish
rewards given Clark and the white members.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark even resisted granting him freedom because York had become valuable
property, and threatened to sell him ``down the river'' to slavers in New
Orleans when York asked to return to Louisville to be with his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   But Holmberg said that had York not gone on the journey, Clark not acted
like typical slaveholders, and York not wanted to return to his wife in
Kentucky, historians may have known much less about the era.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was really a sad and deplorable situation, a reflection of the
slaveholding society and the ugliness of slavery, but it's sure telling us a lot
now about the institution and the people involved,'' Holmberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Geraldine Hammond, a retired school administrator and teacher, said she
hoped the conference helped build more awareness of the contributions black
people made to settling the West.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning scored 28 points as the Miami Heat beat
the Washington Wizards 98-88 tonight for their third straight victory and a
sweep of the season series. Tim Hardaway added 23 points and Jamal Mashburn had

to a full game over idle New York. Mourning gave Miami an 86-84 lead with a
dunk, Dan Majerle added a 3-pointer and Hardaway capped the run by hitting three
free throws after being fouled by Rod Strickland on a 3-point attempt.

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Rally Around Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rallying around one of their own, Republican governors
say they're confident in their colleague from Texas, mobilizing a show of unity
they hope will boost George W. Bush's struggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, they're brimming with free advice.
</P>
<P>
	   In town for their winter meeting, GOP governors gave Bush their early and
powerful backing at an earlier gathering -- even before he declared he was
running. That support helped rally the Republican establishment around the Texas
governor as the party's best chance for taking back the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm confident we made the right decision,'' said Gov. Ed Schafer of North
Dakota, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which gathered a dozen
governors Saturday to demonstrate their unity with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all have faith and confidence in him because we know him,'' said
Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, whose state holds a primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilmore said the governors backing Bush believe that his experience leading
one of the nation's largest states makes him qualified to be president.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors show no sign of bolting despite Sen. John McCain's
unexpectedly strong challenge. They say Bush has made mistakes but argue he has
time to correct them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're a pretty solid bunch. Once they're on board, they're on for the
long haul,'' said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, where Bush lost a hard-fought
race with McCain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush obviously will have to right himself, and he will,'' Gov. Mike
Leavitt, R-Utah, chairman of the National Governors' Association, said Saturday.
``It yet will turn out the way we want it to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Governors of both parties are meeting this weekend with an agenda filled
with policy issues. But politics tops the unwritten agenda, particularly for
Republicans, who are watching Bush try to regain his footing as McCain shreds
the assumption that Bush's nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic governors are relishing the intense GOP fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just absolutely delighted that the Republicans are having the
opportunity to discuss all their shortcomings,'' said Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton.
``I just hope they go right down to the wire. It looks like they are.''
</P>
<P>
	   From Republican governors, advice ranged from staying focused to allowing
them to carry more of the campaign's message.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Set the rules, but let us do it our way at home,'' said Schafer.
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota's holds its caucuses Tuesday, but Schafer can't figure out why
he hasn't been more involved in the Bush campaign. ``How come I'm not doing a
radio spot encouraging people to go out and vote, and using my image or my trust
or whatever I have with the voters to spread the Bush message?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Schafer plans to deliver a cautionary message to his colleagues. Too many
governors assumed that it was enough to turn over lists of party activists and
volunteers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's entire operation has been second-guessed since he lost primaries in
Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday. Supporters questioned, among other things,
spending $1 million on ads in Arizona, McCain's home turf. And Connecticut Gov.
John Rowland bluntly said that it was stupid to visit Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, which lost its tax exempt status for failing to admit blacks and
whose namesake once labeled the Catholic Church a ``satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like other GOP governors, New Jersey's Christine Todd Whitman is confident
Bush will win the GOP nomination. But she worries that the visit to Bob Jones
University and other efforts to appeal to the most conservative voters will come
back to bite Bush in the general election, when candidates will be fighting for
voters in the political center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to put together a coalition that can win in
the fall,'' Whitman said. ``It can be dangerous if you start to marginalize
yourself in any way.'' Asked if Bush has done just that, she said: ``I don't
think that's happened in any kind of irretrievable way.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, governors say, these controversies, along with constant
bickering over which candidate is most guilty of negative campaigning, have
distracted Bush from his core messages on taxes, education and opportunity for
all.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush lost Michigan, Schafer said, ``because we were fighting about who said
what first and who hit who first in the sandbox.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign may be getting the message, Engler said. He applauded the move
late this week to have Gilmore talk about the McCain camp's phone calls to
voters suggesting that Bush is anti-Catholic, freeing Bush to talk about his
core issues. Still, Bush talked more about those calls on Friday, again
denouncing McCain for them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our message to him,'' Leavitt said, ``is to stay focused on his message of
reform and not to get caught up in the sidebar stories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then again, he remembered in 1996 when Republican nominee Bob Dole met with
the 17 Republican governors, each of whom took a turn at offering advice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By the time you got around to all 17, there' s just no way he could have
even remembered all the advice, let alone accepted it,'' Leavitt said. ``We're
probably compulsive advice givers. We can't stop ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Dominican President Campaigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- In a rare campaign stop, former
President Joaquin Balaguer told a jubilant crowd Saturday that he would bring
progress to Santo Domingo's poor neighborhoods if returned to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of supporters cheered and shouted ``A president of two centuries!''
as the 93-year-old leader arrived at a tin-and-wood pavilion in the impoverished
Tres Brazos area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't come with a bag of promises, but rather to identify with you,''
Balaguer told residents. ``I sympathize with you and your problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   The autocratic Balaguer governed the Dominican Republic for most of the last
three decades. Despite fragile health and flagging support outside his party, he
has pledged a return to power in the May 16 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Balaguer was known for his capital works projects, and on Saturday,
supporters dressed in the red of his party said they were optimistic he could
bring low-cost housing projects, better water service and electric lines to poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want houses and water and light -- and a life like decent people,''
said Rosalia Garza. ``Balaguer is the only one that can help us.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Diplomat Escorted to Airport  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Cuban diplomat who ignored a State Department demand
that he leave the country on his own was taken into custody by U.S. authorities
Saturday evening and flown out of the country on a government plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Imperatori, 46, accompanied by his lawyer, was escorted away in a late
model Buick by FBI officials who turned up shortly after 8:30 p.m. at his
suburban Maryland apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   He was not handcuffed and looked impassive as he entered the vehicle. He
made no statement.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said he was driven to Reagan National Airport in suburban
Virginia and flown aboard a U.S. government plane to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   From Canada, he was to catch a Sunday morning flight to Havana, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has been expelled from the United States for not voluntarily departing
by the appointed time,'' the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday morning, Imperatori announced his plan to defy the State
Department expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with a
U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have been absolutely cleared
of the accusations brought against me,'' Imperatori said. He spoke less than
three hours before the State Department's deadline for him to depart the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   This past week, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin had warned that
Imperatori could be subject to arrest once his diplomatic immunity had expired.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision not to return voluntarily came as no surprise, as Cuban
officials signaled all week they had no intention of willingly abiding by the
deportation order.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was introduced to reporters by Kurt Schmoke, a former mayor of
Baltimore who has been retained by the Cuban government to defend the diplomat.
After his remarks, Imperatori refused to take questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmoke, who said his client planned a liquids-only diet until his name is
cleared, accompanied Imperatori to the airport Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba's western town of Guane, tens of thousands of people who rallied
Saturday to press for the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez return also
denounced Imperatori's pending expulsion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Down with lies! Free Elian!'' the protesters chanted at the gathering
headed by Gen. Raul Castro, Fidel Castro's brother and Cuba's Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The youngster was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean in November after his
mother and her boyfriend died, along with several other people, in an effort to
get from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether he should be returned to Cuba or stay with relatives in Miami who
have taken him in has created an international furor.
</P>
<P>
	   The impasse over Imperatori's status underscored the palpable mistrust
between the U.S. and Cuban governments, which seems to increase with time.
</P>
<P>
	   A gaunt man, Imperatori spoke in a loud, clear voice and with indignation
about his supposed illicit links with Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born 34-year
veteran of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who has been charged with
spying.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at a separate news conference, Fernando Remirez, head of Cuba's
diplomatic mission, acknowledged that Imperatori had maintained contacts with
Faget but said they were no different from the kinds of aboveboard relationships
the Cuban mission maintains with many Cuban-Americans and other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   At 7 a.m. EST Saturday, Imperatori gave Remirez his resignation as consular
affairs officer, leaving him without diplomatic immunity 6 1/2 hours before the
official deadline of 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife and 3-year old son left for Cuba Friday night, as they would have
been stripped of diplomatic immunity as well by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Imperatori and Remirez were adamant in their insistence that the Cuban
Interests Section does not engage in spying and is used solely for improving
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have become the victim of a major slander,'' Imperatori said. ``The
accusation against me is totally false.''
</P>
<P>
	   Remirez also joined Imperatori in maintaining that there was a direct link
between the timing of Faget's arrest and the custody battle over the Gonzalez
boy. Faget was arrested a few days before a scheduled court hearing on the
Gonzalez case, which was later postponed. The State Department has dismissed
speculation of such a link as ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   In their case against Faget, federal authorities said that 12 minutes after
they fed him phony information about a pending defection by a Cuban official,
they caught him passing it on to a contact with ties to the Cuban government.
Court papers also identified Imperatori as Faget's contact in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori could have used the Cuban Interests Section headquarters as a
safe haven after his diplomatic immunity lapsed. He would have been beyond the
reach of U.S. law enforcement while there, because international law proclaims
that local law does not apply at such missions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, with the concurrence and perhaps at the direction of his
government, he sought to remain here as what amounted to an undocumented alien.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and jailed.'' he
said. ``My morale and my truth will be my shield.''

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Detained in VP's Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A Paraguayan citizen detained at a suburban
police station has been identified as the suspected killer of Paraguayan Vice
President Luis Maria Argana, Argentina's interior minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Alberto Rojas, 31, ``has been duly identified as the person Paraguayan
justice is seeking to try'' for Argana's murder, Interior Minister Federico
Storani told the Noticias Argentinas news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The date and original reason for Rojas' detention were not immediately
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Argana was assassinated March 23 in the street near his office in downtown
Asuncion, the Paraguayan capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Argana's killing and the ensuing political turmoil led to then-President
Raul Cubas' downfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Lino Oviedo, a former army chief-of-staff who led a failed coup attempt in
1996, has been widely blamed as instigator of Argana's murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the crime Oviedo obtained political asylum in Argentina. His
whereabouts are unknown.

<HEADLINE> Bruins 2, Penguins 2  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Boston Bruins killed off a Pittsburgh power play
during the final 1:14 of overtime after getting a tying goal from Cameron Mann
early in the third period and tied the Penguins 2-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The tie was Boston's NHL-leading 17th and gave the Bruins (19-26-17) only
two more victories than ties. They were 0-4-2 in their previous six games before
ending Washington's 10-game home winning streak with a 3-0 decision Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins are 0-3-1 in their last four games and 1-5-2 without NHL
scoring leader Jaromir Jagr, who remains hospitalized after having a pool of
blood surgically removed his left thigh on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr's return is uncertain, and Penguins general manager Craig Patrick
admits to being concerned that complications from the injury could further delay
the recovery. Jagr has missed the last three games.
</P>
<P>
	   Pittsburgh had a chance to win after Dave Andreychuk was called for holding
Martin Straka with 1:14 left -- a call disputed by Bruins coach Pat Bruins --
but the Penguins did not have any strong scoring chances after that.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins moved one point ahead of the New York Rangers for seventh place
in the Eastern Conference and, without Jagr likely to play in the near future,
are in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston took the initial lead as Sergei Samsonov's wrist shot from the left
circle eluded goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin at 9:31 of the first. Aubin turned
aside 25 of 27 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   But, unlike Friday when the Capitals put 49 shots on goal, the Bruins
weren't able to maintain their early offensive momentum and had only 14 shots by
the end of the second period before finishing with 27. Pittsburgh's Pat Falloon
tied it at 13:37 of the second, skating into the slot to put a rebound of Brad
Werenka's slap shot by John Grahame, who made 32 saves in his second strong
performance in as many nights.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins took their first lead on Tyler Wright's eighth goal of the
season at 3:11 of the third. Rob Brown forced a turnover in the Bruins' end,
allowing Wright to power a slap shot off Grahame's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   But the lead lasted barely a minute. Mann tied it at 4:14 with his second
goal, putting in a rebound of Shawn Bates' backhander off a faceoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston is 1-15-4 at Pittsburgh since 1990-91.

<P>
    STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Khalid El-Amin drove the length of the court and
banked in a shot at the buzzer as No. 22 Connecticut edged West Virginia 72-71
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   After West Virginia's Calvin Bowman made two free throws to give the
Mountaineers (13-12, 5-9 Big East) a 71-70 lead with 4.8 seconds remaining,
El-Amin took the inbound pass and raced down the court for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin had 23 points to lead the Huskies (19-8, 8-6), who trailed by seven
with 5:20 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowman had a career-high 29 points to lead the Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut took a 70-67 lead with 1:38 left on two free throws by El-Amin.
West Virginia's Tim Lyles cut it to 70-69 with 1:14 left, but missed a free
throw that would have tied it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies let the clock wind down to 20 seconds when El-Amin missed a
3-pointer. Bowman then had two chances to put the Mountaineers up and was fouled
with 4.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn built a 22-17 lead midway into the first half on a three-point play by
El-Amin, but the Huskies couldn't shake the Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcus Goree and Bowman sparked West Virginia's comeback, scoring 19 of the
Mountaineers' next 21 to take a 38-36 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mountaineers' largest lead was 38-32 on a three-point play by Goree with
2:09 left in the half. Two free throws by the Huskies' Tony Robertson and a jump
hook by Souleymane Wane just before the buzzer allowed Connecticut to leave the
court trailing by only two.
</P>
<P>
	   Goree and Bowman combined for 27 of West Virginia's 38 points in the first
half.

	   YONGPYONG, South Korea (AP) -- Ole Kristian Furuseth, a master of skiing in
the Far East, led Mitja Kunc of Slovenia by one-tenth of a second after the
first of two runs of a men's World Cup slalom on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	Furuseth, whose last victory was on this course two years ago, negotiated the
55-gate layout in 46.08 seconds to Kunc's 46.18. Furuseth, who turned 33 last

Japan, and a giant slalom at Shigakogen, Japan, in 1989. He has four other
top-three placings in Far East races.
</P>
<P>
	Kunc, who was fourth in Saturday's giant slalom, had a margin of .10 seconds
over Germany's Marcus Eberle in Sunday's first run, followed by two-time race
winner Didier Plaschy of Switzerland at 46.41 and Mario Matt of Austria, also a
winner this season, at 46.45.
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, the season leader in the World Cup slalom

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Becalmed By Winds  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The 30th America's Cup has sailed into the
doldrums.
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's scheduled Race 4 between Italy's Luna Rossa and Team New Zealand's
Black Magic, which leads 3-0, was postponed due to a lack of stable wind on the
Hauraki Gulf, the third time in nine days that conditions have been too tame to
race.
</P>
<P>
	The wind was only about 4 knots at the scheduled 1:15 p.m. starting time. There
was a puff of hope at about 2:30 p.m. when the wind was about 7-10 knots, and
sails aboard both yachts were hoisted.
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to both yachts and between the three of us we were feeling
pretty happy that there would be something, then it died off and changed 100
degrees,'' race committee chairman Harold Bennett said. ``Then it started to get
far too fragile to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
	By 3 p.m., the breeze dropped back to about 5 knots and the jibs were lowered.
The race was abandoned at 3:25 p.m. and the yachts were towed back into the
Viaduct Basin.
</P>
<P>
	Monday is a lay day, so officials will try again Tuesday, with Race 5 in the
best-of-9 series scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	Becalmed on the water and locked into a schedule dictated by television,
organizers have gotten in just three races in nine days, stripping away any
momentum for sailing's biggest regatta in what's supposed to be one of the best
places in the world to sail.
</P>
<P>
	While the wind can sometimes rage on the Hauraki Gulf, it can also hinge on the
``Battle of the Breezes.'' Breezes from the northeast and southwest meet at
Rangitoto Island near the race course, and if they're similar in strength, they
cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
	The lingering image of this regatta, besides that of Italian crewman
Massimiliano Sirena bleeding all over Luna Rossa's hull after being injured in
Race 2, will be of the idled 75-foot yachts bobbing on the water under the
baking summer sun, the crewmen as bored as the spectators.
</P>
<P>
	When Race 3 was postponed Thursday, there were complaints that Bennett was
influenced by Team New Zealand, which doesn't want to race in light conditions.
The Italians felt a race should have been held. But Bennett, who taught Black
Magic skipper Russell Coutts to sail many years ago, said the wind was too
unstable toward the top end of the course and could have shifted dramatically.
</P>
<P>
	``It was worse today because the shifts in the breeze were a lot bigger, 100
degrees,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
	There were complaints about fluky wind when the America's Cup was held in San
Diego, but there were no problems getting off any races in the finals in either
1992 or 1995.
</P>
<P>
	This America's Cup will at least match the 1983 regatta as the longest ever at
13 days.
</P>

Cuban Diplomat Flown Out of U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuban diplomat Jose Imperatori was taken into custody by
U.S. authorities and flown out of the country tonight after ignoring a State
Department demand to leave the country. Imperatori said at a news conference
earlier that he was contesting allegations that he is linked to a U.S.
immigration officials accused of spying for Cuban. His decision not to return
voluntarily came as no surprise, as Cuban officials signaled all week they had
no intention of willingly abiding by the deportation order.

Bush Holds National Lead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A recent poll shows that although he suffered an upset
last week in Michigan and Arizona, Texas governor George W. Bush maintains a
large approval rating nationwide. Among likely Republican voters in California's
primary, a Time/CNN poll found Bush leading 48 percent to 23 percent. McCain
held a slight but statistically insignificant edge over the Texas governor among
Democrats and people without declared party preferences, but only registered
Republicans' votes will count in the GOP race. California, the star of the
13-state "Super Tuesday" voting exercise on March 7, awards the winner 162
delegates to this summer's national convention to nominate a candidate.

Senegal Readies For Election
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- After decades of rule by a single party, voters will
choose Sunday whether to unseat their incumbent Socialist president as signs of
unrest grow in Senegal, one of Africa's most peaceful democracies. President
Abdou Diouf is facing seven candidates in a contest that has sparked isolated
street clashes in the past week and threatens to escalate further. The
opposition candidates say Diouf's time is up. They agree that he can only win
through electoral fraud -- a common enough occurrence in African elections --
and accuse the president of fixing earlier votes and siphoning millions of
dollars in graft from the economy.

Calif. Editor Begins Jail Sentence
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   RED BLUFF, Calif. (AP) -- A journalist who refused to disclose his sources
began a five-day jail sentence today for contempt of court. Tim Crews, 57, the
publisher, editor and lead reporter of the twice-weekly Sacramento Valley Mirror
in Glenn County, kissed and hugged his tearful longtime companion, Donna Settle,
and waved to a knot of onlookers. Crews, in a story based on unidentified
sources, reported officials had long been aware of allegations that former
California Highway Patrol officer Dewey Anderson stole a handgun from a county
drug enforcement unit. Anderson has been ordered to stand trial, and his
attorneys seek Crews' sources in connection with the defense's case.

Diallo Verdict Sparks Rallies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Protesters took to the streets of New York City today to
rally against the acquittal of four white police officers in the Amadou Diallo
case. "Killer cops have got to go!" shouted a crowd of more than 2,500 people
who marched down Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan. About 40 people were
arrested when they sat down in the street near St. Patrick's Cathedral and
blocked traffic. Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was shot down by the
officers last year in a flurry of bullets outside his Bronx apartment building.

Slave With Lewis &AMP; Clark Recognized
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Historians joined today for a conference to remember
the slave who had grown up with Capt. William Clark and made the journey into
history with him and Meriwether Lewis. The explorer made a deliberate choice to
bring York along on the expedition because he valued his skills as a hunter and
woodsman, historians said. York was treated nearly as an equal on the
expedition, yet was expected to return to the status of slave upon his return,
unable to share in the lavish rewards given Clark and the white members.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya delivered on his promise of an impressive
performance tonight, knocking out Derrell Coley at the end of the seventh round
in their welterweight fight. De La Hoya, who lost to Felix Trinidad in his last
bout, said the new year would bring a new, improved fighter. He certainly looked
it against Coley, who went down from a left to the body in the dying seconds of
the seventh. As referee Wayne Kelly counted out Coley, De La Hoya lifted his
arms in celebration. It was a job well done.

power-play goals Saturday night in the Flyers' 5-1 victory over the New York

<HEADLINE> Calif. Town Has Best Tap Water  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY SPRINGS, W.Va. (AP) -- Bragging rights for best-tasting tap water go
to Yucca Valley, Calif., toasted by judges at the International Water Tasting
competition Saturday as the nation's most drinkable.
</P>
<P>
	   Yucca Valley beat out 45 competitors from more than two dozen states in the
municipal water category, one of three at the world's largest water-tasting
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   The city bumped off last year's winner, Desert Hot Springs, Calif., which
competed again this year along with three-time winner Atlantic City, N.J., and
two-time winner Charleston, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Calistoga Sparkling Mineral Waters of Napa Valley, Calif., was picked as
having the best-tasting sparkling water of the 17 entries. Honors for best
uncarbonated bottled water went to Halstead Spring Water of Cumberland Gap,
Tenn., which beat 35 other entries. This year's contestants included France,
Italy and Bosnia, Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
	   Oazatesanj of Bosnia, Herzegovina won the People's Choice award for
packaging design.
</P>
<P>
	   Arthur von Wiesenberger, an author and trained water master from Santa
Barbara, Calif., helped train the panel of amateur judges just hours before
Saturday's competition at Coolfont resort and spa.
</P>
<P>
	   One judge, Colleen Anderson of Charleston, served as a judge at the first
competiton 10 years ago. She said the event has grown in size in prestigious
since then.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was much harder this year. The quality of waters seemed consistently
better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the winners, there are financial payoffs as well as prestige: Victories
proclaimed on bottle labels can increase sales, von Wiesenberger said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a big deal for the companies for that win. It's a very prestigious
thing that people put on their labels and trucks,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Generally, the more natural a water is, the better it will taste. The more
chemicals added and the more processes used, the greater the chance that there
will be some residual tastes.
</P>
<P>
	   Potassium, for example, makes it sweeter; calcium and magnesium give it
fullness. Ideally, no one flavor should overpower the palate.
</P>
<P>
	   Some municipal water systems use as many as 30 chemicals to clarify, treat
and flavor their water; they generally don't fare as well in the contest.

<HEADLINE> No. 23 Kansas 80, Baylor 70  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Kenny Gregory scored six straight points in a
decisive stretch of the final minutes and brought the crowd to its feet with a
thunderous dunk as No. 23 Kansas beat Baylor 80-70 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bears (12-13, 3-11 Big 12), losers of 11 of their last 14 games, fought
the heavily favored Jayhawks almost even through most of the game and had the
momentum when Gregory hit from close range.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Baylor forward Terry Black, who tied a Kansas opponent record with
seven steals, sliced the lead to 70-64 with a 12-footer at the 4:35 mark.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gregory went back to work, hitting a follow shot and then, after a
Kansas steal, going in for the dunk to give the Jayhawks (10-4, 21-7) a 74-64
lead with 3:54 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   If Baylor had been able to hit free throws, the Bears might have won. But
they were only 10-for-22 from the line, while getting outrebounded 45-29.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by seven at halftime, Baylor pulled within three at 51-51 on
DeMarcus Minor's basket midway through the second half. Tevis Stukes, whose made
five 3-pointers to set a Baylor single-season record with 86, hit from long
range and shaved the lead to two points at 58-56.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Collison and Ben Echols traded buckets, then 7-foot-1 Eric Chenowith
muscled inside for a tip-in, drew a foul and made the free throw.
</P>
<P>
	   After Black was called for traveling, Jeff Boschee put the Jayhawks on top
66-58 with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks, after leading by as many as 14, scored the last seven points
of the first half to take a 41-33 lead. A 13-2 run, keyed by Boschee's two
3-pointers, had seemingly put Kansas in command.
</P>
<P>
	   But Baylor came back with a 10-0 spree and sliced the lead to a single point
at 34-33 with 1:53 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Stukes had 22 points for Baylor and Minor had 16. Collison led Kansas with
19, Boschee had 16 and Gregory 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor coach Dave Bliss, 477-284 as head coach at Oklahoma, SMU, New Mexico
and Baylor, dropped to 4-15 against Kansas.

<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Paul Mara scored with 33.6 seconds left and Zac
Bierk stopped all 14 third-period shots Saturday night as Tampa Bay beat the
Nashville Predators 3-2, giving the Lightning their season-high third straight
win.
</P>
<P>
	   Mara ripped the game-winning slap shot from the top of the left circle
through the legs of Tomas Vokoun.
</P>
<P>
	   The Predators outshot the Lightning 14-5 in the final period and 30-17
overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Right wing Mike Johnson, obtained in a trade with Toronto Feb. 9, had his
second straight two-goal game for Tampa Bay. His second goal came on the power
play, as he shoveled the rebound of Vincent Lecavalier's shot over Vokoun in the
second.
</P>
<P>
	   Predators defenseman Karlis Skrastins tied it 2-2 on a power-play blast from
the left point later in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson gave the Lightning a 1-0 lead at 15:04 of the first on a one-timer
in the slot, set up by a perfect feed from behind the net by Lecavalier.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville defenseman Drake Berehowsky tied it 1-1 at 19:00, crashing in from
the right circle and putting Sebastien Bordeleau's feed between Bierk's legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bierk was one of seven rookies among the 20 players Tampa Bay had in
uniform. Chris Gratton was out with a bruised foot, missing just the sixth game
due to injury in his seven-year career.

	   Takeisha Lewis added 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Christie Sides had 14
points shooting 4-for-5 from beyond the 3-point arc for Louisiana Tech (23-2,
14-0 Sun Belt), which won its 13th straight game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Techsters last lost on Jan. 2 to Connecticut and have already
clinched an eighth consecutive Sun Belt title.
</P>
<P>
	   Michaela Pavlickova led Denver (16-8, 10-4) with 10 points and seven
rebounds. Lika Black added nine points for the Pioneers, who had their five-game
winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisiana Tech didn't allow a point for the first 6:05 and built a 20-point
lead with Sides hitting a pair of 3-pointers, and Jackson and Takeisha Lewis
scoring six points each.
</P>
<P>
	   Misty Station scored Denver's first points after the Pioneers started with
0-for-8 shooting and three turnovers. Her basket off the dribble started a 6-0
run.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver, which was 5-for-39 from the field and turned the ball over 12 times
in the first half, managed only seven points the rest of the half and trailed
49-13 at the break.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Techsters made it 58-18 four minutes into the second half on a
3-pointer by Sides and Betty Lennox's two free throws. Catrina Frierson's
putback put Louisiana Tech ahead 73-31 with 11:15 left.

<HEADLINE> No. 20 Oklahoma 83, Missouri 56  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Eduardo Najera made his last home game one to
remember, scoring 25 points and grabbing 10 rebounds Saturday night as No. 20
Oklahoma beat Missouri 83-56.
</P>
<P>
	   J.R. Raymond hit six 3-pointers and scored 20 points as the Sooners (22-5,
10-4 Big 12) moved into a tie with Kansas for fourth place in the conference
standings. The top four finishers in league play get first-round byes in the
postseason Big 12 tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   Kareem Rush scored 13 in his first start for Missouri (16-10, 9-4), which
had won its previous five road games. The Tigers tied their season low with a
15-point first half and wound up shooting just 32 percent (19-of-59).
</P>
<P>
	   Najera scored 20 points in the second half, including a pair of 3-pointers
during a run that saw Oklahoma outscore the Tigers 25-14 in the final 6 1/2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma ended the suspense early, scoring the game's first 11 points --
including one of Raymond's 3-pointers. It took Missouri more than four minutes
to score its first basket, and the Tigers ended the half by making just two
field goals in the final 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma led 35-15 at halftime and didn't allow Missouri to get closer than
16 after that.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyon Dooling, Missouri's leading scorer, didn't start due to an injured
right ankle. He entered the game early in the first half and wound up scoring 10
points in 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The poor shooting night was the continuation of a trend for the Tigers, who
came in hitting just 38.6 percent from the field in their previous six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Missouri has lost to four ranked Big 12 opponents in the past three weeks --
Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas and Iowa State.

<HEADLINE> No. 23 Kansas 80, Baylor 70  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- For a team that's reputed to lack a go-to guy, Kansas
does pretty well with Kenny Gregory.
</P>
<P>
	   With underdog Baylor hanging close, Gregory scored six straight points in a
decisive stretch of the final minutes and capped his spurt with a thunderous
dunk as the 23rd-ranked Jayhawks carved out a hard-fought 80-70 victory Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   "For a while it looked like we were going back to our old ways," Gregory
said. "But then Eric Chenowith had that big three-point play and we made a
couple of baskets off transition and regained all the momentum. It looked like
that hurt them."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bears (12-13, 3-11 Big 12), losers of 11 of their last 14 games, played
the heavily-favored Jayhawks (21-7, 10-4) almost even through most of the game
and had the momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor forward Terry Black, who tied a Kansas opponent record with seven
steals, sliced the lead to 70-64 with a 12-footer at the 4:35 mark.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gregory went back to work, hitting a follow shot and then, after a
Kansas steal, going in for the dunk that brought the sellout crowd to its feet
and gave the Jayhawks a 74-64 lead with 3:54 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   "They didn't quit," Kansas coach Roy Williams said of the Bears. "I commend
head coach Dave Bliss with the job he has done."
</P>
<P>
	   If Baylor had been able to hit free throws, the Bears might have won. But
they were only 10-for-22 from the line, while getting outrebounded 45-29.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks scored the last seven points of the first half to take an
eight-point lead. But the Bears came right back and cut it the lead to two
points three times in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   "We kind of lost it right before the half," said Bliss, who is 477-284 as
head coach at Oklahoma, SMU, New Mexico and Baylor but 4-15 against Kansas. "We
got it down to one (point) and then I started coaching again."
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor pulled within three on DeMarcus Minor's basket midway through the
second half. Tevis Stukes, whose five 3-pointers set a Baylor single-season
record with 86, hit from long range and shaved the lead to two points at 58-56.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Collison and Ben Echols traded buckets, then the 7-foot-1 Chenowith
muscled inside for a tip-in, drew a foul and made the free throw.
</P>
<P>
	   After Black was called for traveling, Jeff Boschee put the Jayhawks on top
66-58 with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   Black bedeviled the Jayhawks all night with his intimidating defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't know much about Terry Black," Boschee said. "Now I know he's
quick."
</P>
<P>
	   "I had no idea I did that," Black said of his record-tying seven steals. "I
just wanted to come out and help the team."
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks, after leading by as many as 14, scored the last seven points
of the first half to take a 41-33 lead. A 13-2 run, keyed by Boschee's two
3-pointers, had seemingly put Kansas in command.
</P>
<P>
	   But Baylor came back with a 10-0 spree and sliced the lead to a single point
at 34-33 with 1:53 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Stukes had 22 points for Baylor and Minor had 16. Collison led Kansas with
19, Boschee had 16 and Gregory 13.

<HEADLINE> Rape Victims Worry About AIDS  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- When Annie Newton puts her twins to bed, there are no
goodnight kisses after nightly prayers. She washes her hands before hugging the
10-year-old girls, and won't let them in the kitchen while she's cooking, for
fear they might touch her blood if she cuts herself.
</P>
<P>
	   Newton doesn't have AIDS and she has tested negative for HIV, but, like
millions of other sexual assault victims, she constantly fears the man who raped
her gave her the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
	   While Newton has been told that her attacker had AIDS, many other rape
victims are left knowing only that the possibility exists.
</P>
<P>
	   Privacy laws prevent some states from releasing inmates' HIV test results or
causes of death, even to their victims. In recent years, some state
legislatures, including Arizona, Hawaii, Kentucky, South Carolina and Wisconsin,
have amended their laws to give victims access to such records. In Georgia,
district attorneys are allowed to inform victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Many victims say their inability to find out their attacker's status makes
their ordeal even worse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm constantly thinking that I may have survived the attack, but he might
eventually murder me with HIV, and not knowing is just eating me up right now,''
said Kellie Greene, an Orlando, Fla., woman who was attacked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene has sued Florida to get the medical records of her attacker but has
been told several times she can't access them due to privacy considerations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why does he have any privacy rights?'' Greene said. ``He certainly
disregarded mine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Newton's attacker recently died in prison after a long bout with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On the one hand, I was happy he died after what he did to me,'' she said.
``But then I started thinking that my time might come soon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Victim advocates say Newton's chance of infection is greater than that of
women who have normal sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive man because the
brutal nature of the attack led to more blood contact.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's something that crosses every victim's mind,'' said Debbie Andrews,
executive director for the Rape Abuse &AMP; Incest National Network. ``You have to
go through that struggle of not knowing for sure, even if the first test is
negative.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates there are as many as
900,000 people infected with HIV in the United States. Doctors say it can take
five years for the virus to appear after sexual contact.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates say few statistics have been compiled on the number of women who
contract HIV through rape. A 1990 study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine showed that less than 1 percent of victims surveyed contracted the
disease through the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Liz Flowers, executive director of the Georgia Network to End Sexual
Assault, said that percentage probably wasn't accurate because many women aren't
tested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many attacks are by someone they know or a former sex partner,'' Flowers
said. ``That brings the fear level about HIV and AIDS way down, even though the
risk is just as high.''
</P>
<P>
	   That wasn't the case for Newton and other victims of Joseph Patrick
Washington. He died in prison last October while serving a life sentence in
conjunction with five separate Augusta area attacks in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington forced the women into his car at gunpoint, drove to a remote
location, shot them and then raped, prosecutors said at his 1995 trial. One
witness testified that Washington had said he wanted to infect as many women as
he could because his former girlfriend had given him HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   But fearing lawsuits for breach of privacy by Washington's family members,
state corrections officials would only say he died from ``natural causes.''
Georgia Department of Corrections spokesman Scott Stallings said that all
incoming inmates are tested for HIV, but the results are not made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Newton was told Washington had AIDS by Augusta's district attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Victims advocates say the specter of AIDS makes it hard for women to recover
after an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rape produces post-traumatic stress syndrome, and if you can't put some
distance between yourself and the attack, it will never go away,'' Flowers said.
``And the longer possibility of AIDS just keeps hanging there, so will the
effects of the attack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Baxley, 44, was attacked by Washington in 1993 and has been tested
three times since then. All have turned up negative, but she still can't shake
the fear of contracting HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I might have escaped dying the first time, but there's no telling if it
will come back around again.''

<HEADLINE> No. 22 Conn 72, West Virginia 71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Khalid El-Amin proved that 4.8 seconds can seem like
an eternity.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin drove the length of the court and banked in a shot at the buzzer as
No. 22 Connecticut edged West Virginia 72-71 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew I had time to get the shot off. The only thing I didn't know was if
it would go in," El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach wanted to get me the ball in the open court and take it all the way
for a layup. I lost control momentarily but regained my composure. It was a
tough angle but I banked it in."
</P>
<P>
	   After West Virginia's Calvin Bowman made two free throws to give the
Mountaineers (13-12, 5-9 Big East) a 71-70 lead with 4.8 seconds remaining,
El-Amin took the inbound pass and raced down the court for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the longest 4.8 seconds of my life," West Virginia coach Gale
Catlett said. "It was a tough loss because we played hard all night."
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin had 23 points to lead the Huskies (19-8, 8-6), who trailed by seven
with 5:20 left.
</P>
<P>
	   "We needed something good to happen to us and I thought we made something
happen at the end," UConn coach Jim Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowman had a career-high 29 points to lead the Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut took a 70-67 lead with 1:38 left on two free throws by El-Amin.
West Virginia's Tim Lyles cut it to 70-69 with 1:14 left, but missed a free
throw that would have tied it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies let the clock wind down to 20 seconds when El-Amin missed a
3-pointer. Bowman then had two chances to put the Mountaineers up and was fouled
with 4.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn built a 22-17 lead midway into the first half on a three-point play by
El-Amin, but the Huskies couldn't shake the Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcus Goree and Bowman sparked West Virginia's comeback, scoring 19 of the
Mountaineers' next 21 to take a 38-36 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mountaineers' largest lead was 38-32 on a three-point play by Goree with
2:09 left in the half. Two free throws by the Huskies' Tony Robertson and a jump
hook by Souleymane Wane just before the buzzer allowed Connecticut to leave the
court trailing by only two.
</P>
<P>
	   Goree and Bowman combined for 27 of West Virginia's 38 points in the first
half.

<HEADLINE> McCain Courts Ohio Republicans  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The invitation to John McCain's rally in Cleveland
contained a not-so-subtle suggestion from the campaign: Don't put just any
slogan on your campaign sign. Write, ``Republicans for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Moore didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of in-your-face,'' said the public relations officer, a McCain
supporter, while waiting to shake the senator's hand at Cleveland's popular West
Side Market.
</P>
<P>
	   As McCain and his Republican presidential rival George W. Bush turn their
attention to Ohio and other Super Tuesday primary states, the Arizona senator's
campaign believes it cannot afford to be subtle -- especially in its appeal to
core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   He invokes Ronald Reagan and courts non-Republicans in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a proud conservative Republican,'' he declared to several thousand
residents crammed around the market's produce tent on an unseasonably balmy day.
``But I also say to you that I want independents, Democrats, Libertarians,
vegetarians!''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, McCain autographed copies of his autobiography at a bookstore in
Cincinnati and told reporters on his bus: ``I think we can carry New York, Ohio
and California. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours later the New York Post issued a press release saying it
intended to endorse McCain for the GOP nomination in its Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   It said a front-page editorial was to hail McCain for his ``personal
character'' and cite its agreement with his positions on ``cutting taxes,
doubling the child tax credit, protecting Social Security, favoring school
vouchers and outlawing partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Bush has carried the vast majority of Republican support in the
primaries and polls, even as McCain racks up victories in New Hampshire, Arizona
and Michigan thanks to moderate Republicans and crossover votes from Democrats
and independents in open contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Both McCain and Bush, who is scheduled to campaign in Washington state on
Sunday and Ohio on Monday, are airing ads that mention former President Reagan,
a GOP icon.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the Bush campaign is targeting voting blocs who have supported McCain,
too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Strategically, you're going to see us reach out and make inroads in the
center and challenge him on his claim that he's like Ronald Reagan,'' Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer said Saturday. ``He's got a real Republican problem and
he's going to have a hard time fixing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek magazine poll found Bush has a 56 percent to 27 percent lead over
McCain nationally among registered Republicans and those likely to vote
Republican. And 62 percent said Bush was more likely to beat the Democratic
nominee in the general election, down from 73 percent in a poll in early
February, compared with 27 percent for McCain, 8 percentage points higher than
before.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP race has taken on a harsh tone, with the Texas governor deriding
McCain for hiring phone banks to tell voters about Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University, a school in South Carolina that doesn't allow interracial dating and
is seen by some critics as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ronald Reagan never said one thing and then did another, and McCain has a
proven propensity to say one thing and do another, like saying you're going to
run a clean campaign and then turn around and run a bunch of anti-Catholic phone
calls,'' Bush said in Virginia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia and Washington state hold open primaries on Tuesday and North
Dakota Republicans hold caucuses, a week before coast-to-coast March 7 contests
in 13 states, including Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   In Virginia, where 56 delegates are at stake, voters must sign a nonbinding
pledge not to participate in any other party's nomination process, which could
hurt McCain among Democrats and independents. In Washington, 12 delegates will
be awarded, and 19 in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain planned a long day of campaigning on Monday with stops scheduled in
Virginia, Washington state and California, where he's 25 points behind Bush in a
new Time/CNN poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, who was at McCain's side Saturday, worried that
Democrats and independents might not cross over for McCain in the GOP primary
because the Democratic voting is held the same day -- a potential March 7
problem for McCain nationwide in open contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also has organizations in each of Ohio's 88 counties, while McCain is
relying on news reports to build support and turn out voters. DeWine said
McCain's tour through Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati passed through three TV
broadcast markets that reach 80 percent of the state's residents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There really wasn't a race in Ohio until Thursday night,'' when McCain's
commercial went on the air,'' DeWine said. ``Organization doesn't matter here.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the multiethnic West Side Market, where vendors hawk everything from
bratwurst to butterscotch pie, McCain bought beef jerky. He and his wife Cindy
signed autographs and shook hands with residents and shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter Ehrnfelt, whose family has run a butcher shop at the market since
1912, said he'd seen Reagan, Rosalynn Carter and President Bush pass through the
market -- but not candidate Bush, so far.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They say John McCain is one of the boys, and that he speaks to you
straight, and that Bush doesn't have that same kind of feeling,'' said Ehrnfelt,
mayor of nearby Strongsville. ``We need that kind of straight talking person (as
president) given what this country's been through lately.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later at Ohio State University's St. John Arena in Columbus, McCain took on
protesters who interrupted his town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Give us a living wage!'' several men chanted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be glad to - go to work,'' McCain replied.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Diplomat Escorted to Airport  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Cuban diplomat who ignored a State Department demand
that he leave the country on his own was taken into custody by U.S. authorities
Saturday evening and flown out of the country on a government plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Imperatori, 46, accompanied by his lawyer, was escorted away in a late
model Buick by FBI officials who turned up shortly after 8:30 p.m. at his
suburban Maryland apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   He was not handcuffed and looked impassive as he entered the vehicle. He
made no statement.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said he was driven to Reagan National Airport in suburban
Virginia and flown aboard a U.S. government plane to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   From Canada, he was to catch a Sunday morning flight to Havana, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has been expelled from the United States for not voluntarily departing
by the appointed time,'' the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday morning, Imperatori announced his plan to defy the State
Department expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with a
U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have been absolutely cleared
of the accusations brought against me,'' Imperatori said. He spoke less than
three hours before the State Department's deadline for him to depart the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   This past week, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin had warned that
Imperatori could be subject to arrest once his diplomatic immunity had expired.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision not to return voluntarily came as no surprise, as Cuban
officials signaled all week they had no intention of willingly abiding by the
deportation order.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was introduced to reporters by Kurt Schmoke, a former mayor of
Baltimore who has been retained by the Cuban government to defend the diplomat.
After his remarks, Imperatori refused to take questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmoke, who said his client planned a liquids-only diet until his name is
cleared, accompanied Imperatori to the airport Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba's western town of Guane, tens of thousands of people who rallied
Saturday to press for the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez return also
denounced Imperatori's pending expulsion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Down with lies! Free Elian!'' the protesters chanted at the gathering
headed by Gen. Raul Castro, Fidel Castro's brother and Cuba's Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Later in Havana, Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque expressed admiration
for Imperatori, saying his handling of the expulsion ``is reason for Cuba and
its inhabitants to be proud.''
</P>
<P>
	   The youngster was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean in November after his
mother and her boyfriend died, along with several other people, in an effort to
get from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether he should be returned to Cuba or stay with relatives in Miami who
have taken him in has created an international furor.
</P>
<P>
	   The impasse over Imperatori's status underscored the palpable mistrust
between the U.S. and Cuban governments, which seems to increase with time.
</P>
<P>
	   A gaunt man, Imperatori spoke in a loud, clear voice and with indignation
about his supposed illicit links with Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born 34-year
veteran of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who has been charged with
spying.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at a separate news conference, Fernando Remirez, head of Cuba's
diplomatic mission, acknowledged that Imperatori had maintained contacts with
Faget but said they were no different from the kinds of aboveboard relationships
the Cuban mission maintains with many Cuban-Americans and other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   At 7 a.m. EST Saturday, Imperatori gave Remirez his resignation as consular
affairs officer, leaving him without diplomatic immunity 6 1/2 hours before the
official deadline of 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife and 3-year old son left for Cuba Friday night, as they would have
been stripped of diplomatic immunity as well by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Imperatori and Remirez were adamant in their insistence that the Cuban
Interests Section does not engage in spying and is used solely for improving
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have become the victim of a major slander,'' Imperatori said. ``The
accusation against me is totally false.''
</P>
<P>
	   Remirez also joined Imperatori in maintaining that there was a direct link
between the timing of Faget's arrest and the custody battle over the Gonzalez
boy. Faget was arrested a few days before a scheduled court hearing on the
Gonzalez case, which was later postponed. The State Department has dismissed
speculation of such a link as ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   In their case against Faget, federal authorities said that 12 minutes after
they fed him phony information about a pending defection by a Cuban official,
they caught him passing it on to a contact with ties to the Cuban government.
Court papers also identified Imperatori as Faget's contact in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori could have used the Cuban Interests Section headquarters as a
safe haven after his diplomatic immunity lapsed. He would have been beyond the
reach of U.S. law enforcement while there, because international law proclaims
that local law does not apply at such missions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, with the concurrence and perhaps at the direction of his
government, he sought to remain here as what amounted to an undocumented alien.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and jailed.'' he
said. ``My morale and my truth will be my shield.''

<HEADLINE> No. 20 Oklahoma 83, Missouri 56  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Eduardo Najera didn't disappoint the Oklahoma fans who
had to wait until after the game to honor him on senior night.
</P>
<P>
	   Najera scored 25 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in his final home game,
leading the 20th-ranked Sooners to an 83-56 victory Saturday night. Then he and
the other three seniors were honored for their contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   In switching the normal routine, coach Kelvin Sampson said he was concerned
Najera and the seniors might get too emotional if the farewell were held
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
	   As it was, the Sooners held Missouri to just 15 first-half points and
weren't ever threatened as they joined Kansas in a tie for fourth place in the
Big 12.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if we could have scripted the night any better," Sampson said.
"The way our team played was the way we had to play. Our perimeter defense was
outstanding. We made them work for every shot. That was a great example of
Sooner basketball."
</P>
<P>
	   J.R. Raymond hit six 3-pointers and scored 20 points for Oklahoma (22-5,
10-4 Big 12). The Sooners are trying to finish among the top four in the league
standings because that would ensure a bye in the first round of the postseason
Big 12 tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   Najera scored 20 points in the second half, including a pair of 3-pointers
during a run that saw Oklahoma outscore the Tigers 25-14 in the final 6 1/2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first half I think I was thinking about tonight, my last game, I was
not playing the way I usually play," Najera said. "The second half I said to
heck with it, we still got to win this game."
</P>
<P>
	   Kareem Rush scored 13 in his first start for Missouri (16-10, 9-4), which
had won its previous five road games. The Tigers tied their season low with the
15-point first half and wound up shooting just 32 percent (19-of-59).
</P>
<P>
	   "They came out at a level that we couldn't match, effort-wise," coach Quin
Snyder said. "We couldn't make shots, we couldn't catch the ball. I think that's
emblematic of a team on our heels.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just got hammered, it's that simple."
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma ended the suspense early, scoring the game's first 11 points --
including one of Raymond's 3-pointers. It took Missouri more than four minutes
to score its first basket, and the Tigers ended the half by making just two
field goals in the final 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma led 35-15 at halftime and didn't allow Missouri to get closer than
16 after that.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyon Dooling, Missouri's leading scorer, didn't start because of an injured
right ankle. He entered the game early in the first half and wound up scoring 10
points in 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The poor shooting night was the continuation of a trend for the Tigers, who
came in hitting just 38.6 percent from the field in their previous six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Missouri has lost to four ranked Big 12 opponents in the past three weeks --
Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas and Iowa State.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Get No.3 Pick in Trade  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington acquired the No. 3 overall draft pick from San
Francisco on Saturday, giving the Redskins two of the top three selections in
April's draft.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers, rebuilding and in need of youthful upgrade at several positions,
received the 12th and 24th overall picks in return, plus a fourth-round
selection (No. 118 overall) and a fifth-rounder (No. 148).
</P>
<P>
	   "It was vital for us to secure choices to supplement our roster due to the
players we had to release because of salary cap constraints," 49ers general
manager Bill Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expect that it will be a good trade for both clubs. ... The trade will
give us the chance to add four players with what would have been just one
choice. And we still have a fairly early pick in the first round."
</P>
<P>
	   The Redskins already own the No. 2 overall pick, one of eight draft choices
acquired on draft day last year from New Orleans. The Saints gave up the picks
so they could move up and draft Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   The No. 12 overall pick was one of two first-round selections the Redskins
obtained from Carolina in the Sean Gilbert trade two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato had already said the Redskins
will take either receiver Peter Warrick, defensive end Courtney Brown or
linebacker LaVar Arrington with the No. 2 pick. Now it appears Washington will
get two of those three.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland has the first overall pick in the draft, scheduled for April
15-16.
</P>
<P>
	   "We anticipate one of the strongest Redskins drafts of all time," Cerrato
said. "With both the second and third overall picks in the draft, we will have a
unique opportunity to see a significant infusion of youth."

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Some Islands' Delegates  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush won the first four of more than two dozen
delegates to the Republican National Convention being chosen in four
presidential contests being held this weekend in U.S. territories.
</P>
<P>
	   Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands each had four delegates at stake
during separate caucuses Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush won all four in the Virgin Islands, said the territory's Republican
committeeman, Holland Redfield II.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans met on the islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John.
Redfield said ``several hundred'' people attended buy declined to give any vote
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thank you Virgin Islands!'' Bush said in a written statement Saturday
night. ``I am humbled and honored by your tremendous outpouring of support.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had run radio advertisements in the Virgin Islands, a territory of
110,000 people. Neither he nor rival John McCain had visited the islands to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives shrugged off the defeat, saying McCain was
trying to concentrate on areas with more delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, we can't compete for every single delegate,'' she said.
``John McCain's is an insurgent campaign ... we simply do not have the resources
to compete with Gov. George Bush in the Virgin Islands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans from Puerto Rico will commit 14 delegates on Sunday at their
winner-take-all primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was expected to win all the delegates from this
weekend's contests, despite growing support for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
particularly in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had 67 delegates heading into the weekend races, compared to the 96
earned by McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   A candidate needs 1,034 delegates to win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While residents of the U.S. territories may participate in primaries and
caucuses, they are not allowed to vote in the presidential general election.

Cuban Diplomat Escorted to Airport
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Cuban diplomat who ignored a State Department demand
that he leave the country on his own was taken into custody by U.S. authorities
Saturday evening and flown out of the country on a government plane. Jose
Imperatori, 46, accompanied by his lawyer, was escorted away in a late model
Buick by FBI officials. Late Saturday morning, Imperatori announced his plan to
defy the State Department expulsion order so he could contest allegations
linking him with a U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba.

Bush Ahead in National Polls
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A recent poll shows that although he suffered an upset
last week in Michigan and Arizona, Texas governor George W. Bush maintains a
large approval rating nationwide. Among likely Republican voters in California's
primary, a Time/CNN poll found Bush leading 48 percent to 23 percent. McCain
held a slight but statistically insignificant edge over the Texas governor among
Democrats and people without declared party preferences, but only registered
Republicans' votes will count in the GOP race. California awards the winner 162
delegates to this summer's national convention to nominate a candidate.

Saturday to resume peace talks, saying there was a "historic" opportunity for a
Middle East settlement. "It is imperative to consolidate efforts and contacts to
resume the peace process, move it forward on all tracks and remove all the
obstacles to achieve the just, comprehensive and lasting peace yearned for by
the people of the region," Abdullah said. Arabs and Israelis "should make use of
the historic opportunity available now to achieve the aspired peace," he added

Missing Reporter in Russian Custody

	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Radio Liberty reporter Andrei Babitsky, whose
disappearance in Chechnya prompted international concern, said in television
footage aired Saturday that he had traded himself into Chechen hands in exchange
for Russian prisoners. After not contacting family or colleagues for weeks,
Babitsky turned up Friday in Makhachkala when he was detained for having a
forged Azerbaijani passport, Dagestan Interior Minister Adilgerei Magomedtagirov
told reporters Saturday. Babitsky's reporting from the rebels' side of the war
has angered Russian officials. He was detained by federal forces in Chechnya in
January, after which Russia said it exchanged him for two Russian prisoners
captured by Chechens.

Diallo Verdict Sparks Rallies

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Protesters took to the streets of New York City Saturday to
rally against the acquittal of four white police officers in the Amadou Diallo
case. "Killer cops have got to go!" shouted a crowd of more than 2,500 people
who marched down Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan. About 40 people were
arrested when they sat down in the street near St. Patrick's Cathedral and
blocked traffic. Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was shot down by the
officers last year in a flurry of bullets outside his Bronx apartment building.

Dark Matter Study Contradicts Others
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- A group of physicists said their Stanford
University experiment to detect so-called "dark matter" particles that hold the
universe together could contradict earlier findings by an Italian team.
Physicists have long theorized that "dark matter" particles could account for
much of the universe's mass. But new research presented Friday by University of
California-Berkeley physicist Richard Gaitskell suggests that it is unlikely
that a Stanford University detector had found as many of the elusive particles
as an Italian experiment recorded, The New York Times reported Saturday.

performance Saturday, knocking out Derrell Coley at the end of the seventh round
in their welterweight fight. De La Hoya, who lost to Felix Trinidad in his last
bout, said the new year would bring a new, improved fighter. He certainly looked
it against Coley, who went down from a left to the body in the dying seconds of
the seventh. As referee Wayne Kelly counted out Coley, De La Hoya lifted his
