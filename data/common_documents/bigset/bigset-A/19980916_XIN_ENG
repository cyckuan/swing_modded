<HEADLINE> Hunan Province Starts Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- As the water level of
Dongting Lake dropped below the danger mark, the work of
reconstruction in central China's Hunan Province has begun in full
swing.
</P>
<P>
Many flood-affected people today left their temporary shelters
on the levees for their homes, and the local government has sent
work teams to every flooded region to discuss programs to rebuild
towns and villages with them.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, local governments have also organized farmers to
plant autumn and winter crops, and provided them with seed
strains, chemical fertilizers and necessary funds.
</P>
<P>
More than 21 million flood victims in Hunan, about one third of
the local population, were affected by this summer's devastating
floods on the Yangtze and Dongting Lake, according to a local
official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics available show that direct industrial and
agricultural losses totalled 32.9 billion yuan (3.97 billion US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> British PM Announces Policies to Transform Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Tuesday Pledged radical policies to transform Britain's
poorest communities where crime, drugs, poverty and unemployment
have been rampant.
</P>
<P>
Blair unveiled the new measures in Hackney district in London,
promising a new "joined-up" approach which would give local
communities more power to solve their own problems.
</P>
<P>
Blair promised that 800 million pounds (1.3 billion U.S.
dollars) would be spent on a "New Deal for Communities" to reverse
this trend. But the key to the new scheme is not just cash but
better coordination between different parts of the government
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
He said there were "no instant solutions or quick fixes" but
promised a concerted effort over the next 10 or 20 years,
beginning with 17 pilot area schemes.
</P>
<P>
A report published on Tuesday by the Social Exclusion Unit, set
up by Blair last year, estimates Britain may have up to 4,000 such
problem neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The report says net incomes after housing costs of the richest
tenth of the British population rose by 68 percent between 1979
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Government ministries and local authorities will work together
rather than separately in 18 "action teams" to tackle the problems
-- crime, health, jobs, schools, transport and housing, Blair
said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Senior Minister on His Memoirs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew told a press conference Tuesday evening that he wrote
his memoirs for the purpose to let young Singaporeans know
Singapore's history and to make a contribution to the history
records of his country.
</P>
<P>
He held the press conference one day before his million-word
memoirs is published on his 75th birthday that falls on September
16.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir as saying that
Singapore has used the weakness of its neighbors to achieve
economic prosperity and the publication of Lee's memoirs "will
bring about bad effect on Malaysia,", Lee Kuan Yew argued that the
book "is my personal account of the events that had shaped my
life, and when I was prime minister (1959-90), which also affected
Singapore's history."
</P>
<P>
"I set out to give young Singaporeans an objective account of
why and how Singapore sought merger with Malaya but in two years
was asked to leave," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the criticism that he has chosen to publish his book
when Malaysia is in difficulties to take advantage of it, the
senior minister said he started writing in 1995 and the timing to
publish was settled last year.
</P>
<P>
He stated that "what I have written, I have checked against the
records, especially when recounting the race riots of 1964."
</P>
<P>
"I expected my book to be scrutinized and criticized," he said.
"if there are false or untrue statements, I will stand
contradicted and my credibility demolished," he added
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about what made Singapore successful, he
said the decisive factor is the human being.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Singapore is an island that has no large land area
and rich resources, he underlined that "the people became the
critical factor when we came across the strategic field."
</P>
<P>
"That meant diligent, strong, arduous leadership, well
educated, well organized, productive workforce," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Without that we could not succeed," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also said the circumstances forced Singapore to look at the
world and to seek outside market.
</P>
<P>
The history of Singapore indicates that the development of
Singapore is closely linked to the development of the world, he
noted, saying "When the world developed, Singapore would
develop."
</P>
<P>
"Without that world economy, Singapore will go back to a
fishing village and we will never forget that lesson," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Turkish Alliance Not to Harm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel Tuesday assured Cyprus
that its military alliance with Turkey will not harm Cyprus and
urged Arab diplomats to promote the peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting Tuesday with Cyprus' House of
Representatives President Spyros Kyprianou, Israeli Ambassador to
Nicosia Shemi Tzur said his country wants stability in the
Eastern Mediterranean and would like to see a solution to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Tzur made the remarks just one day after Arab ambassadors
accredited to Cyprus expressed concern about Israeli-Turkish
military alliance following their meeting with Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements made Monday by Arab ambassadors to
Cyprus that they are worried over the Turkish-Israeli military
alliance, Tzur said that "Arab countries should be more worried
how to proceed with the peace process with Israel and to leave
this sort of things aside."
</P>
<P>
He said their worries have nothing to do with Cyprus and urged
Arab diplomats to help "promote peace process with Israel, to
convince Palestinians... to come forward to proceed with the
peace."
</P>
<P>
Tzur said that during his meeting with Kyprianou, the Cypriot
House president received again the assurances that Israel's
cooperation with Turkey has nothing in it to harm Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is a close friend of Cyprus, Israel won't harm Cyprus,
there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus," Tzur said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have enjoyed close military ties since 1996
when they signed a military cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Tzur said his country "is looking for stability in the Eastern
Mediterranean, we want to see stability, we want to see the Cyprus
problem being solved."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kyprianou said that during his discussions with
the Israeli ambassador, he raised the issue of the military
cooperation between Israel and Turkey because "it creates an
atmosphere of concern to both Cyprus and Greece and to other
countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said Tzur told him that the alliance is of a technical and
commercial nature and has nothing to do with Cyprus, nor should
it affect the very good relations between the two countries or
the relations between Israel and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said Cyprus does not oppose alliances between
countries in the region, but stressed that these should not affect
issues which seriously concern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' relations with Israel have been enhanced since the
opening of its embassy in Tel Aviv five years ago and through the
exchange of visits by high-ranking officials.

<HEADLINE> No Pakistani Army Involvement in Afghan Conflict: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a meeting with Iranian Ambassador in Islamabad Mehdi
Akoundzadeh who called on him at the Prime Minister House, Sharif
rejected "baseless" allegations regarding the involvement of
Pakistan's armed forces in the recent fighting in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Iranian leadership would view
the current development with their wisdom.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's remarks came one day after Iran alleged that some
Pakistani army personnel were involved in the recent Afghan
fighting. Tension between Pakistan and Iran heightened following
the Taliban victories in northern Afghanistan and the killing of
nine Iranian nationals by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated that Pakistan gives high priority
to its relations with Iran and would like to take all necessary
steps to remove any misgiving or misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Pakistan has extended full support to efforts which
led to the release of five Iranian prisoners and the return of the
bodies of the Iranian personnel killed in Afghanistan, Sharif
stressed that Pakistan will spare no effort to preserve and
nurture its abiding relationship with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon both Iran and Afghanistan to defuse the
present tension between them and pursue a path of restraint,
mutual understanding, reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that Pakistan has made most sincere efforts in the
past and would continue to offer all assistance in order to defuse
the tension between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He offered to support all efforts at the United Nations and the
Organization of Islamic Conference to defuse the tension and all
political initiatives to resolve the outstanding problems.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Sharif and Akoundzadeh discussed matters
of mutual concern, including the regional situation with special
reference to Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Demands Referendum on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian opposition party
Agenda for Zambia (AZ) has demanded a referendum to allow people
a chance of deciding whether Barotseland, now Western Province,
should reclaim independence from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Monday, AZ president Akashambatwa
Mbikusita-Lweanika (Aka) said that his party leaders met ten days
ago in Barotseland and the majority view was that integration
based on real political freedom, with honest power sharing and
equal justice was impossible under Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, participants demanded Barotse
self-determination through referendum," The Post newspaper
Tuesday quoted Aka as saying.
</P>
<P>
Aka, a member of the Barotse Royal Establishment and son of
late King of Barotseland, Mbikusita Lewanika, said: "The idea is
to give people a chance to say if they want to continue living as
a captive nation under Zambian tribal domination, or to reclaim
independence as a free state."
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader noted that his party members would have
preferred a government system under which national leadership
alternated between regions to prevent one group ruling forever.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposed referendum would be a "peaceful and
democratic solution."
</P>
<P>
Government-owned Times of Zambia newspaper reported last month
that seditious materials on the status of Barotseland emerged in
Lusaka, prompting the government to threaten to deal with those
distributing them ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
The brochures circulated by a group calling itself the Barotse
Patriotic Front on Self-Determination demanded independence of
Western Province from the Zambian central government.
</P>
<P>
Barotseland enjoyed half independence under British colonial
rule and strove to become an independent country before it became
part of Zambia soon after the country won its dependence from
Britain in 1964. The land got its present name in 1969.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Sign Cultural Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece Signed
here Tuesday a cultural cooperation program for the years
1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Cyprus' Culture Minister Lycourgos
Kappas and his visiting Greek counterpart Evangleos Venizelos,
provides for upgraded Greek participation in the annual Cyprus
festival "Ta Kypria", now underway, the furthering of cooperation
in theater, music, cinema and archaeology, as well as exchanges
and cooperation in the international art and music fields.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for Cyprus' participation in the Cultural
Olympiad to take place in Greece from the year 2000 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Kappas said that "as we
believe closer cultural cooperation is our national duty, the two
ministries have developed close ties aiming at safeguarding the
historical identity of the Greek nation."
</P>
<P>
He added that meetings between delegations of the two
ministries will be held every six months and there will be a
constant exchange of information and views.
</P>
<P>
Venizelos underlined the importance of cultural cooperation
between the two countries, saying that never before had it been
set out in such a formal way as in the agreement signed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister, meanwhile, expressed disappointment with
the European Union (EU)'s stance toward the destruction of the
cultural heritage in the Turkish-controlled northern part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Venizelos said the EU should show more sensitivity as it
believes in the common European cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over 500 churches in northern Cyprus are
estimated to have been looted, destructed or used for other
purposes, while archaeological sites are not given the necessary
attention for their protection.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Programme
(WFP) Tuesday granted the disaster management division in the
vice-president's office of Zambia to strengthen its capacity in
mitigating natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Boniface Nonde, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Finance,
signed on behalf of the Zambian government the agreement and said that
the money was intended for information, resource and inventory
management including community training in the implementation of
mitigating the activities in natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed, out of the total allocation, over half would go
towards meeting the cost of food commodities.
</P>
<P>
Nonde said the El Nino weather phenomenon did a lot of damage
to Zambia's agricultural output in the last season and ruined the
economic infrastructure in the society.
</P>
<P>
WFP representative in Zambia, Techeste Zergaber expressed his
hope that the funds could be used to help Zambian farmers
especially those adversely affected by the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of an information system on disaster
management in Zambia was important because it would be able to
gauge the government's efforts towards effective management of
such calamities.

<HEADLINE> No Availability of Materials Delays Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian official
Tuesday said that no availability of materials had delayed the
completion of the Nigerian Railway Rehabilitation Project (NRRP)
on time, hence no blames on contractor.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here, Greg Icukwe, Sole
Administrator of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), noted
that materials such as steel rails, sleepers, turnouts and
fastenings are supposed to be provided by Nigerian side under a
contract.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria can not produce such things and has to order from
abroad, he said. However, he added that majority of the
materials ordered for the project did not come until now.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official stressed that the delay "is beyond our
control" and the contractor, China Civil Engineering Construction
Corporation (CCECC), had to wait because of the delay.
</P>
<P>
The NRRP project is being undertaken by CCECC under the contract
signed by Nigerian Federal Ministry of Transport and Chinese
Ministry of Railways in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the Chinese side is responsible for survey
and design for 4,200 km of railway lines, track rehabilitation of
3,500 km and supply of locomotives, coaches, wagons and rail
cars, and the project should be completed within 30 months, in
another word, is scheduled to be completed by September 30 this
year.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that survey and design had been completed, 83
percent of track rehabilitation done and 80 percent of
locomotives and rolling stock delivered to NRC and put into
operation before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Icukwe noted at the press conference that if the momentum
keeps on, the Chinese company can finish the remaining work
within one month.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, they brought in signal equipment for
the project, but signal houses which the Nigerian side is
supposed to build under the contract are not available.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Chen Xiaoxin, Deputy General Manager of
CCECC, told reporters that after two years of the rehabilitation,
great changes have taken place to the Nigerian railways with the
annual goods tonnage increasing from 137,000 tons to 566,000 tons
last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to August this year, he noted, the goods tonnage has
already reached 872,000 tons and are expected to be well over a
million tons, double what was last year.
</P>
<P>
The chinese official stressed that all the locomotives and
rolling stock supplied to Nigeria are manufactured in strict
conformity with the technical specifications agreed upon by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the rumours that locomotives delivered to Nigeria
are second hand, he said, since the gauge of Chinese railways is
1435 mm while that of Nigerian railways is 1067 mm, it is
impossible for the Chinese side to renovate their standard
locomotives by tailoring to the narrow gauge.
</P>
<P>
The cost of renovation would be more than the manufacturing of
brand new ones, Chen Xiaoxin said.

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister Calls Russian Counterpart on Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair called his new Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov on
Tuesday, saying that the world's major developed countries were
willing to help Moscow if reform continued.
</P>
<P>
Blair gave Primakov the message in a telephone conversation
following Monday's meeting of senior officials of the G7 group of
countries in London on Monday, a Blair aide said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-minute call was the first time Blair has spoken to
Primakov since he became Russia's prime minister last week.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told Blair there would be no backtracking on reform,
which he would carry forward with a new cabinet, according to the
aide.
</P>
<P>
"Blair told Primakov that G7 deputies had agreed to the
importance of staying engaged with Russia. He explained the
meeting had not been about taking decisions, but the G7 was
willing to provide help and advice on reform if Russia wanted it,"
the aide said, adding that Primakov briefed Blair on the situation
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Primakov said the new government would want to act vigorously.
He also said there would be no retreat from basic reform policies
which would continue," the aide said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he would be having talks with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank to discuss Moscow's funding
needs over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting brought together senior officials from the G7
-- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and
Japan, and representatives from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
However, western efforts to end the current crisis have
achieved little and the IMF is under fire from critics who say its
solutions are too inflexible, Reuters said today.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Issue Deeply Understood at SADC Summit: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos said here Tuesday that "Angolan issue has won deep
understanding in southern Africa."
</P>
<P>
The president said this upon returning home from the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) summit in Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
"This stance (of the southern African countries) will
contribute to the efforts by the government and all political
parties to build up the peace in Angola," Dos Santos stressed.
</P>
<P>
In response to the SADC recognition of the "UNITA Renovation
Committee", the Angolan president said that "all countries in the
region have shown their great unity for the sake of the Angolan
people and the peace cause in the country."
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit released a statement in Grande Baie of north
Mauritius Tuesday, strongly condemning the United Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) for its failure to implement the
1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol, accusing UNITA President Jonas
Savimbi for his chief crime in the civil war and expressing
support for the breakaway "UNITA Renovation Committee."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media said that President Dos Santos sent a
message to the United Nations General Assembly on September 10,
asking the U.N. Security Council to recognize the "UNITA
Renovation Committee" as the "only lawful dialogist" in the
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Dos Santos also called upon U.N. to withdraw
its recognition of Savimbi, citing that the UNITA president has
proven himself to be unable to lead the party in the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Donates Relief Aid to Flood Victims in China, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- German Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development announced Tuesday that it would
provide relief supplies worth 30 million marks (17.6 million U.S.
dollars) to help people hit by the recent floods in China and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The German relief supplies would include drinking water
purification equipment, pumps, offroad vehicles as well as medical
supplies, a statement issued by the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the German development ministry estimated that
at least 20 million marks (11.8 million dollars) of the relief
supplies would go to flooding areas in China. But the actual
proportions to be received by the two countries would be
determined by German experts according to the needs on the scene,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Vows Continued Attacks on Pro-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
Muslim group Hezbollah, or Party of God, Tuesday vowed to
continue its attacks on the pro-Israeli militia South Lebanon
Army (SLA) in its controlled southern Christian town Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony marking the killed guerrillas, the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah's secretary-general, sheikh Hassan
Nasrallah, said that his party would continue to fight against
occupying forces on any piece of land in Lebanon, including
Jezzine, until all occupants are driven out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, which lies just north of the Israeli occupied border
strip in south Lebanon with a population of 35,000, has been
policed by the SLA since the militia was created in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah's comments came in reaction to the latest security
measures adopted by leader of the SLA Antoine Lahd.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lahd announced that all residents of Jezzine will
have to apply for special travel permits 48 hours prior to
leaving or returning the area.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the new measures were applied because of the
rising number of Hezbollah bombing attacks targetting his soldiers
inside the district.
</P>
<P>
The new restriction, which the SLA commander said would come
into effect on October 1, has raised fears of a mass exodus of
Jezzine's population.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of asking us to neutralize the area and stop
resistance, ask Lahd to withdraw from Jezzine and surrounding
areas and restore Lebanese government's authority on the area,"
the Hezbollah leader said.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way, Jezzine and its residents will be
satisfied," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war in Lebanon trying
to oust 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 SLA militiamen from the
country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200 square-kilometer self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Calls for More Humanitarian Aid to Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- "Fatigue over the
drawn-out peace process should not jeopardize the survival of the
millions of children and women in desperate need of continued
humanitarian assistance," Carol Bellamy, executive director of the
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Angolan children and women need out help now more than ever,"
said Bellamy, who visited Angola earlier this year and said that
she saw for herself the dire plight of the people.
</P>
<P>
"Over 20 years of civil war have devastated the country's
infrastructure, and deteriorating security over recent months has
forced thousands more families to flee their homes," she said,
adding "The need for basic necessities of life -- food, shelter,
clean water and health care -- are both urgent and immense."
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 Angolans, 65 percent of whom are children
and women, have recently been displaced in the country and
represent a swelling of the more than 700,000 whose lives were
already displaced at the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Angola currently ranks among 174 nations on the United
Nations Development Programme's latest Human Developments Index
and has an infant mortality rate of 170 per 1,000 live births,
exceeded only Niger's 191 deaths per 1,000, according to a
UNICEF report.
</P>
<P>
"It is critical that the international community and
humanitarian agencies increase their efforts at this time to
help the people of Angola," she said.
</P>
<P>
So far the interagency humanitarian appeal for 91 million
U.S. dollars, launched by the UNICEF Executive Director on
behalf of all U.N. agencies, is only about 37 percent funded.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government and UNITA, the main rebel group,
signed a peace accord in 1994 which purported to end the
conflict in Angola, and a Government of National Unity and
Reconciliation was set up in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, full implementation of the peace process remains to be
achieved, and the recent deteriorating security environment has
necessitated restriction on most of the programs of the U.N. and
the non-governmental organizations to provincial capitals and the
immediate surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
"Yet it is heartening to note that, despite all the
difficulties facing Angolans at this time, important work is still
being carried out by our partners," said Bellamy. "Particularly
notable are the National Immunization Days, which are going ahead
as planned."
</P>
<P>
Nearly three million Angolan children under five years old need
to be given the polio vaccine free of charge during this campaign.
Already, in the first phase of the campaign at the end of August,
550,000 children had received polio vaccine drops, the UNICEF said.
</P>
<P>
"Health workers make long, arduous and sometimes hazardous
trips to vaccine children throughout this vast country," Bellamy
said. "Banditry and landmines pose additional threats to health
workers in the territories and regions where much of the work has
to be done."
</P>
<P>
The campaign, supported by the World Health Organization
(WHO), UNICEF and non-governmental organizations, has benefited
from comprehensive media coverage and the efforts of nearly 4,000
Angolan health workers who are participating throughout the
country, the UNICEF report said.
</P>
<P>
"So much more still needs to be done," the UNICEF chief said,
adding that "Despite Angola's abundant natural wealth in natural
resources, years of war have left most of the country's estimated
12 million people in absolute poverty and their children fighting
for survival."

<HEADLINE> Nile Water Level Reaches Record High in Egypt's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Nile water level in Lake
Nasser, the man-made lake behind the Aswan dam in Egypt, rose to a
record of 179.43 meters Tuesday, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The volume of water stored in Lake Nasser stood at 146.23
billion cubic meters on Tuesday, an increase of 610 million cubic
meters compared to that on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 240 million cubic meters of water were being
discharged from the Lake Tuesday to meet the needs of irrigation,
power generation, drinking water, industry, navigation and other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The excess water is being diverted to the Toshka canal, which
irrigates a swath of desert to the northwest of the dam.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time since the dam's construction in 1971
that the Nile water has been diverted to the Toshka canal. The
first time was in 1996, when the water behind the dam reached the
then record level of 178 meters.
</P>
<P>
The current diversion began early this month when the water
exceeded the dam's safety level. The lake, which reaches 500
kilometers up the Nile, is considered full at a depth of 175
meters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt used to suffer periodic flooding from the Nile river
until the high dam's construction.
</P>
<P>
The average annual flow of the Nile is 84 billion cubic meters,
with 80 percent of the volume passing during the flood season of
August through October.
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented flood levels in Sudan have already destroyed
hundreds of homes while some southern parts of the Upper Egyptian
governorate of Aswan have been inundated.
</P>
<P>
The 1,670-kilometer Nile is Africa's longest river, running
south-north through several countries before pouring into the
Mediterranean.

<HEADLINE> GCC Determined to Remove Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan said
Tuesday that the council is determined to make special efforts
to remove hurdles blocking commercial exchanges among member
states, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan was speaking to reporters after the GCC Committee
of Commercial Cooperation closed its 25th meeting here.
Ministers of Commerce of the six-member GCC attended the
one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the GCC ministers of commerce discussed hurdles in
trade exchanges, regulating the retail and whole sale trade,
ownership and trading of shares by the GCC nationals.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers support the establishment of a general audit
authority and this is a crucial matter as auditing has
become an effective factor in reviving and organizing the
economy," Al-Hujailan said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC official said the ministers also discussed the
relations between the chambers of commerce and ministers of
commerce in these countries, economic cooperation between the
GCC states on the one hand and the United States and the
European Union on the other.
</P>
<P>
On the GCC-European cooperation, Al-Hujailan said that the
GCC states should unify custom tariffs and set up a common
market before signing an agreement with the European Union to
establish a free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The GCC General Secretary pointed out that the GCC-European
balance of trade tilted in favor of the European countries
by 14 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the classification of commodities,
which is blocking the integration of the GCC customs tariffs,
would be finalized at the forthcoming GCC summit due in December
in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance set up
in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> WIPO to Cut Patent Registration Fees by 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) will cut patent registration fees by
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based WIPO said that the reduction in fees to
register international patents, the second in a year, was approved
by 171 members at its annual meeting which ended on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Revenues in 1997 from 54,000 international patent applications
brought in 100 million Swiss francs (about 74 million U.S.
dollars). The number of applications rose 27 percent in the first
half of 1998, partly thanks to an earlier cut of 15 percent in
fees last January.
</P>
<P>
WIPO spokesman Laurent Manderieux said the latest cut would
bring the fee for an average international patent application down
to between 1,650 and 2,650 Swiss francs from 2,000-3,000.
</P>
<P>
WIPO also agreed to lower fees for registering industrial
designs by 20 percent, Manderieux added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations agency has also decided to build a new
headquarters costing over 55 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
WIPO, the richest UN agency, has larger financial autonomy than
other U.N. agencies because more than 85 percent of its revenues
come from companies and not from governments.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Israeli Anti-peace Policy Affects Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Tuesday warned that Israel's "negative policies" are
affecting the future of economic development and welfare in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an economic forum here, the Egyptian top diplomat
urged the Israeli government to reconsider these policies.
</P>
<P>
"Both Egypt and the U.S. believe that regional stability and
economic development cannot be achieved, if the Arab-Israeli
conflict remained unresolved. We are fully committed to this
goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also called upon the United States not to scale down its
mediation efforts in face of Israel's uncompromising position.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the U.S. role therein is
indispensable. The role should continue regardless of all the
obstacles and the intransigence of Israel's current government,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attempts to break the Palestinian-Israeli peace
impasse have been hampered by Israel's rejection of a 13 percent
further Israeli redeployment plan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross kicked off last week
a fresh mission to narrow the gap between both sides. Negotiations
have been deadlocked since March 1997 when Israel began building
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Egypt for Arab Ministers' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived in the northern coastal city of
Alexandria Tuesday evening on a two-day visit to Egypt to attend
the Arab League (AL) Foreign Ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
He will update Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria
on the results of current peace-saving efforts and his three round
of talks in a week with U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also scheduled to deliver a speech at the opening
session of AL Foreign Ministerial Council's 110th meeting in Cairo
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the Palestinian leader will call on the Arab
countries to hold an emergency Arab summit to rescue the faltering
Mideast peace process and challenge Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
His address will also tackle the outcome of Ross' mission to
the region, the reasons behind the current deadlock, the explosive
situation in occupied territories like Jerusalem and Hebron, and
difficult economic conditions in Palestinian areas due to the
siege imposed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the region last week on a new mission to narrow
the gap between the Palestinian and Israeli sides on an American
plan on Israeli redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But there is no breakthrough after his rounds of shuttling
between Arafat and Israeli prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The
negotiations between both sides have been languishing for 18
months.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has accepted the U.S. proposal on a 13 percent Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank in return for harsher crackdown on
Palestinian militants. But he rejected Netanyahu's conditions that
PNA have only limited control over 3 percent of the land, which
will be turned into "nature reserves."
</P>
<P>
Egypt backs the U.S. initiative but warns Arafat against
striking a "bad" deal that would compromise Palestinians'
interests and can not be implemented.

BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union expressed
on Tuesday satisfaction at the peaceful and orderly course of the
general elections held in Bosnia-Herzegovina last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The union described the elections being held in a positive
climate as an important step in the implementation of the Dayton
peace accord and on the way toward enhanced stability, normality
and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The satisfaction was declared by Austria that is holding the
rotating presidency of the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in a written statement that the high voter turnout
proved the growing democratic maturity in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The union also expressed gratitude to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for its professional
preparation and organization of the elections held on September 12
and 13 under difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The EU hoped that the election results would soon become
available.
</P>
<P>
OSCE Ambassador Robert Barry, however, said on Tuesday that the
international body supervising the general elections in Bosnia
postponed release of results in that OSCE did not want to publish
incomplete figures.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador added that any partial result would hamper
political dialogue in the country and that of claims by various
Bosnian parties that they won the elections, nobody has yet basis
for claiming victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health
Ministry announced Tuesday that there are 61,270 reported cases
of AIDS in the country until last June.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted a statement issued by the
ministry as saying that however, the number of AIDS patients
across the country is estimated at over 400,000, making Ethiopia
one of the highly-affected countries in eastern and southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, there are also an estimated 2.5
million HIV virus carriers in Ethiopia which has a population of
58 million.
</P>
<P>
An HIV/AIDS policy was approved by the Council of Ministers of
Ethiopia on August 14, 1998 in order to curb the spread of the
killing disease at an alarming rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the policy aims at coordinating efforts of
various sections of the society including donors and at
generating funds necessary for the fight against the AIDS
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
It said that creating situations conducive to preventing and
controlling HIV/AIDS, giving appropriate care to children who
lost their families as a result of AIDS and providing care and
counseling services to AIDS sufferers are some of the major
objectives of the policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a recent press report, since the AIDS
disease was first spotted in Ethiopia in 1984, about 150,000
children have contracted HIV by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Adults between the ages of 20 and 49 years are responsible for
about 90 percent of the reported AIDS cases.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Warns against Freedom Abuse by Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday gave a stern warning to
the press and called on cultural and judicial bodies to deal
with those who are abusing the freedoms.
</P>
<P>
"I keep waiting to see what the responsible bodies will
do" with the group of the press that started targeting the
people's faith, Khamenei said to a group of commanders of
the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).
</P>
<P>
The problem arose when a group of people opposed to
Islam, (late supreme leader) Imam (Khomeini) and the system
hid behind another group and started targeting people's faith,
the official news agency IRNA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I see that a group of the press in the country is
gripped with such crisis and they should salvage themselves,"
he warned, "stopping their moves is not anything difficult."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Khamenei was referring to the
pro-moderate press which are struggling for freedom of
expression in the country, one of the promises of President
Mohammad Khatami during the presidential elections in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance, judicial and security bodies should identify those who
have targeted the people's faith and have desecrated the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
"I am making it clear for the officials that they should
take measures and find out which paper is going beyond the
boundaries of freedom," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei underlined the need to distinguish between proper
exercise of freedoms and conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
"How can one allow those looking towards the west and
specially the U.S., after 20 years of opposition with the
Islamic revolution and the late Imam Khomeini, to raise
questions about the glorious past of the nation?" he
questioned
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also underlined the necessity for preservation of
the system's integrity and respect for the officials and
called for preventing any offenses carried out under the
pretext of defending leadership and religion.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the recent assault by a group of
hard-liners on two key figures of the Khatami's cabinet,
Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani and
Vice President for Development and Social Affairs Abdollah
Nouri.
</P>
<P>
On September 4, Mohajerani and Nouri were beaten by the
hard-liners in a funeral ceremony for 700 Iranian soldiers
killed in the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
"We have rules and regulations and officials and the system
should be respected," the Iranian leader added.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Soldiers Aid Oppositions: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho opposition
party supporters, who took to the street in capital Maseru and
seized government vehicles Tuesday morning, were being aided by
army soldiers, police said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Lesotho
Police Commissioner Bolutu Makoaba as saying that his officers
were too scared to arrest protesters because the soldiers were
assisting them.
</P>
<P>
Makoaba said that he was unable to take up the matter with the
defense force because its chief was last week forced to step down
by mutinous officers.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Lieutenant-General Makhula Mosakheng, who
was forced to resign at gun point on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Mosakheng's successor, Lieutenant-General Anthony Thibedi,
also appeared not to be in control of the army, Makoaba said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also confirmed that government vehicles were
being seized by protesting youths.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of injuries to civil servants or damage
to property, but a security guard outside a local business was
injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, there was a report saying that Lesotho
army dispersed groups of youths from opposition parties, who
attacked civil servants, and that the situation in the capital
was under military control.
</P>
<P>
Army trucks were patroling the streets of the capital and
groups of police officers were stationed at the strategic points
along the main streets, SAPA quoted witnesses as reporting.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Resumes Credit Talks With World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has resumed talks with
the World Bank (WB) on renewing credit facilities frozen by the
bank, the official News Agency of Nigeria said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks started Monday in Nigerian capital Abuja between
Finance Minister Mallam Ismaila and visiting WB Vice President
for Africa, Jean-Louis Sarbid.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to access whatever facilities that would assist
us, especially when our foreign currency earnings are falling as
a result of dwindling oil prices," said the Nigerian minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that the present Nigerian administration led by
General Abdulsalam Abubakar is trying to revitalize the economy
by attracting foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Sarbid said he would use his brief stay in
the west African country to discuss ways in which the bank could
be of assistance to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also use the opportunity to find out ways of
making Nigeria attractive to foreign investors, where fuel queues
would vanish and where school pupils studying on bare floor would
find desks and chairs to sit on.
</P>
<P>
Sarid said that the talks, which would continue at the bank's
headquarters in New York next week, would center on how to
achieve a realistic price for petroleum products, stressing that
in all development efforts sound economic management is
essential.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Britain to Enhance Defense Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister
Ismet Sezgin said Tuesday that Turkey will strengthen defense
cooperation with Britain, according to local TV reports.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with his British counterpart George Robertson,
Sezgin said that the good Turco-British relationship has created
a positive environment for the two countries' cooperation in the
defense field.
</P>
<P>
"A strong and well-trained army is essential for Turkey
which is located in a region of instabilities," Sezgin said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who is on a two-day official visit to Turkey,
said that Britain is ready to further its ties with Turkey,
describing Turkey as one of the most valuable ally of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
The British defense secretary is also expected to hold
meetings with Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and British defense officials signed an agreement
aimed at strengthening defense industry cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The accord is similar to those Turkey has signed with
other countries in the same sector, Turkish officials said,
declining to give details.
</P>
<P>
Britain currently does not have a significant investment in
Turkey's defense industry apart from a 160 million U.S. dollar
deal on wireless radio production between the Turkish army and
the British company Marconi.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Toughening Methamphetamine Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Penalties for trafficking
in methamphetamines would increase to equal those for crack
cocaine under a bill the U.S. House of Representatives passed by
voice vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The measure would increase penalties for manufacturing,
trafficking, importing or possessing methamphetamines by cutting
in half the amount of the drug required to trigger a mandatory
minimum sentence. The Senate has not yet voted on a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
It would require a mandatory minimum 10-year sentence for 50
grams of speed and a five-year minimum for five grams.
</P>
<P>
Under current law, 100 grams of methamphetamine drugs trigger
a 10-year minimum sentence, and 10 grams trigger a five-year
minimum.
</P>
<P>
Part of the current law that would not change let judges impose
a life sentence on an offender with a previous felony drug
conviction or when use of the drug leads to the death or serious
bodily injury of another.
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine abuse is a "national problem," said
Representative Bill McCollum, a Republican," Methamphetamine
deaths around the country have skyrocketed."

<HEADLINE> Kinkel, Dini Call for New International Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel and his Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini Tuesday proposed
that a new international police peace mission be established in
Albania given the renewed unrest in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter to Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel of
Austria, who now holds the rotating presidency of the European
Union, Kinkel and Dini also called on the EU to strengthen its
efforts to help stabilize the situation in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Albania's efforts to achieve political and economic
stabilization had been increasingly threatened given the overall
unstable situation in the Balkan region and especially the Kosovo
crisis, the two ministers said in the letter publicized Tuesday in
Bonn.
</P>
<P>
"It had become increasingly important for the world community
and especially the EU to strengthen their efforts to contribute to
a democratic consolidation of the institutions in the country and
a stabilization of the overall situation," they said.
</P>
<P>
A development like the one in Spring last year, which sank
Albania in anarchy and chaos, should be allowed to be repeated,
the two ministers stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinkel and Dini, a new international police
mission in Albania could help the local authorities in restoring
order and controlling arms smuggling to Kosovo as well as illegal
immigrations.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also called on the EU to seek further
measures to help Tirana to promote economic development, to combat
corruption and to overcome difficulties concerning inflows of
Kosovo refugees.

<HEADLINE> Jordan FM Urges Israel to Stop Anti-Peace Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdel Ilah Al Khatib Tuesday called on the Israeli government to
implement the agreement concluded with the Palestinians and to
stop its anti-peace practices.
</P>
<P>
In statements upon his arrival here to attend the 110th
session of the Arab foreign ministers meeting on Wednesday, Khatib
said the most important thing for Arabs in this stage is the
Mideast peace march, especially on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian minister stressed the significance of the
upcoming Arab League Foreign Ministerial Council meeting at a time
the Arab nation is "fraught with critical issues."
</P>
<P>
The new developments in the Mideast peace process and
Libya-West crisis will top the agenda of the foreign ministers'
two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled for 18
months over Israeli construction of Jewish settlement and its
delay in further West Bank redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Khatib said that Jordan, together with Egypt, offers the
Palestinians every possible help with a view to realizing
progress and fulfilling the just Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian top diplomat urged Arab countries to come up with
stronger teamwork to face up to various challenges.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab nation is facing critical challenges which entail the
unification of Arab lines to be able to take positive steps,"
Khatib said, adding that "calm and constructive dialog" is
necessary for any successful joint Arab action.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the second Arab country, after Egypt, to sign a peace
agreement with Israel, and remains a close relationship with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Flood Claims One Life in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A 45-year-old woman became
on Tuesday the first victim of the Belgian flood that affected
four of the country's nine provinces.
</P>
<P>
The woman was drowned to death after the car she was driving
swerved off road and submerged in a deep ditch at
Heist-op-den-Berg in northern Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Military servicemen and flood rescuers were called in to help
evacuate people from communities immediately menaced by the rising
waters that overflew river embankments in northeastern Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Though torrential rains stopped on Tuesday and the water
stopped to rise in the rivers in the eastern province of Liege,
the situation still remained critical in the northeastern
provinces of Brahant and Limbourg.
</P>
<P>
The water in rivers Ambleve, Vesdre, Hoegne and Demer as well
as the Meuse, fed by huge quantities of rain water, rose to
alarming levels by surpassing the 1993 and 1995 flood levels.
</P>
<P>
Third-degree warnings are given in case of catastrophe by
Belgium's provincial authorities that are thus entitled to demand
military and special assistance.
</P>
<P>
The flood-stricken communities were each given up to 20 million
Belgian francs (600,000 U.S. dollars) to cover emergency relief
cost such as food and drinking water while provincial authorities
are expected to grant special funds to repair damaged
infrastructures in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Continuous rains, that started late last month and kept on and
off for most of the past fortnight, were attributed to the
unusually warmer waters in the nearby North Sea.

<HEADLINE> 2 Iranian Diplomats Return From Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The two Iranian diplomats
who escaped the massacre of the Afghan Taliban militia have
entered Iran, the evening paper Kayhan reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian deputy foreign minister for Asia-Pacific affairs Mohsen
Aminzadeh revealed the news to the paper Monday night on the
sidelines of the ceremony to receive the bodies of killed Iranian
diplomats and reporter.
</P>
<P>
However, Aminzadeh did not give further details about the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh said earlier that one of the diplomat was not present
in the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif when the Taliban forces
attacked it on August 8, while another was wounded in the massacre
but fled from the city.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of six Iranian diplomats and a correspondent of
the official news agency IRNA were flown to Tehran Monday night,
but the fate of another two Iranian diplomats are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban found nine bodies, but two of them were not
accepted by Iran as an Iranian technical team could not identify
them.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh also told Kayhan that some people believe the two
Iranian are still alive. He stressed that Iran would make efforts
to find out the fate of the two Iranians.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Okays Extension of MONUA Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday voted 15-0 to adopt a resolution in its
decision to extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer
Mission in Angola (MONUA) until October 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to assess the overall situation
and take action on the future role of the United Nations in Angola
on the basis of a report and recommendations to be submitted by
the U.N. Secretary-General no later than October 8.
</P>
<P>
The resolution endorsed the decision of the Secretary-General
to instruct MONUA to adjust its deployment on the ground to
ensure safety and security of the MONUA personnel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution demanded that UNITA comply
immediately and without conditions with its obligations, in
particular the complete demilitarization of its forces and full
cooperation in the immediate and unconditional extension of State
administration throughout the national territory.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called upon UNITA to withdraw immediately
from territories which it has occupied through military action
while reiterating its full support for the implementation of the
Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council held UNITA responsible for the
current stalemate in the peace process, saying that "the primary
cause of the crisis in Angola and of the current impasse in the
peace process is the failure by the leadership of UNITA under
Lusaka Protocol."
</P>
<P>
The resolution "strongly urges the Government of Angola,
UNITA and States in the region to reject military action, to
pursue dialogue to resolve the crisis and to refrain from any
steps which could exacerbate the current situation."
</P>
<P>
The international community has said UNITA is blocking peace
process in Angola and leaders from 14 southern African countries
branded the UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government, headed by President Jose Eduardo Dos
Santos, accused rebel UNITA of its failure to come in terms with
the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Angolan
president said on Monday that his government would no longer deal
with the former rebel leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Savimbi has again launched a military campaign all over
the national territory and has hardened his positions against
the Angolan Government, the Troika of Observers and the United
Nations themselves," he wrote in the letter, referring to an
observation group of representatives of the United States,
Russia and Portugal, the former colonial power.
</P>
<P>
After more than 20 years of civil war that left every industry
destroyed and millions dead, Angola has been hovering someplace
between peace and war for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
Angola won its independence from Portugal in 1975 and
immediately plunged into a civil war. A truce was achieved in
1992, and elections were held, UNITA leader Savimbi returned to
war. In 1994, facing likely defeat, he agreed to the Lusaka
Protocol.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Tuesday underscored the need for his country to
tighten links with Swaziland for the mutual benefit of the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking in at a banquet here for the
visiting King Mswati III of Swaziland who arrived in Dar es
Salaam Tuesday for a three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said it is gratifying to note that even without formal
arrangements, the peoples of two countries have conducted
cooperation in several fields especially manpower and business.
</P>
<P>
"While in your country I had an opportunity to meet a
community of Tanzanians working there," Mkapa said, adding that
Tanzania also has a lot of people from Swaziland who are doing
business or studying at colleges.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges have been spontaneously conducted, Mkapa said,
noting that people of the two nations have walked ahead of their
governments in promoting bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said it is high time that the two governments expanded
and formalized cooperation in other key sectors such as tourism,
agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of the Great Lakes Region, Mkapa said member
countries view with great concern the escalation of conflicts
especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He said the continued civil war in Congo (K), where rebels
have been fighting against government troops loyal to President
Laurent Kabila since August 2, poses a great threat to the peace
and stability of all surrounding countries and hinders their
development.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa reaffirmed that Tanzania advoes peaceful
resolution of the crisis in Congo. "Peace is an indispensable
condition for the socio-economic development of any society," he
said. "Africa desperately needs peace, security and stability."
</P>
<P>
"Africa must rise from the morass of poverty, underdevelopment
and conflict," he said, pointing out conflicts will undermine the
conducive environment for investment, industrial production and
sustained economic development in the continent.

<HEADLINE> Arab States to Adopt Unanimous Stance on Libya: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Arab states will adopt a
unanimous stance on the Lockerbie issue after the resolution of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on lifting the embargo
imposed on Libya as from September 1, according to a senior
official here.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail was quoted by
the Sudanese News Agency as saying that the position of the Arab
states "will not be different from that of the African ones on
Libya."
</P>
<P>
The OAU, in its summit meeting in June, adopted a resolution to
defy the sanctions starting from this month if the United States
and Britain fail to make compromise.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on Libya in
1992 after it failed to hand over two Libyans suspected of blowing
up an American flight over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. The
bombing killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab states will not keep silent towards the U.N. unjust
resolution, despite their respect for the international
legitimacy," said the Sudanese minister who chairs the Arab
League' Foreign Ministers Council.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the Arab position to be adopted during the
Cairo session of the AL Foreign Ministers Council next week will
be unanimous for lifting the embargo on Libya.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity of supporting Libya that backs the
Arab causes all the time.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton has chosen Gregory Craig, a ranking State Department
official, to join the team of White House officials handling
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on the Monica Lewinsky
matter, the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Craig will quarterback the response to the (Starr)
referral," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters,
adding that Craig would hold the title of assistant to the
president and special counsel at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Craig is a former law partner of Clinton's private lawyer David
Kendall and also served on the staff of Senator Edward Kennedy, a
top Democrat who is a strong supporter of the president. Craig
will come to the White House from the State Department, where he
served as director of policy and planning.
</P>
<P>
He will join White House deputy chief of staff John Podesta,
White House counsel Charles Ruff and Kendall in representing
Clinton before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee,
which is weighing the 445-page report that Starr sent Congress
last week, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Craig will report directly to the president.
</P>
<P>
The White House has been seeking to strengthen Clinton's legal
and political team following the release of the Starr report,
which alleges that Clinton may have committed 11 impeachable
offenses related to his affair with Lewinsky and efforts to cover
it up. Clinton's lawyers have denied that the president did
anything that warrants impeachment.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Most European shares slipped
on Tuesday, as fears about Asia, Russia and the weak dollar
resurfaced, but a steady start on Wall Street helped European
shares recover in late afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
The London market was under pressure for much of the day, but
shares recovered late in the session, tracking Wall Street's move
out of the red.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 finished the day 13 higher at 5282. The index was
75 points in the red mid-afternoon but recovered to close just
short of the 5283 session high.
</P>
<P>
A steady showing on Far Eastern equity markets, offered hope,
although stocks drew little comfort from some soothing inflation
data, which undermined sterling as economists said UK interest
rates were likely to move lower sooner.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are some positive factors floating around,
there just seem to be too many negatives," one trader was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The market had gotten ahead of itself expecting G-7 interest
rate cuts soon, and rates should have been cut some time ago if
they were to have had any effect, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax closed down 41.95 at 4,851.56 in
quiet trading.
</P>
<P>
"Without a sustained breakthrough of a resistance level of
5,000 points, the DAX remains delicate," one German equities
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares also drifted lower, with the Cac 40
index closing down 16.8 points at 3698.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says it Has Stronger Force to Confront Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military force to
confront Iraq is stronger than earlier this year and it will be
used if diplomacy fails to make Iraq to cooperate, the U.S.
administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the House International Relations Committee,
Martin Indyk, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs, said the U.N. Security Council must first decide on how
to respond to Iraq's decision to freeze its cooperation on weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government's actions have put the U.S. administration
"back on the ladder of potentially escalating confrontation with
Iraq," said Indyk.
</P>
<P>
"So be it. We will not accept the indefinite blockage by Iraq"
of U.N. weapons inspections, he stressed. "Force remains an
option...It has not been taken off the table."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had a "considerably stronger strike capability" in the
region than we did at the time of the last confrontation with
Baghdad," he noted, adding, "We can augment that force rapidly
should we need to do so."
</P>
<P>
Indyk said the United States will decide when and how to
respond to Iraq's actions.

<HEADLINE> S. African, Botswanan Officials Meet Over Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise Tuesday briefed Botswana's Deputy President
Ian Khama in Gaborone about the political situation in Lesotho,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The Gaborone briefing had taken place "within the context of
recent Southern African Development Community's efforts to
restore peace, democracy, stability and rule of the law in
Lesotho, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's spokesman
Ronnie Mamoepa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Modise had two rounds of talks with Lesotho cabinet ministers
and representatives of the army in the country since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While the Tuesday meeting was held in Botswana's capital,
Lesotho opposition party supporters had been gathering in Maseru,
the capital of the land-locked kingdom in protest against delays
in releasing a tri-national report on alleged electoral fraud in
Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
A joint investigation team formed by officials from South
Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe have been probing into the alleged
rigging of results of Lesoth's general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
A report by the team reportedly completed last week. However,
informed sources said, Mbeki decided to withhold it until it had
been seen by the presidents of South Africa, Botswana and
Zimbabwe, who form a troika protecting Lesotho's democracy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the meeting between Modise and Khama, there was
still no official word on when the report would be released to
the Lesotho people.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's defense minister, who earlier indicated he would
attend the meeting in Gaborone, failed to arrive and the briefing
went ahead without him.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa refused to give details of the talks with Khama, who
is also Botswana's defense minister, saying that the meeting had
noted the troika presidents' commitment to "deliver the report as
soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the situation in Maseru, where opposition youths
forced civil servants out of government cars and seized the
vehicles Tuesday morning, Mamoepa said: "the meeting expressed
its gravest concern about the degeneration of the situation into
lawless and disorder."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard it resolved to call on all leaders in Lesotho
to stablize the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sources reaching here said that Lesotho's protesters seized up
to 50 government vehicles and impounded them at the Palace of
King Letsie III in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's unrest follows a mutiny last week in which junior
army officers arrested more than 20 senior officers and forced
army chief lieutenan-General Makhule Mosakheng to resign.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
approved a 165 million U.S. dollar loan to Brazil to help reduce
the incidence of HIV and STD infection, expand and improve
treatment and care of persons with HIV, AIDS and STDs.
</P>
<P>
The Second AIDS and STD Control Project is planned on the First
AIDS and STD Control Project. Under the first project, the
Brazilian government put in place a prevention program containing
many of the features which have proved to be highly successful in
preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The new project will broaden prevention activities, maintaining
a focus on high-risk groups. The project will also strengthen
evaluation capacity, work towards the sustainability of the
program, and decentralize some responsibilities for AIDS/STD
prevention to states and municipalities to identify the most
cost-effective intervention.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 300 million
dollars.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
okayed a 85 million U.S. dollar loan to help finance the Second
Roads Rehabilitation Project in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve road maintenance management,
rehabilitate high-priority, primary, secondary and tertiary roads
as well as reduce traffic congestion in Panama City.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project will strengthen the capacity of the
Environmental Unit of the Ministry of Public Works for conducting
environmental and social impact assessments and for mitigating the
negative impacts of road development in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The construction and rehabilitation of Panamanian road will
take place throughout the country. In Panama City, commuters will
benefit from road rehabilitation and minor widening, as well as
technical advise to reorganize public transportation to reduce
transport costs and travel time. The rehabilitation of secondary
and tertiary roads will complement poverty alleviation in rural
areas as inhabitants will now have greater access to outside
employment and markets.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 123.8 million
dollars. Apart from the World Bank's loan, the government of
Panama will contribute 38.8 million dollars.

ATHENS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis said here Tuesday that the current crisis in

He said that Greece was doing its utmost to make sure that
there were no adverse effects on the Greek minority in Albania or
on the Greek people living near the Albanian border.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Nations Delay Arms Purchases Amid Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Latin American nations
face growing pressure to delay arms purchases as Asia's economic
woes spread to the region, according to the latest edition of a
U.S. weekly magazine.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, the hardest hit Latin American country by the
crisis, has delayed purchasing two F-16 fighter planes and may
scale back purchases of training aircraft, The Defense News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The outlook in Venezuela is very uncertain. "The country is
facing serious economic problems generated by a drop in the value
of its oil exports and pressure on a currency that many economists
argue is overvalued," the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Chile's defense spending, which depends in part on the
performance of its copper industry, which in turn relies on sales
to Asian nations, has delayed the purchase of new fighter aircraft
until at least next year.
</P>
<P>
The country's military relies heavily on a state-owned fund
that receives 10 percent of its revenue from copper exports. The
fund has yielded about 250 million U.S. dollars for the military
annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chile's prospective purchase of an initial lot of 16 fighters
has been delayed into at least next year.
</P>
<P>
As lower commodity prices slow Latin American economies and
government spending reductions are needed to defend the value of
national currencies, the likelihood of defense cutbacks increases,
the report quoted U.S. and European defense officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Latin America represents a small but growing market for
defense equipment," said the report.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1997, Latin American nations spent 5 billion U.S.
dollars on weapons, representing 6.9 percent of total arms
purchase agreements with developing nations.

<HEADLINE> UNRWA Workers Stage One-day Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A majority of the workers at
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's (UNRWA) branch in
Jordan Tuesday staged a one-day strike to protest low wages
and poor working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The strike was prompted by the cash-strapped agency's recent
decision to raise the salaries of 10 to 15 senior managers in its
five areas of operation by 30 to 40 percent, the official Jordan
Television quoted an anonymous worker at the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ordinary workers' wages have remained unchanged for some
five years and have been inconsistent with the increase of the
cost of living, he said.
</P>
<P>
"After 10 years of service at the UNRWA, our salaries are
lower than those of government employees. We do not even get the
same benefits of early retirement and compensation for
termination of employment," the semi-official Jordan Times
recently quoted an UNRWA staff representative as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UNRWA's workers have also complained for poor working
conditions and service cutbacks imposed by the agency, according
to the representative.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNRWA Commissioner General Peter Hansen has sent
the staff a letter, insisting that the strike would not yield any
results and the workers' salaries were well above those of
the local government employees.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's strike took place after rounds of negotiations between
the workers and the agency's managers.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Television reported Tuesday that similar strikes also
happened in other four areas in the region that the agency
operates.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official figures so far as to how many UNRWA
employees were on strike in Jordan and how many in the whole
region.
</P>
<P>
The UNRWA is currently burdened with a 56 million U.S. dollars
of deficit in its budget of 314 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the UNRWA has been short of fund as the
traditional contributors began to decrease their donation. The
financial shortage forced the agency to adopt cost-reduction
measures which included suspending recruitment of teachers,
canceling hospitalization programs and reducing international
staff by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The UNRWA was established in 1948 to offer educational, health
and other social services to some 3.4 million registered
Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Jordan alone is home to over 1.2 million
U.N.-registered Palestinian refugees.

BUCHAREST, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Ministry
is seriously worried about the situation in Albania and appeals to
all political forces there to decline violence by giving
consistency to the existing democratic framework.
</P>
<P>
Romania commiserates over the losses of human lives that have
taken place in Tirana lately, and will examine in consultation
with NATO and EU member countries the way in which it can back up
Albania's democratic development, informed the department of the
spokesman for the Romanian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Tuesday that
a contribution of 450,000 Canadian dollars (292,500 U.S. dollars)
to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) in support
of the Landmine Monitor program.
</P>
<P>
This funding will help enhance the capacity of the ICBL and its
member organizations to monitor international compliance with the
Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines, according to a
release issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Monitoring compliance is about making sure that the convention
becomes much more than words on paper," said Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy in the release.
</P>
<P>
"It is about making sure that the convention will have concrete
impact on the lives of people who must live with landmines every
day. It is about making sure that the millions of mines held in
stockpiles around the world will not poison the ground for future
generations," added the Candadian minister.
</P>
<P>
The contribution comes from Canada's
100-million-Canadian-dollar Landmines Fund announced last December
at the signing conference for the Ottawa Convention.
</P>
<P>
The announcement coincided with the Landmine Monitor Meeting
taking place on September 14-19 in Dublin, Ireland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Cooperation with Russia to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The cooperation between
the United States and Russia will continue despite Russia's
economic crisis and government shakeup, a senior U.S. official
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hearing of a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Steven Sestanovich, special advisor of the
State Department on former Soviet regions, said how Russia's
economic crisis is resolved "has profound political implications."
</P>
<P>
"It has created nearly a month of political turmoil that
Russian democracy appears to have weathered in an orderly,
constitutional way," said Sestanovich.
</P>
<P>
"Russian democracy seems to have put down real roots. All the
same, we have to recognize that there are players in Russian
politics who have no more than a tactical commitment to democratic
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that these people will be "prepared to exploit
economic and political turmoil to gain power, and neither we nor
Russia's elected leaders can ignore this fact."
</P>
<P>
Sestanovich also warned that the United States must also
wrestle with the foreign policy implications of Russia's current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has repeatedly said that it will
continue to support Russia if it pursues economic reform path and
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard grim predictions that U.S.- Russian cooperation
will gradually break down -- either because foreign policy will be
subordinated to Russia's domestic drama, or because domestic
difficulties will push Moscow's leaders into a more
confrontational approach toward the outside world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Either of these predictions could come true, he told the
lawmakers, explaining that cooperation between the two countries
are in the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The goals of the U.S. foreign policies are "realistic goals
precisely because they reflect Russian interests as well as our
own," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S. shares common interests in a wide range of
issues including arms reduction, security in the Balkans, good
relations with neighbors, said the official.
</P>
<P>
"These interests -- Russia's as well as ours -- provide a solid
continuing basis for working together. The test will be whether
the Russian government continues to share that view and act
accordingly," Sestanovich said.
</P>
<P>
"We have too many interests at stake to put U.S.-Russian
relations on hold," he concluded.

UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan had met with U.N. representatives from Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Afghanistan, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general met the three representatives Monday and
he expressed his concern over the heightening tension along the
Iran-Afghanistan border and reports of mass killing following the
August 8 capture of Mazar-i-Sharif by the Taleban," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general asked the representatives to use their
influence to persuade the Taleban to respect the rights of all
civilians regardless of their religious beliefs. They agreed to do
so," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis between the two neighboring Islamic states began
when the military faction Taleban captured the city of
Mazar-i-Sharif and was accused of killing nine Iranian diplomats
during the takeover. The Taleban denied the allegation by saying
that unidentified soliders acting on their own killed the Iranian
diplomats. The crisis between the two states deepened at the
weekend with the Taleban's takeover of the city of Bamiyan, west
of the Afghan capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the
only three countries which recognize the Taleban government.

<HEADLINE> Late Chinese President Remembered by Hometown People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- People of the hometown of
late President Yang Shangkun, who died early this week, have
expressed deep love for him.
</P>
<P>
At the Shuangjiang Township of Tongnan County, southwest
China's Sichuan Province, where the late president was born,
continuous streams of people have visited the mourning hall to
offer their condolences to Yang, who died of illness in Beijing on
September 14 at the age of 92.
</P>
<P>
Yang left his hometown at 1920 at the age of 14, and only
returned for the first time in 1987 when he was over 80 years. He
re-visited his hometown in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Every time Yang returned home, he showed great concern about
the livelihood of the local people.
</P>
<P>
"He asked me whether I was paid in IOUs and whether my family
had a washing machine," farmer Liu Fakun recalled of a meeting
with Yang in April, 1993 during Yang's second return trip to his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
Jin Zhenbao, headmaster of Shuangjiang Primary School, said
that each time Yang met with the village folks, he would ask the
teachers to sit at the front-row seats and inquire about education
there.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zuwen, magistrate of Tongnan County, recalled: During each
of his return trip home, he said repeatedly that the folks should
be freed of any trouble by doing anything special for him.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, he often asked me whether people's life had
improved," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-year-old Liu Huaiqing had this to say: "When he left us
last year, he said he would return home again next year. But now
his last wish will not be realized."
</P>
<P>
"His gentle voice and kind face will always linger in our
hearts," Liu said with tears welling his eyes.

<HEADLINE> Burtenshaw Admits 'Bung' Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Steve Burtenshaw has
apologized to a Football Association disciplinary hearing after
admitting receiving an illegal payment while he was at Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The former Gunners chief scout accepted a 35,000 pounds
payment from Scandinavian agent Rune Hauge two months after John
Jensen moved to Highbury from Brondby in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
Burtenshaw, now chief scout at Queens Park Rangers, was
charged after the Inland Revenue were alerted to the large sum of
money deposited in an offshore account.
</P>
<P>
He will have an anxious wait until Friday to hear the FA
ruling after judgment was deferred.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said: "It was clearly a conflict of
interests with his role with Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"The unauthorised payment is outside FA rules. It was accepted
by the FA commission that the payment was not solicited and
counsel representing him said that other than this incident he
had an unblemished 50-year career in football.
</P>
<P>
"He added he was guilty of a misjudgment for which he is
deeply sorry."
</P>
<P>
The inquiry follows a four-year investigation by the FA which
culminated in Burtenshaw being charged in January this year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Czech President Vaclav Havel met at the White House
Wednesday to discuss European security issues.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Havel at a South Lawn ceremony by the White House,
Clinton praised the Czech president for his role in his country's
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"It owes a very great deal, in our time, to the inspiration
provided by a single man, Vaclav Havel, who for years spoke when
it mattered and often at enormous personal cost," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Havel said his country looked forward to becoming a member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which is to
formally admit Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic as new
members next spring.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that it was your personal
leadership that made this historic development possible," Havel
said to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Havel said NATO membership was "one of the most important
guarantees of our democratic development".
</P>
<P>
Havel, 61, is on a five-day U.S. visit and is expected to meet
Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
other U.S. officials this week.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal in Panic Over Adulterated Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Panic is growing in the
Himalayan kingdom of Nepal over adulterated oil in the market as
Dashain, the biggest festival in the country, is just around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
Panic gripped the country about three weeks ago when news broke
out that adulterated mustard oil, which had claimed more than 50
lives and caused over 2,000 cases of dropsy in neighboring India,
was being smuggled into the markets here.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Nepali people, especially those living in urban
areas and the Terai region bordering India, use mustard oil which
is considered cheaper and good for health.
</P>
<P>
Ten out of 278 samples of mustard oil collected from customs
offices in the border area, godowns, oil mills, wholesalers and
retailers had been found adulterated with argemone mexicana, said
Dr. Tika Bahadur Karki, chief of the Central Food Research
Laboratory under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
And the fatal oil had been detected in a soybean oil sample
taken from Kathmandu and three mustard oil samples from Nepalgunj
in mid-western Nepal, he added.
</P>
<P>
Argemone mexicana, which grows together with mustard in fields,
is a black seed quite similar to mustard seeds in appearance,
press reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Its mixture into the mustard oil can cause symptoms like bouts
of vomiting followed by diarrhea, swelling of the stomach, hands
and legs, cataract in the eyes, urinary disorder, respiratory
complications and even heart attack, Ganga Raj Aryal from the
Department of Health said.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of fear and apprehension grew further after 10
members of two families in Jhapa district of eastern Nepal fell
ill after consuming the cooking oil bought in the local market.
</P>
<P>
Experts blamed the infiltration of adulterated oil in the
market on the government's failure to control the sale of
unlabeled food products.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that the government had issued an order to
label the date of manufacture and expiry, the net weight and batch
number of food products from April 14 this year, but backed down
when the industrialists raised a hue and cry.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, the central and local governments in Nepal
have taken strict measures to strengthen checking at border points
to seize smuggled adulterated oil from India, ban import of
cooking oil from India, seal factories producing adulterated oil,
test samples brought from across the country and take actions
against those selling adulterated oil.
</P>
<P>
And a committee has been formed to coordinate efforts of
various ministries toward providing quality cooking oil to the
consumers for the coming festival.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Vegetable Ghee and Oil Manufacturer Association
announced on Sunday that the adulterated oil would be withdrawn
from the market within three to four days and replaced with oil
certified by the government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Nepal Food Retailers Association decided not to
sell cooking oil unless it was certified as edible and to have the
wholesalers make the testing of mustard oil public.
</P>
<P>
Most of the consumers in the Kathmandu Valley just have stopped
purchasing the mustard oil. Sales of other kinds of cooking oil
were said to have gone down as well.
</P>
<P>
"I have completely stopped buying any oil from the market after
the incident. I used to buy sunflower oil, but now it is also not
safe because there may be adulteration in it," said Mrs. L.
Sharma, a consumer.

<HEADLINE> Sweden's Inflation Falls to Zero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Swedish inflation fell by
0.5 percent in August, bringing the annual inflation rate to about
zero, down from nearly two percent at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The August decline, which was mainly caused by a dramatic cut
in tobacco tax, was the largest in a single month since November
1992.
</P>
<P>
The government cut the tobacco tax after widespread cigarette
smuggling, which started to lessen Sweden's tobacco tax
revenues. As a result of the tax cut, the price of cigarettes fell
by 16 percent.

<HEADLINE> Study: Gulf War Syndrome Beyond Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The "Gulf War syndrome"
are not only common among Gulf War veterans, they are also
frequently reported by soldiers who never went to the region,
according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
The syndrome, such as fatigue, moodiness, memory problems and
muscle pain, that many Gulf War veterans complain of are
not likely to be explained by toxic exposures, exotic infections
or other risk factors peculiar to the war, said a report by a
team of epidemiologists in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
The scientists from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, after a survey of four Air Force units in
1995, found that 45 percent of Gulf War veterans had chronic
physical complaints, but about 15 percent of soldiers who had
never been deployed to the Gulf had the same problems.
</P>
<P>
Many had suspected that the illness was sourced from the Gulf
War in which chemical weapons might have been exploded.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Gulf War in 1991, many soldiers reported that
they were suffering tiredness, difficulty concentrating, muscle
and joint pain, as well as diarrhea, skin rashes and breathing
problems. About 100,000 people have signed up for medical exams
offered by the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Bumper Rice Harvest for Vietnam Despite Bad Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite several natural
disasters, Vietnam's farmers are expecting a 31.3-million-ton
harvest this year, including 28.4 million tons of rice, marking
the fourth straight year of bumper rice crops.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Statistics Department, this year's
rice output is the largest on record, 900,000 tons more than last
year.
</P>
<P>
Despite several months of extended dry spells and extreme heat
waves caused by the El Nino phenomenon along Vietnam's central
coast, farmers in the Mekong delta survived by building field
embankments and coastal dikes to prevent salinization.
</P>
<P>
However, the subsidiary crops' output has dropped slightly
because of the prolonged drought spell to an expected 2.8 million
tons, 200,000 tons fewer than last year.

<HEADLINE> HK to Introduce Electronic Service Delivery in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
said here Wednesday that in the next century the government may
provide its services to the community electronically through an
information infrastructure accessible throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
Kwong Ki-chi, secretary for information technology and
broadcasting of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
said that the government was now "actively planning for the
introduction of Electronic Service Delivery in the year 2000 to
keep Hong Kong in the forefront of Information Technology ( IT)
development and to exploit the full potential of IT."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong International
Computer Conference '98, Kwong said, Electronic Service Delivery,
as the scheme is called, aims to provide government services to
the community electronically through an information infrastructure
accessible throughout the SAR.
</P>
<P>
"In the not too distant future, we will be able to transact
business with government on-line and on a seamless basis through
the use of information kiosks installed at convenient public
locations, personal computers at home or in the office, telephone
through interactive voice response system or interactive
television," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
Public services will be available 24 hours a day and seven days
a week, he added. In short, the scheme will transform the way
public services are delivered, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kwong anticipated that the scheme would serve as a catalyst to
pump-prime the development of electronic commerce in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The open and common information infrastructure adopted for the
scheme could also be readily used by the private sector for the
conduct of electronic transactions at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
A total of 44 local and international companies have expressed
their interest in the scheme, Kwong said. Some of them had solid
experience in implementing similar Electronic Service Delivery
projects elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said, "Our plan is to call for tenders for operating the
Electronic Service Delivery Scheme by the end of the year, award
the contract in mid 1999 and launch the first phase of the scheme
within 2000.
</P>
<P>
"To support the implementation of the Electronic Service
Delivery Scheme and to facilitate the development of electronic
commerce in Hong Kong, we consider it necessary to have locally
established certification authorities to provide security and
trust in the conduct of electronic transactions under a public
key infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said the government was also looking into the need for a
legal framework to enhance certainty in the conduct of electronic
transactions. The objective was to create an environment to help
electronic transactions to take hold in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> HK Anti-Piracy Operation Nets 100,000 Pirated Discs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong customs officers
seized more than 100,000 suspected pirated optical discs, worth
about 1.9 million HK dollars (244,000 U.S. dollars), after raiding
a shopping arcade Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
At about 6 p.m., the officers raided 40 shops at a shopping
arcade at Kwai Chung, making the seizure and arresting 11 men.
</P>
<P>
Of the pirated optical discs, there were 12,000 VCDs of
Japanese TV drama series, which were very popular in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We have been achieving a significant result in checking the
sale of pirated Japanese TV dramas," said a spokesman for the
Customs and Excise Department.
</P>
<P>
The customs officers have seized more than 240,000 pirated
Japanese TV dramas in separate anti-piracy operations during the
past week, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers at all control points are maintaining
vigilance against smuggling of pirated compact discs, including
VCDs of the Japanese TV dramas, into Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
The department was also concerned over piracy activities via
e-mail or Internet. "The situation is now under close supervision
by Customs. We shall strengthen the collection of intelligence to
locate the source of the goods before taking further action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Customs would spare no efforts in combating piracy
activities and preserving the good image of Hong Kong, the
spokesman said.

airports went against EU laws on fair competition.
</P>
<P>
The decision was originally postponed for a week so the Italian
government could reconsider its decree on moving almost all other
European countries' airlines out of the convenient Linate airport
to newly-built Malpensa.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, days of unremitting efforts came to no avail,"
said Kinnock who had been involved in long negotiations with the
Italian authorities.
</P>
<P>
He added that the commission had been trying to persuade Italy
to make rapid and effective efforts to bring its distribution plan
into line with the requirements of fair competition laws
stipulated in the Treaty of Amsterdam for the single market.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government decided last November to redistribute
airline traffic between Milan's existing airport, Linate, and the
new airport, Malpensa, due to start operating on October 25.
</P>
<P>
The Italian authorities passed the decree that all carriers
with more than two million passengers each year would continue to
fly in and out of the easily-accessible Linate while other flights
would have to fly in and out of Malpensa, which is 53 kilometers
away from Milan and still lacks ground transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, nine European carriers including British
Airways, Iberia, TAP, Sabena, Lufthansa, Air France, Olympic,
Austria Airlines and SAS complained to the European Commission
that the plan was discriminatory and disproportionate.
</P>
<P>
The carriers argued that passengers would continue to choose to
fly Italy's national carrier Alitalia out of Linate close by the
Milan town center because of insufficient road and rail links
between Milan and Malpensa.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock said that the European Council of Transport Ministers
was expected to uphold the commission's decision should Italy
stick to its decree.
</P>
<P>
The council, however, can overrule the commission's decision
with a qualified majority . Otherwise, the EU legal procedure
will start to deal with Italy's plan.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rules Out New Taxes, Assures Bread Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Finance Minister
Mohieddin el-Gharib said on Wednesday the government does not
intend to increase taxes in the foreseeable future, or cut back
bread subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, there are trends to reduce taxations on
individuals and organizations whenever possible," he told a
conference on market economies in the Arab states, organized by
Euromoney, an international financial foundation.
</P>
<P>
Gharib said "bread subsidies will also continue and there is
no intention to cancel them either."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has been for years subsidizing sugar,
oil, bread and other basic necessities to cater to the nation's
huge poor population, who are estimated at one third of the whole
population.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister said the government is committed to
reducing customs tariffs on imports over stages to cut down local
market prices without putting local industries at risk.
</P>
<P>
The government is also determined to increase the contribution
of the private sector in the economy and improve the climate for
investment.
</P>
<P>
But he denied reports of a plan to privatize the customs
sector, saying that the government will have an agreement with a
foreign company before the end of the year to help improve custom
services, pinpoint origin of imports and improve standards of
specifications.

The opening of the school is an important step to draw on the
experience of Singapore and a new attempt to restructure China's

<HEADLINE> Senior Party Official Reiterates Rural Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Reform in China's rural areas
should be further deepened to help promote national economic
growth, according to Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, the country's
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Tian, who is also member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made the call
during an inspection tour of northwest Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region between September 5-15.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to deepen reforms in the countryside and
guide farmers to readjust their production structure in accordance
with market needs to help increase farmers' incomes and promote
national economic growth," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have
scored considerable achievements on all fronts since the founding
of New China in 1949, especially since the launching of the
national reform and opening-up program 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Xinjiang's economic strength has increased and local people's
life has improved significantly," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has great advantages in terms of natural resources and
its development prospects are very bright as long as the people of
various ethnic groups unite as one and work closely round the
center of economic construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
To further develop rural economy, the household responsibility
system should be persevered, Tian noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said the production of grain must never be slackened,
the policy of comprehensive agricultural development must not be
deviated, and the guideline for developing rural and township
enterprises must not be wavered.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and only
when the agricultural sector is stable can there by economic and
national stability as well as economic and social advances, Tian
underlined.
</P>
<P>
"In the process to deepen reforms in the rural areas, we must
guide the farmers to be more market-oriented and pursue commodity
production," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, efforts must be beefed up to industrialize
the rural economy and seek a combination of trade and the
industrial and agricultural sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
"To accelerate the industrialization of the agricultural sector
is conducive not only to narrowing the economic disparity between
urban and rural areas but also to accelerating the modernization
process in the rural areas," Tian said.

OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Wednesday
that it will provide additional emergency relief aid to flood
victims in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) will give
wheat valued at 2.5 million Canadian dollars (1.68 million
U.S. dollars). It will be delivered for immediate distribution
through the public distribution system of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"Two-thirds of Bangladesh was flooded in the heaviest rains in
over a decade, drastically reducing the current harvest of rice
and adversely affecting the next crop," said International
Cooperation Minister Diane Marleau.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians are moved by the situation of the 30 million people
affected by the disaster which will leave future food stocks
extremely inadequate," she added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to food aid, CIDA will also provide 425,000
Canadian dollars (284,750 dollars) for the purchase and
distribution of essential medicines, water purification tablets
and oral rehydration salts to over 250,000 families in areas most
affected by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Managers of Moderate Iranian Newspaper Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Some managers of the banned
Iranian moderate evening newspaper Tous were arrested on
Wednesday, Tehran Islamic Revolutionary court announced in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted the statement as saying
that the arrest warrant was issued in light of the activities of
some managers of the newspaper in conflict with the national
security and interests.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement did not give names or number of the
arrested.
</P>
<P>
It said that Tous, which was named after an Iranian ancient
city, was banned from publication as of Wednesday until further
notice.
</P>
<P>
The ban order was announced on Tuesday to Tous' license holder
and editorial director Mohammad Sadeq Javadi Hesar, after Iranian
leader Ayatollah Khamenei on Tuesday called on cultural and
judicial bodies to deal with "the group of the press which are
abusing the freedoms."
</P>
<P>
Tous appeared on newsstands only on July 25 to replace the
banned moderate daily Jameah (Society) and was welcomed by the
public, particularly the Iranian youth for its support for the
policies of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
It was banned for the first time on August 1 following strong
protest from the hard-liners and conservatives against its
pro-democracy articles.
</P>
<P>
But the ban was lifted one day after it was announced as
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance called on the
conservative judiciary to revoke the ban order.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Israeli Policy Fuels Arab Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel Meguid Wednesday warned that Israel risks
stirring up Arab outrage by applying its lop-sided peace policy.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's attempt to impose its concept of peace on the Arab
nation could not ensure its security and stability, but would
rather feed the spirit of Arab resistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the inaugural session of the 110th Arab League
Foreign Ministerial Council meetings here Wednesday, Abdel Meguid
said the kind of peace Arab countries want is the one
"consecrated" by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"It is peace based on implementing U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242, 338, 425, 252 and the land-for-peace
principle ... which means Israel's withdrawal from all occupied
Arab territories," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief appealed to the United State to exercise its role
as a genuine sponsor of the Mideast peace process, "out of
protecting its interests in the region on the one hand, and
giving credence to international legitimacy principles and
resolutions, on the other."
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli negotiations have been stalled on all tracks
for nearly two years. U.S. mediation attempts to break the
Palestinian-Israeli peace impasse have been hamstrung by Israel's
rejection of a U.S. plan for West Bank redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid urged Arab Americans to work to counteract the
pressure of Zionist lobby on the U.S. administration in support of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time Arabs seek the support of some 3 million
Americans of Arab origin who have a say in the U.S. political
system in order to counter balance Zionist pressure groups," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meetings are attended by Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Shara and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, as well as
other foreign ministers and senior diplomats from the 22 AL member
states.

HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong government will
seek to stimulate the economy and spend prudently when formulating
policies at a time when the economy is slowing down, Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with chairmen of the Provisional Urban and
Regional Councils and the Provisional District Boards, Tung said
that the government will join hands with members of the public to
tide over this difficult period.
</P>
<P>
Tung said, Hong Kong's economic base is narrow and its economy
has undergone drastic changes as a result of the Asian financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"To stimulate the economy, we will look into ways to expand our
economic base and the types of value added economic activities. It
is obvious that labor intensive industries are no longer our
advantage," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a preliminary report by the Chief Executive's
Commission on Innovation and Technology will be ready this month,
Tung hoped that there would be some indications on the direction
for industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Tung and the chairmen also exchanged views on issues such as
the review on district organizations as well as medical services.
</P>
<P>
Tung had talked with a number of political parties in groups in
the previous two days to seek their views on future policy
directions as his second Policy Address is due to be delivered
early October.

<HEADLINE> Funcinpec Agrees to Attend Cambodian Assembly Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's
deposed First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said
Wednesday that his Funcinpec party would participate the first
National Assembly session chaired by King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks with Sihanouk on Wednesday in the northern
town of Siem Reap, Prince Ranariddh said, "We discussed the way to
avoid bloodshed and to resolve the current political crisis, but
we did not touch upon the formation of the new government.
</P>
<P>
"Funcinpec party has agreed to participate in the new National
Assembly's first session which is scheduled on September 24 and
will be presided over by the King in Siem Reap."
</P>
<P>
The Prince also hoped to meet Chea Sim, President of the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP), as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was plunged into a political crisis on July 26 when
the CPP won a majority of parliamentary seats in the general
election, but failed to get the two-thirds majority needed to form
a government alone.
</P>
<P>
The CPP's major rivals, Funcinpec and the Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP) led by former dissident Sam Rainsy, have rejected the result
of the poll which was judged free and fair by international
observers, and accused the CPP of rigging the elections.
</P>
<P>
They also turned down offers of forming a coalition and
threatened not to participate the first session of the new
national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks of demonstrations in Phnom Penh resulted in violent
clashes involving the police, supporters of Funcinpec, the SRP and
the CPP, which left several dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said that the continuation of the demonstrations
would depend on the outcome of the three-party summit although
Funcinpec had decided to call off the protests in order to pave
the way for the talks expected to take place this weekend.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Sam Rainsy would meet Sihanouk in Siem
Reap on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bee-keeping Business Starts in Somali's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The business of
bee-keeping is becoming popular and attractive to a growing
number of Somalis for the first time in Mogadishu, the country's
capital.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 families have now launched a campaign for
installing their new bee cages in Mogadishu in the past ten days
alone, said Ibrahim Farah Hussein, a bee-keeping expert.
</P>
<P>
According to a group led by Ali Shinnileh, a bee expert and a
campaigner for the bee-keeping business, hundreds of local
families are now installing their boxes. "In the next two months,
more than 1,000 families will be having their own honey producing
creatures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even though the pure honey is very much sought and expensive
in Mogadishu for its good taste and its use as medicine, the bee
has been very much detested by the Somalis for its mal-behavior
when it gets mad and itches the people. Most of the Somali
families especially those in Mogadishu do not believe up to the
moment that the bee can be tamed and kept around the houses and
farms for yielding honey industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Shinnileh, his team goes along the streets every
morning in search for the bee families under the trees and roofs.
And whenever a bee family or families are found, the experts try
to persuade the owners of the area to start the habit of
bee-keeping.
</P>
<P>
"We also bring new families of the bee from the countryside to
those who wish and this is how our business and clients increase
by the day," he said.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former deputy
prime minister and finance minister Anwar Ibrahim's private
secretary Mohamad Azmin Ali was detained by the police Wednesday
to help in the investigations into allegations contained in the
book "Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister",
police said.
</P>
<P>
Azmin, accompanied by two lawyers, was detained after he went
to Federal Police Headquarters here to give his statement relating
to the case.
</P>
<P>
Azmin would be remanded for a week under the Penal Code, senior
police officer Yaacob Md Amin was quoted by the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It's a normal procedure for us to call someone and then detain
him if we think necessary to help us in our investigations," the
officer said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, in connection with the same case, the
police already detained two persons -- Munawir Anees, a Pakistani
said to be good friend of Anwar, and Mohamad Ahmad, a private
secretary to Anwar at the Finance Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Newspaper Tous Banned Again in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian moderate evening
newspaper Tous once again was banned from publication as of
Wednesday after Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
lashed out at some print media for abusing freedom.
</P>
<P>
The conservative evening paper Kayhan reported on Wednesday
that a judicial official announced the ban order on Tuesday to
Tous' license holder and editorial director Mohammad Sadeq Javadi
Hesar.
</P>
<P>
Hesar was ordered to stop publication of Tous, which was named
after a famous ancient Iranian city, until further notice, Kayhan
said.
</P>
<P>
The judicial official said that the paper was banned for
publication of articles against national interests and security.
</P>
<P>
The ban came after Khamenei on Tuesday called on cultural and
judicial bodies to deal with "the group of the press which are
abusing the freedoms."
</P>
<P>
"I keep waiting to see what the responsible bodies will do"
with the group of the press which started targeting the people's
faith, he told a group of commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC).
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance, judicial and security bodies should identify those who
have targeted the people's faith and have desecrated the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
"I am making it clear for the officials that they should take
measures and find out which paper is going beyond the boundaries
of freedom," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tous appeared on newsstands only on July 25 to replace the
banned moderate daily Jameah (Society) and was welcomed by the
public, particularly the Iranian youth for its support for the
policies of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
It was banned for the first time on August 1 following strong
protest from the hard-liners and conservatives against its
pro-democracy articles.
</P>
<P>
But the ban was lifted one day after it was announced as
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance called on the
conservative judiciary to revoke the ban order.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Says Gov't Need Not to Buy Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada brushed aside here Wednesday calls for the government to
buy stocks to boost public confidence in the Philippine economy.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said there is no need to buy stocks as proposed by the
Philippine Stock Exchange as the stock market has been recovering
for the last three days.
</P>
<P>
"No, No. The government should not intervene in the exercise of
private business," the president said when asked about whether the
government will follow the proposal of the Philippine Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Philippine Stock Exchange head Jose Yulo urged
the government to buy stocks to revive confidence in the domestic
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's investment into the stock market need
not involve a high amount, and will merely serve as a token show
of the government's faith in the performance of Philippine
companies.
</P>
<P>
The composite index of the Philippine Stock Exchange fell to a
seven-year low of 1,082.18 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the very beginning of the Asian financial crisis, the
index has fallen by more than 50 percent.

JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- As U.S. Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross is winding up his mission in the region with no
imminent breakthrough in sight, Israel and the Palestinians are
drawing different conclusions over his mediating efforts.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat has described Ross' visit as a
failure, saying it had not yielded any result.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Arafat as telling an Egyptian newspaper that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had attempted to
destroy the peace process by procrastinating and dodging issues
concerning the overdue Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross is on a short trip to Amman Wednesday to brief Jordanian
Crown Prince Hassan on his week-long efforts to bridge the gaps
between Israel and the Palestinians over the Israeli
redeployment. He has traveled to Egypt for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are playing important mediating roles in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an intensive effort which began last Wednesday, Ross has
held rounds of talks with Arafat and Netanyahu, as well as other
officials from both sides, but he has reportedly failed to help
them resolve their disputes on a series of issues, even those
secondary matters such as the safe passage between Gaza and the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin indicated Tuesday
that Ross will likely return to Washington empty-handed at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Palestinian newspapers as accusing Ross of
his "Zionist" and "racist" positions in the mediation, saying he
had acted against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the Prime Minister's Office expressed its regret
over Palestinians' "anti-Semitism" attitudes. Netanyahu's media
adviser David Bar-Illan praised Ross as a "fair mediator," saying
he had considered the positions of both sides.
</P>
<P>
As Ross is expected to hold his last rounds of talks with
Netanyahu and Arafat after returning from Amman later Wednesday,
Netanyahu convened his inner cabinet Wednesday to discuss the
current Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The details of the session were not disclosed, but Israel
Radio said Netanyahu is not scheduled to meet either
U.S. President Bill Clinton or Arafat next week when he is in New
York to attend the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Many have expected that Netanyahu and Arafat will hold a
summit, probably together with Clinton, during that time and
finalize an agreement over the second Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Credit Risk Rating Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's chances of
obtaining foreign loans decreased after international rating
agency Moody's decided to increase its credit risk rating,
according to reports here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moody's announced earlier this week that it is downgrading the
rating of Romania's debt in hard currency from Ba3 to B1, and the
rating of bank deposits in hard currency from B1 to B2.
Consequently the rating of Eurobonds issued by the Romanian
government and the National Bank was lowered from Ba3 to B1.
</P>
<P>
Because of the downgradings, Romania's credit risk rating
increased. As a result, interest rates in Romania increased, which
lowered Romania's chances of obtaining foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from Moody's, Romania proved to be
slower in carrying out market reforms than other countries in
transition, which has affected its potential in economic growth in
the medium term.
</P>
<P>
The private sector only manufactures 12 percent of its
industrial output and 50 percent of exports, while the large
inefficient state-owned enterprises monopolizes most of the
economic production. That situation has lead to a poor micro- and
macro-economic situation and undermined the country's capacity for
acquiring hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Moody's estimated that in 1998 the deficit of Romania's current
account will range from 2.5 billion to 2.9 billion U.S. dollars
(six to seven percent of its gross domestic product), given that
foreign direct and portfolio investments will be considerably
smaller than those in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Considering that direct foreign investment was less than 500
million dollars in the first half of this year, and the net
portfolio investment was insignificant, Moody's said the only
financial resources left for Romania in 1999 were the
privatization of important companies with the participation of
foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeeper Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations peacekeeper
working in south Lebanon was wounded by Israeli shelling
Wednesday morning, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The soldier, from Norwegian battalion within the U.N. Interim
Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL), was wounded when Israeli shells fired
in the direction of a Norwegian patrol near the village of Blat
on the edge of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL spokesman Timor Goksel said that they have
protested to the Israeli army and received an apology.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, an Israeli army statement has confirmed the
attack, saying they would launch an investigation into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Since UNIFIL troops were first established in 1978 after
Israeli first invasion of Lebanon, a total of 222 peacekeepers
have been killed in separate incidents or military conflicts
between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong U.N. forces, which were designed to help
restore Lebanese government's authority over southern part of
the country, comprises troops from Finland, France, Nepal,
Norway, Fiji, Ghana, Ireland, Italy and Poland.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, conflicts between Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas have never stopped and U.N. troops frequently were
mistakenly attacked.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Long-Term Plan Needed to Tackle Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Residents here feel relieved at
last as flooding waters are receding in the capital city
remarkably, with more ground appearing above water and traffic
partially returning normal.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, 17 flood-hit districts in Bangladesh had become
flood-free, and the overall situation in the remaining of the 52
affected districts were improving gradually, according to
officials of the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The situation remained static in no district...while water
continued to recede rapidly from upstream down to the southern
downstream," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of Dhaka and three-fourths of the country
were under water at a certain moment during the
over-two-month-long flood which started hitting the country in
early July, directly and indirectly affecting about half of the
country's 127 million people, with nearly 30 million of them being
hit seriously.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged flood has claimed 755 lives, damaged more than
1.39 million acres (562,950 hectares) of crops, 867,632 houses,
15,896 kilometers of roads, 4,343 kilometers of embankments, 6,095
bridges and culverts, and 1,669 educational institutions. And
nearly 200 people have died of water-borne diseases such as
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates show that the loss caused by the flood,
which experts described as "the biggest in a century," may be as
high as 3.4 billion U.S. dollars, about 10 percent of the
country's gross domestic products (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The heavy loss of both lives and properties might have been
avoided or at least reduced if the government had taken necessary
precautionary measures and there had been more flood control
facilities in the country, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
An effective flood-forecasting system should be set up capable
of telling whether there is any possibility of a flood and its
possible duration, instead of merely warning people of a flood
when it comes, and so the government could take precautionary
measures accordingly, they said.
</P>
<P>
If the government had been prompt in realizing the possible
long duration and severity of this year's flood, in which the
flood forecasting system could play a significant role, the losses
could have been minimized, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
As a common phenomenon in Bangladesh, flood occurs in the
country almost every year due to the country's particular
geographical location and its climatic features.
</P>
<P>
The location of the major parts of the country at the lowermost
reaches of the three mighty river systems - the Ganges, the
Brahmaputra-Jamuna and the Meghna, and heavy monsoon rainfall
coinciding with flood waters from the upstreams of rivers and
surges in the Bay of Bengal, make floods an annual phenomenon in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
To reduce flood-caused losses, they said, the government should
make long-term plans to deal with possible flooding in the future
instead of merely distributing relief materials during and after
the flood.
</P>
<P>
The country's major flood facilities are the about 500
embankments along major rivers, dikes and a 250-meter-long barrage
in northeastern Bangladesh, according to Water Resources Minister
Abdur Razzaq.
</P>
<P>
But for the Dhaka Protection Embankment and the
Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra Embankment, the country's capital city
would have been totally inundated this year.
</P>
<P>
These projects, which were mainly built after the 1987-88 flood
and are badly in need of renovation, are insufficient for
protecting the country from flood, the experts said. They
suggested the construction of upstream storage dams, more
embankments and reservoirs in plains for shallow storage, and
channel improvement by dredging rivers.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed measures such as flood preparedness and
community-based flood preparedness activities like evacuation,
sheltering, flood fighting, stock-piling of food and medical
supplies.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua recently, the water resources
minister blamed heavy rains, rising sea levels in the Bay of
Bengal, the effect of the La Nina weather phenomenon, the
reduction of flood plain because of unplanned construction of
roads, bridges, culverts and homesteads, and the rise of riverbeds
due to siltation for the prolonged flood this year.
</P>
<P>
It's a good thing that the government knows what has caused the
flood, but what is more important is that the government knows how
to avoid flood-related losses and take concrete measures to tackle
the issue of flood, the experts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To this end, they said, the ruling and the opposition parties
should join hands to address the flood issue for the interest of
the people, instead of trying to gain benefit for their respective
parties only.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Finishes Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) --The Australian dollar closed
stronger Wednesday, despite coming off a high of 59.75 U.S. cents
during local trading Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Senior foreign exchange dealer at Colonial State Bank, Nick
Volanakis, said an improvement in commodities overnight helped the
local currency gain strength.
</P>
<P>
"Commodities were up quite a lot overnight, gold is the only
disappointment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended here at 59.61 U.S. cents from 59.49
at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said the currency market would continue to be
influenced by U.S. politics, particularly the situation of its
beleaguered president.
</P>
<P>
"Bill Clinton opened up a can of worms on Friday night over the
possibility of stimulating the world economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people understood that the U.S. will lower interest
rates, if not, a few other countries will."
</P>
<P>
The address by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
Thursday morning will be watched closely to see if the chairman
agrees with the comments made by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Greenspan is greatly respected and I think anything he says
will have a major impact on the market in the next 24 hours," he
said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 14 days the Australian dollar hit the 80
Japanese yen level, trading at 80.05 from 79.24 Tuesday. It was
also buying 1.0091 German marks from 1.0090.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Lower in a Subdued Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) --The Australian sharemarket
lost its momentum Wednesday, closing slightly lower because of
some profit taking and nervousness about overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
After two days of rises, the benchmark all ordinaries index

</P>
<P>
Client adviser Brett O'Donovan said the slow day on the local
bourse could signal the start of uncertainty ahead of the upcoming

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Correcting A Few Judicial Workers' Law-Violating Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese legislator Li
Peng today enumerated a few law-violating activities by judicial
workers in some places and called for prompt actions be taken to
put an end to judicial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
"The violation of regulations in the profession and neglect of
work ethics by some officials in judicial departments are so
serious that it has undermined judicial work and posed a threat to
social stability," warned Li, chairman of the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, at the fifth meeting of the NPC
interior judicial committee that closed here today.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to waste any time addressing the problem,"
said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
During the past three days, law-makers heard reports by Xiao
Yang, president of the Superem People's Court, and Han Zhubin,
procurator-general of the Superem People's procuratorate, on
rectification work in judicial departments.
</P>
<P>
Judicial corruption, which draws sharp criticism from deputies
at the annual sessions of the National People's Congress over
recent years, has become one of the relevant heated topics by the
general public, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the efforts by judicial departments across China
to set standards for the behavior of their staff, and nevertheless
noted that their achievements should not be overestimated.
</P>
<P>
"With the absence of a full-fledged legal framework at work and
the influence of unhealthy practices from inside and outside the
Party, judicial corruption cannot be expected to stamped out at
one stroke or overnight," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that fighting against judicial corruption is a
long-term task, he said that courts and procurator's offices at
all levels should, in line with specific local conditions,
conscientiously sum up experiences and come to recognize the
importance and protractedness of the work, so that they will pool
efforts to do a good job in education and rectification.
</P>
<P>
While going in for education and straightening things out, the
judicial departments should do their work well, and improve it in
the course of conducting reforms, and build up and strengthen
their ranks and further improve their work system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from system building and ideological education, he noted,
the question of prime importance is to safeguard judicial fairness
and to guarantee that preliminary trials be open to the public and
the people's jury system be instituted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, special efforts should be enhanced to stop the
practice of prolonged detention and stalling handling of cases, Li
said. He also urged the people's congresses at all levels to
increase their supervision over judicial work as a means to
further promote judicial fairness.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Repay 24 Billion Dollars Before Next July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea must repay 24
billion U.S. dollars of external debt between October and next
July, the Ministry of Finance and Economy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The long-term debts, which will expire before next July, amount
to 18.7 billion dollars while five billion dollars in short-term
loans with interest must be paid back.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said South Korea, whose foreign exchange reserves
stand at about 42 billion dollars, would have enough foreign
currency boosted by current account surpluses and capital inflows
to repay the debts.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts expressed concern over the issue, saying the
country might be mired in another debt crisis next year.
</P>
<P>
They said the International Monetary Fund (IMF), faced with
mounting liquidity problems amid the global spread of financial
crises, will urge South Korea to repay its long-term public debt.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the IMF have yet to negotiate the renewal of
debt maturities. South Korea borrowed 58 billion dollars in an IMF
rescue package last December after it was gripped by a financial
crisis triggered by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, financial institutions might run into trouble in
persuading foreign banks to roll over seven billion dollars of
short-term debt if fresh turmoil engulfs the nation.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that South Korea was forced to the brink of
declaring a debt moratorium last November in the wake of foreign
lenders' refusal to roll over debts, such possibilities could not
be ruled out, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to the fire is the prediction that the global
economic downturn will cause South Korea to reap a much smaller
current account surplus next year while the outlook for massive
capital inflows is not that bright, taking into account the fact
that Western capital still shows no signs of returning to emerging
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Samsung Economic Research Institute said South
Korea had to increase its usable foreign currency reserves to 78
billion dollars by September in 1999 to fight another possible
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> World Forum on Capital Market Opens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae called for rising harmony of regional capital and
financial markets at the opening ceremony of a top-level
conference on world capital market here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As (regional and global) integration proceeds, the need for
harmonization of fiscal and monetary policy becomes important,"
he said at the 23rd annual conference of the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).
</P>
<P>
"Globalization of the capital and financial markets makes it
imperative for every country to pay attention to the developments
in other parts of the world," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said tjat among the most challenging tasks of capital and
financial market regulators is to create financial harmony in the
emerging economic and monetary unions, especially at the regional
level.
</P>
<P>
"The transition from national to regional monetary and capital
authorities require a high degree of cooperation and
collaboration to harmonize money and capital markets within the
region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the global financial system has changed
rapidly in 1990s, ushering in new opportunities as well as
challenges in market development and regulation.
</P>
<P>
This will offer a new climate of hope for the emerging
economies of the world, which have enormous investment
opportunities but lack the financial resources to exploit such
opportunities, he added.
</P>
<P>
"To access external capital, it is necessary that our
financial systems must be transparent, efficient and well
managed," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 regulators of capital markets from over 60
countries attended the four-day conference.
</P>
<P>
The IOSCO meeting, the first ever held in Africa, is focused
on the deliberations of the Principles of Securities Regulations,
a landmark document that sets out the objectives of securities
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Other topics to be covered will include cross-border
investment flows and the stability and development of markets,
international cooperation in the investigation and enforcement of
securities laws.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and the U.N. Industrial Development Organization will also attend
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
IOSCO, set up 23 years ago, is a Montreal-based world body
composed of 134 member regulatory agencies. It meets annually to
discuss issues over world securities and futures markets.

<HEADLINE> HK Youth Should Know More of Motherland, Says Foundation Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The youngsters of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) should take more visits
to China's mainland to know more of the Chinese history and
culture and become a new generation to serve the community, the
head of a local nongovernmental organization said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tours and visits to the mainland would help Hong Kong youth to
understand the present conditions of their motherland as well as
to learn about the origin, history, fine heritage and culture of
the Chinese people," said Annie Wu, Chairman of the Executive
Committee of the Chinese History and Culture Educational
Foundation for Youth, at a press conference here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The youngsters would then develop a sense of identity with the
motherland, to grow into a new generation that loves China and
Hong Kong and is committed to building a better place to live and
serving the community, she said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation organized two cultural exchange and study tours
to Beijing and Xinjiang in July and August this year, which
involved hundreds of young Hong Kong students. Members of the
Foundation delegation met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin
during the Beijing visit, which Wu described as historically
significant for the organization.
</P>
<P>
It was announced at the press conference that Chinese pianist
Xiang-Dong Kong, who now lives in the United States, had been
invited to be the Foundation's Overseas Culture Ambassador, who
will hold a charity concert later this month in Los Angeles to
raise fund for the Foundation as well as China's flood children
victims so that they could go back to schools.
</P>
<P>
And famous Hong Kong-based female painter Yvonne Tang will
organize an exhibition for her latest paintings, with the
proceeded to be donated to the Foundation.
</P>
<P>
And as part of the future activities, the Foundation is now
organizing another study tour to Shanghai later this month, during
which Hong Kong students would celebrate the National Day with
their Shanghai counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit making Foundation was founded in February this
year, with SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa as Honorary Patron
and Jiang Enzhu, director of the Xinhua News Agency (Hong Kong
Branch) as Honorary Advisor. The organization accepts donations
from overseas compatriots as well as organizations and individuals
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Funds of the Foundation are
solely used for organizing History and Cultural Educational Groups
for Youth, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Public's view of U.S. President Bill Clinton's moral
character has sunk to the lowest level of his Presidency, but most
Americans still believe he is a vigorous leader who should not be
impeached or forced to resign, a New York Times/CBS News Poll
shows. Americans also dislike Kenneth W. Starr and suspect his
motives.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton met with the nation's senior generals
and admirals and received warnings that the armed forces were
being stretched thin by increasing duties and decreasing budgets.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Undaunted by White House objections, the House Judiciary
Committee Tuesday prepared to release the videotape of President
Clinton's August 17 grand jury testimony as Republican leaders
rebuffed suggestions that Congress forgo an impeachment inquiry in
favor of a resolution censuring the president.
</P>
<P>
-- The physical complaints known as "Gulf War syndrome" are not
only common among Gulf War veterans, they'er also frequently
reported by soldiers who never went to Iraq, Kuwait or Saudi
Arabia, according to new research.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. intervention in Kosovo is being weighed because of
fears of a humanitarian disaster among refugees this winter. In
the war-torn Serbia province, refugees poured into the last area
held by ethnic Albanian rebels as Serbs continued attacks on the
Albanian border.

<HEADLINE> HK Well-Placed to Provide Chinese Support for Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, as a bilingual
city, is well-placed to provide Chinese language support for the
development of applications and content on the Internet, a senior
Hong Kong government official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There is a growing demand for content in Chinese on the
Internet in Asia in particular as the use of the Internet spreads
around the globe, said K C Kwong, secretary for information
technology and broadcasting of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 9th Asian Information
Technology Exhibition (IT Expo '98), Kwong said that with the
ever- increasing number of users all over the world, the Internet
has become an important channel for communication, information
sharing, on-line government services and electronic business.
</P>
<P>
But communication on the Internet is still based largely on the
English language, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is only to be expected given the history of development of
the Internet, Kwong said. However, the scene is changing rapidly
as the use of the Internet becomes popular around the world, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kwong pointed out that the HKSAR government fully recognizes
this and has taken measures to promote the use of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Within the government, we have adopted a common
Chinese character set to facilitate data exchange between
government departments and the public."
</P>
<P>
"And, nearly all of our Web sites now support both Chinese and
English languages. Our current plan to deliver public services
electronically, through the Internet and other communication
channels, will also be enabled for communication in Chinese," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We are also working closely with other governments and
institutions under the aegis of the International Standards
Organization in the development of the ISO 10646 standard, which
is an international coding standard aimed at encompassing
characters of Asian languages into one single common character
set," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Kwong noted that harmonization of internal codes for Chinese
characters is not enough. There are equally important issues that
demand immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
The first is the provision of more sophisticated and
user-friendly conversion tools capable of supporting the use of
traditional and simplified Chinese characters, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
The second is the development of an efficient and effective
mechanism for searching and retrieving information in either
traditional or simplified Chinese characters on the Internet and
the most important is the provision of content in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
All this requires close collaboration between government, the
information technology and services industry and academia, Kwong
said.

<HEADLINE> Security Official on Taiwan Residents' Entry to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong security
official said here Wednesday that the policy of requiring Taiwan
residents to apply for an entry permit before entering Hong Kong
has not changed after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The application procedures for Taiwan Visit Permit (TVP) have
remain the same, Regina Ip, secretary for Security, said in a
written reply to a Legislative Council member's question on
whether there are changes in the policies and procedures for
issuing entry visas to residents of Taiwan after Hong Kong's
return to China.
</P>
<P>
She said TVP applicants have to submit their applications to
the Immigration Department through the authorized offices of
altogether 21 airlines in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Applications for renewal of TVPs may however be submitted to
the Immigration Department in person, through their authorized
persons in Hong Kong, or through the authorized airline offices in
Taiwan, she said.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's application for joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Ip said the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has long supported Chinese
Taipei's application for WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the General Council of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) reached an understanding in 1992 that
China's accession to GATT should precede that of Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has all along abided by this understanding,
she added.

<HEADLINE> China Charity Springs up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China's reforms towards the
socialist market economy have triggered a fast growth of charity,
an official with the China Charity Federation (CCF) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
A recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs show that
there are 117 million senior citizens in China above the age of
60, nearly nine million of them living with no proper care.
</P>
<P>
There are also 200,000 orphans, and more than 50 million
disabled, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for the Chinese government to take care of all
of them," the official said, adding that charity organizations
have much to do.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1994, the CCF is the first of the kind in the
non-governmental sector to help people in need. It has so far had
79 member associations. China has now a total of 42,385 charity
organizations and welfare houses.
</P>
<P>
To date, the CCF has helped 2,000 children get rid of harelips
free of charge and drilled 15,000 wells for poor people living in
northwestern China's Gansu Province. It has also offered many
essential equipment to over 30 elderly welfare homes.
</P>
<P>
The CCF donated over 12 million yuan (about 1.4 million U.S.
dollars) to Zhangbei county in north China's Hebei Province, which
was hit by a disastrous earthquake early this year.
</P>
<P>
The CCF also donated nearly 500 million yuan (about 60 million
U.S. dollars) to the flood-stricken areas throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The recent charity performance jointly held by the CCF and
China Central Television Station (CCTV) has collected over 600
million yuan (about 72 million U.S. dollars) for the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
This year's ravaging summer flooding killed 3,004 people,
displaced some 223 million people across the nation, and caused an
economic loss of 166.6 billion yuan (about 20.8 billion
U.S. dollars), according to a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The CCF has also launched an auction website on the Internet
together with the Beijing Municipal Telegraph Bureau and Wisdom
Science and Technology Enterprise, raising money for a disaster
fighters fund.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Myanmar Government Calls for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 16 (Xinhua)-- The Myanmar government
Wednesday urged all the political parties in the country including
the National League for Democracy (NLD) to cooperate in
establishing social and economic foundation for a stable
democracy, according to an official information sheet issued
here.
</P>
<P>
"The government views with grave concern the expressed
intention of the NLD to convene a People's Parliament before the
country has had time to complete a National Constitution which
will ensure political stability," it said, adding that without a
constitution, the Parliament would be unable to govern
effectively, but will lead to institutional confusion, social
chaos and genuine political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government warned that "if political crisis leads to that
in national security, then Myanmar's very existence is in danger
of splitting into a number of Mini-states."
</P>
<P>
Concerning the detention of some NLD members recently, the
government has no wish to "house" them for any longer than
necessary, and will free them soon if the NLD leaders cooperate,
the information sheet said.
</P>
<P>
According to the NLD, the numbers of its members detained since
May 27 has gone up to 802, including 195 parliament
representatives elected in the 1990 election, and 607 other party
organizers.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 60 parliament representatives-elect and 302 party
organizers have so far been detained after the NLD declared its
intention to convene a parliament itself in September when the
party received no response from the government on the expiry of a
dead line set on August 21 for holding a parliament elected in the
election.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 general election, participated by 93 political
parties, the NLD won 396 out of 485 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NLD warned in a latest statement issued on
Wednesday that the present political, economic and social crisis
could not be settled if the government goes on preventing the
representatives-elect from convening a parliament by detaining
them.
</P>
<P>
The NLD also announced in the statement that it has formed a
10-member Representing Committee of the parliament
representatives-elect in the 1990 General Election with NLD
Chairman U Aung Shwe as Chairman.

<HEADLINE> India Not to Sign CTBT in Present Form: Vajpayee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee said Wednesday that India is not prepared to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in its present form.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu in southern
India, he said that he understands that the treaty itself could
not be amended, yet the government is seeking a different
arrangement, especially with regard to transfer of high technology
and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said that India was negotiating with key nations on the CTBT
issue to create conditions for signing it.
</P>
<P>
Since June 11 this year, the United States and India have held
four rounds of talks on the CTBT and other concerned issues.
Further talks between the two sides are expected to be held later
this month in New York when Vajpayee goes there next week to
address the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The successive nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in May this
year have caused great concern across the world as they have
aggravated the tense situation in South Asia, especially between
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The international community has time and again called upon the
two nations to stop their nuclear development programs and start a
peaceful dialogue to solve their disputes. The United States and
other western countries have imposed economic sanctions against
both the countries and urged them to sign the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that there is no necessity for further nuclear
tests, as the required data have already been collected and
nothing more is needed. That is why India's attitude has changed
and India has declared a self moratorium, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks More Kuwaiti Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President
Omari Ali Juma Wednesday called on Kuwait to increase investment in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Juma, who is on a three-day official visit here, made the call
at a press conference held at the Kuwaiti Bayan Palace.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is abundant in natural resources, but
"unfortunately we have no capital and know-how to develop those
resources."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Juma said, Tanzania is indeed an ideal
investment area in view of its peaceful and stable political
situation, and geographic advantages.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's long borderlines have made convenient land
transportation with its neighboring countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which has financed 10 projects in Tanzania so far with
an investment of 155 million U.S. dollars, have increased its
investments in Tanzania in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Juma reiterated his country's support for Kuwait's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, calling on Iraq, which had
a short-lived occupation of Kuwait in 1990, to abide by all
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Juma also stressed the need to extend and
consolidate a comprehensive bilateral relationship, saying "we
have proposed that we should give our friendship a new approach."
</P>
<P>
Ties between Tanzania and Kuwait have warmed up since 1992 with
the increase of visit exchanges by senior officials between the
two countries.

CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Ministry of Planning predicted that the
unemployment rate in 1998 will fall to 7.9 percent from 8.3
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Tuesday that the estimate
includes a rise of labour force to some 18.3 million this year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the ministry attributed the lower unemployment
rate to government's employment policy, which was designed to
promote vocational and administrative training and continued
studies of the labour market abroad to seek new job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- World financial and banking experts will meet in
Cairo October 4 to discuss ways to improve the efficiency of
banking sector in the Middle East, the Arabic Al Hayat reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on formulation of financial systems for development
in the Middle East and North Africa, organized by the World Bank
(WB), coincides with the joint annual meeting of the WB and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is planned in the backdrop of the crippling
financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The average monthly expenditures per Palestinian
family are 742 U.S. dollars, with 792 dollars in the West Bank and
628 dollars in the Gaza Strip, report from the Palestinian Central
Administration of Statistics has showed.
</P>
<P>
The agency, surveyed 3,600 Palestinian families, said the
relatively lower spending in Gaza resulted from Israel's closure
on the area and subsequent lower income.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The accuracy of the arrivals and departures of the
Royal Jordanian's (RJ) commercial flights increased by 4.3 percent
in the first eight months of this year as against the same period
last year.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Government Paralyzed as Turmoil Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho government
departments became paralyzed Wednesday as civil servants abandoned
their offices and went home for fear of increasing turmoils in the
capital of Maseru, sources reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition supporters in the country took to the
streets for the second successive day to protest the delay in
releasing an investigation report into alleged electoral fraud in
the southern African kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A joint investigation team formed by officials from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe reportedly completed last week a report on the
Lesotho elections in May. However, the South African government, which
chairs the team, declined to make the report public immediately.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition coalition spokesman Mamelo Morrison was quoted
as saying that employees in government departments and parastatals had
either closed shop or were in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
Junior officers of the Lesotho army, who forced army chief Makhula
Mosakheng to resign last week, have offered support to protesters,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday angry protesters also blocked entrances to
parliament. Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, cabinet ministers and
senior government officials were unable to gain entry to their offices
because of the blockade.
</P>
<P>
Protesters locked the parliamentary gates and left a message that
anybody who tampered with the lock would do so at their own risk,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the protesters said their intention was to make
the Mosisili government ungovernable as "it was in power illegally".
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lesotho opposition party supporters seized government
vehicles and blocked entrances to other government officers in town
and parastatals like the Lesotho Telecommunications Corporations.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Admits Drinking Water Annoyingly Dirty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 16 (Xinhua)-- The organizing committee of the
2000 Sydney Olympics (SOCOG) admitted on Wednesday that major
problems over contaminated drinking water was "both a surprise
and annoyance" in the run-up to the games.
</P>
<P>
But it is determined to handle the issue urgently after
presenting a progress report to the executive board of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) which is meeting here this
week.
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales (NSW) health department has warned
Sydney's three million residents three times in the last two
months to boil drinking water due to dangerous levels of
parasites.
</P>
<P>
Michael Knight, the NSW Olympic minister and SOCOG president,
said, "I said to the IOC very clearly 'yes there is a problem'.
The problem is both a surprise and annoyance, but it's a matter
which the government of New South Wales is committed to getting
fixed."
</P>
<P>
Knight said IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and his board
were "pretty confident" after listening to SOCOG.
</P>
<P>
IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge said the IOC did not
feel there was a need for contingency plans at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Knight said water contamination was one of just four questions
posed by the board, adding: "President Samaranch was very
complimentary in his remarks about our preparations."

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Defendants in a fraud case
involving casings for pork livers and sheep entrails were recently
sentenced to imprisonment in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Yueyang City Intermediate People's Court in Hunan sentenced
Zhou Zhenglong to life imprisonment and the deprivation of
political rights for life. The court also confiscated his personal
property valued at 60,000 yuan (about 7,500 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Eight other defendants received prison sentences ranging from
8-15 years, with periods for deprivation of political rights
ranging from 1-5 years. The court also confiscated their their
personal properties in amounts ranging from 20,000-50,000 yuan.

The defendants from the cities of Xiangyin and Xiangtan in
Hunan Province and unscrupulous business people from Hong Kong,
Macao, Taiwan regions and Malaysia conspired to defraud tens of
millions of yuan from Chinese export enterprises under the pretext
of exporting casings for pork livers and sheep entrails.
</P>
<P>
The group defrauded 38 Chinese enterprises in 16 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions between 1992 and 1966.
</P>
<P>
The 34 separate instances of fraud involved 48.77 million yuan
(5.86 million U.S. dollars), and burdened both the state and

<HEADLINE> India Vows to Keep Borrowings Within Budgeted Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha said Wednesday that his ministry and the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) are working out a common strategy to keep the
fiscal deficit within the targeted 5.6 percent of GDP in fiscal
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an economic editors conference here, he said, "We
will make sure that government does not borrow more than the
budgeted levels. The RBI's busy season credit policy to be
announced next month will contain measures to take care of this."
</P>
<P>
The Indian government's borrowing program is put at more than
790 billion rupees (18.72 billion U.S. dollars) in the 1998-99
budget against 560 billion rupees (14.55 billion dollars) in the
previous fiscal year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to higher inflation, Sinha said inflation would be
reined in over the next few months. He attributed the price rise
to increases in prices of agricultural commodities.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, in the past couple of months, prices of
daily necessities have risen sharply and the inflation rate has
been recorded at 8.78 percent, the highest in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the country's economic policy, Sinha said India
would not retreat into protectionism. India's integration with the
global economic process would continue as no country could afford
to remain in an island of isolation in the fast changing world
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said India would make a forceful plea for reforming the
international financial system at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank in Washington next
month to ensure that unscrupulous global operators did not trample
upon national interests of developing countries as those in East
Asia.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges to Encourage Investment in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry, Peter Mandelson, has assured South
Africa that Britain would continue to encourage further investment and
trade in the country despite its challenging crime problems.
</P>
<P>
"The record of Britain and British business suggests that the
current problems will not discourage further investment and trade,"
Mandelson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Britain was aware of the commitment by the South African government
and business community to eradicate crime, South African newspapers on
Wednesday quoted Mandelson as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain was South Africa's largest trading partner with
investments worth 10 billion Pounds at current prices, this was not
enough, Mandelson noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our partnership with South Africa is the bedrock of our trading
relationship with the rest of southern Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation deals aimed at encouraging South African and British
exports into Africa were signed Wednesday by South Africa's Credit
Guarantee, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, the Industrial
Development Corporation and Britain's credit guarantee department.
</P>
<P>
The British export credit guarantee department said, under the
agreements, it would provide export credit support for South African
goods and services up to 15 percent of a contract value.

<HEADLINE> Italy To Get Tougher On Doping Offences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy stepped up their campaign
against the doping offences as they plan to introduce a tough
sports anti-doping law by the end of the year, reports said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Offenders will face up to 10 years in jail under the proposal
which was put forward to the Senate with all-party support on
Tuesday by Dr. Francesco Carella, a member of the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for doping to be incorporated into
the Italian penal code, but only for those supplying or
administering banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
Athletes who commit doping offences will still be left up to
be disciplined by sports authorities.
</P>
<P>
Doctors, chemists and sports coaches breaking the law will
face up to five years in prison and up to 10 years if drugs are
administered to athletes under 18.
</P>
<P>
The law could go even further and cover popular restoratives
such as creatine, a widely-used and perfectly legal aminoacid
which improves muscle-performance.
</P>
<P>
The bill will also remove the authority for doping controls
from the national Olympic committee, whose test laboratory at
Acqua Acetosa near Rome has been exposed as a fiasco.
</P>
<P>
The new bill plans a national committee on drugs, with members
appointed by the deputy prime minister and including health minis
try representatives.
</P>
<P>
AS Roma football coach Zdenek Zeman stirred up a storm two
months ago by warning that Italian football risked becoming
drugs-infested.

<P>
They also said that smuggling, money laundering, tax fraud
and profiteering are often behind illegal foreign-exchange
activities.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal dealings in foreign exchange can seriously disturb
the economic and financial order and endanger national economic
security, and therefore must be harshly dealt with," a SAFE
official said.
</P>
<P>
The measures already taken to stamp out illegal
foreign-exchange trading activities include a general examination
of foreign-exchange settlements of enterprises, and revising
existing rules and regulations and increasing punishment for
violators, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the customs, banks and foreign-exchange
administration departments computers will soon be linked up to
ensure synchronical transmitting and checking of the inflow and
outflow of goods and foreign exchange, thereby eliminating
loopholes.
</P>
<P>
The majority of economists here agree that despite the impact
of the Asian financial crisis, and the devastating floods, the
Chinese economy is in good shape and is improving month by
month. They also said that China will be able to realize its goal
of an eight percent increase in gross domestic product for all of
1998.
</P>
<P>
All this indicates that the people are fully justified to remain
confident in the economy and the yuan, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China reported a trade surplus of
31.38 billion U.S. dollars in the first eight months of this year,
attracted 23.9 billion U.S. dollars in direct foreign investment
in the first seven months, and has current foreign-exchange
reserves valued at 140 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has a sound balance of international
payments and a reasonably sized and structured foreign debt.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Geologist Puts Forward New Flood Explanation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- An extreme increase in the
amount of vapor and heat escaping from the earth's crust is one
geological factor contributing to the floods that ravaged the
Yangtze River Valley this year, according to Beijing geochemist Du
Letian.
</P>
<P>
He set forth this new idea in an interview with Xinhua, saying
that the rain cloud mass from the Indian Ocean was not capable, by
itself, of causing this year's unusually heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
"The Yangtze River is a large gap where gases, with vapor and
heat, intermittently escape from the earth's crust with pressure
dozens or even hundreds of times stronger than the atmospheric
pressure. The escaped gases were extremely strong this year." Du
said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that vapor and heat emitted from
underground is the major reason the four hottest cities in China
are located along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, these gases prevented the rain cloud mass
from moving northward and significantly enlarged the cloud mass.
</P>
<P>
"So this year's rainfall greatly exceeded that in the past," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The geochemist noted that although he is not yet certain of the
geological effects on precipitation, underground meteorological
research is essential for natural disaster prevention and relief.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Sign CTBT Until Sanctions Lifted: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Wednesday that his country would not sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) until sanctions against it
are lifted and its legitimate concerns addressed to its
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks while winding up
discussions on the issue of the CTBT in a joint session of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition parties continued to boycott the house
proceedings on the second day. They complained that the government
had not taken them into its confidence while opening the debate on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The joint sitting of the parliament was convened for exclusive
debate on the CTBT to evolve consensus on the issue. The joint
sitting, however, could not table a resolution.
</P>
<P>
Aziz assured members of the parliament that their suggestions
would guide the government in its future negotiations on the CTBT
and national interest would come uppermost.
</P>
<P>
There would be no bargain on national interest, Aziz said,
adding that Pakistan is a nuclear power and this capability would
be protected at all costs.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of CTBT would not affect our nuclear capability
and no world power can deny this," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a demand for linking the solution to the Kashmir
issue with the signing of the CTBT, Aziz said that after
Pakistan's nuclear tests there is a greater realization in the
world community that a solution to the Kashmir issue is vital for
lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the government would intensify its efforts for the
solution of the Kashmir issue. He also said there was no
justification for economic and other sanctions against Pakistan
and demanded their lifting immediately.

<HEADLINE> Business Travel: Target for Cost Control in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Business travel is where
many Asian companies are considering to chop spending amid the
current economic woes and efficient management can help them
achieve the goal without cutting such trips, a travel service said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Travel and entertainment are the third largest expense for most
companies, after salaries and costs in information technology,
said Tim Johnson, who heads American Express Travel Services Group
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Asian companies spend about 100 billion U.S. dollars on travel
and entertainment a year, about one-quarter of the total by firms
worldwide, according to American Express, a global travel services
company.
</P>
<P>
Johnson told an economic forum here Wednesday, "After almost 30
years of fabulous growth, there is a compelling need for Asian
companies to cut operating costs."
</P>
<P>
Asian companies have started to tighten budgets by firing
workers or using updated technology in face of the current
economic trouble, but many of them ignore the fact that efficient
management of travel and related expenses can help cut operating
costs significantly, he said.
</P>
<P>
American Express estimates that corporations can save around 30
percent of their spending on travel and entertainment by
efficiently monitoring their expenses and creating a
cost-effective travel program.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China's War on Illegal Foreign-Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Surpluses on both capital and current accounts have
ensured an ample foreign-exchange supply in China and all major
indicators show that, theoretically and practically, China has a
sound economic foundation to keep the exchange rate of its yuan
stable," said Li Guobin, a senior economist at the State
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Along with most Chinese economists, many international
institutions and foreign government officials also are upbeat
about China's economy and ability to keep the yuan stable and the
economy growing at at a relatively high rate.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), for example,
praised China highly in its 1998 global economic report.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been a financial crisis in parts of Asia,
the Chinese financial market has been unaffected and has remained
stable, which indicates that the macroeconomic policies China has
adopted since 1993 have yielded actual effects, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that there is limited room for financial
speculation in China, as the country has huge foreign-exchange
reserves and capital inflow is mostly in the form of direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
An observer here who declined to be named said, "The IMF report
has sounded the alarm for those who intend to rake in fat profits
in China through illegal foreign-exchange dealings and
speculation."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Chinese yuan has remained strong
despite massive devaluations of the currencies of many countries
in the region beginning in July 1997. The yuan has been traded at
around 8.3 to the U.S. dollar for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
"The whole world has benefited greatly from China's effort to
keep the yuan's exchange rate stable," Robert Rubin,
U.S. treasury secretary said in the latest issue of Fortune, a
widely read financial magazine.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Joint Liaison Group Ends Meeting in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) ended its two-day meeting here Wednesday with
a joint communique issued.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the JLG will take place in Beijing this
year, at a time to be decided by the two sides, the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Senior Representative Wang Guisheng and his British
counterpart, Ambassador Alan Paul, jointly held a press conference
here after the JLG's 43rd meeting.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the JLG meeting was held under the
circumstances of the effective and successful practice of "one
country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
with a high degree of autonomy by the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the people of Hong Kong
with the strong backing of the Central People's Government and the
Chinese people as a whole over the past one year or more.
</P>
<P>
In a positive, friendly and practical manner, he said, the two
sides exchanged views on the situation in Hong Kong and some
remaining issues such as the issue of Vietnamese refugees and boat
 people and the issue concerning the continued application of the
Paris Convention on third party liability in the field of nuclear
energy.
</P>
<P>
Wang reaffirmed the central government's support for the SAR
government's efforts to maintain the linked exchange rate between
the Hong Kong dollar and the greenback and to stabilize the
financial market.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on roles of the JLG, Wang said that
before Hong Kong's return to China, the JLG had done a great deal
of effective work and played an important role in implementing the
 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and
promoting the smooth return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the JLG is not an organ of power, but an organ
for liaison. It will not participate or interfere in the daily
management of the SAR affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wang listed several reasons for the continued existence of the
JLG after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
First, the Joint Declaration stipulates that the JLG will
continue its work until January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Second, the JLG has only basically completed its historical
missions and the two sides still need to hold consultations and
exchange views on some remaining issues or new issues arising from
new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Vietnamese refugees and boat people, Wang
said the SAR government, along with the Central People's
Government, has made concerted efforts to bring this long-standing
problem to an end.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side noted and appreciated the efforts made by the
British side and hoped that the British side will undertake its
inescapable responsibility for the final solution of this matter,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that there are a total of more than 1,100 Vietnamese
refugees and boat people stranded in Hong Kong and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees' debt to the Hong Kong SAR amounts to
1.16 billion HK dollars (148.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that more efforts will be made by the
British side in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Paul described his discussions with the Chinese side as free
and wide-ranging. "At the meeting we took the opportunity to
review developments in the six months that have elapsed since our
last plenary meeting in March," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the British government's strong support for the
SAR government's commitment to the defense of the Hong Kong dollar
peg to the U.S. dollar and for the contribution it is making to
global currency stability.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Vietnamese boat people, Paul said the British
side remains ready to do what it can in support of the efforts of
the SAR and China's central government.

<HEADLINE> S. African Bond Market Hit by Foreign Exodus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The foreign exodus from
the South African bond market which started in May has so far led
to a net disinvestment of almost six billion Rand (963 million
U.S. Dollars) for the year, the latest bond exchange figures
show.
</P>
<P>
According to the Business Day report Wednesday, net foreign
sales of bonds have reached more than 22 billion Rand (3.53
billion U.S. Dollars) since May, more than wiping out all the net
foreign investment in the market this year.
</P>
<P>
On Monday alone, the report said, foreigners sold a sizable
one billion Rand (160 million Dollars) in bonds.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Africa saw a net investment of 14.8 billion
Rand (2.4 billion Dollars) in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
With the capital exodus continuing unabated, hopes of an ease
in interest rates in the near future were dashed. The flight
from local bond market is one of the main reasons behind the
sharp rises in the central bank's lending rate in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Chris Stals, said
the outflow of capital was causing a liquidity shortage in the
country's financial markets, which was why the bank had to hike
its lending rate to commercial banks to just under 22 percent
last month, the highest level in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The reserve bank's rate hike and the subsequent increases in
commercial banks' interest rates have raised fears that South
Africa would fall into recession at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the havoc wreaked by the foreign stampede
from the South African capital market highlighted the country's
dependence on "hot" capital inflows from abroad to finance
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But some economists said local and foreign sentiment could
improve, after the U.S. presidential crisis is resolved, and
after the G-7 industrialized nations take concrete action to
stave off a global financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> EAC Impartial in HK's Legislative Elections: Woo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The commission has always been acting and making its decisions
absolutely independently, and needless to say, no one has ever
influenced the commission in an improper way," Woo said at a press
conference while explaining a package of recommendations for
improvements in electoral arrangements in the future.
</P>
<P>
Sixty members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) were determined through the
elections held on May 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to the chief executive of the SAR
government last month, the EAC reviewed various aspects of
electoral arrangements and procedures, taking into consideration
feedback from candidates, returning officers, polling and counting
staff as well as complainants.
</P>
<P>
Procedures that have proved to work well will be retained in
future elections, Woo said. They include the counting arrangements
adopted on May 24, the allocation of an alternative polling
station for electors affected by inclement weather and the opening
of polling stations for public visit before the polling day, he
added.
</P>
<P>
A number of improvement measures have been recommended for a
wide range of areas such as voter registration, election-related
guidelines, the allocation of polling stations, the design of
ballot papers and introductory leaflets and polling and counting
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
In response to growing public concern over the protection of
privacy of personal data, consideration will be given as to
whether the identity card number of electors can be struck off
from the published registers or extracts of the registers given to
 candidates for electioneering.
</P>
<P>
Voter registration forms will be revised to ask electors to
indicate their language preference in communications. According to
the Basic Law, both Chinese and English are official languages in
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive review of the method of allocation of polling
stations will be conducted for the sake of convenience to
electors.
</P>
<P>
Given the large number of complaints about noise nuisance
generated from loudspeakers used for electioneering, the EAC will
consider stipulating in the guidelines a time restriction for
using loud hailers on top of requirements under the Noise Control
Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Training for voter registration staff and polling and hotline
staff to be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the experience gained from the Election
Committee election, the EAC will continue to study the viability
of computer linkage of electorate data with a view to simplifying
polling and counting arrangements in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo said the enthusiasm of a majority of the electors
to participate in the poll had made the election a matter of pride
or great meaning for Hong Kong citizens, especially in view of
the poor weather on polling day.
</P>
<P>
A record 1,489,705 electors cast their votes, resulting in an
unprecedented turnout rate of 53.29 percent. Other record-breaking
 events were: The largest number of electors ever -- 2.8 million
-- were registered and the largest number of 166 candidates were
validly nominated and a record 156 of them contested the election.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Woo said the annual voter registration exercise
would be launched in December. He urged Hong Kong permanent
residents, including young people who are about to turn 18, to
join the ranks of the 2.8 million electorate.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Upgrades Power Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
will spend at least 48.8 billion yuan over the next three years to
increase power output to meet the growing demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to bring installed capacity to 19.5 million
kilowatts by the year 2000 from the present 14.38 million
kilowatts, according to provincial power department sources.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Jiangsu has achieved an annual
economic growth of 15.5 percent, with a gross domestic product
reaching 669.5 billion yuan last year, ranking second in China,
next to south China Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The rapid expansion of the economy in Jiangsu, one major
economic powerhouse in the country, has put great pressure on the
power supply which has long been restricted by backward facilities
and the lack of variety in energy sources.
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, the province will use much of these
funds to build some large and medium-sized power plants equipped
with generating units of no less than 300,000 kilowatts each.
</P>
<P>
These will include a nuclear power station with two
one-million-kilowatt generating units in Lianyungang, and two
pumping regenerative stations, in Yixing and Liyang.
</P>
<P>
The province will transform many existing small power stations
into environment-friendly and modern facilities. It also plans to
establish or upgrade more than 400 transformer substations to
ensure a better power supply for both urban and rural residents.

for Development Supervision and State Administrative Reform
Hartarto told reporters before a cabinet meeting at the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
"It will soon contact the former president to inform him of the
investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie Tuesday ordered a special team to
directly examine Soeharto over his recent statement that he did
not have "a single cent" of savings overseas as widely alleged.
</P>
<P>
American magazine Forbes estimated in July that Soeharto, who
stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21, had a
fortune worth 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Soeharto swore that he did not have any deposits abroad in
a statement broadcast by his own daughter's television station
early this month.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib told reporters Wednesday that the probe is being
conducted in response to the people's demand and because Soeharto
and his children have opened the doors.
</P>
<P>
The probe will focus on allegations that the former president
has a great deal of money stashed here and abroad, the source of
his children's wealth, and the presidential instructions that
Soeharto issued special privileges to family members, relatives
and close friends.
</P>
<P>
"The team will investigate matters that are supported by data,"
Ghalib said, adding that it will work on the presumption of
innocence until proven guilty.
</P>
<P>
Questioning will start before the end of this week, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Muladi said the probe on Soeharto
is the start of a legal action, meaning everything related to the
issue of hidden wealth will be identified and investigated.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will trace if the Soeharto family's
wealth came from corruption and collusion.
</P>
<P>
"The most important things is that (the probe) is open to the
people. It should be transparent," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls for Improved Relations With World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State,
General Abdulsalami Abubakar has appealed to the World Bank to
normalize relations with his country without further delay.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the call Tuesday in Nigerian capital Abuja while
receiving the bank's Vice-President for Africa, Jean-Louis
Sorbib.
</P>
<P>
He said it was imperative for Nigeria to work together with
the World Bank for the mutual advantage of both parties.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar stressed the need for donor countries to reconsider
the problem of debt burden of Nigeria, adding that there was a
real need to return to the Paris Club for a meaning discussion of
the issue of debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Noting that political stability is a necessary pre-requisite
for foreign participation in any national economy, he said the
window of investment opportunities would remain opened for the
mutual benefits of prospective investors in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar stressed that progress being made in the political
front must be accompanied by corresponding progress in the
economic realm.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, called on the international community to avail
themselves of the new investment opportunities in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Sarbib said it is important for the World
Bank to work in partnership with Nigeria for accelerated economic
development in the country, which he described as "the beacon of
hope for African Renaissance and new hope as the greatest
ingredient of investment."
</P>
<P>
Sarbib said the international business community is happy
under General Abubakar as the country is on the path of political
stability and economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM Offers to Mediate Between Iran, Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has offered to act as mediator in a bid to ease the
tension between Iran and the afghan Taliban militia, the
Associated Press of Pakistan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Iranian President Seyed Mohammad Khatami,
Sharif urged both Iran and Afghanistan to take steps to defuse the
current tension and show restraint and mutual understanding and
seek reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"This is fundamental to the region's peace and stability as
well as Islamic solidarity in the long run," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is ready to expedite this process in any way our
Iranian and Afghan brothers wish," he said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Taliban worsened last week after
the Taliban admitted that its forces killed nine Iranian nationals
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians were seized in a raid by the Taliban militia on
Iran's consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif, the stronghold of the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Sharif slammed the killing of the Iranians as a "catastrophe"
and said Islamabad has asked the Taliban militia to "arrest and
punish the culprits."

<HEADLINE> Ansett Suspends Shanghai Services, Plans Fiji Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian-New Zealand
airline Ansett announced Wednesday its decision to suspend its
Sydney-Shanghai services from October 22 this year and a plan to
add Fiji to its international network later this year.
</P>
<P>
Ansett attributed the suspension of the Sydney-Shanghai
services to the current excessive capacity of four carriers on the
route, including Australian flag carrier Qantas and Air China and
Shanghai-based Eastern Airline.
</P>
<P>
The present situation has meant that the airline can no longer
afford to operate the service without sustaining significant
losses over a period of time, the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ansett, which began flying the Sydney-Shanghai route on June 8,
1997, said it would continue to be represented in China through
its Shanghai office.
</P>
<P>
Craig Wallace, general manager of Ansett International, said
Ansett Australia, a division of Ansett Australia Limited, would
add Fiji to its international network from November 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
Wallace said it intends to operate services from Sydney to Nadi
of Fiji, a popular leisure destination, with a Boeing 757-200 on
Saturdays and an Airbus A320 on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
"Fiji has a distinct combination of leisure, business...
traffic on the route," Wallace said in the statement.

HARBIN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, an area
which suffered from some of the most severe devastation during the
summer flooding, has pledged to work diligently over remaining four
months of the year to achieve the annual economic growth target of
an 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that over 2,000 industrial firms
sustained flood damage totalling three billion yuan.

value-added.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to increase the production of
building materials, textiles, pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs in
order to increase the industrial output value by 2.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang also plans to carry out agricultural and water
control projects at cost a 14.8 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Telecom Firm to Adopt GSM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Telecel Zambia Limited
will soon be able to offer international call service on mobile
phones following its decision to adopt the Global System for
Mobile Communications (GSM), a national newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the new system would facilitate the use of the
mobile phones across national borders and cellular networks, the
Times of Zimbia quoted Telecel Managing Director Alain Girard as
saying at a press briefing in Lusaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to adopt the GSM follows a directive from the
Ministry of Transport and Communication, urging the
telecommunication company to begin offering the GSM services in
Zambia in line with a decision made by Southern African
Development Community (SADC) members last January.
</P>
<P>
The decision, Girard said, is a result of a
memorandum of understanding among SADC member states aimed at
improving communication in the region.
</P>
<P>
SADC member countries resolved in January 1998 to adopt the
GSM cellular phone standards in order to allow "roaming"
throughout the region, which was designed to promote easier
communication and trade within the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
Zambian subscribers who intend to adopt the new GSM system
which will be operational in about five months will have to
exchange their current Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
handsets with the GSM ones.
</P>
<P>
Zamcell, another telecommunication company which was granted
an investment license recently and is to begin its operations
next month, will also be using the GSM cellular phone system,
said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices shot up with
active buying on the Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as the
benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) climbed by 44.47 points to
close at 946.75.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the surge to rising hopes of international
action to lower interest rates and spur global growth.
</P>
<P>
They said the rise was sparked by a falling interest rates
environment and mounting speculation that Singapore's weight in
the Morgan Stanley Capital International Indexes will be
increased.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was 302.73 million units worth 351.8 million
Singapore dollars (about 203.94 million U.S. dollars). Advances
outnumbered declines by 210 to 55 with 322 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
KepLand was the most active stock of the day as it had 20.42
million stocks traded. It was followed by Wing T that had 17.8
million units done. SingTel was next with 11.92 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
DBS F was the top gainer of the day as it climbed 70 cents to
close at 6.05 Singapore dollars. SIA F moved up 70 cents as well
and finished at 8.8 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sem was up 50 cents
to end at 6.6 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser of the day
as it lost 30 cents to close at 17.7 Singapore dollars. Jurship
slid 20 cents to finish at 6.2 Singapore dollars and TLB Land shed
17 cents to end at 0.65 Singapore dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Qomolangma Reserve in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous region, or the so-called "Roof
of the World", provides a safe sanctuary for a number of
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Snow leopards, an endangered species which lives on the
highlands at altitudes ranging between 3,000-6,000 meters above
sea level, are frequently spotted in the state-class nature
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Other rare species include long-tailed leaf monkeys, wild
donkeys and Tar sheep, all of which were on the verge of
extinction prior to establishment of the reserve in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The regional government strictly prohibits hunting and logging
in the 330,000-sq.km. reserve.
</P>
<P>
"The reserve is a paradise for wild animals," said Cering
Truldan, deputy director of the Qomolangma Reserve Administration
Bureau, adding that staffers have effectively quelled excessive
hunting.
</P>
<P>
He said the increasing number of wild animals has also created
certain problems, including crop damage and attacks on
domesticated animals.
</P>
<P>
The local government has prioritized efforts to find solutions
to issues related to dealing with the relationship between
protecting wild animals and ensuring the well-being of residents.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China's War on Illegal Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials and experts
have enthusiastically welcomed the government's declared war on
illegal foreign exchange dealings, describing it as conducive to
maintaining currency and financial market stability.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is very necessary and important for stabilizing
public sentiment and investor confidence as well as for
safeguarding the stability of the Renminbi yuan and the financial
order," Mao Yushi, director of the Beijing-based Unirule Institute
of Economics, said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
This is especially so considering that the international
financial market remains turbulent, that some speculators with
ulterior motives both in and outside of China have fabricated and
spread rumors of yuan devaluation, and that the public has been
misled and become less confident about the yuan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official decision, announced by a spokesman of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Tuesday, has come in
response to a resurgence of black-market trading in foreign
exchange in some parts of China, and to increased efforts by some
people to evade foreign exchange payments and conduct unlawful
foreign-exchange arbitrages. All these practices have affected
China's balance of international payments.
</P>
<P>
"We must draw lessons from the financial turmoil in Southeast
Asia and Russia and resolutely crack down on illegal activities in
foreign exchange, or there might be grave consequences," Mao said.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts say that the harm done by illegal dealings in
foreign exchange should be viewed from the vantage point of
national economic security.
</P>
<P>
The financial crises in Southeast Asia and Russia have stemmed
partly from uncontrolled foreign-exchange dealings, which
increased the opportunities for international speculator to
profiteer, and caused the devaluation of local currencies as well
as economic recession and social instability, according to the
experts.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will carry on
with its military development program but with modifications in
the face of the country's economic slowdown, defense forces chief
General Ismail Omar said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The program for the period to year 2000, aimed at building up
the Malaysian military capability, is still relevant, Ismail said
while addressing a parade marking the defense forces' 65th
anniversary here.
</P>
<P>
He however said cutbacks in allocation because of the economic
downturn have prompted the defense forces to readjust the
priorities for its development program.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Human resource development still gets high priority
given that the soldiering profession in the future requires
personnel of high expertise and knowledge."
</P>
<P>
The defense forces chief ordered Malaysian soldiers to be
sensitive to development in information technology (IT) and
familiarize themselves with the various IT applications to benefit
the national defense agenda.
</P>
<P>
He also directed them to constantly uphold the system of
regimental orders based on loyalty, camaraderie, discipline and
uniformity.
</P>
<P>
He said it is these values that would determine the genuine
strength of the Malaysian defense forces as without them the
forces' personnel would not make effective use of even the most
sophisticated equipment they have.

<HEADLINE> German Trade Surplus Surges in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany posted a trade surplus
of 14.2 billion marks (about 8.4 billion U.S. dollars) in July,
the highest monthly surplus registered in the past 10 years, the
German Federal Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures issued by the statistics office put
Germany's exports in July at 85 billion marks (about 50 billion
dollars), up 7.7 percent over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany's imports grew only by 4.6 percent to a
total of 70.8 billion marks (about 41.6 billion dollars) in July.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months as a whole, Germany saw its exports
surge by 10.9 percent to 559.1 billion marks (about 328.9 billion
dollars) while imports rose by 8.4 percent to 478.5 billion marks
(about 281.5 billion dollars), with a trade surplus of 80.6
billion marks (about 47.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the continuing exports boom, Germany's current
account deficit, which also measures trade in services and
financial transfers, shrank to 1.6 billion marks (about 941
million dollars) for the first seven months compared with 8.1
billion marks (about 4.8 billion dollars) for the corresponding
period of last year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Blacks Feel More Unsafe Than Whites: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) --The South African black
people are more frightened of their safety than whites, a victim
survey, which polled nearly 14,000 people, has found.
</P>
<P>
While 58 percent of white Johannesburg residents felt unsafe
in their neighborhoods at night, 67 of the blacks and 83 of
coloreds feared for their safety at night.
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa, only 20
percent whites felt threatened in their neighborhoods after dark,
while for black Capetonians, the figure was 50 percent, showed
the survey, conducted by the Institute for Security Studies.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that a majority of those who lived in four
largest metropolitan areas, namely Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban
and Cape Town, had been victims of crime since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg is believed to be the most dangerous city in
South Africa with 63 percent of the 1,200 surveyed saying that
they had been crime victims since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Other cities in the country were not that far behind. In
Durban the figure was 60 percent, in Pretoria 55 percent and in
Cape Town 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that blacks were more likely to become crime
victims than whites in all major cities, with the notable
exception of Johannesburg where 70 percent of whites people
surveyed had been crime victims in the past four years, compared
with 58 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
Whites on the whole had more confidence in the police than
blacks, 45 percent of whites in Johannesburg believed that police
in their neighborhoods were doing a good job of controlling crime
while only 27 of blacks thought the same.
</P>
<P>
Asked what government should do to make cities safe, only a
small minority of those polled believed that penalties for crime
should be made harsher. Most believed that solution lay in more
effective policing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Golden Monkey Population on the Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The total golden monkey
population has dropped 764, some 300 less than the number of giant
pandas, according to a recent habitat survey.
</P>
<P>
China's three species of golden monkeys are found in southwest
China's Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Golden monkeys
living in Guizhou Province face the greatest danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
The natural of the monkeys, which weigh between 10-25 kg and
consume leaves, buds, flowers and fruits of more than 100
varieties of plants and fungi as well as insects, little birds and
their eggs, and fish, crabs and small animals, is limited to
primeval forests in the Fanjingshan Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of the animal can be attributed to the slow
reproduction cycle and evolution process, according to Prof. Ma
Hanzhang, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Chief Seeks U.N. Condemnation of Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban leader Mulla
Omar Wednesday asked the United Nations to condemn Iran if it
refuses to resolve its conflict with the Taliban on the basis of
international law.
</P>
<P>
If Iran is not ready to resolve the problem with the Taliban
militia on the basis of international law, "the United Nations
should condemn it," Radio Kabul quoted Omar as saying in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"If the United Nations shuts its eyes and does not condemn
Iran, then the forum which regards itself as a neutral body would
be meaningless for the world people," Omar said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban chief said his administration has made three to
four official requests but they have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
"If the United Nations does not consider our demand and Iran
does not get ready to resolve the dispute with Islamic Emirates of
Afghanistan on the basis of international laws, then the United
Nations should not interfere in the affairs of Afghanistan in
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran, he said, can settle its problems with the Taliban
administration in accordance with international law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a report reaching here Wednesday
afternoon from Kabul, Omar Wednesday invited Iran to hold peace
negotiations to defuse tensions as Tehran ordered its forces to be
ready for swift action against the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Iran has placed its army on a state
of high alert along the Iran-Afghan border. Senior Iranian leaders
have said Iran will take revenge on the Taliban for the killing of
its diplomats.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's peace effort to
help defuse the Cambodian crisis has won applause from the
international community, Thai Foreign Ministry officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Europe and Japan endorsed Thailand's bid to
help broker talks between Cambodian conflicting parties and
expressed the hope that it would succeed in defusing tension in
the country, Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Kitti Wasinondha
said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra has just
ended a peace mission to Cambodia where he had separate meetings
with King Norodom Sihanouk and leaders of the three main political
parties -- Chea Sim of the Cambodian People's Party, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh of Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy of his self-named
party, according to Thai Foreign Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand also tried to ensure safe travel guarantees for the
two opposition leaders to join a summit with Cambodian Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen under the chairmanship of King Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Under Thailand's brokerage, the three conflicting parties have
agreed to hold talks.
</P>
<P>
In a message conveyed to Thailand, U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin hailed the trip as both timely and important
to the cause of peace and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Japan saw special significance in the deputy minister's
audience with King Sihanouk, noting that the monarch is endowed
with the "august role of arbitrator" under the Cambodian
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel, speaking for the
EU presidency, praised the Thai initiative as conforming with that
of a good neighbor and with the European Union's stand for a
non-violent resolution of the Cambodian conflict.

<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Family Planning
Committee (SFPC) today called on manufacturers and wholesalers of
reproductive healthcare products to support family planning effort
in flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Family planning organizations in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei,
Heilongjiang, Jilin provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region have sustained heavy losses as a result of summer flooding,
according to SFPC Director Zhang Weiqing.
</P>
<P>
Medicines and basic reproductive health care products are badly
needed in flood-stricken areas, especially poverty-stricken areas,
to guarantee the fulfillment of this year's family planning
program, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Ten enterprises, including the Zhuhai Well Medical Instruments
Corp. and the Kimberly-Clark (China) Holding Co., have donate
related products valued at 5.3 million yuan (638,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Family planning departments at all levels will distribute
donated products to affected areas at the earliest possible date,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Heavy flooding since early summer have caused devastation in
six provinces and autonomous regions along the Yangtze,
Songhuajiang and Nenjiang rivers. Devastating floods have killed
over 3,000 people, adversely affected the lives of 200 million
Chinese citizens and led to economic losses of well over 160
billion yuan (18 billion US dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China, one of the largest
producers and consumers of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in the
world, held activities today to mark the fourth International
Ozone Day and advance the cause of ozone-layer protection.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 delegates from organizations including the Executive
Committee of the Multilateral Fund under the Montreal Protocol,
the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations
Environment Program, the State Environmental Protection
Administration, the State Development Planning Commission, and the
Ministry of Science and Technology attended today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to the Montreal Protocol on Substances which deplete
the ozone layer, China will stop the production and consumption of
ODS by July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
With only nine months remaining to reach this goal, China is
facing more pressing issues at present, Wang Jirong, deputy
director of the State Environmental Protection Administration,
told today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Many medium-sized and small enterprises have become the main
obstacles in the process of phasing out ODS in China, since they
lack financial support and managerial expertise, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
She said China plans to revise its regulations and work out new
policies to tackle the problems.
</P>
<P>
Since the United Nations declared September 16 as International
Ozone Day in 1995, China has held activities to mark it every year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 children were given awards today for their
paintings on the theme of ozone-layer protection, and two of the
children will take part in a contest held by the United Nations
Environment Program on the same subject.
</P>
<P>
An ozone-monotoring balloon lifted off here today to obtain
data on the ozone content in the atmosphere 20 to 30 kilometers
above the earth.

soldiers took part in a battle in Central Asia in 53 B.C. and were
defeated by Asians.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 soldiers were thought to have survived the fierce
battle, but were never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
The Han Dynastic records speak of a Roman military group that
encountered a Chinese army many years later, who, after
surrendering to the Han Dynasty, settled in northwest China. Some
believe the descendants of this group still live in Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Based on such historical facts, the screenplay focuses on human
nature and harmony rather than the conflict and resettlement of
the Roman soldiers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Two persons suffering from
full-blown AIDS and three others who are HIV-positive have been
discovered in Medan, capital of Indonesia's North Sumatra
province.
</P>
<P>
"All 19 Thai fishermen found stranded at the Belawan port (in
Medan) have also tested HIV-positive," Medan Mayor H. Bahtiar
Djafar was quoted by Antara News Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said more AIDS and HIV cases have yet to be detected.
</P>
<P>
On the spread of the lethal disease, he said, the prevalence
and incidence of sexually-transmitted diseases in Medan is quite
high due to the high mobility of merchants, workers, tourists and
other people who enter and leave the city through the Belawan port
and the Polinia airport.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over 700 people in Indonesia are known to
be infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Among them, 195
were positively suffering from AIDS, while the others were
HIV-infected.

<HEADLINE> Fossil Fragments May Belong To Largest Asian Dinosaur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists in Chongqing
in southeast China have unearthed dinosaur fossil fragments
which they believe belong to the largest dinosaur ever discovered
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The fossil fragments were found at a construction site two
meters underground in Tongnan County, and are thought to date back
some 140 million years. Among the more than 30 fossil bones are a
scapula 2.2 meters long and a vertebra 0.9 meters high.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said this dinosaur might have been some 28 meters
in length when full grown. This is six or seven meters longer than
 the largest known fossil dinosaur ever found in Asia, discovered
in Mamenxi near the city of Chongqing forty years ago.
</P>
<P>
But many parts of this latest discovery are missing and some
fossils are very fragile because they were positioned very close
to the earth's surface, said one archeologist, adding that the
discovery provides valuable material for dinosaur research and
other inquiries into the conditions of the region in remote
antiquity.

<HEADLINE> Manila-Rebels Peace Talks Still Ongoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the
Philippine government and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) are still ongoing, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that while speculations on recent kidnappings may
have hampered negotiations somewhat, the low-level peace talks
have not stopped.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Zamora also said both sides have set up
informal channels to continue talks if negotiations at the low
level fail.
</P>
<P>
"We have to focus on this particular problem but the peace
talks at the panel level will not be stopped... as a matter of
fact, MILF negotiators are talking to me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora added that the government has even accepted the MILF's
offer to proceed with the talks after the kidnapping of Italian
priest Luciano Benedetti, whose abduction was initially linked to
the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also dismissed as a case of media misinterpretation
President Joseph Estrada's reported backtracking on peace talks
with the secessionist rebels.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which already signed a peace treaty with
the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their low-level peace talks
in January 1997.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Leaders Urged to Watch on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has called upon African especially southern African
leaders to keep close eyes on the situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the dinner for visiting Namibian President Sam
Nujoma here Tuesday, President Chissano said that Angola's
opposition movement the United Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA)is pushing the war-torn country to the verge of
fighting by ignoring the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the new leaders of the breakaway UNITA faction can
turn the situation toward peace, national unity, state
reconstruction and regional peace and stability," Wednesday's
Noticias newspaper quoted Chissano as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president reiterated support for the Angolan
people and government, calling upon the international community
to continue providing all necessary assistances to Angola in
order to ensure a final peace in the country and the
reintegration of all citizens into the society.
</P>
<P>
Chissano expressed his confidence that as the United Nations
new special representative of Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
Angola, Issa Diallo, arrived in the country, a new scenario will
appear and the conflict will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the developments in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), the Mozambican president said that in order to keep
the Congo crisis in rein, it is important for the resolutions
adopted at the summit of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) in Mauritius early this week and the agreements
reached at the meetings in South Africa's Pretoria and Zimbabwe's
Victoria Falls earlier to be observed.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the best way to quickly restore peace in
Congo (K) is to resume dialog," said Chissano.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the conflicts in Lesotho since over a month ago
are also worrisome and they could bring negative affects on the
stability in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the Basotho and their leaders to bring the social,
economic and political life of the country back to normal through
peaceful approaches." he said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also called upon the world community to reschedule or
write off the debts burdening the African states, saying that
heavy debts are impeding the development and growth of these
countries and unbalancing their trade.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the words of the Mozambican leader, President Nujoma
said that Africa should not merely be the receiver of the foreign
manufactured goods and the industrialized nations should
implement more generous trade policies toward Africa so that the
African products could have quick access to their markets.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma arrived in Maputo Tuesday evening on his first state
visit to Mozambique since he became the Namibian president.
</P>
<P>
Besides holding talks with Chissano on the cooperation between
the two southern African nations, Nujoma will pay a visit to
central Mozambican city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma is scheduled to end his visit Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Striving to Vitalize Local Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The north China city Tianjin
is trying to vitalize its local economy by investing in several
new sectors to propel economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This move is designed to counter the diminishing force of major
economic city powerhouses such as the coastal development zone and
the petrochemical and automobile industries which have been
feeling the adverse impact of many unfavorable factors since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the newly chosen sectors for
development include real estate, high-tech industries, and
research and development of new industrial products.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city spent 3.1 billion yuan in housing
construction in the first half of this year, a rise of 12 percent
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to supporting measures for boosting real estate
development, the city sold 1.23 million square meters of
open-market apartments between January and June, a rise of 71
percent.
</P>
<P>
The development of the real estate sector over the past six
months contributed 1.21 percentage points to Tianjin's economic
growth this year, a growth targeted for nine percent.
</P>
<P>
The city will put even more investment into the real estate
sector in the later half of the year. It is estimated that 10
billion yuan will be spent in housing construction this year, with
completed apartment buildings totaling 4.5 million square meters
and sales of 3 million square meters of apartments.
</P>
<P>
The real estate sector, including the renovating of
dilapidated housing and the construction of new and modern
apartments, is expected to contribute two percentage points to the
city's economic growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The city also reported encouraging results from investments
in high-tech industries, technical upgrading and technological
innovations, and the development of new industrial products.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the first six months, Tianjin had a rise
of 14.6 percent over the same period last year in the output value
of new industrial products.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The next World Cup cannot be
rescheduled for bad weather in joint-host countries South Korea
and Japan, according to a news release from FIFA on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Korean officials suggested earlier this year that the c
ompetition should start in May 2002 to avoid the traditional
rainy season.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA's planning group said at a meeting Tuesday that the
dates for the event cannot be changed because June and July are
traditionally reserved for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The quadrennial, monthlong competition usually starts around
June 10. The professional soccer season in Europe and South
America ends in April.
</P>
<P>
"Any change of timing would severely disrupt soccer operations
around the world," FIFA said.
</P>
<P>
However, officials have asked both nations to investigate past
weather in the region between May and September to allow FIFA's
executive committee to make a final decision at a two-day meeting
starting September 24.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Invests Heavily in Highway Construction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China expects heavy
investments in highway construction to promote economic growth
during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government recently added 20 billion yuan to its
highway construction budget, bringing the total budgeted figure
for the year to 180 billion yuan. The initial figure of 120
billion yuan was increased to 160 billion yuan in June.
</P>
<P>
The massive investment is expected to increase this year's GDP
by 0.795 percentage points, according to recent estimates by the
Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Increasing investment has promoted China's economic growth,
according to well-known economist Hu Angang. Hu pointed out
ongoing adjustments of the economic structure, especially in terms
of redundant processing industries and undeveloped basic
facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Accelerating the construction of basic facilities will be a
major factor in ensuring fulfillment of the eight percent economic
growth goal for 1998 and alleviating existing bottlenecks," said
Hu.
</P>
<P>
He added that the highway system, a key infrastructure sector
which has long restricted economic development, is undoubtedly a
key target for investment.
</P>
<P>
China commenced its highway construction program less than a
century ago. The nation's first highway, which was constructed in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1906,
was only several dozen kilometers long. The nation's total highway
mileage in 1949 stood at 80,000 km, with the figure rising sharply
to 1.23 million km by the end of last year. Highways are currently
found in all counties.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Invests Heavily in Highway Construction (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, China's current level of 11 kilometers of highways for
every 100 sq.km is far less than the 60 km average in developed
countries, and less than a third of the average level in
developing countries such as India and Thailand in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
China's highways are for the most part low grade arteries with
limited capacity. The nation's 4,700-km expressway system
represents a mere five percent of the total length of the
U.S. system. The mileage for high-grade highways accounts for a
mere 10.7 percent of the total. Statistics show that vehicles
plying China's highways travel at only an average speed of 30
km/hr.
</P>
<P>
The 180 billion yuan earmarked for highway construction will
create 1.2 million jobs during 1998 and will greatly benefit
efforts to reemploy laid-off workers, according to Zhu Yongguang,
director of the Department for System Restructuring and Regulation
under the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
June statistics show that 4.38 million Chinese workers were
engaged in highway construction, including 3.36 million farmers.
</P>
<P>
Highway construction will also promote growth in related
industries, said Zhu. Over 1.03 million tons of steel, 14 million
tons of cement, 250,000 tons of asphalt, and 1.73 million tons of
oil consumed funds totalling 46.45 billion yuan during the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that various other industries will witness
accelerated development in conjunction with the expanded scale of
highway construction during the latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
China will set a new record by constructing highways stretching
over 33,000 km during 1998, including the record construction of
expressways covering some 1,560 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
China's long-term policy centers on accelerating infrastructure
construction. The State Council plan calls for 500 billion yuan in
funding for highway construction over three years. The total
highway mileage will hit 1.4 million km by the year 2002, with the
expressway network covering 10,000 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Academic on U.S. Policies Toward South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- An American academic said
here Wednesday that the first interest of the United States right
now in South Asia is the containment of nuclear activities
followed by increased trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Stephen F. Dachi, chair for South
Asia Area Studies at the Foreign Service Institute of U.S.
Department of State, said that the United States would like to
ensure that there is no more testing but agreement to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the United States has important objectives of
developing economic relations and promoting investment and trade
with the South Asia region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the sanctions slapped on India and Pakistan by
the United States following their nuclear tests in May make it
more difficult to improve the economic ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dachi is on a lecture tour in Nepal at the invitation of the
U.S. Information Service Office here. During his 29 years of
foreign service career which ended in March 1996, Dachi traveled
frequently in Asia, Europe and the Americas to lecture on global
economy and U.S. foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is also very concerned about the
tensions between India and Pakistan, terrorism and narcotics flow
in the region and human rights violations in Afghanistan, which is
considered by the U.S. as part of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The South Asia region did not figure prominently in U.S.
foreign policies after the end of the cold war. But last November
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pakistan and
India in preparation for a scheduled visit to the two countries by
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"When Secretary of State Albright came here, the U.S.
government was very hopeful that we could have a major improvement
in cooperation relations," Dachi said. "The testing has changed
the situation unfortunately."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States was not changing its foreign
policies toward South Asia, but devoting more attention to
strengthening relations with the region.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the United States always has three to five
foreign policy crises going on in the world at any one time, so it
is very difficult some time to devote all the necessary attention
to every issue in the world.
</P>
<P>
"South Asia is sometimes not very high on the administration's
priority list. That's what the secretary of state and the
president want to remedy, but the situation is more difficult," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that President Clinton's visit to India and Pakistan
is still under review.
</P>
<P>
But he said that it is possible that the United States will
lift the sanctions on India and Pakistan in the near future
"because all these sanctions were imposed by congressional action
and there has been very definite recognition in the U.S. Congress
that we have to review our sanctions policies because sometimes
they do not work very well."
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a two-party special commission appointed
by the Congress to evaluate U.S. sanctions policies.
</P>
<P>
In the case of selling wheat to Pakistan, the Congress voted to
suspend embargo for the deal about three weeks ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
On regional cooperation, Dachi said that "regional cooperation
in SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) is
always being impeded, slowed down by the tensions between India
and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said that when the two powers are concentrating on
difficulties in relations between themselves, it is very difficult
to get the smaller member countries to move toward very firm
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
On the development prospects of the region in the 21st century,
Dachi noted that Bangladesh has made most progress in the last
five years with thousands of new jobs created, energy resources
developed and many people becoming better-off.
</P>
<P>
India made some progress for a few years with the economic
reform, he said, but now it is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
He said Sri Lanka would be doing very well except for the civil
war, while for Nepal, the big breakthrough lies in development of
hydro-power, but investment and market are the problems to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
He observed that as obstacles to peaceful development are great
in South Asia, one of the poorest regions in the world, and the
prospects for resolving the political obstacles are not very
encouraging, economic prospects are not bright here in the next
century.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province maintained stable economic growth during the first eight
month's of this year in spite of declining exports resulting from
the impact of the ongoing financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, one of the nation's major contributors to foreign
trade, accounted for close to 40 percent of total exports. The
adverse influences of the international environment limited the
province's export growth to only 8.1 percent for the first eight
months, down dramatically by 25.6 percent growth for 1997. The
growth figure reached 1.5 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
However, the negative impact of sluggish exports was offset by
a relatively impressive 19.2 percent rise in investments in
infrastructure and technological renovations, with total
investments for the period surpassing 62.32 billion yuan (7.5
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector provided additional encouragement, with
the sector's value-added growing by 9.9 percent to 155.9 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales for consumer products grew by 12.7 percent in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's gross domestic product (GDP) for the period grew by
9.7 percent, some seven percent higher than the national average,
with 10 percent growth for industrial value-added surpassing the
national figure by 7.9 percent.

Foreign Ministerial Council conference, which is to be held in
Cairo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General Ahmed bin Hilli said that the
impetus for the new initiative was based on an agreement signed
last month by rival factions of the Somali National Alliance and the
26-faction National Salvation Council.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the establishment of a federal
government and the reopening of Somalia's airports and seaports.
</P>
<P>
Since the ouster of the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in
1991, Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by
faction leaders, who fought to expand their turfs despite a number
of peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
The AL had lobbied its 22 members to fund a peace conference in
Somali capital Mogadishu and hlep reconstruct the country's
airports and seaports damaged during the six-year-old conflicts.
</P>
<P>
But only 400,000 U.S. dollars of 6 million needed have been
raised so far due to "a lack of confidence" among the AL members
in the sincerity of Somali warring parties in making peace.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Favor Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Businesses from Europe and
the United States have reinforced their investments in Tianjin,
the largest port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
A municipal government official said that during the
January-August period, United States enterprises increased
investments by 25 percent over the same period last year, and
European Union member countries invested 180 million U.S. dollars
in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that up to now Tianjin has approved
over 12,000 foreign-funded enterprises, with total investments of
21.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, foreign interests put 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars into Tianjin annually.
</P>
<P>
By August, Tianjin had nearly 1,900 U.S.- funded enterprises
with investments totalling three billion U.S. dollars, accounting
for 15 percent of the city's total. The United States is second
only to Hong Kong in Tianjin investment.
</P>
<P>
Six of the top ten enterprises in the United States have
invested in Tianjin, and most have realized satisfactory profits.
Motorola for example, garnered over 160 million U.S. dollars in
profits from Tianjin in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the favorable investment environment and preferential
policies provided by the Tianjin municipal government, most
foreign enterprises have confidence in their investments in the
city.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Updates Mubarak on Peace Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat Wednesday morning held talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on his recent contacts made to break the
peace impasse with Israel, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in the northern coastal city of Alexandria
Tuesday evening on a two-day visit to Egypt to attend the Arab
League (AL) Foreign Ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Mubarak in Alexandria focused on the results of
current peace-saving efforts and his three round of talks in a
week with U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Presidential Political Adviser Osama el-Baz,
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Shaath attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to deliver a speech at the opening session
of AL Foreign Ministerial Council's 110th meeting in Cairo later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the Palestinian leader will call on the Arab
countries to hold an emergency Arab summit to rescue the faltering
Mideast peace process and challenge Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the region last week on a new mission to narrow
the gaps between the Palestinian and Israeli sides on an American
plan on Israeli redeployment. But there is no breakthrough after
his rounds of shuttling between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has accepted the U.S. proposal on a 13 percent Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank in return for harsher crackdown on
Palestinian militants. But he rejected Netanyahu's idea of turning
3 percent into a "nature reserve" over which the PNA has only
limited control.
</P>
<P>
Egypt backs the U.S. initiative but warns Arafat against
striking a "bad" deal that would compromise Palestinians'
interests and can not be implemented.

<HEADLINE> Artificial Breeding Techniques Developed for Golden Monkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists may be
able to save the golden monkey in southwest China's Guizhou
Province from extinction, thanks to the development of artificial
breeding techniques for this very endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Covered with golden hair, the four young golden monkeys bred by
artificial means are all in good health. The Fanjingshan natural
reserve zone of the province has spent 1.5 million yuan (about
190,000 U.S. dollars) to establish a farm for the Guizhou golden
monkeys, which are also known as grey golden monkeys.
</P>
<P>
This species only lives in areas around the Fanjingshan
Mountain region, and it has been placed under first-category state
protection.
</P>
<P>
Only one of the 11 golden monkeys living on the reserve-zone
farm has died of natural causes, and all of the young monkeys bred
under artificial conditions are healthy, compared with only a 42
percent survival rate in the wild.
</P>
<P>
China first caught and bred a golden monkey in 1991, and now
researchers understand the animal's breeding behavior. "When the
number of golden monkeys increase to a certain level, we will send
them back to nature in groups," said Yang Yeqing, director of the
administration department of the Fanjingshan nature reserve.

capabilities demonstrated when it fired a rocket two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Monopoly on Thai Whisky Industry to Be Ended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A 55-year-old state monopoly
on whisky production in Thailand is to be lifted as the government
approved a plan to liberalize the industry, a government press
release available Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, whisky production is monopolized by a business
group, which operates all the 11 state-owned liquor plants through
two concessions from the Finance and Industry Ministries.
</P>
<P>
The government will allow private investors to bid for all the
11 distilleries within 15 years and for the machinery, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Interested investors can apply for liquor production within the
next two or three months, but sale of products can only begin
after current concessions expire on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
To make locally-produced liquor more competitive, the
government has decided not to tax whisky production licensing.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said that even though the government's
income from liquor tax will be reduced, it will earn more from
excise paid by new whisky producers estimated to seize about 50
percent of the total market.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also reported that in 1997, tax collected from
white whisky and blend whisky was 17.8 billion baht (445 million
U.S. dollars), of which 17.2 billion (430 million dollars) was
from state distilleries.
</P>
<P>
Tax collected from beer and wine in 1997 amounted to 21.6
billion baht (540 million dollars) and 42.12 million baht (1.06
million dollars) respectively.

<HEADLINE> Australian Bank Tellers Fall Victim to ATMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 bank branches,
or about 8 percent of the total in Australia, have closed in the
past financial year ending June 30, as telephone banking and the
Internet replace the traditional bank tellers.
</P>
<P>
According to latest official statistics available here
Wednesday, the total number of branches across Australia fell by
506 to 5,615 from 6,121, down 8.2 percent, over the past financial
year.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia, the nation's central bank, said
in a bulletin released this week that the drop added up the number
of branches closed over the past five years to 1,131.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, the number of automatic teller machines
(ATMs) has jumped by 2,966 to 5,616.
</P>
<P>
People went into a bank branch from time to time, but
day-to-day banking was done electronically at the supermarket,
through electronic machines such as ATMs, or over the telephone
and the Internet, said Eric Kinsella, general manager of the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Victoria state branch.
</P>
<P>
As 95 percent of the households in Australia have access to
phones and one million households have access to the Internet, it
is convenient and cost-effective for Australian residents to pay
their bills over the phone or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The massive closure has led to dismissal of thousands of
tellers by banks.
</P>
<P>
The Australian and New Zealand Banking Corporation, one of the
leading banks in Australia, announced earlier this year a plan to
fire about 2,000 redundant employees in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Labor Party, the nation's opposition, has seized
the bank branch closures and banking services as an election
issue.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said Wednesday Australian banks
would be forced to contribute 20 million Australian dollars (12
million U.S. dollars) to a fund to ensure at least one bank stays
open in every country town if Labor is elected.
</P>
<P>
The closure of hundreds of banks in regional areas in recent
years has devastated many country towns and caused widespread
anger in the rural areas about the loss of services.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The city of Dehui in
northeast China's Jilin Province has emerged as one of China's
major production centers for organic food.
</P>
<P>
The Dexin Company, the city's leading organic food producer
which entered operations early this year, has been unable to fully
satisfy increasing demand. Nonetheless, the company has succeeded
in exporting products to Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The company marketed 3,600 tons of beef during the first half
of the year. The ready market provided a 300 US dollar per ton
price for beef over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
The city's Organic Food Festival offered eight varieties of
pollution-free food products, including chicken, beef, edible oil,
rice, vegetables, maize and beans.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the city's organic food producers received orders
valued at 750 million yuan and signed contracts worth over 30
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Constantly improving living standards in China over the past
few years have expanded the market for organic food products.
</P>
<P>
China has 600 registered organic food companies which market
1,200 varieties of organic food products. China's annual export
volume for organic products stands at 20 billion US dollars,
according to Liu Lianfu, director of the China Green Food Center.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists predict
that the nation's economy will grow by a dramatic 9.1 percent in
the fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Such a growth rate for the period will ensure that China can
achieve its 1998 economic goal of eight percent growth.
</P>
<P>
A report issued today by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences notes that increased investments in fixed assets, more
bank loans and rising income levels for urban residents will be
conducive to an anticipated rebound.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy dropped steadily between April and June by
6.9 percent over the same period of last year, representing the
lowest point since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that investments in fixed assets will grow
by 16 percent during the fourth quarter, with related growth
expected to stimulate the economy and boost imports. The trade
surplus for the year is expected to hit 45.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the grain circulation system will lead to slight
rises in prices for grain and food. Price hikes for industrial
products and overall prices increases will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey in 34 cities revealed that the trend for
savings will remain strong and consumption power in turn will
remain weak.
</P>
<P>
Economists point to various good signs, but nonetheless note
the economy will face a number of obstacles resulting from
devastating summer floods and the sliding Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that measures must be introduced to increase
exports and ensure the stability of the Renminbi.

ZHENGZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,200
reemployment service centers in central China's Henan Province
have provided services for over 610,000 laid-off workers, or 61
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The province has raised 67 million yuan (8.3 million US
dollars) to help maintain basic living standards for laid-off
workers. Some 120,000 laid-off workers have received basic living
subsidies and some 20,000 workers received monthly subsidies of 300
yuan during August.
</P>
<P>
The provincial labor department has made arrangements to

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Craftsmen in north
China's Hebei Province have completed work on a huge inkstone and
presented it as a gift to greet Macao's return to Chinese
sovereignty next year.
</P>
<P>
The giant inkstone is eight meters long, three meters wide and
one meter tall and weighs more than 30 tons. It is believed to be
the largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Carved on the body of this "king of inkstones" are 99 flying
dragons and 9 phoenix, representing that the event will take place
in 1999. Nine carved tortoises suggest Macao's return since the
words "tortoise" and "return" sound alike in standard Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The enormous inkstone has two wells designed to contain ink;
one is in the shape of China and the other is carved in the shapes
of the sun, moon, stars and Earth.

stolen credit number to download pornographic pictures and films
worth 147,000 dollars, an Egyptian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette quoted security sources as saying Tuesday

Authorities contacted the cabinet's Internet department, which
is in charge of all Internet service providers, and traced the two
students who had been using the card for seven months.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Strikers Threaten to Intensify Stoppage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- As their strike entered
the second day Wednesday, Israeli local authority workers
threatened to intensify it if demands for wage increase were not
met.
</P>
<P>
Trade Union of Israeli Local Authorities said that it had hold
negotiations with the Finance Ministry Tuesday night in an effort
to reach an agreement and end the strike.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the officials from the ministry still refused
to give a 30 percent wage rise as the trade union suggested after
five hours of talks.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the trade union told Israel Radio that the
negotiations would continue on Wednesday. But he warned that if
the Finance Ministry did not make compromise, the trade union
would "unleash chaos all over the country."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Finance Ministry insisted that it would
agree to a wage increase not more than 27.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade union launched the strike on Tuesday, which kept
some 100,000 employees from the local authorities across the
country from their work.
</P>
<P>
The strike shut down most of the municipal departments,
hospitals and kindergartens.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Industry Eyes Civilian Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear industry is
accelerating efforts to shift from military production to civilian
applications, and is rapidly becoming a major powerhouse in the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The industry is operating under a new system featuring a
combination of military and civilian production combined with the
development of nuclear power and a diversified economy, according
to a senior industry official.
</P>
<P>
The sector has established a large number of enterprise groups
in developed coastal areas such as the east China municipality of
Shanghai and the southern province of Guangdong. Enterprises in
the sector have developed over 1,500 products for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
The industry has expanded its economic base by maintaining a
high growth rate for a number of years in succession and has in
turn contributed to dramatic improvements in the nation's
comprehensive economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Products designed for civilian use account for over 80 percent
of the total industrial output volume for China's nuclear sector.
</P>
<P>
The development of nuclear energy represents a major factor
enabling the industry to introduce strategic adjustments,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in east China's Zhejiang
Province and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong
province have exemplary safety records and their combined annual
power output is three times the total power China generated in
1952.
</P>
<P>
The two facilities have not only alleviated power shortages in
east China and Guangdong, but have also supplied substantial
quantities of power to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Construction of second and third phase projects at Qinshan, and
the Ling'ao and Lianyungang nuclear power stations is progressing
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear power generating capacity should approach 9.2
million kilowatts by early next century, with earnings from
nuclear power expected to reach 30 billion yuan annually. The
industry plans to further improve its industrial structure,
economic base and technology.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power currently accounts for one percent of China's
total power output, a level substantially lower than the world
average of 70 percent. Nuclear power is a clean and highly
efficient energy source which enjoys wide-ranging market
advantages in terms of the energy structure, environment and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces in east China, the
island province of Hainan in the south and Hunan province in
central China are actively preparaing to construct their own
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to achieve significant development in the
realm of nuclear power in the 21st century. For example, the
nation's nuclear power generating capacity will reach 20 million
kw by the year 2010, with the figure expected to rise to 40
million kw and account for five percent of the nation's total
power output by 2020.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The listed companies of
Guangdong Province in south China have consistently reported
technical progress in
their efforts to become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Just recently the Yue Meidi company, an electronics producer,
invested 16 million U.S. dollars to import an advanced production
line for manufacturing washing machines, an innovation expected to
add 150 million yuan (18.07 million U.S. dollars) to the company's
annual output.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gree Electrics, a major air conditioner
producer, also made a huge outlay to import advanced technology
and equipment from abroad. In the first half of this year, Gree's
sales rose by 30 percent to rank it first in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhongxing Telecommunications in Shenzhen spends about
10 percent of its sales income on scientific research and
development. Last year, they spent 130 million yuan and
this year they expect this figure to reach 300 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another electronics producer, Kelong, which is listed on the
Hong Kong exchange, set up a research institute in Japan and
employs development experts from Japan, Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Some listed companies in Guangdong have endowed scholarships at major
universities to specially train personnel who will eventually work
for them.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Coffee Export Forecast Revised Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has revised up its
targeted 1997/98 coffee exports to 70,000 tons from originally
40,000 tons, said a spokesman of the state-run Coffee
Board of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
"Our export estimates for the season (October 1997/September
1998) are 70,000 tons. We can go beyond this figure or below it
but it is our forecast," said CBK's spokesman Paul Kivila.
</P>
<P>
Earlier forecasts had indicated that coffee output would stand
at 40,000 tons because the freak weather had cut the output, the
East African Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual coffee yield averaged 80,000 tons in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Kivila was quoted as saying that in spite of the fall in
volume, Kenya would earn about 16-18 billion Shillings (267
million to 300 million U.S. Dollars) from coffee exports
because of the good prices from last October to this month.
</P>
<P>
"Although we got a smaller crop this season, the value is
relatively good because we experienced good prices, which covered
the shortfall," he said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the coffee production during the coming year
from October 1998 to September 1999 will rise to between 80,000
and 90,000 tons "if the country is not hit by freak weather
again."
</P>
<P>
Coffee exports, accounting for 25 percent of Kenya's annual
export revenue,is the third biggest export earner in Kenya,led
only by tourism and tea.
</P>
<P>
However, Kivila said that the horticultural industry is
threatening to replace the coffee sector as a major foreign
exchange earner.

<HEADLINE> Military Range Becomes World's Largest Settlement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 750,000 poor
farmers living in mountainous areas in northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region today began to move to new homes on a former
artillery range in central part of the region.
</P>
<P>
The range, the largest of its kind in China, covers 55,300 ha
in the central part of Hongshipu, a vast wasteland which will
become the world's largest settlement over two years.
</P>
<P>
Water from the Yellow River entered irrigation channels this
morning at 10:00 and made its way to the range located some 160 km
from the regional capital of Yinchuan. The roar of water pumps has
now replaced booming artillery rounds characteristic of the past
40 years.
</P>
<P>
Trucks and tractors carrying new residents filled the highway
leading to the range which was formerly restricted to military
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A septuagenarian Muslim farmer named Yang Yili travelled the
100 km from his former home by donkey cart. His family was in the
first group of new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Yang formerly lived in one of China's poorest and most arid
mountainous areas in southern Ningxia. The evaporation rate is 10
times the annual rainfall of 300 mm. Farmers lacked access to
adequate cultivatable land and harsh conditions made life
difficult.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the central government earmarked three billion yuan
(360 million U.S. dollars) to transform Hongshipu into the world's
largest settlement.
</P>
<P>
China used a Kuwaiti government loan of 140 million U.S.
dollars to construct a massive irrigation project to divert water
from the Yellow River to Hongshipu.

The project will provide ample irrigation for 140,000 ha
surrounding Hongshipu and will facilitate the resettlement and
improve living conditions for some one million poverty-stricken
farmers from the region's mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
"Geological and topological conditions are suitable for both
military training and farming," according to Liu Xinghua, director
of the artillery range administration.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Constitution of the People's Republic of China
provides for the military to support national economic
construction by either vacating or opening military installations
for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
A recent White Paper on China's National Defense noted that the
country has opened more than 101 military airports and has either
opened or deactivated 29 military ports and military areas
covering some three million square meters for civilian use over
the past 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call For Reintroducing Vegetation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Reintroducing vegetation in
the Yangtze River Valley represents the important measure needed
to prevent flooding in the region, according to experts attending
a symposium on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fucheng, a forestry expert from the Southwest China
Forestry Institute, noted that silting has severely hampered the
operational capacities of over 50,000 reservoirs in the Yangtze
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
He said silting in tributaries in middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze have impeded the normal flow of flood waters and
resulted in rising water levels.
</P>
<P>
An average 200 million cu.m. of silt is deposited in lakes in
the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze each year.
</P>
<P>
The surface area of Dongting Lake has dropped dramatically from
over 4,300 sq.km. in the 1950s to only 2,600 sq.km., with the
lake's flood water control capacity dropping from 29.3 billion
cu.m. to 17.4 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the symposium urged related departments to
take immediate measures to reintroduce vegetation in the
Yangtze River Valley, protect natural forests, develop shelterbelt
systems and close hillsides to facilitate afforestation.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Sun Shuwei to Miss Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Sun Shuwei, men's 10-meter
platform gold medalist at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, will miss
the Bangkok Asian Games in December to focus on preparing for
the 2000 Olympics, his coach Hu Enyong said on Wedbesday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Sun, also winner of the world championships in
1991 and 1994, finished a modest 10th place in the springboard
event on Tuesday at the current national championships, which
serves as the trial for the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Due to an out-of-form, Sun has announced to pull out of his
favorite platform event to be held on Thursday, which means he
gives up the Asian Games, in which he swept the two consecutive
platform golds in the 1990 Beijing and 1994 Hiroshima editions.
</P>
<P>
"Sun had overworked himself in preparing for the 8th National
Games last year," Hu said. "He has been too exhausted. He needs
to relax."
</P>
<P>
The coach said it's also part of the efforts to let Sun
compete in the highboard event this time. "This could move his
attention otherwhere from the platform. But he is sure to
prepare for a participation in the platform event in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
Hu added that winning a second Olympic gold medal is the only
dream to be fulfilled before Sun's retirement. "That's the only
reason he is still diving."
</P>
<P>
Sun failed to take part in the Atlanta Olympic Games after
finishing a disappointing third in the pre-Olympic national
trials with his eyes injury. Then he conceded the Olympic berths
to new hands Tian Liang and Xiao Hailiang, who placed third and
fourth respectively in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive star, nicknamed as "big boy" by western
reporters in the Barcelona Olympics, has made a strong comeback
since 1997, winning his speciality event in the National Games in
Shanghai last October and taking the double platform golds at the
Perth World Championships in January and the Goodwill Games in
July in New York.
</P>
<P>
But Russian Dimitry Sautin has emerged as the most powerful
opponent on the platform when Sun was resting his eyes injury in
1996, by winning the golds in the Atlanta Olympics, World
Championships and almost all the major international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"Sautin has become a hurdle in front of us," Coach Hu said.
"But we're confident to beat him in Sydney."

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of China's Tibetan
children performed songs and dances from the region's traditional
life and culture in the United States on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The China Tibet Children's Art Troupe performed on the
first-day of the international exchange during the 28th annual
International Children's Festival in Fairfax, Virginia. The event
is scheduled to last till September 20.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the festival at Wolf Trap Farm Park in Fairfax
County are troupes from Argentina, Armenia, Mexico and Russia, as
well as American host children.
</P>
<P>
Before an audience of some 3,000, the Tibetan children, aged 10
to 13, vividly portrayed to the American people and children from
other nations, life, work and the traditional culture in the
Himalayan region.
</P>
<P>
Their dance "A'shie" showed the way Tibetan people sing and
dance while performing their daily work. The Yak Dance, which is
simple and lively, reflected the children's life in the northern
Tibet Grasslands and how they cope with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
For many Americans, it was the first time to see such a
cultural dance performed by a group of girls and boys in
traditional Tibetan dress. Many described the performance as

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Tuesday told a visiting senior Chinese military leader

America.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met with Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of China's
Central Military Commission, Tuesday evening in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said Clinton told the Chinese
general that both sides need to continue their efforts to maintain
the momentum of development, created by top-level exchange of
visits, in the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
General Zhang said that he had come to the United States to
make concrete arrangements for furthering military ties between
the two countries in line with the agreements reached by the two
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Zhang arrived in Washington Monday afternoon at the invitation
of U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Calls for Political Solution to Albanian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, in his capacity as the chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), has
been stepping up consultations for a political solution to the
Albanian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, said a spokesman for the Polish Foreign
Ministry on Tuesday, Geremek has talked over the phone with
Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani, Prime Minister Fatos Nano and
opposition leaders about the situation in the tiny Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
During their phone conversations, Geremek pointed to the
necessity of political dialogues in the wake of violent unrest in
Tirana, the capital of Albania, touched off by the weekend
assassination of the popular opposition leader Azem Hajdari.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he called for the Albanian government and
opposition leaders' attention to the Polish experience of tackling
similar situations years ago with political roundtables.
</P>
<P>
Geremek was quoted as saying that the crisis in Albania not
only hurts the process toward social and economic stability of the
country itself, but also the stability of the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Poland supports the Monday statement of the
European Union (EU) condemning the killing of Hajdari, a leading
opposition deputy in the Albanian parliament and a close friend of
former President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
He added that Poland hopes that Tirana could make thorough
investigation into the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Two days of violent clashes beginning on Monday in Tirana
resulted in the death of at least three people and the injury of
14 others.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Recover Noriega's Corrupt Money in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Panama has sent legal
representatives to recover state funds diverted by former military
strongman General Manuel Antonio Noriega into French banks.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers published here Tuesday quoted the Panamanian
government's General Accountant Gabriel Castro as saying that
Noriega has over 12.6 million U.S. dollars in French banks.
</P>
<P>
Originated from state funds, the money was a result of
corruption and mismanagement during Noriega's rule of the country.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Castro said, Panama has managed to recover, via
legal actions and with cooperation of the French authorities, 7.6
million dollars from frozen bank accounts of the former strongman.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian legal representatives would try to recover the
rest five million dollars this time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ousted from power by a U.S. military strike in 1989, Noriega
now is serving a 20-year prison term in the United States for
drug-trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Panama Demands Indemnity for Losses by U.S. Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Panama is demanding the
United States pay more than 250 million U.S. dollars for
losses caused by the U.S. invasion on December 20, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The National Human Rights Commission of Panama said Tuesday the
amount has increased since more Panamanians have come forward who
claim to have been injured. Originally, only 70 individuals
claimed to have been injured or lost family members during the
invasion.
</P>
<P>
In December 1989, former U.S. President George Bush ordered
U.S. Army troops to enter Panama to overthrow the country's former
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian legal advisors have met some victims at the city of
Colon, 80 kilometers west of the capital city, and in the
metropolitan neighborhood of El Chorrillo, which was destroyed
during the invasion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Panamanian legal representative Gilma Camargo has
challenged the accuracy of the U.S. official war report on
Panamanian casualties. The report claims that only 202 civilians
were killed and 314 casualties were reported among military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Vielka Barria, member of the commission, said the U.S. invasion
left over 18,000 Panamanians homeless and many persons maimed.
</P>
<P>
She said that until now reported cases of clandestine burials
by U.S. troops have not been thoroughly investigated.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Washington questioned the accuracy of the demands,
which were also rejected by the Interamerican Commission of the
OAE. The OAE also defended its authority to investigate the
case.

<HEADLINE> Flood Water Receding Fast in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation throughout
Bangladesh has improved further as water levels of major rivers
such as the Mrahmaputra and Ganges were continuing to fall
remarkably.
</P>
<P>
The situation in and around the capital city of Dhaka has also
improved with the fall of water levels in the Buriganga,
Shitalakhya, Turag and Kaliganga rivers.
</P>
<P>
If the situation continues, the flood situation across the
country is likely to improve markedly by the end of this month,
press reports Wednesday quoting sources of the Flood Forecasting
and Warning Center as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, major rivers are still flowing above the danger mark.
The sources from the center added that whether the water levels of
these rivers would continue to fall rapidly would depend on the
quantum of rainfall in the catchment areas of the major rivers
outside the country and unhindered discharge of waters through the
Meghna estuary.
</P>
<P>
The floods, which have lasted for more than two months, have
killed over 800 people, affected about 30 million people in 52 out
of the country's 64 districts and wrought havoc on agriculture,
industry, properties and infrastructure, according to the latest
figures released by the Ministry of Disaster Management and

<HEADLINE> Czech Economic Situation Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Czech economy is declining
this year and the overall situation continues to deteriorate, the
State Statistical Bureau said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in five years the Czech economy has
experienced a downturn.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Bureau show the gross domestic
product (GDP) in the first half of 1998 was 592.8 billion Czech
Korun (19.1 billion U.S. dollars), 1.7 percent less than the same
period last year
</P>
<P>
The first and second quarters respectively saw a drop of 0.9
percent and 2.4 percent, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The Czech GDP, after continued decline from 1991 to 1993, began
to pick up in 1994 with a growth of 2.7 percent. The economy
entered its best period in 1995, when the GDP increased by 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, as a result of playing up the function of the market
and ignoring macro-economic control, the country's economic growth
slowed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Czech economy grew only by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experters predict another drop of 1.5 percent for the Czech
economy this year.
</P>
<P>
Other macro-economic figures are not encouraging. The
unemployment rate in August reached a seven-year high at 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Because of a lack of capital, the country is expected to have a
budget deficit of 26.8 billion Korun (864 million U.S. dollars)
next year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, UN Agency Cooperate on Birth Spacing Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 16 (Xinhua)-- Myanmar has been cooperating
with a U.N. organization to make surveys on birth spacing as part
of the country's efforts to strengthen the program.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association (MMCWA) and
the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) are
jointly sponsoring a birth spacing course here, attended by MMCWA
members from 10 townships in the country's urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
As part of the country's birth spacing program implemented by
the Myanmar Health Department and funded by the UNFPA, the
Myanmar Population Department undertook the fertility and
reproductive health survey (FRHS) in 1997, the second country-wide
demographic survey, to produce reliable estimates of major survey
variables for the whole country, including both urban and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The first survey, population changes and fertility survey
(PCFS) which was conducted in 1991, showed Myanmar's fertility
rate standing at 3.5. But in the 1997 survey, it dropped to 2.8.
</P>
<P>
The contraceptive prevalence rate in the PCFS was 16.8 percent
and it has risen to 32.7 percent in the FRHS.
</P>
<P>
The MMCWA, a non-governmental organization formed in 1991, has
made significant progress in getting its more than 540,000 members
involved in activities such as providing health service to mothers
and children in urban and rural areas, reducing the death rate of
mothers and babies and conducting education on breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the infant and maternal mortality rates in Myanmar
were 48.6 and 1.7 per 1,000 births respectively.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's population is estimated to have reached 46.4 million
in the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, maintaining an
annual growth rate of 1.84 percent, according to official
statistics.

<HEADLINE> China's Pentathletes to Keep Dominance for years, German </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion
Hartmut Nienaber of German highly praised China's great
performances in the 46th Military Pentathlon World Championships
on Wednesday, saying China could stay atop in the sport for next
five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
"They had a high performance in the competition and broke
records. They did very well at home," said Nienaber, now the
German's team captain.
</P>
<P>
Nienaber, a ten-time winner of the military pentathlon worlds,
still holds two world records in the sport, which he set early in
1980s.
</P>
<P>
"China has lots of good competitors and could maintain the
dominance for next five to ten years, I think," Nienaber said.
</P>
<P>
China's Li Zhong and Yang Chunyi, winner and silver medalist
in the men's division respectively, were most impressed, Nienaber
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese has won four titles with one discipline left on
Wednesday and broke three world records in the championships
which of them have been televised by CCTV.
</P>
<P>
"Military pentathlon is a popular sport in the Chinese army,
but it's not the case in German," Nienaber said. "People there
know nothing about it and have no interest in the competition.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for European countries to catch up with China
or even beat them at least in recent years. But the sport will
have a big future," Nienaber continued.

<HEADLINE> Desert Oil Field Emerges As Oasis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Vegetables are growing and
greenery is expanding in the Taklimakan Desert, known as the "Sea
to Death."
</P>
<P>
The second largest shifting desert in the world, the Taklimakan
in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was instilled with life
following the exploration effort of the Tarim Oil Field started in
1989.
</P>
<P>
While oil and gas resources were being tapped, the experimental
growing of vegetables, fruits, and plants was also proving to be
successful, to the delight of tens of thousands of oil workers
from across the country who had settled there.
</P>
<P>
In the Tazhong Oil Field, in the heart of the desert, man-made
greenery has been expanded to 14 hectares. Also, three
greenhouses have been built producing high-yield tomatoes and
cucumbers by taking advantage of the underground water resources.
</P>
<P>
And along the roadside, a 1.2-kilometer long "green belt" has
emerged.
</P>
<P>
The improved environment is drawing the presence of birds and
animals such as the state-protected wild camel.
</P>
<P>
The local oil field authorities have spent a total of 420
million yuan (51 million U.S. dollars) over the past nine years to
protect this fragile environment.

<HEADLINE> Myanmarese Government Denies Detention of NLD Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmarese government
Tuesday further denied its detention of more members of the
National League for Democracy (NLD), an major opposition party
with Aung San Suu Kyi as its General Secretary.
</P>
<P>
An official Information Sheet quoted the Myanmarese embassy in
Washington as saying that "no NLD members have been arbitrarily
detained or charged with a crime in recent days."
</P>
<P>
"Some NLD members were recently invited to government guest
houses to discuss matters relating to the unlawful attempt of that
party to unilaterally convene a parliament," the embassy told the
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said in a statement issued the same day that the number
of its members detained since May 27 has gone up to 783, including
196 parliament representatives elected in the 1990 election, and
587 other party organizers.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 general election, participated by 93 political
parties, the NLD won 396 out of 485 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The NLD, after winning the election, has repeatedly demanded
the convening of a parliament elected in accordance with the then
Election Law, and on June 23 set a deadline for the ruling State
Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to hold the parliament within
60 days.
</P>
<P>
Receiving no response from the government on the expiry of the
deadline on August 21, the NLD declared its intention to convene
the parliament by itself in September.
</P>
<P>
According to the NLD, 61 parliament representatives-elect and
282 party organizers have so far been arrested after the party
made the declaration.

<HEADLINE> Bicycles Become New Kind of Garbage in Beijing, Students Find </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China has been called the
"Kingdom of Bicycles" because it has more bikes than any other
place in the world. However, the capital city of Beijing is now
rapidly becoming a garbage heap of bicycles.
</P>
<P>
Three local middle school students who are environmental
protection volunteers have found that there are now nearly 3
million abandoned bicycles scattered around the city's residential
areas, along the street sides, and at the corners of out-door
markets.
</P>
<P>
This means that one in four Beijingers has discarded an old
bike, turning it into iron garbage.
</P>
<P>
These bicycles become rotted and covered with dust, forgotten
by their owners, and even ignored by thieves since they are
useless.
</P>
<P>
"So many abandoned bicycles not only occupy a lot of space,
they are also unpleasant to the eyes and destructive to the
environment," said Wang Meng, Li Ying and Ai Yuning, three
students from the No. 2 Middle School Attached to the Beijing
Municipal Railway Administration.
</P>
<P>
They conducted their investigation of discarded bicycles during
this year's summer holidays at schools, research institutes,
residential areas and bicycle-storage locations in the western
district of downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They found that if the 3 million abandoned bicycles were
connected in one long chain, it would be 4,500 kilometers long,
nearly equal to the length of the Mekong River, the third longest
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Right now, there are no authoritative and accurate statistics
to prove whether they are right or wrong, but their discovery
might bring the issue to official attention.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is among the Chinese cities with the largest number of
bicycles, with around 7 million.
</P>
<P>
The three students also found that most people cannot find
places that collect old bikes, so they simply cast them aside.
</P>
<P>
The students suggested that some old bike parts could be used
for other purposes, and collection depots should be set up in
residential areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Bill to Try Violent 14-Year-Olds as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed a bill Tuesday night that would allow more
juveniles to be tried as adults for violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed by a 280-126 vote, also would renew federal
support for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
</P>
<P>
The juvenile crime provisions were attached to the legislation
to make it more likely that Congress to take final action on them
before adjourning for the year.
</P>
<P>
Democrats argued vigorously against the move, calling its
approach both irresponsible and hardhearted.
</P>
<P>
Representative William Clay, a Democrat, said the bill "would
result in... mandatory adult prosecution of 14-year-olds charged
with serious violent crimes."
</P>
<P>
But Republican supporters said it is time to teach youthful
offenders that their actions have serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
Representative Bill McCollum, a Republican, said juvenile
authorities are overwhelmed by caseloads while many young
offenders escape any kind of punishment. "It is extremely
important for us to recognize that we have a crisis in juvenile
crime today," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCollum said the bill is similar to a juvenile crime bill that
passed the House last year but stalled in the Senate to treat more
youth offenders as adults and urge states to do the same.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province Encouraging Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province is making new efforts to encourage overseas investors to
participate in its resource-based development.
</P>
<P>
The latest effort came when the provincial government recently
worked out a regulation granting additional preferential policies
to attract overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
A government official said that Qinghai is abundant in natural
resources such as oil, gas, water and salt lakes for potash
fertilizer, all of which are ready for exploration.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulation, preferential policies will be
given to export-oriented overseas-funded firms, high-tech
enterprises, enterprises involving agriculture and animal
husbandry, and such infrastructure projects as transportation,
energy, and communications.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises engaging in infrastructure
facilities and financial projects will be exempted from paying
fees for land use.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also makes it possible for overseas businesses
to invest in Qinghai in various ways such as joint-ventures,
purchasing, shareholding, and underwriting state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has asked governments at all levels
to improve the investment environment by completing approval
procedures for overseas-invested enterprises within ten business
days.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the regulation, during the January-July period
overseas investment soared to 10.3 times that of the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months this year, the province approved 15
overseas-invested enterprises, involving 196 million
U.S. dollars.

Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie will inaugurate Sabang and

He said the region will concentrate on three main industries:
manufacturing, tourism and fisheries.

The report quoted Iskandar, an official of the Aceh
administration, as saying that 47 memorandums of understanding had
been signed by the Sabang Development Authority and investors who
will become involved in the new industrial region.

<HEADLINE> Women Leader Says Clinton's Tryst Unacceptable, But Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
National Organization for Women said on Tuesday that U.S.
President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky at the White
House was "damaging to the work place" but was not sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's behavior "has an impact that cannot be ignored,"
Patricia Ireland told reporters at a briefing on the status of the
feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe this is his private life," Ireland said,
noting that the Clinton's trysts took place in a workplace
setting, with a significantly younger staff member. "What Clinton
has done, while not illegal, and not impeachable, nonetheless is
very damaging to the workplace."
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel's Kenneth Starr's report raised questions
about whether the president's statements were designed to cover up
activities that may have constituted sexual harassment. But the
report did not include sex harassment among the 11 possible
grounds for impeachment.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Contact Group Meeting on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
proposed on Tuesday that the "Contact Group" on former Yugoslavia
meet next week to impact a United Nations resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During 30-minute phone talks with his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin, Chirac expressed concerns over continued fighting in the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Worried about deteriorating conditions for people living in
Kosovo, he called for the Contact Group, of Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, to meet in New York.
</P>
<P>
As a spokesman said, Chirac was hopeful, after talks with
Yeltsin, of a U.N. resolution "to show the determination of the
international community to bring about an end to the fighting."
</P>
<P>
"France is renewing its efforts at the United Nations to get a
resolution (on Kosovo) adopted" in the near future, said the
spokesman with the president's office.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also briefed Yeltsin on his recent phone talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
saying that both leaders stressed the halt of fighting as a
precondition for reopening negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The strife in Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population are
ethnic Albanians, has killed at least 700 people and turned some
265,000 others to refugees since ethnic Albanian fighters started
a war of independence earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls for Restoration of Law, Order in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini Tuesday urged the political forces in Albania to
respect law and refrain from violence and threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
Dini, briefing an emergency session of the foreign affairs
committee of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, called on the
Albanian government to bring to justice the killers of a popular
opposition leader whose death sparked the unrest in the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
He said although Tirana returned to a semblance of normality
after two days of unrest, "the risk of a civil war in Albania is
ever present."
</P>
<P>
Dini said "no one" could replace an elected government and
parliament in maintaining law and order, adding that Albanian
President Rhxhep Mejdani could play a key role in reconciling the
conflicting factions.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Italian Prime Minister Rano Prodi
called Albania's Prime Minister Fatso Nano and opposition
leader Sali Berisha, saying Italy would not recognize "the result
of the exercise of violence as an instrument of political struggle
in Albania," according to Prodi's office.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes in Tirana were touched off by the weekend
slaying of a leading opposition deputy in parliament Azem Hajdari,
a close associate of former President Sali Berisha. At least three
people have been killed and 14 wounded in the past two days of
political protest and street violence.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Promotes Tourism on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
economic center, recently opened a website on the Internet to
promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai International Tourism, the third such site launched
on the Internet in China, after Hong Kong and Beijing, was
jointly initiated by the municipal organizing committee of the
Shanghai Tourism Festival, Shanghai Jiaotong University and the AST
computer center in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The site includes guides to scenic spots, tourist agents,
hotels, restaurants, shopping centers and recreational facilities
in the city.
</P>
<P>
The new web page highlights the Shanghai Tourism Festival which
will be held from October 17 to November 8.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the number of overseas tourists
coming to Shanghai in the first half of the year was 729,200, down
seven percent from the same period last year due apparently to the
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, the city has taken steps to attract outside
tourists by sending out 100 tourism promotion teams to other
countries, issuing 900,000 tourist guide brochures and video tapes
to overseas agents.
</P>
<P>
Local tourist agents have also created many new types of
tours enabling tourists to "be a Shanghainese for a day,"
"honeymoon in Shanghai" and "cross the millennium."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Iran, Afghanistan Refrain From Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
Tuesday urged Iran and Afghanistan to avoid military conflict as
the tensions between the two countries are rising and may erupt
into a cross-border war at any time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said, "We urge all the parties in the region to
respect international borders and to refrain from taking actions
which would inflame or enlarge the conflict."
</P>
<P>
When asked if the outbreak of war would raise the possibility
of U.S. involvement, he said, "I've never heard anybody suggest
that."
</P>
<P>
"The capabilities are clearly in place for this kind of
military action that we have been urging not to take place," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see actions that inflame or make the
situation worse nor actions by neighbors to interfere," Rubin
added.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking at the regular Defense Department briefing,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, "I do not have any
indication of imminent military action along that border."
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Afghanistan have massed troops on their common
border since the fundamentalist Taliban, in control of
Afghanistan, admitted Thursday to killing eight Iranian diplomats
and a journalist last month.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Tuesday called for nationwide demonstrations and put
its military and top civilian officials on full alert, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said that the United States understands the Iranian
government's anger over the killing of its diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"The inviolability of diplomats and diplomatic residences and
embassies is one of the oldest rules of a civilized society," he
said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's auto exports

MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' current
account deficit in the first half of this year dropped to 100
million U.S. dollars from 224 million dollars recorded in the
first five months of the year, according to the country's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
In a report published Wednesday, the Central Bank of the
Philippines attributed the sharp drop to the country's sustained
export growth.
</P>
<P>
"For the month of June alone, there was a current account
surplus, bringing the January-June current account in near
balance," Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials also clarified that the recent current
account deficit was only based on preliminary figures and that it
was possible the gap could be "lower than 100 million dollars."
</P>
<P>
Stronger inflow of dollar-denominated funds coming from foreign
borrowings during the period also contributed to the shrinking of
the country's current account, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Postpone Repayment of Loans to World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmarese government has
decided to postpone the repayment of loans to the World Bank (WB),
according to the official Information Sheet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The WB recently declared Myanmar ineligible for new loans
because it has not repaid the outstanding ones.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Myanmar embassy in Washington told the
Washington Post the postponement of the country's repayment will
last until the WB treats Myanmar like other members and resumes
lending.
</P>
<P>
The WB has suspended all loans to Myanmar since 1987, giving
the reason that Myanmar is unwilling to modify the highly
distortional economic policies that the bank concludes have
created an environment in which external aid resources could not
be efficiently utilized.
</P>
<P>
Complaining that even though it "has now opened its door and
the situation has changed, the bank has not revised its stand,"
Myanmar said "this is not due to technical difficulties between
the bank and the Myanmarese government but to the U.S. policy
blocking loans to Myanmar from all international financial
institutions, including the WB, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)."
</P>
<P>
The Information Sheet warned that "unilateral sanctions have
never been successful and the case of U.S. sanctions against
Myanmar is no different."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the slack, created by the departure of
U.S.investors, has been taken up by others from the ASEAN
(Association of South East Asian Nations) and Europe, and the
U.S. investment (582 million U.S. dollars) ranks only the fifth
among those in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar since May
1997, banning new U.S. investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. companies have reportedly begun withdrawing their
investments since 1996. Those already withdrawn include the
Pepsi-Cola, Eddie Bauer, Liz Claiborne and Texaco oil company.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Atlantic Richfields Oil Company of the
U.S. also decided in August to pull out in the near future.

JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has set up two
teams of experts consisting of its own staff and independent
consultants in a bid to clean up corruption in Indonesia,
especially that involving the bank's funds, national newspapers

</P>
<P>
The teams were scheduled to come here this week and next week

</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the World Bank has made mistakes in

managed, but we want to set the past behind us and make sure that
few mistakes are made in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first team from Washington, headed by the bank's regional
manager of its social development sector unit Katherine Marshall,
is already here to start inquiring into the issue of corruption in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Marshall expected the team to be able to define the corruption
problems in the country by the end of the week, and be ready to
propose subsequent steps to reduce graft over the next six to
12-month period.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping move to tackle corruption comes a month after the
Asian Wall Street Journal published details of a World Bank
internal memorandum which disclosed that more than 20 percent of
the bank's loans were believed to have been siphoned off by
Indonesian officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision
and State Administrative Reform Hartarto Sastrosoenarto encouraged
all elements in society to help the government root out graft by
providing any evidence they had of its existence.
</P>
<P>
"The government will protect those who come forward to report
corruption cases against retribution," he said, adding that it
would also protect the rights of those accused.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Support for Intervention in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
said on Tuesday that the conflict in Congo is among the most
dangerous in the world, and the United States is not helping any
of the country's neighbors to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Testifying at a hearing of the House International Relations
subcommittee, Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice for African
affairs called allegations of American involvement "a specious and
ridiculous accusation that I want to lay to rest once and for all."
</P>
<P>
"We share regional and international frustration with the
Kinshasa government's failures with respect to both
democratization and human rights," said Rice.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we have firmly expressed the United States'
conviction that foreign intervention to topple the government
of... Congo is not acceptable," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said the fighting "threatens regional stability, hampers
economic progress, endangers the lives of millions of people,
perpetuates human rights abuses and impedes the democratic
transformation of Africa's third largest country."
</P>
<P>
At the same hearing, Congo's ambassador to the United States,
Faida Mitifu, repeated her government's suspicion that the U.S.
tacitly approves the invasion of Congo by troops from Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this perception is not true," said the U.S.-educated
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Mitifu said, U.S. officials have a "lopsided view
of the hostilities," and she noted frequent pronouncements from
Washington of the right of Congo's neighbors to secure their
borders.
</P>
<P>
In outlining the U.S. position, Rice said all foreign troops
must leave Rwanda for a lasting resolution of the conflict and
repeated calls for an immediate cease-fire and negotiations by all
parties.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila says rebels trying to
overthrow him are backed by Rwanda and Uganda, which in May 1997
helped him oust dictator Mobuto Sese Seko. Rwanda and Uganda deny
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Also testifying at the hearing, Rwanda's ambassador, Theogene
Rudsingwa, insisted that his country is not involved in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador agreed all foreign troops should withdraw but
added that would not solve the problem of conflicts within the
Congo.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, the seventh
largest steel producer in the world, increases its steel imports
annually, the Brazilian Institute of Steel said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the institute as saying Tuesday that
steel imports are expected to rise from 377,000 tons in 1997 to
790,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
The institute reported that during the period of January to the
present, the national imports of steel products were up 46
percent from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Steel imports are equal to 5.2 percent of the country's total
steel production, but two years ago it was only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Brazil produces 25 million tons of steel every year, the
biggest one in Latin America and the seventh in the world.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's public debt was
up 28.83 percent in the first half of the year to a total of 912
billion pesos (about 91 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The hike, over that of last year, led to a rise in the debt
service, as world financial instability turned into high interest
rates, said the journal El Financiero on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a supplementary analysis, the journal said if the current
trend continues for the rest of the year, an extra debt service
cost of 1.167 billion dollars would occur to the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result, experts were quoted as saying, total foreign
indebtedness as a proportion of Mexico's gross domestic product
(GDP) would be likely to go to 30.1 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The proportion stood at 29.4 percent at the end of June.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States admitted
on Tuesday that concerns that the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) is developing a long-range missile capable of
reaching the U.S. are "significantly overstated."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin made the assessment in
response to media reports that the DPRK may be able to produce
missiles capable of traveling far enough to reach Alaska.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that U.S. experts have not concluded that
Pyongyang has the ability to threaten any part of the U.S., based
on the DPRK's capabilities demonstrated when it fired a rocket two
weeks ago.

<HEADLINE>   Jordan Accused of Breaking Contract Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan was
accused of breaking promise regarding a movie contract but the
Chicago Bulls star denied Tuesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
"When you make a promise and you commit to do something, you
must honor that promise," Dean Dickie, the plaintiff's lawyer,
told jurors during opening statements in Cook County Circuit
Court.
</P>
<P>
Jordan sat at the defense table Tuesday, using a back entrance
to the courtroom to avoid reporters and onlookers. He is to
testify next week in a case expected to last about a month.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 lawsuit filed by Heaven Corp. accuses Jordan of
backing out of the film "Heaven is a Playground" after signing a
1988 contract guaranteeing him 350,000 U.S. dollars plus 5
percent of the film's profits.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's lawyer, Frederick Sperling, said his client never
refused to appear and the contract was a preliminary agreement
that was not legally binding. He added that the producers told
Jordan a lie about financing and missed a deadline in that
regard. Jordan has countersued, seeking 4  million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sperling said producers Brian Fried and Keith Bank threatened
Jordan with "high-profile, destructive legal action" and were now
making good on that threat.
</P>
<P>
Spearling charged Heaven Corp and tried to get more money by
waiting to sue until after the Bulls had won two championships
and Jordan was established as a superstar, rather than bring it
when Jordan was less well-known.
</P>
<P>
"They made a hedge," Sperling said."They made the movie
without Michael Jordan and waited to see how it did."
</P>
<P>
The movie, with former Loyola Marymount basketball standout Bo
Kimble assuming Jordan's role, made 168,000 U.S. dollars at the
box office. Dickie said that with Jordan as the star, "We would
have today a movie that is a classic."
</P>
<P>
Heaven Corp. is seeking 16 million to 20 million U.S. dollars
in damages, which it says represents the profit it would have
made had Jordan appeared.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Kristin Folkl is the
first player assigned to Minnesota's expansion WNBA team,
according to a report here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Folkl, a forward of the 1997-98 All-Pac-10 first team, led
Stanford in scoring (18.9) and rebounding (9.2) last season.
</P>
<P>
"I like challenges," Folkl said. "I feel like all my life I've
been faced with one challenge or another. And I just see this as
a great opportunity to do some good and to be able to conquer
something that a lot of people never thought would come to
fruition."
</P>
<P>
Folkl signed a 3-year contract with the WNBA on April 28, but
she wasn't available to play in the 1998 season because of injury.
</P>
<P>
She also helped Stanford's volleyball team to win two
consecutive NCAA championships. She tore the anterior cruciate
ligament in her left knee in March, had surgery and decided to
pass up her remaining year at Stanford.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Olga Letyushova scored in
the 82nd minute as Russia played to a 2-2 draw with Brazil in the
women's U.S. Cup soccer series in Oneonta, New York, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, still fighting for a berth in next year's
Women's World Cup, nearly upset the South American champions in
the final minutes despite being overmatched for much of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
Letyushova scored the apparent game-winner on a long pass in
the 87th minute but it was disallowed when she was ruled offside.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is one of 10 teams already qualified for the 1999
Women's World Cup, which will be played in the United States from
June 19 through July 10.
</P>
<P>
Brazil took a 2-0 lead in the first half on goals by Pretinha.
</P>
<P>
Pretinha drove a left-footed shot high into the right corner
in the 25th minute on an assist from Roseli. She made it 2-0 at
the end of the first half after sending a long shot past Russian
keeper Svetlana Petko.
</P>
<P>
The Russians finally scored four minutes into the second half
when Natalia Barbashina rolled a soft shot past her on a feed
from Inna Grigorieva.
</P>
<P>
The series resumes on Friday in Rochester when Brazil plays
Mexico and the United States plays Russia.

<HEADLINE> Feyenoord, Villa and Brann Score Respective Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Feyenoord had a flying start
in the UEFA Cup when they defeated VFB Stuttgart 3-1 in the first
round, first leg match on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Feyenoord, clear at the top of the Dutch league after winning
their first four games, outgunned last season's Cup Winners' Cup
runners-up with Jon Dahl Tomasson and Jean-Paul van Gastel
scoring all their goals in the first half.
</P>
<P>
English league leaders Aston Villa did it the other way round
as they produced a remarkable late assault to beat visiting
Norwegian part-timers Stromsgodset 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Villa trailed 2-0 with seven minutes left but emerged
victorious as 18 year-old substitute Darius Vassell scored twice
in injury time.
</P>
<P>
Another Norwegian side Brann Bergen also went 2-0 up against
the odds but their defence stood firm to shock Werder Bremen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian side Parma produced a shock defeat when
they lost to Fenerbahce 1-0 in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
There were no such slips for fellow Italians AS Roma or
Liverpool, Monaco, Club Bruges and Real Sociedad, who all notched
up good away wins and look well-placed to advance.
</P>
<P>
In what always looked the tie of the round, in-form Feyenoord
went ahead in Stuttgart after 19 minutes through van Gastel and
doubled the lead two minutes later through Tomasson.
</P>
<P>
Fredi Bobic pulled one back for the Germans in the 31st minute
but seconds later Tomasson, who joined Feyenoord this summer
after a goal-shy season at Newcastle, outsprinted veteran
defender Thomas Berthold to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
The victory completed a great night for the Netherlands as
Willem II Tilburg and Vitesse Arnhem both notched up 3-0 home
wins over Dynamo Tblisi and AEK Athens respectively.
</P>
<P>
But there was more disappointment for Germany as Bremen were
embarrassed by Bergen.
</P>
<P>
Bremen are bottom of the Bundesliga with just one point from
four games and lost to goals in each half by Arne Vidar Moen and
Kjetil Lovvik.
</P>
<P>
Bayer Leverkusen, winners of this tournament in 1988, looked
on course to give the Germans some joy as they led Udinese throu
gh an early Ulf Kirsten goal.
</P>
<P>
But the Italians clinched a draw eight minutes from time
through Johan Walem.
</P>
<P>
Villa, quarter-finalists last season, were staring disaster in
the face as Anders Michelsen and Christer George had Stromsgodset
2-0 up after 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But Gary Charles reduced the deficit in the 83rd minute before
Vassell produced his heroics.
</P>
<P>
Parma were undone in Turkey by Romanian striker Viorel
Moldovan's 23rd minute header.
</P>
<P>
The Italians were not helped by a red card for midfielder Dino
Baggio after an hour and ended with nine men as defender Fabio
Cannavaro was sent off in injury time.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Rodriguez struck in the last minute to give Metz a vital
away goal in a 2-1 defeat against Crvena Zvezda (Red Star)
Belgrade and fellow French club Marseille needed an equaliser by
Eric Roy seven minutes from time to salvage a 2-2 draw at Sigma
Olomouc of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Monaco, however, cruised to a come-from-behind 3-1 away win
against Poland's LKS Lodz.
</P>
<P>
Bruges thumped Ujpest 5-0 in Hungary, despite having defender
Tjorven De Brul sent off in the 62nd minute.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians were already 4-0 up by then with goals by Edgaras
Jankauskas, Aleksander Ilic, Sven Vermant and Darko Anic. Elonja
Ekakia added the fifth in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool were also in fine form in Slovakia as they
overwhelmed Kosice 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Patrik Berger, Karlheinz Riedle and Michael Owen, with a
trademark run and shot, were on target.
</P>
<P>
Fellow English side Leeds scraped an unimpressive 1-0 home win
over Maritimo of Portugal thanks to Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink but
Blackburn lost 1-0 at home to Olympique Lyon, Pole Kacek Bak
striking a superb 25 meter goal four minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Second half goals by Francesco Totti and Dimitry Alenichev
gave Roma a 2-0 away win over Danish side Silkeborg while
Brazilian Edmundo scored twice as Fiorentina recovered from a
goal down and the dismissal of Italian defender Moreno Torricelli
to defeat Hajduk Split 2-1 in a match played in Bari.
</P>
<P>
In a good night for Spain, only Real Betis, 1-0 losers at
Vejle of Denmark, failed to win.
</P>
<P>
Real Sociedad triumphed 4-2 at Sparta Prague, Valencia won 4-3
at Steaua Bucharest in a thriller, Celta Vigo edged Romanians
Arges Pitesti 1-0 and Atletico Madrid beat Obilic of Yugoslavia
2-0.
</P>
<P>
There was also a good win for FC Zurich, 4-0 at home over
Anorthosis Famagusta, while Schalke 04, UEFA Cup winners in 1997,
struggled to a 1-0 home win over Slavia Prague.

<HEADLINE> NBA Postpones Referee Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The latest casualties of
the NBA lockout are the referee training camp and rookis
transition program, which were both postponed indefinitely on
Tuesday by the league.
</P>
<P>
A lack of progress between the NBA and the Player Association
in reaching a new collective bargaining agreement has resulted in
the postponements. The referee training camp was scheduled to
begin on September 25, while the rookie transition program was
set for September 20 to 23.
</P>
<P>
"Until we have a better idea of when the season start, there
is no point in conducting training camp for the referees or
holding a transition program for rookies, " said NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement comes five days after a preseason game
calling off between the Miami Heat and Israeli champion Maccabi
Elite TelAviv scheduled for October 12, marking the first
cancellation in league history.
</P>
<P>
The sides currently are awaiting a grievance ruling from
arbitrator John Feerick. The NBA Players Association filed a
salary grievance hours before the owners imposed a lockout on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The final briefs for the grievance hearing are due Friday and
Feerick has 30 days after that to render a decision. Although he
is expected to rule before that, the start of the 1998-99 season
is in serious jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Condemns Murder of Iran's Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
of the United Nations Tuesday strongly condemned the murder of
Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan by Taleban combatants.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council was briefed by a U.N.
official on the situation in Afghanistan. The Taleban, a military
faction in Afghanistan, is accused of killing nine of Iranian
diplomats when it captured the town of Mazar-i-Sharif on August 8,
1998.
</P>
<P>
In its presidential statement, the Security Council said the
murder is a crime committed in flagrant violation of international
law and despite repeated assurances by the Taleban leaders
guaranteeing the safety and security of the personnel of foreign
missions in Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its deepest condolences to the families
of the Iranian diplomats and to the government of Iran, and it
believed that this criminal act should be fully investigated with
participation of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The council demanded that the Taleban release other Iranians
detained in Afghanistan and ensure their safe and dignified
passage out of Afghanistan without further delay.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its deep concern at the escalating
military operations in Bamyan province and at reports of mass
killings of civilians in northern Afghanistan, and demanded that
the Taleban fully respect international humanitarian law and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The council called on all concerned to exercise the maximum
restraint and urged the parties, in particular the Taleban, to
take action in response to the strong concerns by the
international community, to stop fighting and resume negotiations
aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement of the conflict on the
basis of the relevant resolution of the General Assembly and of
the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Agree to Cooperate in Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
China have agreed to cooperate in military environmental
protection, realizing the importance of environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department and China's Defense Ministry issued
here Tuesday a joint statement, saying both sides are concerned
with the quality of the ecological environment, an issue of great
significance to national stability and security.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and visiting Zhang Wannian,
vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission, put their
signatures on the paper in the Pentagon Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Both sides "recognize the importance of the military's role in
environmental protection, including monitoring the environment and
eliminating the threat posed to the nations by environmental
degradation."
</P>
<P>
They are prepared to cooperate on the matter and intend to
exchange technical representative groups to study military
environmental protection, and intend to discuss signing a
technical document on exchange of relevant information.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as another step toward closer military-to-military
ties between the two countries. When Cohen visited Beijing in
January, both sides signed an agreement to avoid sea accident
through consultation.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony followed a meeting between Cohen and
General Zhang. Their discussions covered bilateral relations, the
Korea Peninsula and nuclear proliferation with focus on
military-to-military relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"During our productive meetings, we covered other ways to
deepen, to broaden, and to advance our military relationship,"
Cohen told a press conference in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources from both sides, they have agreed
to carry out sand table exercises on disaster relief and
humanitarian assistance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese ship will visit the United States in 1999 and conduct
a seminar on sea search and rescue, while each country is going to
allow the other to observe specific military exercises and both
sides have agreed to exchange some military students, beginning
with short course programs.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed that China will send a delegation to
Sandia National Laboratory's Cooperative Monitoring Center. "This
is going to allow the PLA (People's Liberation Army) delegation to
study ways to enhance measures to build security and confidence,"
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"These meetings allow frank dialogue on global and regional
security issues of mutual concern, and we are working together
where we can openly discuss issues of disagreement that arise as
well," he added.
</P>
<P>
General Zhang, who arrived here Monday afternoon at Cohen's
invitation and also appeared at the press conference, said that he
had come to the United States for implementation of the agreement
reached by the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and his American counterpart Bill Clinton
have exchanged visits in an eight-month period of time since last
October. They agreed to build a constructive strategic
relationship between the two countries on the threshold of the
next century. Military cooperation is an important part of it.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and the United States are countries that carry
considerable weight and shoulder major responsibilities in the
world. To maintain and develop a healthy and stable relationship
between our two countries is in the fundamental interests of our
two sides and conducive to peace and stability in the world,"
Zhang said.

support Niger's efforts to improve the efficiency of the public

African country will improve access to and the quality of services
in telecommunications, water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional

<HEADLINE> Canada's Task Force Gives Bank Mergers Conditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian government task
force said Tuesday that the proposed bank mergers "can be a valid
business strategy" but that the public interest should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no absolute ban on mergers among large banks,
insurance companies or other financial institutions," the task
force said in a report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"However, no such merger should take place if it is not
consistent with the public interest," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, four of Canada's six largest banks proposed
to merge into two, which could drastically change the landscape of
Canada's banking industry and the way Canadians bank.
</P>
<P>
The task force report will surely ignite another round of
fierce debate that pit consumer activists opposing the mergers
against the banks which argue they need mergers to face global
competition.
</P>
<P>
Canada's House of Common's finance committee is scheduled to
start hearings next week on the report. The Senate banking
committee will begin its own hearing the week after next.
</P>
<P>
Later this fall, the federal Competition Bureau and the
superintendent of Financial Institutions will turn over their
separate report to the government on whether the mergers should
proceed.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Paul Martin will have the final say on the
mergers. His decision is not expected to be made until early next
year.
</P>
<P>
"This government wants to make clear that no major bank merger
would be allowed to proceed without public hearings on that
specific merger proposal," Martin said in a statement after the
releasing of the report.
</P>
<P>
"This will guarantee that the people of Canada will have every
chance to be heard, because it is the interest of all Canadians
that will determine the final decision," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government set up the task force 20 months ago to
study the changing face of the country's banking industry. A total
of 124 recommendations were made by the group, including:
</P>
<P>
-- direct access to the payments system for life insurance
companies, mutual funds and investment dealers so they can provide
transactions services to Canadians;
</P>
<P>
-- the ability for banks to offer insurance and leasing to
their customers through their branches;
</P>
<P>
-- adoption of legislation to allow foreign banks to operate in
Canada through branches of their foreign parent.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Expresses Concern Over DPRK's Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
of the United Nations on Tuesday expressed concern over the
activities by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea involving
the test launch on August 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the informal consultation of the
Security Council, the current President of the Council Hans
Dahlgren of Sweden said the members of the Council were seriously
concerned over the test launch by DPRK which was carried out
without prior notification to the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dahlgren said the members of the Security Council considered
such activities by DPRK pose harm to the fishing and shipping
activities in the region and run counter to the promotion of
confidence among the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The President said the members of the Council appealed to DPRK
to refrain from the activities which could result in such
developments, and called on all the countries concerned in the
region to show restraints and refrain from any actions that may
lead to increased tension.
</P>
<P>
He said members of the Council recognized the legitimate rights
of any states to develop space programs for peaceful purposes.

<HEADLINE> Italy Views NATO Enlargement in Balkans Absolutely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Italy viewed NATO's
enlargement in South-Eastern Europe, and particularly in the
Balkans, as an "essential point in Europe's security prospects,"
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian defense minister, who arrived here Monday for a
three-day official visit, made the statement after a meeting with
his Romanian counterpart, Victor Babiuc.
</P>
<P>
The ways of developing bilateral cooperation between the
Romanian and Italian armies, the outlook of NATO's enlargement in
the second "wave" as well as the aspects of European and regional
security were the main topics approached within their official
talks.
</P>
<P>
Beniamino Andreatta said that Italy would back up the Romanian
army's development in many respects, as well as assist Romania in
its integration into the NATO structures. "We consider our
friendship with Romania as a cornerstone in the creation of a
security area in the Balkans," the Italian minister said, adding
that, however, Italy would not support Romania to the detriment of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Victor Babiuc said that as far as the Romanian-Italian military
cooperation was concerned, there was a possibility to update the
Romanian army with Italian assistance in the field of
transmission, air force, sea service and mountain corps.
</P>
<P>
Victor Babiuc also expressed his belief that Italy would back
up Romania's integration with NATO in the future because, "as
Beniamino Andreatta has lately stated, NATO's enlargement and
Romania's cooperation with the Alliance are of interest not only
to Romania but to Italy as well to an equal extent."
