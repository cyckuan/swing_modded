<HEADLINE> Price Decrease For China's Chemical Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The price of 92 of China's 120
major chemical products dropped in October, according to an
official report from the Ministry of Chemical industry (MCI),
while the prices of 24 moved upward, and four remained unchanged,
as compared January of this year.
</P>
<P>
The prices of 20 chemicals in October went up as compared with
the same month last year, and those of 98 declined and those of
two remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The report says that some 20 chemicals suffered a drop of more
than 20 percent compared with the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
China has raised the price of electricity, crude oil, refined
oil, coal, and transportation this year, which has adversely
affected the country's chemical industry, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The chemical industry is expected to pay an additional 9.2
billion yuan due to the price hike. The production costs of
caustic soda, calcium carbide, synthetic ammonia and fertilizer
have increased sharply, and some manufacturers are running in the
red.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Chemical Industry called on chemical
manufacturers to make an effort to adjust the product mix to
adjust to market needs, and promote sales in order to reach the
annual production target.

<HEADLINE> Iran Bans Women to Run for Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official said here
today only men can run for the presidential race scheduled for
next July.
</P>
<P>
The statement made by Habibullah Askaroladi, Secretary General
of the Islamic Coalition Society, at a press conference smashed
the dream of some Iranian women, such as President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's daughter Faezeh Hashemi, of being woman president in
the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Coalition Society is an organization with the
support of Iran's top leaders including Ayatollah Khamenei and
President Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Askaroladi said at the press conference held by the Ministry
of Culture and Islamic Guidance, "There is no ambiguity in the
Constitution. It specifies that men can become the president."
However, the Constitution did not specify the sex of the
candidate.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 65 million, Iran has more females than
males. Traditionally, women are required to stay at home and not
to hold any high political posts.
</P>
<P>
About one month ago, Faezeh Hashemi had openly called on the
Guardian Council to interpret Article 115 of the Constitution,
which spells out the conditions for running for the president's
office.
</P>
<P>
Faezeh Hashemi won the second highest votes just after
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri during the parliament
elections from March to April this year.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that there are a large number of people
who are sick of the religious role in the government
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that if the Islamic regime allows women to
run for the presidential race, Rafsanjani's daughter would give
Nateq-Nouri a grave challenge and has the possibility of winning
the 7th presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the political upheaval, the Islamic regime simply
does not allow women to compete for the post of
presidency. Iran's Guardian Council did not pay any heed to the
call raised by Faezeh Hashemi.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Foreign Investment Up For January to October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China's largest economic
center had 9.08 billion US dollars in foreign investment in the
first ten months of this year, up seven percentage points on a
year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai approved a total of 1,814 foreign-funded projects
invested by 46 countries and regions in the ten-month period, the
municipal foreign trade committee told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The investment for each project on average stood at five
million US dollars, compared with less than 3.5 million US dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
Overseas business people poured most funds into large
industrial projects, which account for 41 percent in amount of
funds and more than 61 percent of the total in number, according
to a spokesman for the committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee has been listing large industrial projects as a
key area to lure foreign investment, as the projects play an
important role in Shanghai's modernization effort, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that real estate, commerce and transportation
projects followed large industrial projects to obtain a certain
ratio of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Japan has become the second largest
investor only after Hongkong. Japanese business people invested
288 projects in Shanghai from January to October, involving a
contractual investment of 1.47 billion US dollars, up 30 percent
from last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The municipality reports a combined 43.34 billion US dollars of
foreign investment by the end of last month by business people
from 72 countries and regions, involving a total of 15,400
projects, statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Rapped for Discrediting Algerian Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today was severely criticized by El Watan, one of the biggest
independent daily newspapers in Algeria, for "discrediting the
Algerian Revolution" of 1954-1962.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, El Watan said that "at the moment when Algeria
makes praiseworthy efforts to relaunch its diplomacy in order to
avoid the snare of isolation, it is strange to hear some French
voices, official or not, rising with a rare resentment to
discredit the Algerian Revolution."
</P>
<P>
Chirac, a former army officer who fought in the Algerian War,
inaugurated on November 11 a monument "in homage to all those who
served France until 1962, in Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria."
</P>
<P>
"Among those voices, that of President Chirac himself has
belittled the glorious movement of people's resistance, which has
turned the world up-side-down, to a sheer fratricide in which the
Mujahidins were terrorists and the colonial inhabitants victims,"
said the commentary entitled "Discredit," seen here today.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech in memory of the Algerian War dead, Chirac
recalled "the importance and richness of the work that France
accomplished down there (in Algeria) and of which it is proud."
</P>
<P>
He also called on people to remember "the sacrifices" the
former French colonial population in Algeria made at the end of
the Algerian War, when hundreds of thousands of French people
returned to France without jobs and houses.
</P>
<P>
The Algerians gained independence in 1962 after driving French
colonists out of their country.

<HEADLINE> Russia's "Mars-96" Probe Crashes Into Pacific Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Mars-96 space probe
crashed into the Pacific Ocean today just hours after lifting off
on a 10-month 300 million U.S.-dollar mission to Mars, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The probe, launched on Saturday night from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, failed to break out of Earth's orbit
after a problem with the booster designed to set it on course for
Mars, Russian mission controllers said.
</P>
<P>
The craft, which was carrying four canisters of deadly
radioactive plutonium, disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth's
atmosphere. But Russian space officials said the canisters could
resist the impact of re-entry and a crash and that there was no
danger.
</P>
<P>
The space probe was designed and built by Russia in cooperation
with other 22 countries including the United States and the
European Space Agency who had invested 180 million dollars in
putting scientific equipment on board.
</P>
<P>
The "Mars-96" planned to reach Mars in September 1997, to study
the surface of the planet, its atmosphere, internal structure and
its near-planet plasma.

<HEADLINE> Belarussian Premier Threatens to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Prime Minister
Mikhail Chigiry today threatened to resign unless President
Alexander Lukashenko cancels next Sunday's referendum aimed at
increasing his powers, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy speaker of the parliament Gennady Karpenko was quoted as
saying, "He (Chigiry) will resign if the president continues his
course of confrontation with parliament, if the measures proposed
by the premier to take Belarus out of the crisis are not
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Chigiry has set the president economic and political
conditions, including cancelling the referendum."
</P>
<P>
Chigiry neither confirmed nor denied he had resigned. But a
governmental official said, on condition of anonymity, that
Chigiry had taken the decision days ago.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko was given the news by telephone in the town of
Gomel, near the Ukrainian border, where he is on a one-day tour
drumming up support for the controversial referendum on November
24.
</P>
<P>
The president has been at loggerheads with parliament for some
time over his plans for a referendum which would amend the
constitution and give him more power.
</P>
<P>
The amendments would allow him to recommence his five year term
of office from the day of the referendum, effectively extending it
by more than two years. They would also give him the power to
appoint half the electoral commission and name part of a new,
upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
But many deputies in parliament have opposed Lukashenko's
plans, claiming he is becoming more and more authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
On November 5, Lukashenko overturned decisions by parliament
and the constitutional court to prevent him from boosting his
powers through the referendum. He said that he would only need
the people's support in the November 24 referendum to extend his
term of office.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko also threatened to dissolve the legislature and the
court if they continued to oppose him.
</P>
<P>
Chigiry was named prime minister by Lukashenko after the
president won a landslide victory in the general election in July
1994.
</P>
<P>
His resignation, if it happens, would be the latest in a series
of ministerial resignations over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko is expected to announce his decision over the threat
after his return to Minsk later today.

HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African

Addressing a SADC seminar on standards and certification,
Director of the SADC Industry and Trade Coordination Division

He said trade liberalization gave rise to various quality
problems and that these should be handled with great caution by
all legislators and quality enforcers.
</P>
<P>
Quality is very important to assure competitiveness of
enterprises and trade of goods among SADC countries and between
the region and the rest of the world, he said.

The seminar is the fore-runner to the four-day SADC regional
conference on quality which starts on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prisons Adopt Psychological Testing and Treatment  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A new psychological test that
is given to every new inmate at the No.1 Prison of east China's
Zhejiang Province asks questions such as: "Do you consider what
you are doing before you act?", "Do you like to work under
pressure?", and "Do you feel unhappy to see children or animals
being tortured?"
</P>
<P>
The prison, which is located in the city of Quzhou, in
southwest Zhejiang, now has more than 2,700 inmates, most of whom
have prison sentences of more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In January, 1995, the prison purchased four computers, and
began running psychological tests on all its inmates, using
software developed by professors from the Provincial Psychiatric
Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
Inmate have to answer over 140 yes-or-no questions, and the
answers are fed into the computer, to establish a personality and
psychological profile.
</P>
<P>
"The psychological test not only provides reference for our
work in rehabilitating criminals, but also gives a more scientific
basis to the abstract term 'ideological education'," Zheng
Ronghua, warden of the prison, explains.
</P>
<P>
Psychological testing is important to the prison, since most
inmates have fragile and rapidly-changing psychological conditions
because of long prison terms, Zheng noted.
</P>
<P>
During the prison's first testing, a warder discovered that one
of the inmates under his supervision had strong suicidal
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
"When I went to try to persuade him to give up the silly idea,
he was in the process of writing a will in his cell," the warder
recalled.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Ministry of Justice's call to build "modern
and civilized prisons", many Chinese prisons in recent years have
established a system of psychological testing and treatment for
their inmates.

<P>
The No.1 Prison of east China's Shandong Province, in the
provincial capital of Jinan, went one step further by opening
psychological consultations, run now by a persaon with a master's
degree in psychology.
</P>
<P>
"When consultations started in 1993, the inmates regarded it as
something new and fresh, but few would try," recalled Li
Zhengtian, 56, one of the psychologists, who has been with the
prison for several decades, and has extensive knowledge of
inmates' psychology.
</P>
<P>
"To gain their trust, we tried our best to set up an intimate
relationship between friends, and stress the protection of
privacy," Li said.
</P>
<P>
By now, he and his colleagues have seen some 400 inmates
seeking psychological help. The consultation covers various
aspects, ranging from interpersonal relationships to marriage and
family problems.
</P>
<P>
Some prison authorities believe that psychometrics can help
manage and reform jailed criminals, and have even wider
applications.
</P>
<P>
"Psychological testing can help us obtain first-hand
information for research on criminal psychology," said Zheng
Ronghua, warden of the Zhejiang No.1 Prison.
</P>
<P>
It can also serve as reference for prison authorities to decide
whether to reduce a prisoner sentence or parole him, he added.
</P>
<P>
To complete its psychological testing and treatment system, the
prison has sent a dozen warders to study psychology in colleges
and universities in Beijing and Xi'an, the capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"We have also invited professors from the Provincial
Psychiatric Hospital to our prison to give lectures to staff
members," Zheng added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today promised that new general elections will be held on
February 3, 1997 without any postponement.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference attended by all Islamabad-based
foreign correspondents at the Presidential House this evening,
Leghari said, "nothing will come in the way of holding the general
elections."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ensure free and fair polls, foreign observers will
be invited and the election commission will be strengthened, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Leghari dissolved the National Assembly and the government led
by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on November 5, declaring
that new general elections will be held in 90 days according to
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, local media doubted the punctuality of holding polls
as the accountability process launched by the caretaker government
and the possible census might put off the polls naturally.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said at the press conference that the accountability
process and the elections will not affect each other.
</P>
<P>
"The elections will be held on time and the accountability
process will go on after the elections," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "the accountability is free of any influence inside
and outside the government."
</P>
<P>
A three-member election commission including judges from the
Supreme Court and Provincial High Courts will be set up, he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Leghari said, "census is nothing to do
with the polls."
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that we need census badly, but it is not
possible for a caretaker government to take a census in three
months," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the new government elected from the
polls next year will take a census in the future.

ATHENS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today urged the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement

participation in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),
stressing that the responsibility lay with all the members of the
party.
</P>
<P>
According to Simitis, the 1997 budget was based on five major
points: the abolition of all unjustified tax breaks; measures to
control and contain spending in the wider public sector and public
organizations; raising an extra 900 billion drachmas (3.9 billion
U.S. dollars) in revenues so as to reduce the public debt from 7.6
percent of gdp to 4.2 percent; drastically reduced public sector
appointments; and a 30 percent increase in spending on the public
investment program.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is expected to give the final approval to the
budget Tuesday before presenting it to parliament at the end of
the month.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe may not meet its
annual beef export quota of 9,100 tonnes to the lucrative market
of the European Union due to a severe shortage of slaughter
stock.

Lawrence Masanga, Chief Executive of the Cold Storage Company,

<HEADLINE> Zambian Firm to Increase Copper Rod Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Metal fabrications of Zambia
(ZAMEFA), the number one copper rod producer in the region, is
schemed to modernize its plant machinery at the cost of 2.2
billion Kwacha (1.76 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
ZAMEFA Chief Executive Robert Harrington told the local press
at the weekend in Luanshya, Copperbelt Province, "we expect to
replace old plant machinery by next year to enable us to compete
favorably on the continent."
</P>
<P>
Harrington said that there is need for an extensive
capitalization of machinery to meet market demands for local and
export markets.
</P>
<P>
ZAMEFA has been awarded an International Standards
Organization (ISO) 9002 Certification in appreciation of its high
quality products.
</P>
<P>
ZAMEFA's main markets are Namibia, Botswana, South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Malawi, Britain, Pakistan and India. It has exported
1,000 tons of copper rods to Egypt this year and is expecting
more orders from that northern African country.

<HEADLINE> Strikes Dampen Zimbabwe's Business Optimism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber
of Commerce (ZNCC) said today business optimism is low for this
time of the year, as part of the effects of the prolonged
industrial actions by junior doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
ZNCC President Danny Meyer said the month-old strike came
barely two months after another mass action by civil servants
which paralysed government services. It had dampened morale in
the country, with companies in the pharmaceutical industry being
the worst afflicted, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Morale seems to be on the low side. I guess partly because of
the industrial actions by nurses and doctors. Therefore, we might
end the year not on a high note as expected," Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
"What this calls is for the urgent formation of broad-based
national consultative council of the private and public sectors
as well as the labour movement to solve or anticipate some of
these problems we are facing," according to the ZNCC president.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for End to Discrimination Against Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
official today advocated making discrimination on the grounds of
disability unlawful.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner for employment and social
affairs, made the appeal at a conference organized by the EU
presidency in Cork of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has proposed to encourage a policy of
dialogue between the member states by establishing a high level
group -- a forum to enable a genuine exchange of views, aided by
an observatory on disability.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the commission will try and reflect the equal
opportunities ideal in its own internal recruitment and employment
strategies.
</P>
<P>
Flynn stressed, "The disability perspective must be taken on
board in all areas of policy-making."
</P>
<P>
The Structural Funds, in particular the Social Fund, are the
main financial instruments at European level for improving the
situation of people with disabilities.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Vote in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The general elections are held
in peace today in Zambia with people all over the country going
to polling stations to choose a new-term president and 150
members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
There are all together five candidates, including President
Frederick Chiluba, running for the presidency while 606
candidates are contesting the 150 mp seats.
</P>
<P>
Voting started at 6:00 hours a.m. (local time) and is
scheduled to complete at 17:00 p.m.. Most of the polling stations
are located in schools and public facilities with a small number
in temporary huts in some constituencies.
</P>
<P>
In Lusaka Primary School and other polling stations in the
capital, the correspondent saw people queuing up to collect their
votes and then marking and casting them into vote boxes. Election
officials, policemen and monitors are there to run the operation
and maintain law and order. So far there are no reports of
violence.
</P>
<P>
In his brief introduction to Xinhua, the Electoral Commission
Chairman, Judge Bobby Bwalya, said that the five presidential
candidates were recommended by five political parties while the
parliamentary candidates came from 11 political parties or were
independent personnel.
</P>
<P>
Seven political parties have announced their boycott to the
elections because of controversy over the clauses in the 1996
Constitution and other national regulations about the elections.
</P>
<P>
Former president Kennith Kaunda, current leader of the major
opposition party -- the United National Independence Party
(UNIP), did not run for the presidency as his parents were
immigrants from Malawi. The new constitution stipulates that only
the second indigenous generation Zambians are qualified to be the
head of state. This is the main reason that the UNIP decided to
boycott the elections.

<HEADLINE> US Inmates Riot for Jail Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- All 635 prisoners in the
Durago Jail in Arizona were temporarily transferred to other
county jails today after a Sunday riot in the jail by hundreds
of inmates angered by jail conditions.
</P>
<P>
About 300 to 400 inmates were involved in the riot, which began
at 1:50 p.m. and lasted until 4:45 p.m., an Associated Press
report said.
</P>
<P>
Inmates armed themselves with Molotov cocktails and tent poles,
broke control tower windows and held 11 guards as hostages for
hours.
</P>
<P>
The riot began after a guard squirted pepper spray at a
prisoner using bathroom without permission, the inmates claimed,
but guards said it started when they tried to separate two inmates
who were fighting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 police lined the jail, some in full camouflage
riot gear and carrying shotguns after the riot began. The
situation was under control and the hostages were freed after
Sheriff Joe Arpaio agreed to hold meetings with the inmates.
</P>
<P>
Inmates complained about inadequate medical care, guard
brutality, bad food and the discomfort of living in the tents.
</P>
<P>
"We've been concerned that there might be such a riot because
of overcrowding," Rick Romley, Maricopa county attorney, was
quoted as saying. "There have been too many complaints out there."

<HEADLINE> Human Fossils Discovered in Northern Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Remains of human fossils
dated 2.33 million years ago have been discovered at Hadar in
northern Ethiopia's Afar Badlands, the Ethiopian News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said an upper jaw of early homo, the genus to which
modern humans belong, has been recovered with primitive stone
tools.
</P>
<P>
The fossil and stone tools were discovered on the surface of a
barren hill near a dry stream bed by an international team of
scientists comprising Americans, Ethiopians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted scientists as saying that the remains may
hold clues to the ancestry of living humans and they also
represent the oldest family dated association of stone tools with
a fossil human ancestor.
</P>
<P>
The short, flat snout and broad, parabolic dental
arch link the fossil to geologically younger ancestors of modern
humans, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The find lacks the long, narrow palate and projecting face
that gives the a. afarensis skull its apelike visage but is
400,000 years older than the next oldest, securely dated fossil
jaws belonging to the homo lineage, which were discovered at
Olduva Gorge, Tanzania, and Koobi fora of Kenya in the 1960s and
1970s, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Hadar is the famous home of Lucy, the most complete example of
the small brained, big jawed, upright walking australopithecus
afarensis, which is not known to have made stone tools.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming
majority of the Security Council members support reelection of
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali despite U.S.
opposition, according to diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council started informal consultations on election
of secretary-general today. The term of the current
secretary-general will expire on December 31.
</P>
<P>
Before the consultations, Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun told
the press that China understands and supports the position of the
Organization of African Unity that Africa has the right to get
another term of secretary-general and recommends reelection of
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that China positively evaluates Boutros-Ghali's
efforts to strengthen the U.N.'s role during his service. China
supports the rational recommendation of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that during the first session of
consultations this morning, Qin stressed that Africa has over 50
countries, accounting for nearly one-third of the U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
"As Africa enters a new historical period of peace, stability
and development, it will help the rest of the world understand
Africa and facilitate Africa to make greater contributions to the
world when an African holds the office of secretary-general
continuously. The international community should sympathize and
support Africa's wish and position on this issue," he said.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Reaffirms Support for Nominating Ghali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid affirmed that there is Arab backing
and support for nominating Boutros Boutros Ghali as
U.N. Secretary General for another term.
</P>
<P>
This came in an interview published by the Saudi Arabian
newspaper Okath today.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid added that he met with Arab representative to the
U.N. on the sidelines of meetings of the current session of the
UN General Assembly, and that an Arab decision was made to back
the renomination of Ghali and to contact all parties with the aim
of gathering support for him.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid pointed out that Arab countries are contacting
the U.S. about the matter through other states.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the possibility of the
U.S. softening its position on renominating Ghali, the Arab
League secretary general said that it is difficult at present to
make prediction, because Washington still adheres to its hardline
attitude which rejects renominating Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Ghali has formally nominated himself as U.N. Secretary
General for a second term, but the U.S. is currently seeking to
prevent him from succeeding in the nomination.

The Lions kept the lead before the half break, and Rone
equalised the score at 57-57 with ten minutes into the second half
through two three-pointers.

But the Lions, awaked from dreams, began their scoring spree,
went ahead to 80-66 on a 17-2 run nine minutes into the second

<HEADLINE> WEU Nations Ready to Step Up Humanitarian Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSTENDE (BELGIUM), November 19 (Xinhua) -- Countries of the
Western European Union (WEU) today called for an international
conference under the auspices of the United Nations to deal with
the continuing humanitarian crisis in the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by foreign and defense ministers of the WEU
when they met here at their Ministerial Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
After devoting an important part of their one-day meeting to
analyzing the situation in Zaire and Rwanda, the ministers
stressed the readiness of WEU nations to step up their
humanitarian aid in order to cover the immediate needs of the
returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stated in a declaration that "the massive return
of hundreds of thousands of refugees during the recent days may
open the way to the necessary long-term solution of the deeper
causes of the present crisis."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they called on the Rwandan government to seize the
opportunity to restore confidence and contribute to a political
solution by facilitating the return of the refugees and securing
their resettlement in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the WEU ministers welcomed the adoption of
U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning the establishment of
a temporary multinational force to facilitate the immediate return
of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery of
humanitarian aid to alleviate the suffering of the refugees in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The ministers held an exchange of views on the evolution of the
situation in the Great Lakes Region and the provisions under
consideration concerning the contributions of WEU countries to
implementation of the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
They also tasked the WEU Permanent Council to continue to
monitor the situation closely and to examine what consequences the
rapidly changing situation on the ground might have on the options
for possible WEU involvement.

<HEADLINE> US Achieves Little Progress Towards Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. bipartisan panel
report warned that the United States as a whole has made little
progress in reaching its eight goals of national education for the
year 2000, although some states have done a better job.
</P>
<P>
"At our present rate of progress, we're not going to make it,"
said Ken Nelson, executive director of the National Education
Goals Panel. "We have to escalate our commitment to it."
</P>
<P>
The "Goals 2000" was drawn after President Bush and the
governors held an education summit in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The goals include: all U.S. children will start school ready to
learn; the high school graduation rate will be 90 percent or
higher; students will leave grades 4, 8 and 12 having shown
competency over challenging subject matter; U.S. students will be
the first in the world in math and science; every American adult
will be literate; schools will be free of drugs, guns and
violence; schools will promote partnerships with parents; and
teachers will be able to access professional development.
</P>
<P>
The panel, set up to track the progress, said that since 1990,
the nation has scored higher marks on five of more than 20
indicators set up to measure performance toward "Goals 2000."
</P>
<P>
It noted that the fourth- and eight-graders are doing better in
math; there are fewer threats and injuries to students at school;
family reading is more prevalent; infant health has been improved;
and more students are getting math and science degrees.
</P>
<P>
But, national performance has declined on eight of the
indicators, including reading at grade 12, teacher preparation and
participation in adult education.
</P>
<P>
However the panel found that in some states, progress has been

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force Leader in Kigali to Evaluate Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The head of the multinational
force to be deployed in war-torn Zaire held talks today with
Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame, who is opposed to foreign
intervention in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Canadian General Maurice Baril arrived in the Rwandan capital
Kigali today to evaluate the objectives of the proposed
humanitarian mission to get aid to over one million Rwandan and
Burundian refugees trapped in the conflict between Zairean
government forces and ethnic Tutsi rebels, said the Agence France
Presse (AFP) news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led Rwandan government, deeply suspicious of the
intentions of the international community, does not want an
international force sent to the region.
</P>
<P>
It has gone out of its way to speed the return home of Rwandan
Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire, relaxing security at border posts
and dropping plans to register the returnees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) said that 500,000 Rwandan refugees have already returned
home and refugees are continuing to enter Rwanda's Gisenyi border
area by the thousands today.
</P>
<P>
The countries participating in the Canadian-led humanitarian
force in eastern Zaire had planned to hold a meeting on Wednesday
in Stuttgart, Germany, to re-evaluate the necessity for such an
intervention following the mass return of refugees. But the
U.S. military said Monday the meeting had been rescheduled to
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But France is insisting on the deployment of the multinational
force, while the United States and some other Western countries
have begun to waver over the project.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, currently visiting Japan, said
today that intervention was above all necessary to assure
humanitarian aid to refugees.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright,
said on Monday that her country could limit its participation to
"a logistic support to assure ourselves that the humanitarian aid
is sent in a correct way."
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said today in Geneva
that thousands of refugees were entering Rwanda "in a relatively
good shape."
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 former military men of the Rwandan Hutu army and
Hutu militias as well as their families have reportedly fled
westward from Mugunga refugee camp, 15 kilometers from the Zairean
border town of Goma, further into Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"They are those who we wanted to separate from the population
of refugees. In the past two years, they have prevented the
refugees from returning home," AFP quoted Berthiaume as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than a million Hutus fled Rwanda in mid-1994 after a rebel
Tutsi army overran the country following the genocide of Tutsis by
Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
Fearing reprisals if they returned home, and terrified of the
armed Hutu militants in their midst, the refugees stayed in their
camps until an onslaught last month by Zairean rebels, including
many Tutsis, forced the extremists to flee.

<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said
China's long-term policy toward Russia is one of developing
bilateral ties of good-neighborliness and friendship, equality and
trust, mutually-beneficial cooperation, and common development
during his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov
here today.
</P>
<P>
Primakov forwarded a letter from President Boris Yeltsin to
Jiang, who said he agreed with President Yeltsin's statement that
China and Russia should make joint efforts to advance the
bilateral friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that President Yeltsin has made a major contribution
to the smooth growth of Sino-Russian relations and has been very
friendly to China and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said he has built good personal relationship with Yeltsin,
and that he had congratulated Yeltsin on his successful heart
operation. He asked Primakov to convey his best regards to Yeltsin
and wished Yeltsin an early recovery. He also said that he is also
looking forward to meeting with Yeltsin again.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that Sino-Russian relations have become better and
better in recent years, and that the decision announced by Jiang
and Yeltsin in April this year on establishing a strategic
partnership of coordination between China and Russia has drawn
positive response internationally. The partnership conforms to the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, Jiang said, and that
China's stance on this will never change.
</P>
<P>
Primakov described his talks on Monday with his Chinese
counterpart Qian Qichen as "having substantial contents and
significant" and said President Yeltsin is looking forward to
Jiang's visit next spring, which will be crowned with success, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said increased coordination between China and Russia on
the basis of friendship and good-neighborliness, mutual trust, and
a commitment to establishing a just and rational new international
political and economic order, is of great importance to the peace
and development of the post cold war world.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia should safeguard their independence,
sovereignty, and national dignity, and maintain their due equal
status and proper interests internationally, so as to help

<HEADLINE> World Economic Forum Highlights East Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The economy in East Asia has
been in the limelight at the ongoing Europe/East Asia conference,
sponsored by the World Economic Forum here in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At the morning plenary session on "The East Asia Dynamo: Toward
Slower Growth or Just a Pause?" today, panelists shared their
insight into the current economic slowdown in many East Asian
economies. They reached a remarkably similar conclusion that the
slowdown is due to cyclical and overlapping structural problems.
</P>
<P>
Many economies in the region has seen their GDP growth scale
down from the whooping double-digit rates over the previous years
to forecast figures of below 9 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The current difficulties are due to structural and cyclical
problems, according to Kenneth Courtis, strategist and chief
economist of Deutsche Bank Group Asia.
</P>
<P>
Manu Bhaskaran, director of Crosby Securities, listed three
reasons -- measures taken by governments to cool down overheated
economies, a contraction in world import demand and for some
countries, the disproportionate dependence on electronic exports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, East Asia is facing many challenges, such as
environmental issues, said Gautam Kaji, managing director of the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
But these panelists believed that the current slowdown is only
a necessary pause to prepare East Asia for the next phase of
economic expansion. The German bank expert cited two long-term
factors fueling regional economic growth: demographic expansion
and productivity. They added that the upcoming cycle may be a
locomotive to power the global economy into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Plenary sessions focusing on individual economies in East Asia,
including China, Japan and Hong Kong, drew wide attention at the
World Economic Forum regional meeting today. The booming consumer
market in Asia, business partnership between Asia and Europe and
sustained growth in Asia were also hot topics.

by the DPRK people in building socialism and in their struggle
against natural disasters.
</P>
<P>

ethical and cultural progress, Wu said China has embarked on a
correct road to development after it introduced reform and
opening-up 18 years ago.
</P>

correctness of Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening-up policy and
the superiority of the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yo Ung said that his visit is aimed at enhancing exchanges
with Chinese colleagues, and to acquaint themselves with the
economic achievements that China has scored, including those in

<P>
GENEVA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic Hutu refugees who have
recently returned to Rwanda from war-torn eastern Zaire have been
well-treated and none have so far been arrested by the Tutsi-led
authorities, the United Nations said today.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokeswoman in Geneva Therese Gastaut told a press
briefing that the human rights of the returnees have been
respected. The Rwandan government has given assurances that any
arrests would be made by representatives of the authorities after
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has also indicated that current
occupants of houses originally belonging to returnees should
return the houses within 15 days. Other sources have said that
about seven to 10 percent of the houses of refugees are being
occupied by other people.
</P>
<P>
U.N. refugee agency data showed that an estimated 5,000
refugees have already returned to Rwanda from their camps in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The agency's press official, Christiane Berthiaume, said
Tuesday that her agency has provided the returnees with relief
aid, including food, blankets, plastic sheetings, seeds, and farm
tools.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) Tuesday told reporters that
over the past four days, it has registered 3,500 unaccompanied
children in the Rwandan border area, 600 of whom have now been
reunited with their families. Some 700 of the children were from

MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Estonia will play a World Cup
qualifier re-match against Scotland on February 11 in Cyprus, a
top official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Tallinn, Estonia, said Sulev Pohlak, member of the
Estonian Football Association, has got acceptances from concerned
sides for the rematch.
</P>
<P>
Estonia was originally to play its home game in European group
four against Scotland on October 9, but the game was rescheduled
to kick off three hours in advance.
</P>
<P>
As no Estonian footers turned up, the referee blew the final
whistle after three seconds.
</P>
<P>
At first, Scotland was awarded a 3-0 win, but soccer's world
ruling body FIFA ruled later for a replay, saying the Estonians
were not given enough warning about the earlier time.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Estonia may play the re-match in Tallinn, but they
prefer Cyprus as the venue since they will be training on the
island at the time when cold weather prevails in Tallinn.

<HEADLINE> China's Securities Watchdog Metes Out Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Securities Regulatory
Commission (SRC) fined two stock dealers earlier this month, the
Haitong Securities Company Ltd. and Shenzhen Development Bank,
which had broken state regulations in their trading.
</P>
<P>
They had to pay a penalty of five percent on overdrawn amounts,
and those involved in the illegal trading were given
administrative sanctions. The commission says that China will
penalize any overdrafts to safeguard the country's securities
market.
</P>
<P>
A handful of local stock dealers must be sanctioned for their
illegal activities and the penalties meted out to the two
companies show that the SRC is determined to maintain controls and
to catch those who break the law.
</P>
<P>
The SRC said it hopes all local securities dealers learn a
lesson from this and abide by the law.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Opens Peace Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today inaugurated the first stage of the al-Salam (peace) Canal,
that is to transport Nile water across the Suez Canal to the
sun-drenched Sinai peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Mubarak hailed the canal as
the lifeline of Sinai, saying that its creation would greatly
benefit the Egyptian citizens at large.
</P>
<P>
"Jobs will be provided by the companies that will acquire
agricultural lands in the area," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The Salam Canal, whose construction is divided into two stages,
is to irrigate up to 620,000 feddans (260,400 hectares) of
land and run through six governorates. The first stage of the
project will cover 220,000 feddans west of the canal.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at fostering Egypt's agricultural programs
by expanding arable land to increase production, lower the
dependence on food imports and step up exports of fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
It is also to make use of the agricultural waste water which
was dumped into the sea. The redistribution of water in Sinai will
help ease the pressure on the densely populated areas.
</P>
<P>
The president said besides the Salam Canal, the government
seeks to start marketing the new duty-free zone east of the Gulf
of Suez before the mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The canal will create a new life for the people by providing them
with Nile water, while the trade zone is complementary to the
free trade project, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the United Arab Emirates on November 14-16,
the president said work on the new water project will start in
January.
</P>
<P>
Following today's opening of the first stage of the peace
canal, Mubarak said that the third Middle East and North Africa
economic conference, held here on November 12-14, was successful
by all standards.

<HEADLINE> SADC Goods Quality Conference Opens in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) opened a four-day conference here today to discuss
ways to improve goods quality among the southern African countries
in order to withstand increased world competitions.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Industry
and Commerce Obert Mpofu warned companies in the region to
improve goods quality or risk losing markets in an increasingly
competitive global trading environment.
</P>
<P>
He said quality had become increasingly topical as a policy
variable for developing countries in their trade relations with
the west.
</P>
<P>
He said the 12 SADC countries, many of whom were implementing
wide-based market reforms, had to be ''alive'' to the issues on
quality so as to withstanding increased competition.
</P>
<P>
''Enterprises are called upon to put in place sound quality
systems to be successful in the global markets,''Mpofu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Director of the SADC Industry and Trade Coordination Division
(SITCD) Abraham Pallangyo said, ''The cross-fertilisation of
ideas coming out of this conference will assist in enhancing the
quality and delivery of the SADC program on standardisation
quality assurance and metrology.''
</P>
<P>
The conference will examine the role of the policymakers in
relation to the promotion and implementation of quality
standards, the importance of 9000 quality standards and the
regional and international competitiveness of SADC goods and
services.

<HEADLINE> Difference Exists Over WTO Singapore Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from
Malaysia and Indonesia insisted that developing countries should
not be overburdened with extraneous issues such as labor standards
 and investment rules at an upcoming ministerial meeting of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The new issues that are likely to be brought up by developed
countries will overburden developing countries, which are
grappling with the problems of liberalization, according to
Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Tungky Ariwibowo, Indonesian minister of industry and trade,
shared the same view with his Malaysian counterpart, arguing that
developing countries have to deal with transitional problems first
as they move from an agrarian economy to an industrial one.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries should take into consideration the
different stages of economic development of members in the world
trade group, he said.
</P>
<P>
On this issue, the two Asian officials parted company with
European speakers in a panel discussion at the Europe/East Asia
conference, organized by the World Economic Forum here. The panel
focused on what to expect from the WTO ministerial meeting to be
held in Singapore in December.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Commission, took
exception to the views, saying that there should be no taboos in
the WTO and that he cannot see any justification for not
discussing any particular subject.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not start excluding things before we get there," said
the European Union official.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Seade, WTO deputy director general, believed that the top
 priority at the Singapore meeting is to implement agreements
reached in the Uruguay Round. And the implementation was a point
on which the four panelists agreed.
</P>
<P>
The WTO official highlighted topics to be discussed at the
ministerial meeting and they include the implementation of a WTO
dispute mechanism, proposals for new rules on telecommunications
and financial services and the WTO's future work program.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin City in North China
is boosting its development through opening more to overseas
investors in the coming years, a senior Tianjin Municipal
Government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here this afternoon, Wang Dehui, vice mayor
 of the city, said that up to now, more than 10,000
overseas-funded projects have been planned in the city with
contracted investments of 14.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wang said their actual investment has reached more than five
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said Tianjin's economy is now witnessing a high growth
rate. Since 1994, its GDP has increased at an annual rate of 14.4
percent, much higher than the average rate in the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
As the largest industrial center in North China, the city has
four pillar industrial sectors including the automotive, chemical,
 metallurgical and electronic industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city will also be one of the major ports in North
China. Now the annual cargo handling capacity of its port has
reached 60 million tons and 800,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent
units).
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the city will take effective measures to
allow more overseas banking and insurance institutions to open the
 market there.
</P>
<P>
Now there are 2,300 banks and branches and banking offices in
the city and 22 overseas banks are now operating in the city.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the city will enhance cooperation with Beijing and
Hebei Province to tap resources for a joint development program.
</P>
<P>
He said the city will be turned into a financial center, trade
center and industrial center in the next century.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM on Middle East Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri today reiterated Lebanon's commitment to the achievement of
a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East in accordance
with international decisions.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the announcement in a policy statement of his new
government delivered to a general session of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new government formed earlier this month is the third
headed by Hariri since he first came to office in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said the biggest challenge for the Lebanese is the
liberation of Lebanon's land from the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reasserted his country's insistence on a
"permanent and continuous coordination with Syria and an
interlock of the Lebanese and Syrian tracks" in the peace
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, two of the four Arab parties which are
engaged in peace talks with the Jewish state, have said neither of
them would sign peace with Israel without the other doing the same.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the new Lebanese government will give
priorities to solving social and economic problems and
administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that the government will work hard to improve
living conditions of the Lebanese citizens and create more
employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The two previous governments headed by the billionaire prime
minister had been strongly criticized for paying too much
attention to the post-war reconstruction instead of taking care of
social problems.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, 52, vowed to continue the process of reconstruction
and rehabilitation which he launched four years ago.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the achievements in the process have led to
"the security, financial stability and economic development in
this country and recovery of confidence in Lebanon from other
Arab and world countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will follow a "productive
economic policy involving the industrial, agricultural and
tourist sectors."
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will also take measures to promote
agriculture, including drawing more investments to the
agricultural industry and encouraging export of agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
As for administrative reforms, he said, the government will try
to establish a modern administration system free from political
interference.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Russian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met with
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov this afternoon at
Zhongnanhai, and said that he is looking forward to his trip to
Russia next month to have talks with the Russian PM.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed also to President Jiang Zemin's visit to Moscow next
spring at President Yeltsin's invitation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that relations between China and Russia have made major
progress in various fields, and that the decision to build an
equal Sino-Russian partnership with strategic coordination and a
vision of the 21st century made by the two countries' leaders
during President Yeltsin's April trip to China, has major
practical and far-reaching significance.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's policy is to develop a long-term and
good-neighborly friendship with Russia, because the two countries
share a long border and their economies complement each
other. Sino-Russian cooperation and consultation on international
issues have increased. Li noted that mutual understanding and
support serve world and regional peace and will play a major role
in building a new international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Russia has paid close attention to China's
development and that it is pleased with China's achievements. The
Russian government values its ties with China, he said, for both
practical interests and long-term considerations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the Russian government is
looking forward to Li's visit to Russia and that he believes some
major issues, such as bilateral relations will be on the agenda of
Li's talks with Russian leaders. President Jiang's visit to Russia
next spring will be a major event in the Russia-China relations,
he added.

NAIROBI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- All Barclays Bank of Kenya
branches will be linked by a satellite system to upgrade services
in the country, according to a Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Peter Geer, Managing Director of the bank, as

The Bank is at the same time building a technology
center in the capital city of Nairobi for a faster processing of
cheques, Peter Geer said.

The center, which will be put into operation next year, will
be unique in the East African country and will process cheques
faster than in the United Kingdom, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets with Nepali Army Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, Chinese minister
of defense and vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said China is willing to develop friendly and cooperative ties
with all countries in the world, especially its neighbors, on the
basis of the five principles of peaceful-coexistence.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at a meeting in Beijing's Great Hall of the
People, today with Lieutenant General Dharmapalbar Singh Thapa,
chief of staff of the Nepali army, where Chi noted that China
needs a peaceful international environment in order to concentrate
itself on economic development.
</P>
<P>
"At present we don't have a single soldier stationed outside
China and we will never seek expansion and hegemony in the
future," he said, noting that China and Nepal share a common
border and have been linked since ancient times by culture.
</P>
<P>
It has been more than four decades since the two countries
forged their diplomatic ties, and bilateral relations have made
good progress, he said, and that he hopes Thapa's visit will
promote the growth of relations between the two countries and
their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi also expressed his appreciation for Nepal's "one China"
stand and its recognition that both Taiwan and Tibet are an
unalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Thapa asked Chi to convey the greetings of Nepalese King
Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev to President Jiang Zemin, and said he
was glad to be the first Nepali chief of staff to visit China, and
that he expects more exchanges and cooperation between the two
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Thapa arrived here Sunday for a week-long visit at the
invitation of Fu Quanyou, chief of the general staff of the PLA,
who presided over a welcoming ceremony, with Thapa accompanying
him in reviewing a PLA honor guard.

<HEADLINE> Build New Homes on Derelict Land, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- There is enough derelict land
in England's urban areas to accommodate the 4.4 million new homes
expected to be built over the next 20 years, without needing to
encroach on the countryside, a new study says.
</P>
<P>
Half a million acres of industrial waste land, an area larger
than that of Greater London, is available for redevelopment,
according to the study carried out for the property development
arm of gas giant British Gas.
</P>
<P>
This is slightly more than the estimated need for new houses
arising from population growth and aging and the break-up of the
traditional family unit.
</P>
<P>
Environment Secretary John Gummer Secretary hinted recently
that about 70 percent of new homes could be accommodated on
derelict land, the same figure as suggested by the Council for the
Protection of Rural England.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the largest amount of derelict land was
in the industrial North West of England, but even in the South
East, where land is scare, the amount of derelict land has
increased by 61 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
British Gas Properties (BGP), which owns 3,000 industrial
sites, including l,000 heavily-contaminated disused gas works, has
a vested interest in promoting the redevelopment and
decontamination of inner-city land.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Ellis, its managing director, said that none of the major
house builders rejected contaminated city land, once it had been
cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
BGP says it costs about 150,000 U.S. dollars an acre to reclaim
some of the worst sites, but urban development land can fetch up
to 700,000 dollars an acre, allowing for a healthy profit even
after the costs of cleaning-up have been absorbed.
</P>
<P>
"If you can build on these half-million acres safely and
carefully, why are we still moving people out into the green belt
and the countryside?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"Why on earth do you want to build 4.4 million homes in the
suburbs or the green belt?"

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Humanitarian Aid for Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations appealed on
Monday for nearly 260 million U.S. dollars of aid for the 1.5
million people affected by the recent armed conflict in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was launched by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to end one of the worst humanitarian crises the
world has seen.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA),
the conflict in eastern Zaire has led to the uprooting of most
of the 1.25 million Rwandan and Burundi refugees who have
lived there for more than two years since the civil wars in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
The mass movement of refugees has created 250,000 internally
displaced persons and affected at least 500,000 others inside the
country. Most of these people are now dependent on international
community assistance for survival.
</P>
<P>
The DHA said that this U.N. appeal is an emergency interim
measure to meet urgent aid requirements over a three-month period
starting from November 1, such as food, clean water and
sanitation, health services and shelter.
</P>
<P>
Over 118 million dollars is needed by the U.N. food agency for
food aid covering over the next seven months.
</P>
<P>
The appeal will also cover reintegration, justice and
rebuilding projects for refugees who have recently returned to
Rwanda and Burundi from Zaire. Data from the U.N.'s refugee
agency showed that by mid-November, some 5,100 refugees have
returned to Rwanda and 29,300 to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The DHA called on the international community to be generous
respond immediately to the appeal to end one of the largest-ever
humanitarian crises.

percent share of Everbright.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hussein Outlines Jordan's Stand on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein
reiterated here today that the only way to break the deadlock in
the Mideast peace process was to implement all the accords
signed between the Palestinians and Israelis and start the final
status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the fourth and last session of the
current 12th Parliament, the king urged both the Palestinian
Authority (PA) and Israel to make sturdy progress towards serious
negotiations on final status negotiations to achieve a just an
durable peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, which effective serves as a policy statement of
the government, Hussein also pledged continued support for the
Palestinians in their quest of a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
On the Jerusalem issue, he said his country had done and would
do its utmost to protect the Arab and Islamic identity of
Jerusalem by playing its special role in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Under the Jordanian-Israel peace treaty signed in 1994, Jordan
enjoys a special role in the holy places in Jerusalem. The PA
has also asked the Kingdom to maintain its religious supervision
of the holy shrines there until the final status negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israelis are completed.
</P>
<P>
Hussein stressed that Jordan's responsibilities toward
Jerusalem "are held in trust, to be handed over by us to the
Palestinian state once final status negotiations are concluded,
and once the Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital,
is established."
</P>
<P>
On inter-Arab relations, Hussein said pan-Arab ties had been
improved, adding that joint Arab actions should focus on cohesion
between all countries of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
A cohesion, he explained, "would be based on solid foundations
of mutual respect, mutual non-interference in internal and
external affairs."
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, he said Jordan's economy had recorded
vast achievements toward comprehensive development over several
decades of growth, adding Jordan was turning to be self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
He said the government continued to pursue an open policy
through negotiations to conclude a partnership agreement with the
European Union (EU) and to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He told deputies and senates that the government continued to
simplify government procedures and bureaucratic red-tape and
introduce new investment promotion laws to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
On the widely expected separation of powers between
government and parliament, the king indicated that there was no
obstacle in introducing a so-called "Norwegian law," which
prevents deputies from taking government portofolios.
</P>
<P>
The king is expected to formally announce the introduction of
the separation shortly before the next elections for the
parliament in October 1997.

However, the government borrowing from commercial banks
increased from 142.871 billion Kwacha (114.3 million U.S.Dollars)
in September to 152.159 billion Kwacha (121.7 million U.S.Dollars)
in October mainly due to the 8.4 billion Kwacha increase in treasury
bills holdings. In August the net claim was 114.182 billion Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the 34 billion Kwacha balance with the
Bank of Zambia, the total claim by the banking system on the
government in October was 118.048 billion Kwacha (94.4 million
U.S.Dollars), a decline from 151.480 billion Kwacha (121.2
million U.S. Dollars) in September.
</P>
<P>
The gradual reduction in total claims on the government by
banking systems has not positively affected the domestic debt
which has been increasing, reflecting heavy dependence on
domestic money by the government to meet its short term
expenditure requirements. The increase in domestic debt has
always brought negative effects on the overall economy.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Garment Industry Attractive to HK Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is becoming
attractive as a garment export production base to foreign
companies especially for Hong Kong firms, according to a new
research report released today by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
The release said that the attractiveness of Cambodia's garment
industry is enhanced by the fact that exports from the country to
both the US and the EU are not subject to quota restrictions.
</P>
<P>
According to the research, Cambodia's export value of garments
increased markedly from 3.6 million US dollars in 1994 to 26.4
million US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January 1996, the Cambodia Investment Board has
approved 46 foreign-invested garment projects, ranking as the
largest sector in attracting foreign capital in terms of number of
 projects. Nine of the approved garment projects were registered
as Hong Kong capital.
</P>
<P>
Last year Hong Kong's total exports to Cambodia jumped by 21
percent to 38.8 million US dollars. Fabrics and textile machinery
make up a large share of the export items, reflecting Hong Kong's
investment in Cambodia's garment industry, according to the
research.

<HEADLINE> 8 Lebanese Policemen Detained After Shooting Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Eight policemen have been
detained in connection with the death of a wanted suspect, the
English-language Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The only English newspaper in Beirut quoted a general
prosecutor as saying that investigators are making interrogations
with the policemen who allegedly shot dead Farid Mousalli, a
suspect belonging to a gang charged with selling forged finance
ministry revenue stamps,
</P>
<P>
Mousalli, a 38-year-old Palestinian, who was wanted for
involvement in the alleged embezzlement of millions of U.S. dollars
from the Finance Ministry, was shot dead Sunday by policemen who
raided his hideout in the mountain village of Ashqout, Kasrwan.
</P>
<P>
The policemen started shooting after they came under fire
from Mousalli, a statement issued by the security department in
the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper quoted judicial sources as saying that
the police unit had opened fire without orders.
</P>
<P>
The embezzlement case was exposed at a time when the Lebanese
government was upset by a campaign of opposition against
corruption inside the government.
</P>
<P>
General Prosecutor Adnan Addoum informed Justice Minister
Bahij Tabbara Monday of the latest findings of investigators
inspecting Mousalli's death.
</P>
<P>
The embezzled money was estimated at first at 43 billion
Lebanese pounds (26 million U.S. dollars), but was later reduced to
15 billion Lebanese pounds (10 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fuad Sinyoura, minister of state for financial affairs, said
Friday that the money amounted to only 4 billion Lebanese pounds
(2.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mousalli's death came only a day after President Elias Hrawi
vowed to launch a war against corruption.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Smooth Transition Vital To Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- European Commission
Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan said that Europe would spare no
effort to help ensure that Hong Kong's transition is a success.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's future is vital to the political stability and
economic advance of Asia, as well as to the European Union's
strategic interest in the region, said Sir Leon, who took part in
the on-going Europe/East Asia Summit, organized by the World
Economic Forum in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission will do its part by persuading member
countries to give visa-free access to Hong Kong passport-holders,
according to the official. Meanwhile, the European Union (EU)
would maintain its diplomatic presence in Hong Kong after the 1997
 handover.
</P>
<P>
By supporting China's accession to the World Trade Organization
 (WTO), the European Union can help underpin Hong Kong' transition
 in the long term, said Sir Leon, who oversees the external
relations and trade policy in the EU since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has insisted that China fulfill some
obligations of the WTO at the point of entry, and then meet the
remaining requirements after a period of time. The Vice-President
said that after China wins the WTO membership, Hong Kong and
Chinese economies would be brought closer together over the longer
 term.
</P>
<P>
To help Hong Kong's smooth transition, the EU official promised
 that the European Union would keep its own market open to Hong
Kong exporters and investors. Since 1988, Hong Kong's imports from
 the EU has exceeded its exports, and the gap has become wider
over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the 15 member states of the EU have substantial
stakes in Hong Kong's economy. There are 40 European banks and 40
European insurance companies based in Hong Kong, plus more than
100 industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has signed a number of Air Services Agreements with
EU member states, including Italy, the Netherlands, France and
Germany to ensure smooth aviation traffic after 1997. Nine
airlines are flying from Europe regularly to the Asian
city.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Localization of law is one of
the leading tasks for the Macao government in the transitional
period before the handover of power in 1999, said a leading legal
official of the Macao government.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Legal Affairs Jorge Silveira made these remarks
at a seminar on legal affairs which opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is attended by some 50 experts and scholars from
Japan, India, Singapore, Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia, Nepal,
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Silveira said the translation of the Civil Law, the Code of
Civil Procedure and the Business Law from Portuguese to Chinese is
 in full swing, while the translation of the Criminal Law and the
Code of Criminal Procedure has been completed.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the localization of law, the current reality in
 Macao and the new situation following the signing of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao should
be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
"The political meaning of the transfer of power of Macao is
beyond Macao itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the transition will be a good example in
handling international relations. It is also helpful to the safety
 and stability of the Asia-Pacific region," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The University of Hong Kong
is enhancing its cooperation with scientific institutions in the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
According to a university spokesman, the university set up a
liaison office at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) this week.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the office is aimed at further and long-term

agreement with the CAS in 1994. A new accord will be signed
between the two institutions during the visit of Zhou Guangzhao,
president of the CAS, here next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the two sides have agreed to set up
two joint laboratories, the Transgenic and Animal Development
Joint Laboratory and the Joint Research Center on Chinese Language
 Sciences.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraqi KDP Calls for Improving Ties With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi-backed Kurdish group
has called for improving ties with Iran, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Sheikholeslam met here
Monday with a delegation led by Fadhel Mirani, a leader of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which had accused Tehran of
providing military assistance to its rival -- the Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan (PUK). Iran denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the first of its kind between Baghdad-backed KDP
and the Iranian government since bloody clashes broke out between
the two rival Kurdish factions in northern Iraq in August.
</P>
<P>
With the help of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the KDP drove
the Iran-backed PUK out of most of northern Iraq in late August
and early September.
</P>
<P>
But the PUK stormed back in October, seizing the strategic town
of Sulaymaniyah and the Dokan Dam, which controls the water and
power supply to the KDP's stronghold Erbil, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The two groups signed a peace deal on October 31 with the
mediation of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Mars-96 Probe Crash Rocks Russia's Space Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian space experts began to
count the cost and review the drawing board of a failed rocket
launch today after their rocket Mars-96 veered out of control and
crashed into the South Pacific Ocean on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the Mars-96 launch, which was already two years
late due to funding problems, has inflicted a heavy blow to the
expectations of restoring the Russian space program to its former
glory.
</P>
<P>
"We've devoted seven years' work into this," said Nikolai
Ivanov, head of the main operational group controlling the launch,
"I cannot begin to describe how it feels."
</P>
<P>
Russian Space Agency officials told a news conference that the
ill-fated Mars-96 launch cost 300 million U.S. dollars, including
122 million dollars of probe and about 180 million dollars of
scientific equipment carried on the 6.8-ton probe funded by 20
other countries including the United States, Britain, Germany and
France.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts were also reported to be stunned by the sudden
failure of their efforts, particularly the British experts, who
have not recovered from the explosion of the European Space
Agency's Ariane-5 rocket last spring.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Russian Space Agency Yuri Milov
expressed regret over the financial losses caused by the failed
launch to participants.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Western countries were expected to
continue close cooperation with Russia in space plans and all
sides should share space risks.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to reach the Mars on September 12 next year, the
Mars-96 was the second of three planned missions to Mars within a
month following a U.S. robot voyage on November 7, and the third
is due to blast off on December 2 by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The object of the three missions is to check signs of water on
the Mars to determine whether there used to be life on it.
</P>
<P>
The Mars-96 rocket took off at 20:49 GMT on Saturday from the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan under optimal weather
conditions. Two hours later, however, a fourth stage booster,
intended to power the module out of the Earth's orbit, failed to
function for as long as expected.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Russian experts lost control over the rocket,
which, together with its precious payload, crashed down into the
Pacific Ocean near Chile's Easter Island on Sunday morning at a
speed of 27,200 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Although the launch failure is a setback to the reputation of
the Russian space complex which consists of three main areas:
military, commercial and scientific, the Russian experts said it
was unlikely to stop future development.
</P>
<P>
They believed despite the Mars-96 disaster and doubts about
Russia's under-funded military branch, Russia still enjoys a solid
reputation among international clients as a highly efficient
contractor for lucrative commercial satellite launches, the
experts believe.
</P>
<P>
Half of Russia's one-billion-dollar space program budget in
1995 was from the federal budget and the other half from foreign
investment, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Distressed by the loss of the Mars-96 probe, the Russian space
officials said that they would persist with space exploration
programs.
</P>
<P>
Russian Space Agency's General Director Yuri Koptev said on
Monday that by the year 2000, Russia would launch payloads worth
about one billion dollars in 60 joint projects.
</P>
<P>
Russian space programs will concentrate on astrophysical
research, three scheduled space missions to be staged within the
next four to five years, and a new Mars probe to be launched at
the end of 2000 or early 2001 with foreign financial aid.

TOKYO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men spikers rallied
to beat their Japanese rivals for a full-set victory in the men's
World Super Challenge volleyball tournament in Osaka on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nationals won their opener 4-15, 15-8, 15-9, 7-15
and 15-13.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set, the Chinese squad overturned the
table from 2-6 to win the second 15-8, levelling the score 1-1
through solid blocks and strong serves.
</P>
<P>
Against a partisan audience, the Chinese national squad rushed
ahead to win the third set before conceding the fourth.
</P>
<P>
In the decider, the Chinese men exploited their height
advantage to lead 8-5 and 12-8 before ace spiker Zhang Qiang
committed errors twice in his off-court attack.
</P>
<P>
However, it was also Zhang who unleashed the last spike to seal
the game 15-13 wherein each serve scores one point for either side.
</P>
<P>
Early on Sunday, the Chinese women spikers won their version
with four wins against one defeat, beating Cuba and Brazil to
second and third places respectively.
</P>
<P>
The men tournament features Atlanta Olympic top three of the
Netherlands, Italy and Yugoslavia against Asian top three of South
Korea, China and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Legality of Kuwaiti Parliamentary Speakership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 19 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented event
to the Kuwaiti parliament, a protest letter challenging the
outcome of Kuwait's parliamentary speakership elections last month
made the parliament adjourn its session today.
</P>
<P>
The session was delayed for one hour to allow further
consultations on the letter filed by parliament member Jassem
Al-Khorafi, who lost a closely-contested election for parliament
chief to Ahmad Al-Saadoun, parliamentary sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a heated discussion would take place on
what the parliament should do with the event.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saadoun won the October 20 Speakership battle 30-29 with one
blank vote in the first session of the current parliament when 60
MPs and Cabinet members cast their votes. Valid votes in the
current parliament total 61.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's constitution, Al-Khorafi argued, the
speaker needs at least an absolute majority of the votes to hold
the post.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khorafi and his supporters are demanding that the case
should go to the Constitutional Court for interpretation of
clauses in the country's Constitution regarding the Speaker's
election.
</P>
<P>
Claiming the election was unconstitutional, he also demanded a
re-run of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saadoun, who was speaker in 1981, 1985 and 1992, and
Al-Khorafi were the only two candidates competing for the post.
</P>
<P>
The candidates were elected from each of their constituencies
among Kuwait's 25 constituencies on October 7 in all-man
affair. Women are not allowed to vote or run for office in Kuwait
which hosts the only elected parliament in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's current parliament is the eighth one in the
country's history since it become independent in 1961.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A four-day economic
cooperation conference of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) opened here today in a bid to enhance regional
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda called
for enhancing business cooperation among the seven member nations
of the regional economic grouping. He said that the member nations
should not be disheartened by the slow progress in various fields
of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives,
India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In the past 10 years, SAARC
has made some progress in regional cooperation in the fields of
agriculture, rural development, education and culture, but its
achievements are not so big as expected due to differences and
conflicts among the member nations.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister asked the member nations to work
towards the removal of non-tariff barriers in the region for
enhancing intra-regional trade, and he promised that India would
not create obstacles while implementing decisions arrived at the
SAARC meetings.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over inadequate exchange of information
among business organizations in the region and said that efforts
should be made to speed up dissemination of business information
in all areas for promoting trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC member nations are scheduled to hold second round of
negotiations on trade liberalization within the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rules Out Seeking Nuclear Weapons From US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has made it clear that it
will not seek to buy nuclear material from the United States
despite enjoying a non-NATO ally status newly granted by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Marwan Muasher said at a weekly press
briefing Monday that his country will take advantage of the
privileged status to seek certain advanced and sophisticated
military technology and equipment from the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kingdom, which was named as a major non-North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally by U.S. President Bill
Clinton last Friday, had not yet drawn up a list of its
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said Jordan welcomes the U.S. move, "which opens the
door for Jordan to receive certain state-of-the-art technology and
equipment from the United States."
</P>
<P>
Under the non-NATO ally status, Jordan is now entitled to
"priority considerations for the transfer of excess defense
articles, the use of already appropriated military assistance
funds for procurement through commercial leases, the stockpiling
of U.S. military material and the purchase of depleted uranium
munitions."
</P>
<P>
Asked specifically about the clause on "depleted uranium
munition," the minister pointed out that such provisions are
standard in granting non-NATO ally status.
</P>
<P>
"But it does not mean that Jordan would be asking" for such
items, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan can receive some of the advanced equipment that
U.S. military units brought in with them when they come here for
joint exercises with Jordanian counterparts, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This was not the case until now," said the minister,
referring to the fact that Jordan can not get the U.S. advanced
radar and control equipment related to F-16 fighter jets the
U.S. Air Force units brought in last April for joint exercises.
</P>
<P>
On Monday King Hussein also hailed the U.S. move and described
it as the result of persistent Jordanian efforts for interaction
with regional and international groupings.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. administrative decision was the
materialization of the Kingdom's "intents and desires to
communicate and interact with the grouping of the North Atlantic
states," adding that it gave the Jordanian Armed Forces the rank
it deserved.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President May Help Resolve Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President
Shahabuddin Ahmed is likely to take the initiative to resolve the
political impasse resulting from the boycott of parliament
sessions by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
BNP lawmakers have been abstaining from attending parliament
session since November 10 to press its 10-point demand, including
"adequate opportunity" for the opposition to speak in the house.
</P>
<P>
No detail was disclosed about the president's initiative, but a
highly placed source at the presidential palace said the hint of a
possible presidential initiative came when BNP Chairperson Begum
Khaleda Zia led a 10-member delegation to hand in a BNP memorandum
to the head of state Monday.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the hope that the Treasury and opposition benches in
the parliament would work together for the people, the president
told Khaleda that he would discuss the matter with Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Awami League has also reiterated its
invitation to the BNP to sit for a dialogue for ending the
impasse. The two sides resumed contact Monday after a lapse of
three days.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarians have to reduce
consumption of bread, meat and dairy products under the high
inflation, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Annual consumption of bread, meat, milk and yogurt per capita
are respectively 40, 15, 25 and 45 kilograms less than six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarians' actual income decreased by half in real terms over
the first ten months of the year with an inflation rate of 120
percent.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of Bulgarian leva with the U.S. dollar has
plunged to a quarter compared with that at the beginning of this
year, resulting in a run on the banks.
</P>
<P>
The attempt of Bulgarian banks to prevent the run by raising
the interest rate of leva deposit to 180 percent has proved a
failure. People just want to exchange their leva into hard
currencies to avoid devaluation.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Official Calls for Assistance to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official today
called on the international community to provide 10 million
U.S. dollars in assistance to the Iraqi refugees in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Husseini, director general in charge of Foreign National
Affairs of the Interior Ministry, said at a press conference that
Iran needs the money to take care of the refugees during the cold
and rainy season.
</P>
<P>
About 75,000 Iraqi refugees poured into the border regions
following the fighting between two rival Kurdish factions in
northern Iraq two months ago. They are sheltered in seven camps
in three Iranian provinces of West Azarbaijan, Kurdestan and
Kermanshahan.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has spent some 15 million dollars for the refugees since
their arrival in September," the Iranian official said.
</P>
<P>
But, he complained, "Of the total expenditure incurred by
Iran, only 3.1 million dollars had been paid back by various
U.N. and international organizations."
</P>
<P>
Up to now, he said, some 48,000 refugees have left Iran for
their home in Iraq upon their own will.
</P>
<P>
However, the official admitted the difference between the
Iranian government and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), which asked Iran to move the remaining refugees
from the cold border areas to less hostile environments in the
interior provinces.
</P>
<P>
But Tehran refused to do so on grounds that the change of the
camp might encourage the refugees to stay permanently in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We are negotiating with UNHCR representatives in both Tehran
and Geneva," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is now hosting about 2 million refugees, about 1.5
million from Afghanistan and another half million from Iraq, some
of them came to Iran as early as in 1973.

"The Punch" reported that the fuselage was found by divers
underneath a three-meter-deep mud on the bed of the lagoon.

the black box of the crashed beoing 727 plane have been found
before.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the recovery of the fuselage may lead to
the discovery of intact or identifiable bodies of the victims, as
only bits of human flesh and severed parts were found so far.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Writing Brush Factory Combs Gold Out of Babies' Hair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese writing brush
factory in the Chinese capital has discovered that the top of a
baby's head can be a lucrative place.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Jinghua Writing Brush Factory is persuading Beijing
people to allow its specially trained barbers to cut their babies'
hair, promising a pleasant surprise for parents: a pair of
baby-hair writing brushes.
</P>
<P>
The writing tools can serve as souvenirs to mark a baby's
birth, said a salesman from the factory.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hong, director of the factory's market development
department, said that only baby hair can be made into a writing
brush, because baby hair has sharp tips that can form a natural
nib. He added that once a head of baby hair is cut, the strands
that are left are not pointed and can no longer be made into a
good writing brush.
</P>
<P>
The factory, with a staff of 20, launched the baby-hair
writing brush business in May last year, inspired by the
traditional Chinese writing brush, which is made of the hair of
goats, rabbits or wolves.
</P>
<P>
The move reflected the factory's eagerness to find a source of
quick profit, as revenues from its traditional writing brushes
have inched along at an annual rate of six to ten percent in the
company's five-year history, Liu explained.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese traditionally used brushes made with animal
hair. They now mostly use pens, but when the need to write large
Chinese characters arises, they must resort to the brushes.
</P>
<P>
The idea of using baby hair to make writing tools originated in
the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). According to Liu, skilled
calligraphers prefer baby-hair brushes, as the soft strands allow
the artist's imagination to run free, while a stiff writing brush
restricts creative ability.
</P>
<P>
Liu said Chinese parents can use brushes made from their own
child's hair to create gifts that can later be presented at the
grown child's marriage ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a studious-looking man, showed such birthday writing
brushes with shafts made of bamboo or cloisonne. Inscribed on the
shafts are phrases such as "Receiving Life From Parents" and
"Devoting Your Life to Society," "Eternal Love From Your
Parents," and "Writing Your Life Story and Painting Your Future."
</P>
<P>
Baby-hair writing brushes range of 80 to 450 yuan a pair.
</P>
<P>
He said that his factory has made more than 1,500 pairs of the
brushes to date, but admitted that the business has slacked off,
as parents cut their babies' hair in winter for fear of catching
cold.
</P>
<P>
But he is optimistic about market prospects for the baby-hair
writing brushes once spring comes along, and haircuts are in
greater demand.
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 babies are born each year in Beijing's eight urban
districts.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that some overseas Chinese have also mailed their
babies' hair home to have brushes made. He added he has not yet
received any curly baby hair.
</P>
<P>
Curly hair can be made into a brush, but it is not especially
suited for writing purposes, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Now that his baby-brush business has taken off, Liu has turned
to another head for inspiration, and is currently making writing
brushes made from the hair of newlyweds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the factory has started making "dragon and
phoenix" writing brushes for newlyweds in the city. The groom's
hair is stuck in a shaft shaped like a dragon head at the end,
while the woman's hair is arranged in a shaft with a tip like a
phoenix head.
</P>
<P>
The dragon and the phoenix are imaginary creatures believed to
be incarnations of emperors and empresses from ancient Chinese
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
He said that some couples want to have their black hair mixed
into one writing brush, to represent the belief that they will
grow old together.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, these brushes are difficult to use for writing," he
said.

<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Joides Resolution, the only
10,000-ton deep sea drilling ship in the world, hopes to conduct
drilling in the South China Sea before the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
China has formally asked the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), the
owner of Joides Resolution, to drill in the South China Sea,
according to academician Wang Pinxian.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes well, the drilling will probably be
conducted in 1999," said Wang, who is also the vice president of
the International Committee for Oceanography Research.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1994, the Joides Resolution had drilled 58 times,
involving huge investment and 19 nations in its operations.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, one of the most fascinating challenges of
the 21st century will be large-scale ocean exploration, which
needs wide international cooperation from both financial and
scientific sectors.
</P>
<P>
"China has decided to participate in the ODP, and she will play
a more important role in this field in the future," he said.

PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The economic platform presented by the Socialist Party six
days ago hit the bull's eyes by winning widespread support among
the French people, according to a latest poll by the
BVA-Liberation polling group.
</P>
<P>
-- Elected with 54.4 percent of the votes, Emil Constantinescu
will be Romania's first president of alternation since 1989. A
strong Orthodox Church believer, he urged his followers to work
for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac is on a visit to Japan until
November 21, where he has signed with Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto ``20 actions for the year 2,000'' which plans
several high-level meetings between the two countries each year.

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>

movies, posters, discs, books and radio-television programs are
all paying homage to the great man of letters on a
multi-dimensional scale.
</P>
<P>
-- If the disarmament of their nuclear arsenals by the United
States and Russia has been going on for several years, the people
in charge of the task have failed so far to take care of the
military plutonium, dangerous materials which can remain very
radio-active for 24,000 years. Experts of many governments are now
examining different technical solutions for the problem.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Sees No Necessity in German Mediator's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's pro-Iranian
Hezbollah said today that it does not see it necessary for a
German mediator, who helped negotiate a deal of swapping
prisoners between Hezbollah and Israel in July, to visit Lebanon
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, made the statement in response to
recent local media reports on an allegedly planned visit by
Bernd Schmidbauer, German minister of state for security
affairs, to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"These reports are groundless from beginning to end," the
Islamic Shiite party said. "We do not see anything justifying
the necessity of the German minister's visit to Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
It confirmed that the issue of missing Israeli airman Ron
Arad was raised during Schmidbauer's visit to Beirut last month,
but "he was officially told by Hezbollah leaders that at present
Hezbollah did not have informations on Arad's fate."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed party said that the German envoy paid the
visit only for the purpose of delivering oral messages from Abdel
Karim Obeid, a Hezbollah cleric, and Mustapha Dirani, a Lebanese
Islamic faction leader, to their families.
</P>
<P>
Both Obeid and Dirani have been imprisoned by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Almost all major newspapers in Beirut have reported
that progress had been made in tracing Israeli air force
navigator Arad, who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Ash-Sharq daily said that Schmidbauer, who brokered the big
exchange in July of prisoners and bodies between Hezbollah and
Israel, was involved in the present contacts to plan another
swapping.
</P>
<P>
It quoted unidentified sources as saying that Germany was
helping to prepare a top secret deal to exchange Arad for Obeid,
Dirani and other Lebanese and Palestinians held in Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
"According to some indications in the last two days,
information given to the German government shows that Hezbollah's
efforts to locate Arad achieved some positive results," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The German security official (Schmidbauer) is expected to
come to Lebanon and Israel soon to work out the deal on
exchanging Arad for Obeid, Dirani and other Lebanese and
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails," it added.

<HEADLINE> WEU Ministers Discuss European Defense Identity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSTENDE, Belgium, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and defense
ministers of the Western European Union (WEU) started here this
morning a one-day meeting to examine the prospects for European
security and defense identity in the context of NATO's adaptation
and the role the WEU should play in it.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda are the issues of possible role the WEU -
the future armed force of the European Union (EU) - could play in
the multinational force to be set up in Zaire and of the creation
of a European armament organization.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting, chaired by Belgian Foreign Minister
Erik Derycke and in the presence of WEU Secretary General Jose
Cutileiro, was also participated by foreign and defense ministers
of WEU observer members, associated members and associated partner
countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are expected to discuss ways to firm up the
Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTFs), a concept approved by NATO
foreign ministers during their Council meeting on June 3 in
Berlin, under which NATO will provide its means for humanitarian
and peacekeeping operations under WEU banner.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, the ministers may, according to meeting
sources, formally sign the proposal to create Western European
Armament Association, whose legal structure would allow it to sign
armament contracts.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting is not expected to contribute to progress
in European Union negotiations on a common defense.
</P>
<P>
This issue is deadlocked by differences mainly between the
Franco-German duo, who favor the WEU's merger into the EU, and
Britain, who sees the WEU as an autonomous organization, like the
EU, with which it must have relations on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
The Western European Union has existed in its present form
since 1954 and today includes ten European countries - Belgium,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Denmark, Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Ireland have observer status.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Norway and Iceland are associated members. Associated
partners are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

<HEADLINE> Nanning City Punishes 67 Illegal Land Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Poor performance in 67
enterprises and departments in Nanning, the capital of southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have resulted in the
loss of their land use rights, according to a report in
Beijing-based China Land News.
</P>
<P>
The land administration of the city has canceled such rights
for those enterprises or departments that failed to properly
register their land on time, did not submit land fees, or have not
gone into production as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Nanning has feverishly developed land since the central
government approved it as an open city along the coast.
</P>
<P>
But a number of enterprises and departments have not correctly
handled land use procedures with land management departments, or
started construction of projects on time, which left cultivated
land idle, reduced state assets, and affected the city's overall
urban development plan.
</P>
<P>
Since July, the city has been punishing these groups by
withdrawing a total of 133 hectares of land from them. They
include a dozen real estate developers, a mine owned by nuclear
departments, a newspaper branch, and the government of the city's
Jiangnan District.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning Land Administration said that the land
standardization campaign has not ended, and the city government
will recover more land from illegal land users.

<HEADLINE> GCC Considers Unifying Customs Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) Monday discussed ways of unifying customs laws
among its member states in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Officials of customs departments from the GCC held discussions
on obstacles facing trade exchange among the GCC countries,
including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Head of Kuwaiti General Secretariat of Customs Ibrahim
Al-Ghanim said the unification of customs tariffs among the GCC
member states will become a reality after an accord is reached on
commodities to be subjected to the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
At present, customs tariffs in the GCC vary widely, with Saudi
Arabia and Bahrain imposing duties of more than 20 percent on
some imports and the UAE and Oman levying below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ghanim said that a unified customs tariff was the only
opportunity for the GCC states to make significant inroads into
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
GCC finance and foreign ministers held a two-day meeting on
the issue in October but failed to reach an agreement on two
groups of commodities which were previously discussed by
technical sub-committees.
</P>
<P>
The ministers assigned the GCC Secretary General Jamil
Al-Hojeilan to prepare a memo including all possible options
related to the unification of tariffs.

<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Terry Venables, the former
England national football team coach, is poised to confirm later
on Tuesday that he will accept an offer to lead Australia's bid to
qualify for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Neither Venables nor Soccer Australia, Australia's governing
body, has officially confirmed the appointment. But the Europe 96
hero coach explained: "we are still talking,
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to say much more at the moment. There have been
a lot of offers to me since Europe 96 but this is the one hat
interests me most of all." he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Soccer Australia have admitted that their
chairman David hill was in England and he had talked to
Venables and other possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
Venables was in a list of possible candidates that also
included Howard Wilkinson, Jack Carlton and Johan Cruyff,

<P>
It is reported that Venables, whose contract with the
Australian would be worth 200,000 pounds (320,000 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy Prime Minister Urges Equal Business, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Equal partnerships should be
promoted between Asia and the rest of the world in both business
and politics, said Amnuay Viravan, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand, when addressing the 1996
Europe and East Asia Economic Summit here today.
</P>
<P>
Viravan said that equal partnerships should be promoted between
foreign and Asian business people in joint ventures in Asia and
further afield, and between the public and private sectors in
meeting the challenges facing global business.
</P>
<P>
He said that, parallel with its economic development, Asian
economies have been increasingly active in driving regional and
global economic integration, and there is no doubt that East Asia
has become a key player in the global economy, and that the
countries of East Asia are ready to be equal partners in the
business arena.
</P>
<P>
However, cultural gaps or blind spots both at business and
government levels impede progress in investment cooperation and in
promoting business, he said.
</P>
<P>
With time, experience and success, the differences between Asia
and Western business people will be gradually narrowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the political level, however, the gap is greater. European
and American politicians lag behind their business sectors in
seeking "true" cooperation with Asia. The US government still
frequently takes a unilateral approach in international trade," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must work towards equal partnership in all respects." he
said. "There is no doubt that from now on, equal partnership must
form the basis of any successful business initiative."

<HEADLINE> Turky Rejects EU Involvement in Turco-Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today strongly denounced
Greece's efforts to bring the problems between the two countries
to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The denouncement was made by Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller at an interview to local newspaper
Daily News and published today.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said the current tension between Turkey and Greece is
due to Greek efforts to push its bilateral problems with Turkey
onto the EU agenda and have the EU involved in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have long been at odds
over territorial disputes in the Aegean, as well as minority
rights and the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greece, an EU member, has recently vetoed and blocked credits
already promised by the Union to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On the EU's call for Turkey to agree to referring its disputes
with Greece to international arbitration, Ciller said her country
is prepare to settle the disputes through international law
"without excluding third party mechanisms."
</P>
<P>
Ciller also said her country rejects any linkage between
Turkish-EU relations and the Turkish-Greek problems, hoping that
Ankara's efforts to join the EU will not be undermined.

BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader
of Thailand's New Aspiration Party (NAP) that won the mandate to
form a new government, said today that his party would do its best
to form a new coalition government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the parliament house, where new MPs
began to report, Chavalit said he would speed up the cabinet
formation process so that the new government could soon start to
tackle the problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
A six-party coalition has been formed after Sunday's general
elections, but cabinet post allocations among the parties are
being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
The Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party led by outgoing Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-archa has been excluded from the new
government.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly routine cabinet meeting this morning, caretaker
government ministers discussed the drafting of a royal decree for

<HEADLINE> New System Accelerates Oil Exploration in Tarim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- With help from a new operating
system, the exploration of oil and gas in northwest China's Tarim
Basin, known as the "Sea of Death," has scored notable
achievements over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Within the basin, China has discovered nine whole-set oil and
gas fields, and 26 industrial oil-bearing structures. The
potential oil reserves are expected to exceed 10 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the basin will have an annual
production capacity of 4.6 million tons, said Liu Baohe, vice
director of the Production and Development Bureau of the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the achievements have been made with the help of
a new system.
</P>
<P>
Different from older oilfields, Tarim has not established its
own drilling teams, and its oil sinking is undertaken by drilling
teams from other fields. Meanwhile, services for Tarim oil
workers' daily needs are provided by people nearby, thereby saving
the burden of unnecessary personnel.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the Tarim Petroleum Development Headquarters is
able to focus on exploration and development, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
After adopting the new system, sinking of a 5,000-meter-deep
well required only 123 days, compared with the one year period
that was necessary before the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, the average proven reserves of a
wildcat well have reached 1.86 million tons, 2.7 times the
national average level. Investment to build up a production
capacity of one million tons of oil calls for 1.79 billion yuan
(about 215 million US dollars), 144 million yuan less than the
national average level.
</P>
<P>
At present, the CNPC is popularizing the system among onshore
traditional oil and gas fields, so that they will establish
enterprise groups operating with such a system by the end of this
century.

<HEADLINE> China's Eximbank Extends Loan for Export of Aircraft Components </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of
China today granted an export seller's credit of 400 million yuan
(about 48 million US dollars) to the Shenyang Aircraft Industrial
Group to support its export of aircraft parts to the US and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The loan, payable in ten years, has the longest term limit ever
extended by the policy-oriented Eximbank since it went into
operation in July of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The aviation industry is a major target of the Eximbank's
lendings as its products have a high added value, said Qiang
Zhongtao, a deputy bank president.
</P>
<P>
"Since we opened for business, we have approved loans totaling
1.08 billion yuan to finance the export of aircraft and
components," Qian said, pledging that his bank will give even
greater support for the sector in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank is one of China's three policy-oriented banks
established in 1994 to finance China's exports of capital goods,
including machinery, electronics and complete sets of
equipment. It currently has five domestic representative offices
in Dalian, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Sanctions Intact, Says Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The economic sanctions
imposed on Burundi by the Great Lakes countries are still intact
and biting, the Chairman of the Sanctions Committee, Major
General Mirisho Sarakikya, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the official Daily News from Nairobi,
General Sarakikya, who is the Tanzanan High Commissioner to Kenya,
said inspite of the new crisis in eastern Zaire, the trade embargo on
Burundi was still in place.
</P>
<P>
"The snacions are there and according to latest reports from
Bujumbura, they are really bitting," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Great Lakes countries to maintain the
solidarity, saying it was a justified cause aimed at restoring
democratic rule in the landlocked central African country.
</P>
<P>
He, however, conceded that there was a posibility of some
consumer goods and other supplies being routed to Burundi through
Zaire because of the political turmoil in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out that some supplies might be reaching Burundi
from Zaire. This is because of the raging war in the eastern part,
making it difficult for us to monitor the situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Zaire slapped a trade embargo
on Burundi about three months ago, opposing a military coup which
deposed President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
The master-mind of the coup, Major Pierre Buyoya, is the current
leader of the tiny war weary country.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya was reported last weekend in Butiama, northwestern Tanzania
to talk to the first retired President, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, who is
the international meiator in the Burundi crisis. Details of the talks
could not be known immediately.
</P>
<P>
Fresh civil strife has erupted in Burundi, forcing about 10,000
refugees to cross into Kigoma region for safety. enditem

<P>
BEIRUT, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government is
planning to launch a 10-year bond in Europe at the beginning of
1997 to help finance the electricity sector's rehabilitation
process, Beirut's Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The only English-language daily in Lebanon, which was first

issue of the Eurobond, expected to be worth 100 million
U.S. dollars, will be launched in mid-January and will be managed
by Merrill Lynch in France.
</P>
<P>
Maroum Azmar, chairman of Electricite du Liban, was quoted as

</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance refused to comment before an official
response from the World Bank, which is expected to make the
decision in December, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Azmar said that the bond would be used to finance the power
distribution network, including the construction of 10

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Doctors Treat Border Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Eight-year-old Achang suffered
from a chronic cough and high fever. When the local doctors in Nam
Kham, north Myanmar, failed to cure the ailments, his parents took
him to a hospital in Wanting City in southern China, some 30
kilometers away from Nam Kham.
</P>
<P>
Chinese doctors there diagnosed myocarditis, caused by
tonsillitis. After two weeks' treatment, a healthy Achang was back
in school.
</P>
<P>
Renci Hospital is located in Yunnan Province, 200
meters south of the Sino-Myanmian border. A total of 50,000 cases
from both Myanmar and China have been successfully treated there
since it was founded by Dr. Shen Kun in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Shen, 47, was formerly a deputy director at the renowned Yan'an
Hospital in Yunnan's capital city of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
He was shocked by the backward health care conditions he saw in
Wanting while visiting the area three years ago to see a friend,
and decided to open a hospital with 300,000 yuan of his savings
added to money borrowed from friends.
</P>
<P>
Renci Hospital receives patients mostly from Yunnan's Wanting
and Ruili cities, and areas around Nam Kham, Muse and Mandalay in
north Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Shen has trained a dozen local young people to be his
assistants. With their help, he is able to treat patients with a
wide range of medical problems, including diabetes,
enterogastritis, pneumonia and vascular diseases, and he can
perform some surgeries.
</P>
<P>
He also spreads health care education among the local
residents. "A minor disease might develop into a serious one if
the treatment is delayed because of ignorance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ways for Sustainable Development in Agriculture Suggested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese academicians believe
that sustainable development in China's agriculture in the years
to come will best be maintained by water conservation, planting
trees along farmland and farming on a fairly large scale.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Economic Daily," China's overall
prospects in agriculture this year have been encouraging, despite
many difficulties in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Gu Haibing, a professor with People's University of China, said
that through these three methods, China can look forward to a
promising situation in its agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable development in China's agricultural growth is of
special significance, as the country now only has seven percent of
the world's arable land, but feeds 20 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
Drought has become one of China's major natural disasters
threatening farming on hundreds of hectares of farmland each year,
and available water resources in the country are shrinking
rapidly, the professor explained.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is necessary to pay greater attention to
water-conservation work in agriculture, which is a major consumer
of water, and to introduce a more effective market mechanism for
the use of water.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, guaranteeing a certain area for growing
forests along farmland is also important, as vegetation
effectively controls soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's forest coverage rate is 13.4 percent, and
large tracts of farmland in rural areas are suffering from soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a lack of green belts has lowered the country's
capacity to combat natural disasters, resulting in increases in
disaster-hit arable land and also a vicious cycle that has forced
the country to depend more on chemical fertilizers for increased
output.
</P>
<P>
Improving management of farming on a fairly-large scale is also
necessary, Professor Gu said, because it will help enhance the
efficiency of agricultural labor and the use of mechanization in
farming.

BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou Motor '96, an
international automotive show with 440 participating firms and a
floor space of 8,000 square meters, is scheduled to be held in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, from
November 20-25.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by the China National Automotive Industry
Corporation (CNAIC) and the Guangzhou City Government, the coming
show has attracted some 220 companies from nine other countries
and regions and 200 domestic firms.
</P>
<P>
CNAIC successfully staged the First Guangzhou Exhibition of
International Automobiles, Maintenance and Testing Equipment in
the city in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A CNAIC official said today that China's auto industry has been
developing by leaps and bounds ever since the policy of reform and
opening-up was initiated in 1979.
</P>
<P>
China built 1.47 million automobiles and seven million
motorcycles in 1995, and its car population has so far soared to
11 million.
</P>
<P>
According to the Automotive Industry Department under the
Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, China is expected to turn
out 1.55 million automobiles in 1996 and 1.65 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The booming Guangdong Province owns 10 percent of the country's
cars, and its number of imported automobiles rank first in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of the province, according to statistics,
is much higher than the country's average, and local people have
strong purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
CNAIC and China Council for the Promotion of International
Trade jointly launched the Auto China '96 in Beijing in June,
which attracted some 1,000 companies to participate.

BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua)-- In 1996, groups and individuals
in Beijing have shown little interest in buying commercial houses,
according to an official from the municipal statistic bureau.

<P>
The vacant floor space of apartments stands at 0.527 million sq

</P>
<P>
Experts said that the main reasons the houses are unoccupied is
because of the decline in group and individual purchasing ability.
</P>

By the end of October, the sales prices has reached 4,040 yuan
(486.7 US dollars) per square meter, 404 yuan(4.8 US dollars)

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Monday demanded South Korea's return of a
submarine and its crew "immediately and unconditionally", saying
that otherwise, the South Korean side "must bear responsibility
for all the consequencies arising therefrom".
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency said in a statement that in the
past two months, South Korea has refused to respond to DPRK's just
demand, ignoring DPRK's goodwill and the international community's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The submarine, carrying more than 20 people, ran aground on a
beach near South Korea's eastern coast of Kang Rung on September
18.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, a DPRK spokesman said that the submarine,
which went to sea for training, ran aground by accident after
suffering engine problems, and demanded the return by South Korea
of the submarine and its crew including the bodies of the dead.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in the past 50 days, South Korea has
sent armed forces and police to launch a manhunt for the survivors
from the submarine and some crewmen were killed.
</P>
<P>
It accused South Korea of making use of the submarine incident
to "block the North-South relations".
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "There is a limit to our self-restraint"
and the DPRK, as a victim, "can no longer tolerate" South Korea's
arrogance and unjustifiable act.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that South Korea apologize for the killing of the
DPRK crewmen and meet the DPRK's demand "as soon as possible and
unconditionally"; otherwise, the DPRK would retaliate.

pilot comprehensive trading conglomerate in the country.
</P>
<P>
The approving organizations include the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, and the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to enliven trade, the Chinese government
has approved a dozen such comprehensive conglomerates. China
National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation was the first to
become one of the experimental units.
</P>
<P>
Incorporated with five foreign trade companies two years ago,
Shanghai Dongfang has increased its assets from 2.1 billion yuan
(253 million US dollars) to 8.3 billion yuan, according to Wang
Zukang, the chairman of the conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
Its annual foreign trade volume reached 2.7 billion US dollars,
of which 1.8 billion US dollars were generated from export,
ranking third in the country.
</P>
<P>
Owing to diversified development, the group now has invested in
358 enterprises in and outside China, and has been involved in
manufacturing, domestic trade, cargo shipping, real estate
development, service and investment.
</P>
<P>
It has established business ties with over 120 countries and
regions in Asia, Europe, and America.
</P>
<P>
The group recently accepted five Shanghai-based companies as
new members, including Shanghai Municipal Foreign Trade Co. Ltd.,
Yongfeng Co. Ltd., Jinma Real Estate Co. Ltd., Shanghai Dongbao
Department Store Co. Ltd.. and a foreign economic and technical
cooperation company.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Central government believe that it is of
strategic importance for Shanghai, which is a major economic
center and a foreign trade port, to develop large trading groups.

<HEADLINE> China Has 9,000-Strong Chain Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China has more than 9,000
chain stores and the figure is on rise, according to the latest
statistics by the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
With its low-price and big-sales strategy, China's chain
business has grown rapidly since 1995, and has been warmly
welcomed by the country's majority of low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Each of the chain stores usually has more than 2,000 kinds of
commodities, mostly daily necessities, while some supermarkets
sell 3,000-5,000 types of goods, providing greater purchasing
opportunities for customers than the traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
Most of the chain stores are located in newly-built residential
areas and the surrounding outlying regions of urban and rural
areas. And the majority of these have extended their business time
from the traditional eight hours to ten -- or even round-the-clock.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai alone, over 40 foreign-funded chain stores have
been set up, aiming to have a bigger market share in China's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
Shopping in chain stores is now trendy for Shanghai residents,
with statistics showing 40 percent of life's daily necessities are
bought in these stores.

<HEADLINE> China Builds 20 New Grain Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Central and local governments
in China will invest 2.13 billion yuan before the turn of the
century to build 20 large grain production bases.
</P>
<P>
They will be built in ten provinces, including the major grain
producers of Heilongjiang, Shandong and Henan, China's leading
newspaper "People's Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated 200 million yuan so far
this year to support construction of grain bases.
</P>
<P>
Grain output of the 20 bases is expected to increase by 10
million tons, to a total of 90 million tons, after completion in
2000. The bases, which comprise about 15 percent of the country's
grain area, will serve as major forces to stabilize China's grain
production and guarantee sufficient commodity grain supply, said
an official with the State Planning Commission.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Promotes Oceanic Utilization, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The city of Xiamen in
southeast China's coastal Fujian Province plans to work out a
series of local regulations to promote the rational use and
protection of the offshore area, including a permit system to
supervise oceanic development.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen has also established a leading group for oceanic
management, which is fully in charge of coordinating development
and management of the oceanic economy.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hong Huasheng from the Ocean and Environment
Institute at Xiamen University told the ongoing 24th World
Conference on Oceanic Peace in Beijing that the local government
is strongly aware of the importance of sustainable ocean
development.
</P>
<P>
The group is charged with coordinating the oceanic development,
utilization and protection, and has invited experts to give advice
on policy-making.
</P>
<P>
Hong said that with the rapid economic development and oceanic
development in China's coastal cities, oceanic pollution is
becoming more and more serious, and the oceanic ecology has also
been damaged. This has become a major obstacle to sustained
economic development in coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen is one of the country's five special economic zones. It
has a coastal line of 254 kilometers and a sea area of 344 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the United Nations Development Program,
Xiamen started a five-year project for oceanic pollution control
and oceanic management in November, 1993.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Xiamen's annual gross domestic product has
increased by 20 percent, while its total discharged industrial
waste decreased markedly. The city's air quality and sea water
quality are of first-grade standard set by the state.
</P>
<P>
Arthur N Holcombe, resident representative of the UN
Development Program to China, praised Xiamen's achievements and
suggested other Chinese coastal cities and other Asian coastal
cities learn from its experience.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A brother-in-law of
Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen was shot dead by two
unidentified gunmen this morning, a police officer said.
</P>
<P>
Kov Samuth, deputy director of the Economy Department in the
Interior Ministry, whose wife was sister of Hun Sen's wife Bun
Rany Hun Sen, was hit by six bullets at 0800 local time (0100 GMT)
in front of the Boeung Kak restaurant on the Norodom Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
"Samuth came out after finishing his breakfast with his friends
and was unlocking his car parked in front of the restaurant when
the gunmen in civilian dresses fired at him," said Chea Sarin,
deputy director of the municipal military police.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen drove away on a motorbike. The body of the victim
was brought to the Calmettee hospital, only to be found dead,
Sarin added.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's adviser for information Om Yen Ting said that the
killing was "politically motivated," while some other officials
suggested that the incident occurred because of conflict in
personal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Cargo Transport Across Straits Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 representatives
from the airline business and civil aviation bodies from both
sides of the Taiwan Straits attended a symposium on air cargo
transport across the Straits which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, sponsored by the Transport Committee
of the China Civil Aviation Society, is a professional conference
designed to promote cooperation between cargo transport businesses
from both sides of the Straits, and to explore the feasibility of
opening direct cargo flights between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Passengers using a single ticket have been able to travel
between China's inland areas and Taiwan over the past year,
although a change of planes is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The China-funded Air Macao, by initiating flights to Taipei and
Kaohsiung, is now able to carry cross-straits passengers on a
single airliner via Macao.
</P>
<P>
However, through-cargo traffic and cooperation between cargo
transport businesses of the two sides is virtually non-existent.
</P>
<P>
The symposium participants agreed that a forum for contacts and
discussion will play an active role in advancing the development
of the air cargo transport market across the straits, as well as
stimulating cooperation between the businesses of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Communications has issued a set of
regulations on direct shipping business across the Straits, which
is regarded as another major step to accelerate the direct air,
sea and mail links between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> India to Revamp EPCG Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- India's Commerce Ministry is
planning to revamp the export promotion capital goods (EPCG)
scheme to make it more attractive for manufacturer-exporters,
ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes include the introduction of a zero duty
facility without any cap on imports, computing export obligations
in proportion to the actual imports, and giving special weighting
to the companies that fulfill export obligations before the
stipulated period.
</P>
<P>
In case an EPCG license holder sources capital goods from a
domestic supplier, the export obligation would be in proportion to
the value of goods sourced domestically and not the value of the
capital goods permitted to be imported.
</P>
<P>
The present EPCG scheme envisages that capital goods can be
imported at a 15-percent import duty with an export obligation of
four times the cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value of the
imported goods within a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes have been initiated following the demand
of the exporting houses which said the EPCG scheme has lost its
attractiveness due to the reduced custom tariffs.
</P>
<P>
In 1990-91 when the scheme was first introduced, the import
tariff in general was over 200 percent. Now, the average import
duty stands at about 25 percent and the maximum duty 50 percent,
the same sources said.

<HEADLINE> Air-India Installing TACAS in Its Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Air-India (A-I) is in the
process of equipping all its 11 airbus planes with collision
avoidance equipment, A-I sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Its fleet of 17 Boeing 747 aircraft is already fitted with the
traffic alert collision avoidance system (TACAS).
</P>
<P>
The installation of TACAS aboard aircraft has assumed greater
significance in the wake of the mid-air collision near Indian
capital New Delhi between a Saudi Arabia Boeing 747 and a Kazakh
1l-76 transport aircraft on November 12 killing all 351 people
aboard the aircraft. Even if one of them had been fitted with this
system, the collision could have been averted.
</P>
<P>
The fully computerized system involves display of an area
around the aircraft within which any foreign object cannot venture
without being picked up by the TACAS. This area is defined by an
ultrasound shield. As soon as any plane or bird enters this zone,
the system sets up an alarm, and the object shows up on the
display monitor. The system is also capable of identifying the
direction from which the object is approaching the aircraft.
Better still, it guides the pilot on how to avert a collision by
indicating whether he should climb, descend or turn to another
angle. The alarm does not die down till the requisite action has
been taken and the aircraft is out of danger.
</P>
<P>
No plane in the united states is allowed to enter its skies
unless it has TACAS aboard.

<HEADLINE> Injuries-Laden Deng Yaping Vows to Fight On (2-last) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chinese has commanded respect and revere among
table tennis players.
</P>
<P>
"She had a killing instinct and held me in awe," lamented
Swedish Asa Svensson after losing a round-robin match to Deng in
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Being aggressive is the only way for Deng to prevail.
</P>
<P>
Standing just one meter fourty nine, Deng has to take
initiative in attacking. Once forced into defensive, she can
hardly turn the table.
</P>
<P>
Deng's father taught her to play table tennis when she could
barely held the racket at age 5. Adapting to her short stature,
she uses the tennis grip with her right hand to play a fast
attacking game interspersed with loops.
</P>
<P>
Deng kept close to the table to set up continuous attacks,
bringing out the characteristic features of the Chinese game --
ferocity, speed, accuracy and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
There is a popular saying that Deng has benefited from her
short figure because she sees every return as high ball and can
easily make a kill.
</P>
<P>
Deng begged to disagree.
</P>
<P>
"Tall player always has an advantage," she said. "I have to
make a quick killing shot before opponent forces me into rallies
or defensive. There is simply too much wear on my body."
</P>
<P>
Deng's racket is surfaced with inverted rubber for forehand
play and with long-pimpled rubber for backhand strokes, the latter
she uses only as a transitional means before making an attack.
</P>
<P>
Play with long-pimpled rubber, a weapon invented by the Chinese
and more used by defender than attacker, can produce deceptive
spin. Deng's unique block-and-attack style often caught her
rivals nonplused at the beginning of her career.
</P>
<P>
But with more players accustomed to her style, Deng found it
increasingly difficult to win a title. She is no longer
invincible in China, nor in the world.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Barcelona Olympic Games, Deng lost three times to
a Chinese penholding player. In the tune-up tournaments for the
Atlanta Games, she lost to five different teammates.
</P>
<P>
"Deng had once felt frustrated," recalled Chinese coach Lu
Yuansheng. "But she regained confidence after improving the
precision and ferocity of forehand attacks through hard training."
</P>
<P>
The most-hyped defeat of Deng Yaping came at the 1994 Asian
Games in Hiroshima, Japan, where the odds-on favorite lost the
singles final to Chire Koyama, who had won a world championship
for China in her maiden name of He Zhili before joining the
Japanese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The snatch of the Olympic singles gold in Atlanta is the
sweetest moment for Deng Yaping.
</P>
<P>
Held to two-all, Deng kept composure to beat Chinese Taipei's
Chen Jing in the deciding set, allowing just five points to the
1988 Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
Off court, Deng Yaping is a kind, polite and book-loving
lady. She is a consistent donor to the Hope Project, a national
fund to help dropouts resume schooling.
</P>
<P>
This summer, Deng alone sponsored six former dropouts to return
to school and donated parts of her cash awards to victims of flood
in South China.
</P>
<P>
World No. 2 Qiao Hong, Deng's doubles partner as well as her
closest rival, gets along with Deng well, saying the honest and
forthright Deng makes a good friend.
</P>
<P>
As more Chinese table tennis players have joined gold rush
overseas, either playing for foreign clubs or even switching their
citizenship, Deng remains home-bound.
</P>
<P>
"I doesn't have a plan to join foreign club, neither will I
change my allegiance to China," she said.

<HEADLINE> Injuries-Laden Deng Yaping Vows to Fight On (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- From neck to back, wrist to
elbow, knees to ankles, rarely a joint in her body is
injury-free. She can hardly pick up chopsticks for meal after an
extra session of training she pushes on herself.
</P>
<P>
National champion at 13, Asian champion at 15, world champion
at 16, dual Olympic champion at 19, double Olympic titlist again
and World Cup winner at 23. She's got them all, but she won't
rest on the laurels.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping, the most-crowned table tennis player in the world,
vows to fight on.
</P>
<P>
"I won't retire soon even though I often feel worn-out and
badly want a rest," said Deng, who has bagged 14 world titles and
four Olympic gold medals in a career spanning 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who grabbed the inaugural women's World Cup late
September, is to defend her world singles title for the second
straight time in the 1997 championships in Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
She also eyes one more gold in the 2000 Olympics, brushing off
suggestion from friends that she should withdraw at the apex of
career to avoid possible humiliation.
</P>
<P>
"My personal fame or shame doesn't matter," she said. "If my
country needs me, I won't call it quits."
</P>
<P>
Certainly China needs players like Deng. Nerves steady, style
aggressive and ranked world No. 1 for a sport's record of six
years, Deng is hardly replaceable.
</P>
<P>
"A few Chinese youngsters may be technically better than Deng.
But in terms of mentality and experience, there is no match," said
Zhang Xielin, Deng's mentor for eight years.
</P>
<P>
China is never short of young and good women players. Wang
Chen, 21, Yang Ying, 18, and Wang Nan, 18, are from fifth to
seventh in the latest world rankings. But they will have to
toughen their nerves before they take international responsibility.
</P>
<P>
After an unimpressive European tour by these youngsters early
this year, none of them made the Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
Deng and other three veterans, the same four Olympians to
Barcelona, hit on the road to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"To find someone to take place of Deng Yaping is a problem,"
said Yao Zhenxu, a top official with the Chinese Table Tennis
Association.
</P>
<P>
"Deng is the toughest-minded and the most hardworking in the
Chinese team," Yao added.

In the training camps leading to the 1996 Olympics, Deng had
spent more time close to table than any other Atlanta-bound
athletes. She had to change her sweat-soaked clothes five or six
times for a two-session training day.
</P>
<P>
Years of Spartan training and nerve-racking competitions have
taken a toll on Deng, who has, more than once, sprained her
ankles, strained her back, twisted her wrist and injured her knees.
</P>
<P>
"Deng deserves all these titles," said Zhang Xielin. "She has
paid far more than anyone else."
</P>
<P>
Steel nerves under pressure is an asset for Deng and has
carried her through numerous difficult times.
</P>
<P>
"The pressure means one has to concentrate on each ball, have
the will to win and not let a single ball go astray," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Rockslides Hamper Rescue of Trapped Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Continual rockslides have made
rescue work extremely difficult for firemen and specialists who
are trying to rescue two workers trapped in a mine.
</P>
<P>
The miners are trapped inside a gold mine whose passageways
collapsed after the strong November 12 earthquake which struck the
province of Nasca, in the southern department of Ica.
</P>
<P>
Remote teledetection equipment, the size of a package of
cigarettes, was to be used here today to locate a route which
would lead rescuers to the trapped miners more quickly.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Copp, a United States rescue and first aid expert, has
joined the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
The two trapped men have been banging on the walls of the
shafts so they can be located. The rescue teams have set up a camp
with electric generators, medical equipment, cots and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The rescue effort has been hampered by continual rock and mud
slides which are preventing the firemen and the rescue teams from
the Centromin-Peru Company from reaching the spot where both
workers are presumed to be trapped.
</P>
<P>
A new slide occurred Sunday after a quake which shook Nasca
in the early hours. Rescue work was suspended for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
About 300 soldiers were to help today in the cleanup and
rebuilding of Nasca. Army engineers have also joined in repairing
damaged roads and houses.

WELLINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- All the three parties
involved in the talks to form a coalition in New Zealand today
dismissed speculation about who New Zealand First favors to be its
partner.
</P>
<P>
Winston Peters, leader of New Zealand First which is crucial
for forming the next government, said the two parties New Zealand
First is now talking with, the National Party and the Labor
Party, have an even chance in working with his party.
</P>
<P>
He said suggestions that his party is leaning toward National
rather than Labor in coalition talks are just mindless
speculation.
</P>
<P>
Peters had another round of talks with National this afternoon.
He declared that he still does not have a favored partner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Party leader Jim Bolger denied a report
that National may delay the new round of tax cuts scheduled to
start in July next year to meet New Zealand First's demand for
more government spending.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Helen Clark also dismissed suggestions that
National is now the favorite, saying her party still has a good
chance to form the next government.

SANTIAGO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chile was ranked by
international experts as one of the seven Latin American countries
with the lowest investment risk and the highest economic growth
for the year 1997.
</P>
<P>
With a predicted 5.8 percent increase in the gross domestic
product and the lowest risk, Chile will be the most attractive
country for investment in Latin America, a study of the Chamber of
Commerce said today.
</P>
<P>
However, international investors are advised to decrease their
investment in the country's stock market. Chile and Mexico are
considered the least appealing as far as stock earnings are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Among other Latin American countries, Colombia follows Chile
with an estimated high growth rate of 4.9 percent and an
acceptable low level of risk.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Cabinet Subject to Quota System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The cabinet line-up of the
Thai coalition led by the New Aspiration Party (NAP) will remain
subject to the quota system, coalition sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The NAP won 125 of the 393 parliamentary seats in Sunday's
general elections and has the mandate to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of six parties, which command a total of 221 seats in
parliament, signed a joint declaration on Monday announcing their
intention to form a coalition with NAP leader Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Included in the government is the Chart Pattana (National
Development) party, led by former Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan, which won 52 seats in the election.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said that the Chart Pattana party will be active in
the country's economic and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The other four parties in the coalition are Social Action (20
seats), Prachkorn Thai (Thai Citizen, 18 seats), Seritham (Liberal
Democratic, four seats) and Muan Chon (Mass, two seats).
</P>
<P>
With a ratio of one ministerial post for five MPs, the NAP
would take 24 cabinet posts, Chart Pattana 10, Social Action and
Prachkorn Thai four each, and one each for the other two parties,
leaving seven posts for non-MPs competent in economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
A full Thai cabinet has 51 ministerial posts.
</P>
<P>
It will take a few days to work out detailed post allocations
among the coalition parties, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat party, with 123 seats, was only two seats behind
the NAP, losing the chance to lead a government.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Ink Trade Pacts With 7 APEC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will sign
bilateral trade agreements with seven member economies of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum during the November
22-26 APEC meetings held in the country.
</P>
<P>
The seven APEC economies are the United States, Singapore,
Canada, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan, Director of the
Bureau of International Trade Relations Edna Espos said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Espos said the agreements, aimed at enhancing trade, will be on
top of the investment agreements that will be forged with the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and the U.S. have two standing trade issues,
one on intellectual property rights and the other on garments.
Espos did not say whether the agreements will address these
issues.
</P>
<P>
The accord with Singapore will be the first one since the
normalization of bilateral relations this July. Relations between
the two countries had been strained over the hanging of a
Philippine maid under a Singaporean court conviction last year.
</P>
<P>
Espos said the accord will mainly involve the country's
participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial
meeting to be hosted by Singapore in December.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Canada is in preparation for the coming of a
Canadian business mission to the Philippines, while the pact with
Australia seeks to strengthen the Philippines' agricultural
program under the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Espos did not provide details on the other agreements to be
signed with Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan but said these will
involve mainly trade enhancement measures along the line of APEC.

<HEADLINE> Transcript of Crashed ValuJet Plane Recording Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The transcript of the final
minutes recording in the May 11 crashed Valujet Flight 592 shows
that fire was filling the cockpit and passenger cabin before it
went down into the Everglades near Miami, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The transcript was released today as National Transportation
Safety Board hearings began into the crash that killed 110 people.
</P>
<P>
According to the transcript, the tower air traffic controller
was asking what the problem was soon after the pilots talked about
a problem. He was told, "Smoke in the cockpit... smoke in the
cabin." The tower gives instructions to descend, as the plane
attempts to return to Miami airport.
</P>
<P>
At one point, a flight attendant is heard saying: "We need
oxygen. We can't get oxygen back there."
</P>
<P>
"We're on fire! We're on fire!" one man screamed. "Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!" some women cried.
</P>
<P>
The last recorded voice from the plane before it crashed is
that of a crew member telling the tower, "We need the, uh, closest
airport available."
</P>
<P>
The eight-minute recording ends with the sounds of rushing air,
fearing that it was from an open cockpit window venting smoke.
</P>
<P>
A separate report issued today disclosed that Phoenix-based
SabreTech, ValuJet's Miami maintenance company, committed a series
of mistakes in handling the more than 150 oxygen canisters. The
canisters were carried in the DC-9's cargo hold that are suspected
of igniting the fire.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that a stock clerk, who did not know what
oxygen generators were, weighed five boxes of them and labeled
them for shipment to ValuJet's headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that shipping caps are supposed to be
installed on the canisters to prevent them from activating by
accident, but none was requested by mechanics.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Keep 10,000 Troops in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov said here Monday that the Russian Federation would
keep about 10,000 troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency said half the troops belonged to the
Interior Ministry and the others were provided by the Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The total withdrawl of Russian troops from Chechnya meant
Russia would lose the republic, said Kulikov. He said the issue
was still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who has held hard-line attitudes toward the issue
of Chechen conflict, did not comment on the interim agreement
reached between President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya, Ivan
Rybkin, and Chechen leaders last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There are no details about the agreement, which was due to be
signed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chechen
government leader Aslan Maskhakov. But Moscow did not give full
independence to Chechnya and wanted to keep forces in the region
as a sign of its presence there, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
About 800 out of the 2,500 Russian police, who were stationed
in Chechnya, would also stay in the rebel republic, Kulikov said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. JEC Meeting Begins in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. Joint
Economic Committee began its ninth meeting here today to discuss
macro-economic policies and management, financial market and
control, economic cooperation, trade and investment of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and U.S. Secretary of
Treasury Robert Rubin co-chaired the meeting held before
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Beijing
later this month.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Liu recalled the developments of
economic cooperation between the two countries in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and the United States have enormous common
interests in wide-ranging areas. A normal, healthy and stable
bilateral relationship is not only in the interests of the two
peoples, but also beneficial to peace, stability and prosperity of
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that so long as the two sides take equal and pragmatic
attitude and resolve differences through consultations and
dialogues on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving
differences, the bilateral economic relationship will proceed on a
healthy path.
</P>
<P>
He said economic cooperation between the two countries has a
great potential and vast prospects. Despite the differences, he
said, the common interests are far larger than differences.
</P>
<P>
"We should, therefore, strive to expand our common interests,
and not let the differences hamper our cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the atmosphere of Sino-U.S. relations has been
improved and there is a good chance for further improvement of
their relations.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Rubin said the U.S.-China economic
relations offer immense opportunities for both nations.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and China are among the largest economies in
the world; China's weight in the global economy is growing year by
year; and as that weight increases, our two nations will almost
inevitably have greater and greater economic impact on each
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that there are specific areas of disagreement
between the two countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Copper Prices Continue Upwards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The price of copper continued
to go up today in the London Metals Exchange to 1.03873 U.S.
dollars per pound, the highest price since mid-June, Chile's
Copper Commission (COCHILCO) announced today.
</P>
<P>
Today's quotation, which represents a 2.7 cent hike over the
Friday close, pushed the monthly average to 94.759 cents and the
yearly average to 1.03749 dollars.
</P>
<P>
COCHILCO analyst Alvaro Saavedra said, "We don't know what is
going to happen in the next few months. But in October we
estimated that the average price in 1997 could reach 95 cents and,
so far, we are maintaining that projection."
</P>
<P>
COCHILCO has projected an annual average of between 1.00 and
1.05 dollars per pound.
</P>
<P>
With the latest price hikes, the yearly average is approaching
the ceiling of that prediction.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the world's largest copper producer and exporter.

<HEADLINE> Hunger Spreading in Hungary: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A considerably large number
of people in the country are in hunger and malnutrition, of whom
300,000 are children, the newspaper Magyar Hirlap reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although there were no official statistics, the red cross
societies in the capital city and other places were reportedly
receiving a large number of letters every day requesting relief
food.
</P>
<P>
The worst situation was reported in the states of
Szaboles-Szatmar, Szalnole, Hajdu-Bihar and Pest.
</P>
<P>
In Hajdu-Bihar, many poverty-stricken villagers had to eat the
meat of sick or dead livestock.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition was most serious among children in primary schools
and kindergartens, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that at least 300,000 children out of the
country's 10 million population could not get enough food.
</P>
<P>
In the southern city of Pecs, more and more children could not
even afford a full meal in a day.
</P>
<P>
A physical check at a kindergarten in the northern city of
Salgotarjan revealed that the kids' weight dropped while their
height increased with age.
</P>
<P>
The paper called on the society to try to resolve the issue
caused by growing unemployment and deteriorating economy in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Peace Expected in Chiapas in Early 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government and
the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) guerrillas could
sign a peace agreement at the beginning of 1997, the legislative
Harmony and Pacification Committee (Cocopa) said today.
</P>
<P>
Cocopa member Guillermo del Rio said the committee was
optimistic that talks between the two sides would resume before
the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between the government and the EZLN were
called off in September by the guerrillas who said that
the government delegation was not negotiating seriously and that
it had not complied with the agreements previously agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his meeting with Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet,
del Rio underlined the will of both sides for consolidating peace
while preserving justice and dignity for the southeastern state of
Chiapas, which is the base of the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The document was almost in the drafting stage, which would
record the agreements reached by the two parties during previous
talks, said del Rio.
</P>
<P>
In January 1994, a rebel Indian group declared war on the
government and seized towns in Chiapas. They said they wanted
democracy, better conditions for poor Indians and vindications for
their own culture. Later, they formed a liberation army.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China's winter sowing has
nearly come to an end, with the planting area of winter crops
reaching nearly 45.2 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The planting of winter wheat is basically finished, said an
official from the Ministry of Agriculture, adding that the south
China areas, such as Guangdong Province and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, are still busy planting oil-bearing crops,
vegetables and green manure crops.
</P>
<P>
The winter crops include mostly oil-bearing crops and winter
wheat, which are planted by the majority of farmers, and will be
harvested next summer.
</P>
<P>
"What we planted is not only the seeds of next year's summer
grain but also the hope for a good agriculture harvest for the
whole year," said a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
China has outlined a plan to harvest 111.5 billion to 112.5
billion kilograms of summer grain next year.
</P>
<P>
This year's output of summer grain in China reached a record
110 billion kilograms, and that of early rice, 44 billion
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The grain output of all of 1996 is expected to hit 480 billion
kilograms, a record high for two consecutive years.

<HEADLINE> Landmine Attack Foiled in N. Ireland by UK Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The British police foiled a
terrorist landmine attack on a security patrol near the city of
Londonderry in Northern Ireland last Saturday, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The RUC said that a search in Londonderry had revealed
preparations for a strike against a security force patrol.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that a hole had been dug into a roadside
bank and that command wire and a pair of pliers were found
nearby. Two suspects had been arrested and were being questioned.
</P>
<P>
The search began last Saturday in the Springtown Road-Groarty
Road area after people were seen acting suspiciously, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was
suspected of being responsible for the aborted attack, but the IRA
made no comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The IRA broke a 17-month truce in February and resumed a war
against the British rule in Northern Ireland since then.

"China still has a large step to take before it fulfills its
harvest target of 490-500 billion kilograms of grain by the year
2000," the official said, adding that "the country has paid close
attention, and will pay more, to sowing every year and every
season."
</P>
<P>
He said this year's successful winter planting has laid a
strong foundation for a good harvest of next year's summer grain.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievements to farmers' enthusiasm for grain
production, advantageous weather and the spreading of the use of
advanced farming techniques in the planting season.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 38 percent of the country's ten major
wheat producers have been provided with good seeds, six percent
higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the areas where other planting techniques were
practiced, such as the use of machinery and of manure for
fertilizer, also witnessed rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the current condition is good for wheat
seedlings, and the supply of farming materials, such as chemical
fertilizers and pesticides, is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern over the need to raise the per-unit
yielding of crops, noting that in some areas of the country, that
per-unit yield is very low. Statistics show that last year, the
gap between the lowest and the highest per-hectare yield was 4,500
kilograms.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. JEC Meeting Begins in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. Joint
Economic Committee began its ninth meeting here today to discuss
macro-economic policies and management, financial market and
control, economic cooperation, trade and investment of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and U.S. Secretary of
Treasury Robert Rubin co-chaired the meeting held before
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Beijing
later this month.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Liu recalled the developments of
economic cooperation between the two countries in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and the United States have enormous common
interests in wide-ranging areas. A normal, healthy and stable
bilateral relationship is not only in the interests of the two
peoples, but also beneficial to peace, stability and prosperity of
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that so long as the two sides take equal and pragmatic
attitude and resolve differences through consultations and
dialogues on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving
differences, the bilateral economic relationship will proceed on a
healthy path.
</P>
<P>
He said economic cooperation between the two countries has a
great potential and vast prospects. Despite the differences, he
said, the common interests are far larger than differences.
</P>
<P>
"We should, therefore, strive to expand our common interests,
and not let the differences hamper our cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the atmosphere of Sino-U.S. relations has been
improved and there is a good chance for further improvement of
their relations.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Rubin said the U.S.-China economic
relations offer immense opportunities for both nations.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and China are among the largest economies in
the world; China's weight in the global economy is growing year by
year; and as that weight increases, our two nations will almost
inevitably have greater and greater economic impact on each
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that there are specific areas of disagreement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The key is not to let individual disagreements affect the
overall relationship, and to work constructively to resolve
disagreements whenever possible," he noted.

each other's economic views ... we can move forward in a pragmatic

<TEXT>

<P>
GENEVE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- FIFA, world soccer's governing
 body, said on Monday it would not involve the Portuguese
Football Federation's investigation into allegations of bribery
and match-fixing.
</P>
<P>
A report said that following a 75 minute meeting with Gilberto
Madahil, chairman of the Portuguese federation, FIFA general
secretary Sepp Blatter indicated he was satisfied with the way the
investigation was proceeding.
</P>
<P>
"This is an internal matter and FIFA will not get involved,"
said Blatter, adding that it was the Portuguese federation that
sought the meeting and not FIFA.
</P>
<P>
"We've taken note of the problems and the Portuguese
federation deserves our complete trust and time to investigate. We
appeal to the media to give the authorities time to do their job."
</P>
<P>
Madahil is scheduled to fly to Amsterdam on Tuesday where he
will meet with UEFA officials to discuss the allegations.
</P>
<P>
UEFA, however, having demanded a thorough investigation of
the various charges and accusations, may require greater
assurances from the Portuguese federation that it is capable
handling the matter on its own.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese soccer has been plunged into crisis by the
allegations that Porto sought to bribe a referee ahead of a Cup
Winners' Cup semifinal match against Aberdeen 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Businessman Fernando Barata has told police that he was asked
to approach the Romanian referee in charge of the game and offer
him money to secure a 3-0 win for the Portuguese side in the home
leg.
</P>
<P>
Porto won both legs 1-0. Both Porto and the match official
have denied any bribery attempt was made.
</P>
<P>
Porto are also at the center of another controversy over the
payment of a holiday in Brazil for referee Carlos Calheiros in
the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The club has officially admitted that it picked up the
700,000 escudo ($4,600) bill but says that it did so without

<HEADLINE> Slovak Economy Expected to Grow by 6 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak economy is expected
to grow by at least six percent this year, with inflation and
unemployment continuing to drop compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate is
estimated by government officials to be six percent, about 1.4
percentage points less than last year. The Slovak GDP growth rate
last year amounted to 550 billion crowns (18.3 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate has continued to drop from 7.3 percent for
the previous year to 5.3 percent for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has dropped to 11.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials described the country's currency as stable, the
market as brisk and the foreign exchange reserve as growing.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve stands at 4.88 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The economy is still faced with irrational structural problems,
loss-making firms and a huge trade deficit, estimated at 35.3
billion crowns. Last year there was a trade surplus of 1.8 billion
crowns.
</P>
<P>
Eighty to 90 percent of the production capacity of the
country's machinery and military industries remains idle, meaning
production far exceeds market demands.
</P>
<P>
The military industry, whose output accounted for 19 billion
crowns in 1988, or about 40 percent of the total annual industrial
output, shrank to 1.4 billion crowns in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the two sluggish industries were mainly responsible
for the the country's economic slump and high unemployment rates
in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Czech Economy Develops Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The economy of the Czech
Republic has developed smoothly so far this year, with the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) increasing 4.3 percent in the first nine
months.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output went up by 8.4 percent in the first nine
months of this year, and the country's grain yield of 6.66 million
tons was an increase of 72,000 tons compared with that of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly of the Czech Republic, the country's parliament,
has recently set a goal of lowering the foreign debt to 155,7
billion Koruna (about 5.8 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of
1996. The present foreign debt is 160.9 billion Koruna (about six
billion dollars), which has made the country one of the least
indebted in Europe.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last June, the Czech Republic had absorbed
foreign investment of 458 million dollars, an increase of 17.1
percent over the same period last year, bringing the total foreign
investment in the country to 6.039 billion dollars since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, which is seen as the minimum risk country
for foreign investment in central-east Europe, had a foreign
reserve of 16.594 billion dollars by the end of last July.
</P>
<P>
However, the country has been troubled by a deficit in foreign
trade since 1994, as well as the problem of loss-making
enterprises. The foreign trade deficit is expected to surpass 160
billion Koruna (about 5.98 billion dollars) this year.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Decides to Promote Cooperation With APEC Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has decided to
strengthen its scientific, technological and commercial ties with
members of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
during its fourth summit to be held in Manila, in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A Mexican official told Xinhua of these plans for the summit,
to be held November 24-26.
</P>
<P>
Leandro Arellano, the director-general of Asian-Pacific and
North American economic affairs for the Mexican Foreign Ministry,
said that to promote trade with other APEC members would be
Mexico's top priority at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Arellano, who will go to Manila as a member of President
Ernesto Zedillo's entourage, believes that setting up joint
ventures and making investments will be one of the feasible ways
of cooperation between his country and the Asian nations, China in
particular.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we should convince our businessmen on both
sides to do more business and form joint ventures. That is more
important," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that President Ernesto Zedillo would
negotiate joint investment projects with China during his visit to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that for many years, Mexico has had magnificent
political-diplomatic relations with all the Asian-Pacific
countries but very little trade.
</P>
<P>
To attain the goal of intensifying cooperation with the region,
he noted, offices were established in nearly all the Asian-Pacific
countries to create an institutional network of formal Mexican
representation.
</P>
<P>
Mexico joined the APEC in November 1993 but did not participate
in any high-level meetings with the member nations and regions
until January 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mexico still needed to take a series of actions
before fully participating in the APEC.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Lawmakers Threaten to Impeach President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Belarus lawmakers threatened to
impeach President Alexander Lukashenko overnight, after over 70
deputies of the 199-seat parliament have formally backed putting
the impeachment issue to the ballot, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before an overnight break in an emergency parliament
session, Deputy Speaker Gennady Karpenko said the lawmakers have
formal grounds to launch impeachment procedures against the
president, charged with breaching the fundamaental law when
preparing a nationwide referendum on constitution.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting designed to discuss impeaching Lukashenko and
suspending the planned November 24 constitutional referendum, over
70 deputies signed a motion to impeach the president, the reports
said. Under the existing law, impeachment procedures can start if
at least 70 lawmakers sign a relevant motion.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court is to consider the head of state has
violated any provision of the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
It needs two-thirds of the deputies, or 133 out of 199, to vote
in favour to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
Today's session was attended only by 108 members of the
parliament. However, its speaker Semyon Sharetsky, who presided
over the meeting, said that the number was enough for a quorum and
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
He also said Lukashenko will be invited to meet the
parliament's leadership on Tuesday morning to discuss the crisis,
and asked the lawmakers to stay in the building overnight. The
session, which began on Monday afternoon, may be resumed on
Tuesday morning, the speaker told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Belarus Prime Minister Mikhail Chigir and Labour
Minister Alexander Sosnov offered to resign on Monday to protest
the president's standoff with the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko accepted the two high-ranking officials' resignation
overnight and appointed First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ling as
acting Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
The president and the parliament have been involved in a
dispute for several months over who of them should gain more
powers. They had agreed to decide the problem through the upcoming
nationwide referendum.

<HEADLINE> China Produces 21 Million Tons of Fertilizers In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- In the first 10 months of this
year, China produced 21.29 million tons of fertilizers, 89.1
percent of its annual target, and an increase of 10 percent over
the same 1995 period, according to a report from the Ministry of
Chemical Industry (MCI).
</P>
<P>
The report says that the country produced 2.17 million tons of
fertilizers in October, up 6.7 percent over the corresponding
period of 1995, but that with the production of fertilizers and
pesticides growing, marketing is increasingly difficult and
products are piling up.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Internal Trade, the country's
departments in charge of agricultural production purchased a total
of 59.83 million tons of fertilizers in the January-September
period, up 14.9 percent over the same period of 1995, and sold
122.48 million tons of fertilizers in the same period, up 3.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Unsold stocks soared to 20.68 million tons, up 46 percent over
the same 1995 period. Most of the products in stock are nitrogen
and phosphate fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The MCI report says that China produced 302,000 tons of
pesticides in the January-October period, fulfilling 131.3 percent
of the annual goal, an increase of 25.8 percent over the
corresponding period of 1995. The output of pesticides stood at
18,000 tons in October, down 2.2 percent.

LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- British police foiled a
terrorist landmine attack on a security patrol near the city of
Londonderry in Northern Ireland last Saturday, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The RUC said that a search in Londonderry had revealed
preparations for a strike against a security force patrol.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that a hole had been dug into a roadside
bank and that command wire and a pair of pliers were found nearby.
Two men had been arrested and were being questioned about it.
</P>
<P>
The search began on last Saturday in the Springtown
Road-Groarty Road area after people were seen acting suspiciously,
an official said.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was
suspected of being responsible for the aborted attack, but IRA
made no comment on the issue.
</P>

The IRA broke a 17-month truce in February and resumed a war
against the British rule in Northern Ireland since then.

<HEADLINE> Peru Rockslides Hamper Rescue of Trapped Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Continual rockslides have made
rescue work extremely difficult for firemen and specialists who
are trying to rescue two workers trapped in a mine.
</P>
<P>
The miners are trapped inside a gold mine whose passageways
collapsed after the strong November 12 earthquake which struck the
province of Nasca, in the southern department of Ica.
</P>
<P>
Remote teledetection equipment, the size of a package of
cigarettes, was to be used here today to locate a route which
would lead rescuers to the trapped miners more quickly.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Copp, a United States rescue and first aid expert, has
joined the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
The two trapped men have been banging on the walls of the
shafts so they can be located. The rescue teams have set up a camp
with electric generators, medical equipment, cots and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The rescue effort has been hampered by continual rock and mud
slides which are preventing the firemen and the rescue teams from
the Centromin-Peru Company from reaching the spot where both
workers are presumed to be trapped.
</P>
<P>
A new slide occurred Sunday after a quake which shook Nasca
in the early hours. Rescue work was suspended for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
About 300 soldiers were to help today in the cleanup and
rebuilding of Nasca. Army engineers have also joined in repairing
damaged roads and houses.

<HEADLINE> Minister: China to Step up Establishing Legal Assistance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China is scheduled to
improve its legal assistance system over the next five to ten
years, Justice Minister Xiao Yang said here Monday at the first
national seminar on legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said that a revised system, included in the Law of Criminal
Procedures and the Law of Lawyers, which is to take effect on
January 1, 1997, is designed to provide free or less expensive
legal services to the poor and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The new framework is an expansion of the current system, which
was initiated in January of 1994. It has been operating on a trial
basis in about 20 cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the deepening of China's reform and the
further development of the socialist market economy call for the
establishment of the improved legal assistance system.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the new program is an important part of
socialist culture and ideology in terms of its emphasis on helping
the poor and the disabled, improving the social security system
and promoting justice.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that a national legal assistance agency is
expected to be established, in a move to regulate and coordinate
the work of legal assistance across the country. A legal
assistance foundation is scheduled to be set up, he added.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Vows to Win All World Heavyweight Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Former WBC title holder Lennox
Lewis of Britain vowed on Monday to win all four world heavyweight
stitle.
</P>
<P>
His ambitious campaign to make heavyweight history is designed
to take a year-and-a-half and will begin in the New Year against
Oliver McCall for the vacant WBC crown.
</P>
<P>
Then he will turn his attention to Evander Holyfield (WBS),
Michael Moorer (IBF) and London's Henry Akinwande (WBC).
</P>
<P>
More opportunities for Lewis have emerged following Tyson's
defeat to Holyfield which reduced the negotiating power of
promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
And Lewis declared on Monday: "My ambition is to win all four
titles. I think Holyfield thinks he's the best in the world, but
realises there is something missing.
</P>
<P>
"He's boxed Riddick Bowe three times and now beaten the mighty
Mike Tyson. But he hasn't boxed Lennox Lewis yet.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he can retire without boxing me. Holyfield has a
big ego. He's got all the money, but his ego will make him want to
fight me.
</P>
<P>
"And I think Evander will come to me, I don't think I'll have
to go chasing him."
</P>
<P>
After a recent court victoy over King, Lewis will now meet
McCall, the only man to beat him as a professional, in January or
February.
</P>
<P>
"If Tyson had a belt at the moment, yes," said Lewis. "But he
doesn't have a belt, so there's no need to fight him.
</P>
<P>
"The aura of Tyson has gone, he has been beaten in a sense. I'm
not rushing after him."

SANTIAGO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The price of copper continued
to go up today in the London Metals Exchange to 1.03873 U.S.
dollars per pound, the highest price since mid-June, Chile's
Copper Commission (COCHILCO) announced today.
</P>
<P>
Today's quotation, which represents a 2.7 cent hike over the

yearly average to 1.03749 dollars.
</P>
<P>
COCHILCO analyst Alvaro Saavedra said, "We don't know what is
going to happen in the next few months. But in October we
estimated that the average price in 1997 could reach 95 cents and,
so far, we are maintaining that projection."
</P>
<P>
COCHILCO has projected an annual average of between 1.00 and
1.05 dollars per pound.
</P>
<P>
With the latest price hikes, the yearly average is approaching
the ceiling of that prediction.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pak President On Pakistan's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari said here today that no matter who comes to power after
next year's elections, Pakistan will enjoy a stable internal
situation.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of foreign correspondents this evening,
Leghari said that after the dismissal of the government led by
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the press has become "freer
and freer".
</P>
<P>
"Now, the judiciary of Pakistan is more independent than
before, " he added.
</P>
<P>
There is a national consensus on the accountability process in
which those corrupted official will be punished, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ensure the elections to be held freely and fairly,
all the officials from the caretaker central and provincial
government will not contest the next polls, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If they want to contest the elections, they must quit their
positions in the caretaker governments," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Caretaker government will implement a series of structural
reforms in the next three months, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will cut the size of the government from 48 divisions to 31
divisions, and start a complete review of many suspected
projects," he added.
</P>
<P>
The interim government will increase the investment in the
education to raise the literacy rate which stands only at 35
percent now, he said.
</P>
<P>
The interim government will put the focus of the economic
reforms on the agricultural and the manufacturing sectors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Leghari said that the economic
cooperation between Pakistan and other countries will not be
affected by the political change in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will also not change its foreign policy despite the
change of governments, he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Leghari said," I don't want to be the
executive head of Pakistan, and the head should be the prime
minister and his cabinet."
</P>
<P>
Responding to another question, Leghari said, "I don't want to
create a political party of my own."
</P>
<P>
The so-called emerging King's party reported by some newspapers
is totally baseless, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Leghari also gave detailed reasons on
his decision to dissolve Benazir's government.

<HEADLINE> China on Role of UN in Field of Peace-keeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese diplomat said
on Monday that China is of the view that the leading role of the
U.N. in the field of peace-keeping operations should not be
weakened.
</P>
<P>
Councilor He Yafei said that peace-keeping operations should be
mandated by the Security Council and subject to the Council's
political guidance and that they must be implemented by the
Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
"Replacing multilateral with unilateral mechanism and the U.N.
with another organization, bypassing or even rising above the U.N.
will only seriously weaken the peace-keeping capacity of the U.N.
and undermine its reputation and image," he warned in a speech to
the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly (Special Political
and Decolonization).
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Committee of the General Assembly is having a
meeting today on the various subjects relating to the U.N.
peace-keeping operations. Among them the role of the United
Nations and shortage of funds attracted a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
On the funds shortage, He said the problem was caused by
delayed payment of their assessed contributions by a number of
countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, it is thought-provoking that some countries,
on the one hand, shrink resources available to the U.N. by
withholding payment of their assessed contributions, forcing the
Department of Peace-keeping Operations to drastically reduce its
staff, while on the other hand, send large numbers of loaned
officers to the U.N. Peace-keeping Department to improve its
working capacity.
</P>
<P>
He charged that it has changed the composition of the
department in a way most unfavorable to developing countries and
also seriously undermined the provision in the Charter that
stipulates for respect for the exclusively international
character of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and
the staff.

<HEADLINE> Global Beef Market in Depression in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The world market for beef
witnessed depression in the year 1996 with prices down in major
markets due to the impact of the "mad cow" panic, and would see no
recovery in the short term, according to a World Trade
Organization (WTO) report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pace of cattle liquidation in the United States also
contributed to the low price level, said the WTO annual report on
the international market for meats.
</P>
<P>
To exporters, the only good news was expected strong import
demand from Russia, and in particular, continued double-digit
growth in beef imports of Korea and Japan. WTO expected Japan to
import over 1 million tons of beef this year, up 10 percent from
1995, replacing the United States as the world's largest beef
importer.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report noted a sharp decline in consumption of beef in
the European Union since outbreak of the "mad cow" crisis in
March. According to it, EU should still make efforts to restore
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, many people fear that they would contract fatal
human brain disorder from eating infected beef and have thus
turned to chicken, pork and lamb.
</P>
<P>
WTO figured that the 15 EU countries as a whole would export
about 1 million tons of beef in 1996, the same as in 1995, while
importing 450,000 tons, 2 percent down from 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, low domestic price and weaker dollar were
making this world's largest beef importer for years a net exporter
of beef in volume terms, the first time since 1945.
</P>
<P>
WTO estimates put the U.S. overseas sale of beef around 962,000
tons in 1996, a 16.5 percent increase over 1995, following
Australia and EU. Its imports would drop from 954,000 tons in 1995
to this year's 943,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Low prices also helped block Australia and New Zealand to
exploit wider market access for beef in U.S. resulting from the
Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks.
</P>
<P>
Australian producers also suffered from drought, giving chance
to New Zealand to raise its market share in Korea and Japan. Beef
exports of Australia in 1996 was figured at 1.08 million tons, 1
percent less than in 1995, continuing the lead in the field.
</P>
<P>
As a result of adverse weather conditions, declining demand at
home and from EU, its major overseas customer, Argentina was
expected to see a steep 17 percent drop from last year in its beef
exports to 425,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In South America, beef exports of Brazil and Uruguay were
predicted to increase by 38 percent and 26 percent over 1995 to
reach 290,000 tons and 180,000 tons respectively.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Opposition Parties Hold Rally in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav opposition
coalition Zajedno (Together) held a rally Monday in the center of
Belgrade to voice their doubt on the correctness of the counting
of Sunday's votes.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the gathering, the coalition leaders urged the
demonstrators to gather in front of the building where the city
electoral commission was counting votes so as to protest against
the incorrectness of its work, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders then entered the building in a manner
"inappropriate to democratic principles" and interrupted the
commission's session, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The President of the electoral commission Radomir Lazarevic
said he urged the coalition leaders to cease pressure and enable
the commission to complete its work in line with the law but they
just showed their indifference.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows which party has won the local elections until the
electoral commission makes public the results," Lazarevic said,
adding there had been complaints at some polling stations and that
the deadline for presenting requests for investigating the
irregularity of the polls had not yet expired.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of the opposition Democratic Party
Slobodan Vuksanovic said Monday that the coalition Zajedno, which
comprises four major opposition parties in Yugoslavia, had won the
majority of seats in 11 Belgrade districts, and 70 out of the 110
seats in the capital city assembly.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno has also won the majority of seats in 32 municipal
districts in Serbia, Vuksanovic said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
But spokesman for the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)
Ivica Dacic said Monday their party has won three-fourths of
municipalities in Sunday's elections for local authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to results from 174 of the 189 municipalities in
Serbia, SPS has won in 134 municipalities, nearly 80 percent of
all local municipalities, or in over three fourths of local organs
in the Republic, Dacic said.

ROME, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian boxer Fabrizio Di Chiara
was declared dead Monday, two days after collapsing in the ring
moments after the referee stopped a title bout.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Santa Chiara hospital said the 25-year-old
middleweight had been brain dead since Sunday and that his family

Biagio Mazzeo, a deputy prosecutor, opened an investigation

Mazzeo ordered an autopsy and the seizure of the fight tape.
</P>
<P>
Di Chiara was the seventh Italian professional boxer to die
from injuries sustained on the ring since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The boxer, 13-2 as a professional, lapsed into a deep coma
Saturday night shortly after a technical knockout during the final
round of an Italian title bout against champion Vincenzo Imparato
at Avenza.

<HEADLINE> UK MPs Vote against Total Handgun Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- British parliament members
voted against a total ban on handguns on Monday, sparing the
government an embarrassing defeat.
</P>
<P>
An amendment, proposed by rebel Conservative MP Robert Hughes,
to the Firearms Bill calling for an outright ban on the private
ownership of handguns was defeated by 306 votes to 281.
</P>
<P>
The parliament backed a government proposal of a partial ban,
which was designed to protect the sport of target shooting and
exempted guns of 0.22 calibre and below.
</P>
<P>
The government has been criticized for refusing to give its MPs
a free vote. Anti-gun campaigners say they will now make handguns
an election issue.
</P>
<P>
In the Dunblane massacre in March, 16 children and their
teachers were shot dead at school by crazed loner Thomas Hamilton
with handguns for which police had granted him a license.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party said that it would move to outlaw
handguns if it won power at next year's general election.
</P>
<P>
"If elected, we shall in the next parliament provide for a
complete ban on handguns for general civilian use," said shadow
Home Secretary Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was sure that MPs would have voted in favor
of a total ban if they had been given a free vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has to
"reassess what ought to be done" in the international relief
mission in Central Africa as dramatic developments have taken
place in the last four days which saw a half-million refugees
pouring across the border from Zaire to their homes in Rwanda, the
State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is not yet a plan (for U.S. participations in the relief
mission), partly because everything's changed in the last three or
four days," State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army stationed in Italy and Air force transport planes
in Europe and Africa are standing by still without order to depart
for deployment in Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Davies said U.S. military planners and diplomats around the
world were reassessing what should be done to care both for the
refugees who have returned to Rwanda and those who stayed in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Defense Secretary William Perry said the need for
a humanitarian relief remains. However, Rwandan officials have
said they would welcome aid, but not troops.
</P>
<P>
The United States has a 40-military personnel team in Rwanda
to assess the situations in the region, And several nations also
have dispatched their teams to the region for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
It seems much coordination would be required should their
militaries become involved in the relief mission.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Right to Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian today called on the international community, particularly
developed countries, to take concrete actions together with
developing countries so as to realize the right to development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and
Cultural) of the U.N. General Assembly, the Chinese deputy
permanent representative to U.N. said that the right to
development as an inalienable human right has been widely
recognized by the international community thanks to the efforts of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Vienna Declaration and Program of Action has reaffirmed
the right to development, as established in the Declaration on the
Right to Development, as a universal and inalienable human right
and an integral part of fundamental human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the right to development has not yet been given due
attention by the international community and that the goals set in
the Declaration are far from being attained, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the impoverished population in the
world has risen from one billion to 1.3 billion and continues to
increase by an average of 25 million each year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In developing countries, nearly one third of the population
live abject poverty and more than 10 million people die of hunger
or malnutrition every year," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The ruthless plunder and exploitation against developing
countries by colonialists in the past and the current irrational
and unjust international economic order constitute the major
obstacles to the realization of the right to development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Developed countries are duty-bound to remove these obstacles,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it is a lofty objective of the people of all
countries to enjoy full human rights. Unfortunately, this
objective has been distorted and blasphemed by the malpractice of
certain countries to politicize human rights and pursue double
standards.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote sound international cooperation in the
field of human rights, it is imperative to adhere to the following
principles:
</P>
<P>
-- respect for state sovereignty;
</P>
<P>
-- cooperation on an equal footing;
</P>
<P>
-- taking into account the universality and particularities of
human rights; and
</P>
<P>
-- equally treating all human rights -- civil and political
rights, economic, social and cultural rights, and the right to
development.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to strengthen cooperation and exchanges with UN
human rights bodies as well as other countries in the world in the
field of human rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect
and has made and will continue to make unremitting efforts to this
end," he said.

<HEADLINE> European Shares' Recent Surge Lose Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets'
strong surge last week lost momentum and European shares closed
mixed on Monday, with London staging a small rise while Frankfurt
and Paris all ending in the negative territories.
</P>
<P>
On the London market, British shares lost their early gains on
a weak Wall Street, as today's favorable UK government borrowing
figures failed to stimulate the market and investors were kept
cautious and worried about next week's new Budget.
</P>
<P>
However, a strong gilts market kept the bourse in positive
territory, with the FTSE 100 index ending 3.9 points up at 3962.1.
</P>
<P>
British Gas and Shell, central market figures amid takeover
rumours, both enjoyed significant share price rises.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt closed sharply down, with the DAX-30
share index 31.96 points lower at 2,763.84, as investors focused
on the first day of trading of shares in Deutsche Telekom,
Europe's biggest telecommunications company, which undermined
trading volumes among other shares.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 share index in Paris was down 11.52 points at
2,228.81 at the close, as the market digested last week's 1.6
percent gains. But traders were confident that the market would
resume its advance after a short pause.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 leading British shares closed up 3.9 points
at 3,962.1. The DAX-30 index in Frankfurt ended down 31.96 points
at 2,763.84. The Paris CAC-40 index finished 11.52 points lower at
2,228.81.

<HEADLINE> British Company Supplies Arms to Hutu Militia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A British company supplied
large amounts of arms and ammunition to the Rwanda armed groups
and Hutu militia during and after the genocide of some one million
people in 1994, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Documents found in a bus near the abandoned Hutu refugee camp
in eastern Zaire show that a British company named as Mil-Tec
Corporation Ltd provided those rifles, ammunition, grenades and
mortar bombs worth more than 5.5 million U.S. dollars between
April and July 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some of the shipments appeared to have been designed to
circumvent a UN arms embargo imposed in May 1994 after soldiers of
the Rwanda armed groups and Hutu militia started to slaughter
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on these reports, a British Foreign Office spokesman
said in a statement today that the British government "understands
that there have, in the past, been allegations which have been
investigated of UK traders being involved in the supply of arms to
Rwandan groups."
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed that "No evidence has been
found to substantiate offenses having committed in the UK. If any
evidence is presented on offenses in the UK then we would, of
course, investigate."
</P>
<P>
"We would be concerned if any UK nationals have avoided UK
jurisdiction and the UN embargo through actions taken outside the
UK," he added.

<HEADLINE> Muslim-Croat Federation Defense Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 18 (Xinhua) - The defense minister of
Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation resigned on Monday, paying the
way for unloading of American weaponry to be used by the
federation army, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Soljic, a Croat, submitted a resignation letter to
federation president Kresimir Zubak.
</P>
<P>
Washington has insisted that Hasan Cengic, the Muslim deputy
defense minister of the federation, should be removed for alleged
Iranian connections before the 100 million dollar worth of weapons
will be unloaded from a chartered ship.
</P>
<P>
The ship "American Condore" has been ploughing the Adriatic sea
for almost a month because of the stalemate over Cengic's removal.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim side demanded for the dual removal of Soljic and
Cengic, who reportedly could not agree on how to form the
federation army units.
</P>
<P>
The American weaponry is part of a multi-million dollar "Train
and Equip" program sponsored by the United States to beef up the
federation army as a counter-balance against the Serb forces.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Warns Against Israeli Foot-Dragging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an Interview with the London-based Arabic "Al Hayat"
newspaper, which was published today, Moussa said Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has the opportunity to mend what he
has destroyed, a chance which will not last forever.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of wasting time on sideline matters when
ignoring serious issues such as Jerusalem, refugees, borders, the
right to Palestinian self-determination, the establishment of a
Palestinian state, settlements and water.
</P>
<P>
"One should not forget that there is an Israeli and Palestinian
commitment, through the Madrid and Oslo agreements, to finalize
peace by 1999," he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The intransigent policy of the right-wing Israeli prime
minister, including the closure on the West Bank and Gaza and
foot-dragging on a Hebron troop deployment deal, has bogged down
the peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed during his interview with the paper the need
for an agreement in which Israel gives up its strange demands such
as "hot pursuit of terrorists" in the Palestinian areas and
dividing the city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Moussa warned that the redeployment in Hebron is only a point
in a complicated issue and there are other major requirements,
including resumption of talks on the final settlement and halting
the construction of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, while stressing that Israel had to change
its position towards the peace process, called on Arabs to back
Palestine, Syria and Lebanon in negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said no date has been set for a projected
Egyptian-U.S. summit, but contacts were underway.
</P>
<P>
"We have time until January 20, when the new American
administration comes to office, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he would discuss, during his December 5-6 visit to
London, Britain's proposal on the establishment of a regional
organization in the Middle East for security and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But he questioned the possibility of establishing such a
organization with Israel, in view of its current practices.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt thinks that any talk on the creation of a security and
cooperation organization in the Middle East is bound up with
conditions that are different from the present ones," he added.

<HEADLINE> Military Talks Underway in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Military dialogue between
Cyprus' armed forces, National Guard, and the U.N. will continue
this week, as part of proximity talks the U.N. is holding with
the military on both sides of this divided island, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told his daily press briefing that "U.N. officials and
the leadership of the National Guard will meet later in the
week in accordance with the terms of the military dialogue the
U.N. is holding with the Greek and Turkish sides."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, refrained from giving further comment
on the talks, which are shrouded in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said the Greek Cypriot side accepted the
U.N. proposal for talks with the Commander of the Turkish forces
on the island, in accordance with U.N. Security Council
resolution 1062, which calls for such a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the spokesman of the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP), Waldemar Rokoszewski, refused to comment on
reports that the Turkish side is obstructing the U.N. proposed
military dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Broadcast Corporation Television reported Sunday
night that Turkish army Commander Ali Yialtsin refused to accept
the proposals tabled by the commander of the UNFICYP.
</P>
<P>
Rokoszewski told Cyprus News Agency that "we have tabled
our proposal to both sides," stressing that the understanding
with the National Guard and the Turkish forces Commanders is
that "no comments are to be made on the issue."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. proposed dialogue, focusing on the extension of
the unmanning along the cease-fire line, the removal of loaded
weapons and the definition of a code of conduct for soldiers
serving along the demarcation line, is aimed at reducing tension
along the 180-kilometer-long U.N.-controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, four unarmed Greek Cypriots have been
killed and a Turkish soldier was mysteriously murdered in the
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following
a short lived coup seeking union with Greece.

ADDIS ABABA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Some Sudanese rebels, who
have been holding an aircraft belonging to the International
Committee of the Red Cross since November 1, today demanded a
ransom of 50 million U.S. Dollars for the release of the plane.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Commander Karbino Kuagnin Bol made the
announcement after confrontation mounted between his guerilla
soldiers and the Red Cross over the seizure of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Bol claimed that five armed soldiers loyal to his rival, the
Rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), had been found on
board the plane. Bol had defected from the SPLA early in the year
and signed a peace pact with the Sudanese government last April.
</P>
<P>
However, the Red Cross headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland,
denied that there were any arms on the plane and said the five
people on board were wounded rebels on their way home in Ban al
Bezab.

The Red Cross plane, piloted by a Canadian and a Kenyan with
an Australian on board, took off from Kenya where the
headquarters of its international relief operations in southern

<HEADLINE> UK Likely to Go Ahead with Troop Deployment to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
Michael Portillo said here today that Britain was likely to go
ahead with the planned peace troops deployment to Zaire to help
the starving refugees there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview today, Portillo said
that he was waiting for a report from a British reconnaissance
team to Zaire before making a final decision on British troops
deployment.
</P>
<P>
Portillo made the statement when some countries were reportedly
reconsidering the need for multinational military intervention in
Zaire as half a million Rwandan refugees have returned home.
</P>
<P>
"So far, as far as we know, the refugees in the area where we
are intending to go are still infested with the armed militia who
are preventing them going home and terrorizing them and therefore
still in danger of starvation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, until I hear from the reconnaissance team, I have
to assume that our operation, our part of it, has got to go
ahead," he added.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary stressed that there were still a lot of
people "unaccounted for. Therefore, before we have an
international sigh of relief and decide we needn't actually do
anything about this, we'd better check the evidence a bit more
thoroughly."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that those countries which expressed their
intention to join a multinational force are expected to meet later
this week in Stuttgart, Germany, to review the situation in Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Arafat Decides Not to Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today that Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat has decided not to conclude an agreement
on Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Knesset (Israel's parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, Netanyahu said the PA is trying to put
pressure on the Israeli government by delaying an agreement over
the disputed West Bank city.
</P>
<P>
"A deliberate decision by the Palestinian side is not to
complete the Hebron agreement, expecting Israel to be
automatically blamed for the delay," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier also said that there is an attempt by the
PA and the Arab world to use the Israeli opposition to split
differences of opinions among Israelis, in order to mount
pressure on the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks came after Israeli media reported that
opposition leader Shimon Peres has advised Arafat not to
conclude the Hebron agreement with the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Arafat today denied reports, adding that Israel's delays were
the only reason why an accord on the redeployment in Hebron had
not been signed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu admitted today that he has absolutely no evidence,
or information that Peres, chairman of the Labor Party, has
encouraged the Palestinians to delay the conclusion of the
Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also called Peres, who is currently on a tour of
Europe, and told Peres that he does not believe the story about
him, but he said that he would not investigate who was
responsible for the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The development came at a time when Israel and the
Palestinians are blaming each other for the delay of concluding
an agreement on the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
There have been intensive negotiations between Israeli and
Palestinian officials during last two weeks. However, no
progress has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
The main issue in dispute still concerns "hot pursuit," in
which Israel is demanding "freedom of action" in the 80 percent
of the Hebron to be under Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have been refusing to renegotiate
the existing agreement, known as the Oslo accords, and would
accept only joint action by mobile units in Palestinian ruled
areas in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, Israeli army was originally
supposed to complete its redeployment in the Hebron area by
March 28, pulling back from approximately 80 percent of the
city.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel last February and March which left more than 60 people
dead and some 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Peres delayed
the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was further delayed first because of Israel's
May 29 general election, then because of the new Israeli
government's hardline policy toward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
There are some 450 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, with 120,000 Palestinian residents living in most other
parts of the city.

<HEADLINE> Israel Approves Settlement Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
has approved construction of 1,200 housing units in the Immanuel
Settlement in the occupied West Bank, reported Israel Radio
today.
</P>
<P>
The building is slated to get underway in two months of
time. The development plan includes construction of a nursing
home, a school and a country club. There are 700 homes in the
settlement now.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now, a leftwing organization, today criticized the move,
 saying that it will sabotage political negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The government decision is believed to be a concrete step of
what Jewish settlers called the government "compensation" for its
proposed redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
On November 7, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense
Minsiter Mordechai held separate meetings with the heads of the
"Council of Jewish Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza" to
discuss their settlement expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
The settlement leaders told reporters that they got an
impression from Netanyahu and Mordechai that the government will
"compensate" for the redeployment in Hebron with approval of
development plans in other settlements.
</P>
<P>
The settlement leaders declined to reveal details of the
government promises, but described the atmosphere as good.
</P>
<P>
They said that they had decided to put off planned protest
actions against the prime minister to give him a chance to carry
out the promises he made before the May general election to
expand the settlements.

Nigeria, saying that from all indications the economy is
beginning to turn for the better.
</P>

At a business reception held here today, John Dorrell of the

Nigeria's first export processing zone, set up in the southern

</P>
<P>
Investors, especially those from foreign countries, are
expected to enjoy preferential treatment when they set up

</P>
<P>
However, the political climate of the country has to be stable

Dorrell said.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official on Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) described here today the
peace talks between the PLO and Israel as "different" from those
between other Arab countries and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kaddoumi, chairman of the PLO's Political Department,
made this description during meetings with Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in the Lebanese capital at the weekend, heading a
delegation including Hussein Husseini, an official responsible
for the Holy City of Jerusalem affairs in the Palestinian
Authority, and Hani Hassan and Mohammed Jihad, members of the
Palestinian Council.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held jointly with the Lebanese foreign
minister at the end of their talks, Kaddoumi noted that a
"transitional phase" on the Palestinian track, which was not
involved on other tracks, made the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks different from others.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "essential problems" were delayed at the
final stage of the peace negotiations between the Palestinians
and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Under the PLO-Israeli peace agreements, which are better-known
as "Oslo accords," the PLO established a limited self-rule in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The accords deliberately left the thorniest issues for the
negotiations on permanent arrangement, which should have started
by May 1996, but were indefinitely postponed following the
election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Among the problems to be discussed by the two sides in the
final stage of negotiations are the status of Jerusalem, the fate
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi stressed that those three problems were "actually
Arab problems and could not be solved by ourselves (the
Palestinians) alone."
</P>
<P>
"There must be an Arab participation in working out future
views on these problems" before they are raised in the final
stage," the PLO official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Asked on a possible resettlement of the Palestinian refugees
in their host Arab states, Kaddoumi said, "We categorically
object the resettlement, and we want the Palestinian (refugees)
to return to their homeland."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 750,000 Palestinian
refugees spreading all over the world, and a large proportion
are living in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Boueiz described his talks with
Kaddoumi as "candid and fruitful," stressing an "identity" of
view points not only on the last stage but also on the
"requirements of the next stage."
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi and his delegation held a meeting earlier today with
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official said that the talks dealt with the
difficulties the Palestinians were facing due to "deadlocked
peace negotiations and the closure which Israel is currently
imposing on the West Bank and Gaza Strip."
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the problem of some 350,000 Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon, the problem of Al-Guds, the Arabic name of
Jerusalem, and the Lebanese-Palestinian relations, Kaddoumi
said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Spy Suspect Remanded in Custody in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli accused of espionage
for the Jewish state would be remanded in custody for 45 days,
according to the Egyptian Supreme State Security Prosecution
today.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer of the Israeli Embassy had offered up to 100,000
Egyptian pounds to bail the accused out but the prosecution
turned down the offer, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli, Azam Azam, an Arab origin, was held earlier this
week on suspicion of recruiting an Egyptian to spy for Israel's
Mossad secret service.
</P>
<P>
His arrest has strained already tense relations between Egypt
and Israel, which insists he is not a spy and should be freed.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution authority continues its interrogations with
Azam who will face trial at the Supreme State Security Court
after his file is sent to a public prosecutor by the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
The government has allowed the Israeli Embassy to name an
Egyptian lawyer to defend the 35-year-old Israeli.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli consul, accompanied by a lawyer appointed by the
Israeli Embassy, Sunday visited the Torah Prison where Azam was
held. The accused said he was well-treated by prison officers.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian prosecution will soon issue an official charge
sheet detailing the accusation against him and the Egyptian Emad
Eddin Abdul Hamid.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told an Israeli newspaper
Thursday that the Egyptian had admitted selling information to
Azam, who had been caught in Cairo with invisible ink and other
unspecified items.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to establish diplomatic
relations with Israel. The Israeli government's intransigence in
Israeli-Arab peace talks has hindered the expansion of
Egyptian-Israeli ties.

<HEADLINE> CIA Official Arrested with Charge of Spying for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A former station chief of
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was arrested and charged
with passing top secret information to the Russians for 120,000
U.S. dollars, federal authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Attorney General Janet Reno, CIA
Director John Deutch, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Director Louis J. Freeh and U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District
of Virginia Helen Fahey.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Harold James Nicholson, 46, was charged with
"espionage and conspiracy to commit espionage by passing
classified CIA documents to agents of the Russian Federation
Foreign Intelligence Service (SVRR), the Russian successor to the
KGB," said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year CIA veteran from Burke, Virginia, appeared before
the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia today.
</P>
<P>
A FBI affidavit by FBI Agent Michael Lonergan said Nicholson
last June may have given the Russians the identity and biography
of a new CIA agent trained by Nicholson and sent to Moscow. He
said Nicholson may have turned over the identities of all new
agents trained during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said it observed Nicholson photographing secret and
top-secret CIA documents about Russian military capabilities and
U.S. national defenses last Tuesday, four days before he was
arrested at Dulles International Airport as he was about to leave
Saturday for Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The federal authorities intercepted postcards mailed to
Nicholson's handlers, recovered classified information documents,
and that a search of his office revealed numerous classified
materials concerning Russia that were not related to his CIA
duties, the Department of Justice said.
</P>
<P>
On June 27, The FBI said it observed Nicholson put a camera bag
into the trunk and get into a car in Singapore with diplomatic
license plates registered to the Russian embassy there. Within a
month of his return, he made 20,000 dollars in deposits, payments
and purchases and gave 12,000 dollars to his son to buy a new car,
the FBI affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson faces life in prison without parole if convicted.
Fahey said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1980 with the CIA, Nicholson has held top-secret
security clearance throughout his career and was given access to
sensitive information whose disclosure could irreparably harm the
United States, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
He also served as a spy overseas against the Soviet Union,
Russia and other foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
He had first direct contact with targeted Soviet officials
while serving in Manila in 1982 to 1985, the FBI said. He later
served in Bangkok and then Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson was chief of station for the CIA in Romania's
capital, Bucharest, from 1990 to 1992 and then for two years after
that was deputy chief of station in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to July 1996, he taught new CIA agents spy tradecraft
at "The Farm," as the CIA refers to its secret Virginia training
site. In July, he was moved to the counterterrorism center at CIA
headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Gas Flaring Brings Huge Loss to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, which ranks first in
gas flaring globally, has lost an equivelent of more than 2.8
billion barrels of oil as a result of it, industry sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The loss has been incurred by the country through the
activities of oil prospecting and producing companies in the last
40 years, said Ebi Omatsola, managing director of Consolidated
Oil, a local oil company.
</P>
<P>
With the flaring of natural gas, about 35 billion tons of
carbon dioxide have been released into the atmosphere, polluting
the environment with nobody to do anything to solve the problem
in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, aware of the negative effect of gas
flaring, promulgated a decree in as early as 1979 during the
country's oil boom. The decree stipulates a penalty of two Kobo
for every 1,000 cubic meters of gas flared by oil company.
</P>
<P>
However, two Kobo, which was more than 0.02 U.S. Dollars at
that time and only 0.00025 Dollars at present, is almost nothing
nowadays, thus the penalty is far from enough to stop oil
companies from flaring gas during production, because it costs
much in absorbing it.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a major African oil producer and exporter, boasts
some 20.5 billion barrels of reserves. The country may run out of
its oil reserves by the year 2017, if its oil output is kept at
the current 918.6 million barrels per year, according to the
Ministry of Petroleum Resources.
</P>
<P>
The country's gas reserves will be able to last for 72 years,
given the 110 trillion cubic meters of reserves and an annual
production of 1.55 billion standard cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
Since Nigeria's population is projected to shoot to about more
than 200 million by the year 2010, efforts should be put in place
to ensure effective utilization of the huge gas potential,
industry sources suggested.
</P>
<P>
At a workshop on the effective utilization and development on
Nigeria's gas resources, which was held here today, industry
sources cited some of the major impediments against effective
investment in gas in the country.
</P>
<P>
These include the poor commercial environment for the local
use of gas, the improper pricing policy and the lack of defined
and comprehensive gas policy, especially as it relates penalty on
flaring.
</P>
<P>
Nigerians burn a lot of fire wood every year while huge amount
of fine quality natural gas is being wasted. Both are
contributors to the environmental degeneration of the country.
</P>
<P>
To curb the trend, industry sources participating in the
workshop urged the federal government to establish a
comprehensive energy/natural gas policy and take concrete steps
to discourage the use of fire wood in order to combat the menace
of desertification and degradation.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, Shell Petroleum Development Company Nigeria
Ltd announced at the workshop it will stop further flaring of
Nigeria's gas resources by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources hoped that other oil producing companies in
the country would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Shell Nigeria is the biggest among the six Nigerian-foreign joint
ventures in the oil industry, contributing about 60 percent of
Nigeria's annual oil production.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada and Chile signed a free
trade agreement here today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and visiting Chilean
President Eduardo Frei put their signatures on the bilateral trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement demonstrates Canada's determination to create
jobs and encourage economic growth through trade liberalization,"
Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"It also gives us momentum in developing closer political and
economic ties with all of Latin America," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, 75 percent of Canadian exports will enjoy
duty-free access to the Chilean market and Chile's 11 percent
import duty on almost all remaining industrial and resource-based
goods will be eliminated over five years.
</P>
<P>
Improved access will be provided for a range of agricultural
goods, especially durum wheat, whose 35 percent tariffs will be
eliminated immediately.
</P>
<P>
The accord also provides significant new protection for
Canadian investments in Chile, including an agreement to
automatically grant Canadian investors the benefits of any future
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
According to today's agreement, a free trade commission and
secretariat will be set up to ensure the timely and effective
resolution of disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The accord includes two parallel agreements on environmental
and labour cooperation, modeled on the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) side agreements.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the two countries inked two other agreements: one
on social security and the other between the Canadian
International Development Agency and its Chilean counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Chile began to negotiate a free trade agreement last
January. Ten rounds of negotiations have been conducted since
then.
</P>
<P>
President Frei arrived here for a three-day state visit Sunday,
when he was greeted by Canadian Governor General Romeo LeBlanc.
</P>
<P>
He met with Prime Minister Chretien and several cabinet
ministers today, and is scheduled to visit Canada's largest city

<HEADLINE> Left Coalition in Serbia Wins Nearly 80 Percent of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for the ruling
Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) Ivica Dacic said Monday their
victory in winning three-fourths of municipalities was a great
success for the left.
</P>
<P>
Giving incomplete results of the elections for local
authorities held in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia Sunday, Dacic
said at a news conference that SPS would pursue in the coming
period "a policy that rallies all those who think well above all
to the citizens of this country."
</P>
<P>
According to results from 174 of the 189 municipalities in
Serbia, SPS has won, either independently or jointly in a leftist
coalition with the Yugoslav Left (JUL) and New Democracy (ND), in
134 municipalities, nearly 80 percent of all local municipalities,
or in over three fourths of local organs in the Republic, Dacic
said.
</P>
<P>
The left has failed to win only in a small number of
municipalities, Dacic added.
</P>
<P>
"In those municipalities where we have not succeeded, we will
work to strengthen the party, to eliminate weaknesses in the way
we operate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The left has also won a two-third majority in the parliament of
the autonomous province of Vojvodina, or 70 of the total 120
seats, Dacic specified.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting results from 15 municipalities, and what is
very important is that we have already increased the number of
municipalities compared to local elections in 1992, when SPS won
an absolute majority in 132 municipalities, and now that number is
already 134," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Israel to Honor Concluded Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has said his only message to the Israeli public is that
peace deserves making concessions and promises should be honored.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by today's Paris-based "Liberation",
the president said a solution could be found if the agreements
signed are fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
The intransigent policy of the Israeli Likud government,
including the closure on the West Bank and Gaza and foot-dragging
on a Hebron troop redeployment deal, has bogged down the peace
negotiations with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak rejected the probability of a new war in the Middle
East but warned of the return of terrorism to the region and
Europe. "In such a case, neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis
would be able to stand in the face of terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the extremist groups that are benefiting from this
tension, he said, warning that if conditions deteriorate some
people would be forced to join the terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
"Giving the Palestinians their rights is better than the right
to pursue them," he said, criticizing Israel's demand for hot
pursuit of Palestinian guerrillas inside the Arab quarters of the
West Bank city of Hebron after the Israeli troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting the peace march has been on a halt since the Israeli
right-wingers took power, Mubarak stressed that it is important to
build confidence between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Let the PA do its job without any restrictions," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on his meeting with Netanyahu here in July, the
president said that Netanyahu made his commitment to signed
agreements and promised to sign a final peace accord with the
Palestinians similar to the one signed between Egypt and Israel in
1079. But, no concrete results have been produced since
Natanyahu's visit to Egypt in July, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had lost confidence in the Israeli premier, the
president said "I cannot say so. I know he is facing
difficulties, that is why I'm encouraging him to surmount them and
explaining, to the public opinion, what should be done for peace
and stability."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader ruled out visiting Jerusalem for the time being,
saying that such a visit should be sanctioned by the public
opinion in Egypt and the Arab world.
