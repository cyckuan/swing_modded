<HEADLINE> Clinton Said To Discuss Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
By VILMA PEREZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told the leaders of Puerto
Rico's three political parties Wednesday he supports
self-determination for the U.S. island. But they said Clinton did
not respond to their pleas to stop the Navy's practice bombing on
the offshore island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   It was believed to be the first time that a U.S. president has
sat with the leaders of all three Puerto Rican parties --
representing the status options of statehood, independence and the
current commonwealth arrangement -- to discuss ways of resolving the
status question.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president listened to everyone's opinion, and at the end
he reiterated that he wanted to design or set in motion a process
that would be transparent, open and fair that would lead to a
decision of the status issue,'' White House spokeswoman Nanda
Chitre said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has driven Puerto Rico's politics for most of the 102
years since the United States took possession of the Caribbean
island as booty at the end of the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon, leader of the pro-commonwealth
Popular Democratic Party, said she was disappointed with the
meeting because Clinton refused to discuss the Navy bombing on
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vieques is a much more important issue at this time, and I
don't know if he grasped the magnitude of the explosive situation
there is over there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Calderon and Independence Party leader Ruben Berrios said
they asked Clinton to immediately call a referendum for islanders
to decided whether they want the Navy to stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy raged anew after the Navy this week held its
biggest war games on the island since a 1999 fatal bombing. They
ended Wednesday with bitterness on both sides -- from Puerto Rican
protesters who tried to risk their lives by breaking onto the range
to stop the training and from the Navy for an alleged attack in
which two sailors were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told them he, too, preferred to have the referendum
''sooner than later,'' according to Jeffrey Farrow, the president's
adviser on Puerto Rico. The Navy will decide to hold the
referendum, under an agreement negotiated with Clinton, the
Pentagon and the Puerto Rican government.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the meeting was Carlos Pesquera, president of the
governing pro-statehood New Progressive Party. All three
politicians are candidates for governor in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's 3.8 million people are U.S. citizens who can be
drafted into the U.S. military but do not get to vote for president
and have no vote in Congress. They do not pay most federal taxes
though Washington sends down about $13 billion a year, nearly a
third of the island's official gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Korea Missile Talks Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and North Korean officials will hold
missile talks in July, the State Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions, which will take place on July 10-12 in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, will cover a wide range of topics, including U.S.
concerns about North Korea's missile activities and exports plans.
Robert Einhorn, who covers nonproliferation issues at the
department, will talk with North Korea's U.S. affairs officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, North Korea pledged to refrain from long-range
missile tests after the United States lifted some economic
sanctions against it. Washington said it would open trade with
North Korea in nonmilitary goods, open air travel and shipping
routes, and ease restrictions on U.S. investment in the communist
nation.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Drugs Mulled in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are hailing their House-passed
prescription drug bill as a historic new Medicare benefit, but its
prospects are iffy in the Senate and President Clinton has
threatened a veto to force major changes in a measure Democrats
claim is an election-year scam.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is sound, it is in Medicare, it is an entitlement
program and it is a guaranteed benefit,'' Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., a chief architect of the GOP plan, said Wednesday night
as the measure cleared the House in a close, mostly party-line
vote, 217-214.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he had received
assurances from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, that
''they are going to take it up,'' and added that his door was open
for negotiations with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always said we're willing to sit down with the
president,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del., said his panel was working behind closed doors on
bipartisan Medicare legislation he would like to begin action on in
July, after Congress returns from its Independence Day break.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrat Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia said he
wasn't confident that the result would be a viable bill, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we going to have a better chance of compromise after the
July Fourth recess? I very much doubt it,'' Rockefeller said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto any bill reaching his desk that
looks like the House GOP measure. It would rely on a blend of
private insurance companies and federal subsidies to spread
coverage nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is their plan is designed to benefit the
companies who make the prescription drugs, not the older Americans
who need to take them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democrats instead are advocating a costlier
alternative: a uniform, government-run prescription drug benefit,
offered to all 39 million elderly and disabled Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But majority Republicans, arguing that the $100 billion price
tag over five years for the Democratic version exceeded the $40
billion allotted in their budget, refused to allow a House vote on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Polling indicates the issue of prescription drugs is a priority
for Americans 65 and older, a group that accounted for more than
one-quarter of voters in the 1998 elections and is regarded as a
key swing group in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Adding drug coverage to Medicare would be the biggest expansion
of the program since its creation in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   AARP, the nation's largest organization of older adults, is
remaining aloof from either party on what is shaping up to be a
highly competitive election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a lot of details to be worked out on both plans,
and it seems to us a little bit premature to be bringing this to a
vote in such a rushed fashion,'' AARP public policy director John
Rother said.
</P>
<P>
   With elections to determine control of the House a little more
than four months away, the House debate was thoroughly political.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Democrats questioned the motivation of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sham. It's a hoax. It's public relations. It's
electioneering. It is not writing a plan that will help people,''
said Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who led his rank
and file in delaying tactics, including a brief walkout, that added
hours to Wednesday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, citing reports that Democrats already have tested
campaign advertisements on the issue, said, ''My friends, put those
commercials away. America is sick and tired of bickering. Americans
just want us to create a product that will benefit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the House Republican and Democratic proposals include
provisions to help low-income senior citizens and those with
particularly high annual drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Fees charged by private insurers under the GOP plan could vary,
but Republicans estimated a $35 to $40 monthly premium, a $250
annual deductible and a 50 percent co-payment up to $2,100 in
covered costs. Catastrophic coverage would then kick in if a senior
spent $6,000 out of pocket in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said their plan would have a premium beginning at $25
a month, doubling as benefits are gradually increased over several
years. There would be no deductible and a 50 percent co-payment up
to $2,000 in covered costs, eventually rising to $5,000.
Catastrophic coverage would kick in at $4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, several bipartisan drug plans have been
introduced but have garnered little discernible attention from
either party's leadership.

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes 'Partial Birth' Ban  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans in Congress soon may push forward
with legislation that would ban so-called partial-birth abortions
now that the Supreme Court has given guidance on how to make such a
bill constitutionally valid.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the nation's highest court threw out Nebraska's
ban, saying it violates women's constitutional rights by imposing
an ''undue burden'' on their decisions to end their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers, who have been waiting on this decision, now will
take the ruling and rework their already-approved ''partial-birth''
ban in hopes of avoiding any constitutional questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This opinion will be studied intensely,'' House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that the court said made the Nebraska law
unconstitutional -- the lack of an exemption to protect the health
of the mother -- also is not in the GOP bills as they now stand in
the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton likely will get a rewritten bill before
this year's presidential election. He vetoed legislation on the
matter in 1996 and 1997, stating that it did not provide adequate
exceptions to protect the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The House both times voted to override the veto but the Senate
failed to come up with the necessary two-thirds majority for an
override.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Clinton pledged to veto any similar
legislation that widely restricts late-term abortions. ''A woman's
right to choose must include the right to choose a medical
procedure that will not endanger her life or health,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential hopeful,
opposes a ban on partial-birth abortion, while his likely opponent,
the Republican governor of Texas, George W. Bush, supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. Doctors call the
method dilation and extraction, or D&AMP;X, because it involves
partially extracting a fetus, legs first, through the birth canal,
cutting the skull and draining its contents.
</P>
<P>
   A more common procedure is dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E, in
which an arm or leg of a live fetus may be pulled into the birth
canal during the abortion operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote Wednesday, said the Nebraska
law aimed at only at the D&AMP;X method could criminalize the D&AMP;E
method as well. It also does not provide an exception for a
partial-birth abortion to protect the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bills were changed to specify D&AMP;X abortions when
the court cases began, but still do not have a provision to protect
the mother's health.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ban could be on good constitutional ground once
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''A ban on partial-birth abortion that only proscribed the D&AMP;X
method of abortion and that included an exception to preserve the
life and health of the mother would be constitutional, in my
view,'' said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who supplied the critical
fifth vote for striking down Nebraska's law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a partial-birth abortion ban last year and the
House passed a similar version two months ago. But GOP lawmakers
decided to wait on the court before adopting a final bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a deliberate decision to wait until the court ruled
and use the decision to craft the bill in committee,'' said a House
staffer who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The only major difference between the House and Senate bills is
a Senate-passed provision -- engineered by Democrats -- declaring
that the high court's Roe vs. Wade ruling in 1973 established ''an
important constitutional right'' and should not be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The partial-birth abortion issue has caused political anguish
for many Democrats who favor abortion rights but find the GOP bills
impossible to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., already has chosen members
of the conference committee that will consider changes to the bill.
They are Hyde, as well as Reps. Charles Canady, R-Fla.; J.C. Watts,
R-Okla.; John Conyers, D-Mich.; and Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has yet to appoint to the
Senate conferees.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Pass Disclosure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is poised to approve legislation
forcing secretive groups on the left and right to say who is paying
for campaign-style TV ads, radio spots and phone calls that are
being used to influence elections nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage would give President Clinton a chance to sign the
first significant campaign finance overhaul measure in two decades.
The legislation would affect groups that have seized on a
once-obscure section of the tax code to conduct unlimited political
activity without reporting anything about themselves to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is by no means a solution to all of our campaign finance
problems. But it is a start,'' Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to sign the bill. At a Democratic
fund-raiser Wednesday night, he said: ''Getting the disclosure of
these secret committees is a big deal. This could really influence
the outcome of some of the elections this year and more importantly
it could ratify a principal that we all in both parties say we
believe in, which is full disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the Senate had been fighting the
legislation, but they lost a vote earlier this month and a
resounding House vote just two days ago created what proved to be
unstoppable momentum for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the Senate vote will be equally overwhelming,'' said
Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who built a presidential
bid around his campaign for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Feingold and allies hope to translate this week's action
into more substantial campaign finance reform. Larger reforms would
limit the amount of money that flows into campaigns and how it is
used. This bill simply forces the same sort of disclosure rules on
some independent groups that already apply to candidates and
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first step, but we do have a thousand miles to
go,'' said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require tax-exempt groups that register
under the newly popular section 527 of the tax code to say who is
paying for their political activities, including TV ads and other
attempts to influence elections.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 has been in the tax code since 1975, but only
recently has it become the vehicle of choice for donors who want to
remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts say section 527 is undermining one of
the pillars of Watergate reforms -- disclosure of donors.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that requiring disclosure would discourage
Americans from participating in the political process. Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., noted that the Supreme Court has said that groups
are not required to report to the Federal Election Commission if
they do not ''expressly advocate'' for a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on this rationale, interest groups have escaped campaign
finance regulations by avoiding ''magic words'' such as ''vote
for'' or ''vote against,'' even as they air TV and radio ads that
sound much like campaign spots.
</P>
<P>
   Given these court rulings, McConnell said, it's wrong to force
section 527 to disclose their donors as long as they, too, avoid
these key phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although these 527 groups are small, and few, the
constitutional questions are real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 was designed to give political parties and political
action committees certain tax breaks. But while these groups
already report their activities to the Federal Election Commission,
section 527 has become popular with often secretive groups who
don't disclose their spending and donors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, any group organizing under section 527
would have to report its existence to the Internal Revenue Service
within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   It also would require disclosure of donors and spending for any
527 group that raises at least $25,000 a year but does not already
report to the FEC. They would have to report contributions of $200
or more and spending of $500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 527, a pair of Texas brothers ran $2.5 million in ads
praising Texas Gov. George W. Bush and attacking McCain in the days
before a crucial GOP primary election. Another 527 with ties to
House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is working to raise $25 million to
help a variety of Republicans running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the oldest 527s is the Sierra Club, which is running
an $8 million campaign boosting Democrats running for Congress and
attacking Bush's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would take effect the day Clinton signs it. Groups will
not have to reveal donations made before then.

<HEADLINE> Gay Eagle Scout Loses Court Fight  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATAWAN, N.J. (AP) -- Boy Scout Troop 73, ground zero for a
dispute over gay scout leaders, can no longer be found here. It
folded several years ago, crippled by dwindling ranks and a
shortage of adult leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, one of its adult leaders was James Dale, an Eagle
Scout who became assistant scoutmaster after turning 18. In 1990,
the Boy Scouts of America ousted Dale after learning he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Dale's 10-year challenge to that decision ended Wednesday when
the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 that the Scouts can bar
homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're delighted that the ruling was in our favor,'' said James
W. Kay, executive of the Scouts' Monmouth Council, which revoked
Dale's registration as an adult leader. ''We're equally delighted,
if not more so, that hopefully this now gets put behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction on Main Street's compact business district echoed Kay's
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Seber, owner of OK Sales and Rod Shop, a haven for
restoring classic cars, said he disliked the thought of homosexuals
working with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing what I consider unnatural acts,'' said Seber,
52. ''Why give them the opportunity to be around kids who don't
really know better?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johannesen, 15, a former Cub Scout, approved of the
decision, but added that a gay leader would not make him
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ruling would make gay scouts hide their
orientation, said Johannesen, who was working behind the counter at
the Sportscard Zone, a mile from the Matawan United Methodist
Church which sponsored Troop 73 when Dale was its assistant
scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Dale said it was a sad day for him, but a worse day for the Boy
Scouts. By acknowledging publicly that it has an anti-gay policy,
the Boy Scouts risk losing youth and adult members who do not want
to be part of an exclusionary organization, Dale said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Dale's argument stemmed from his experience in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His first troop, which met at the King of Kings Lutheran Church
in Middletown, was forced to disband when an adult leader became
ill. He said two other troops also folded due to a lack of adult
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, who became an Eagle Scout at 17, was determined to become
an adult leader. In 1988, shortly after turning 18, he signed up to
be an adult member and agreed to become an assistant scoutmaster
for Troop 73.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was 19 in 1990 when he was identified in a newspaper
article as co-president of a campus lesbian and gay student group
at Rutgers University. The Monmouth Council then revoked his
registration as an adult leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Boys Scouts consider homosexuality contrary to their oath
requiring scouts to be ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued the scouts in 1992, just after New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law was expanded to protect the civil rights of
gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Boy Scouts are clearly an anti-gay group, New
Jersey schools must consider severing their relationships with
scouting chapters, said Ruth Harlow of the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, one of Dale's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be fallout in New Jersey,'' she said. ''Public
institutions (and) public schools cannot associate with a
discriminatory program.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado-based Focus on the Family cheered the court for dealing
''a severe blow to the gay rights agenda. Gay activists failed in
their attempt to destroy a nearly century-old American
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Cozza, an adult Scout leader in California and
president of Scouting For All, which advocates letting homosexuals
join, said: ''The Boy Scouts, in a weird sort of way, have been
outed. They are out of the closet. They are a bigoted organization.
I know a lot of my friends are not going to keep their kids in
scouting.''

<HEADLINE> 'Perfect Storm' Ppremieres  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SUKIENNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVERS, Mass. (AP) -- Proud to see the New England premiere of
''The Perfect Storm'' and mindful that it pays tribute to local men
who died, loyal fans lined up to see the film -- and the actors
starring in it.
</P>
<P>
   Former ''ER'' star George Clooney and rapper-turned-actor Mark
Wahlberg attended Wednesday night's showing.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we thought was that if we did it right, we could come
back and say with any luck we served their story,'' said Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on the best-selling book by Sebastian Junger,
tells the story of the ill-fated ''Andrea Gail'' and its crew, who
were lost in a ferocious storm that struck the North Atlantic in
October 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very difficult. It was, you know, like a white-knuckle,
holding on,'' said Rusty Shatford, the brother of crewman Bobby
Shatford, who is played by Wahlberg. ''I wanted it to end, but I
didn't want it to end. I was happy with the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The film seemed to capture the audience's attention -- no one
strayed from their seat as the 129-minute movie unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous chuckles from audience members who recognized local
landmarks and fellow Gloucester residents quickly melted into rapt
silence. Audience members fought back tears as the film nears its
end with a memorial service to the fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a wonderful job,'' said Mary Anne Shatford, sister of
Bobby Shatford. ''After seeing this I am proud to be Bobby's
sister, and proud to be from Gloucester.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy. I hope everyone remembers that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, Wahlberg and director Wolfgang Petersen all spoke of
the film as a tribute to fishermen and to Gloucester, a city that
has lost 10,000 people to the sea since 1623.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that we did a tribute to their life here,'' Petersen
said. ''I want to give people a feeling of what's behind the
swordfish on their plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg, a Boston native, said he was mindful of the sensitive
nature of the story about the Gloucester-based crew.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 'Perfect Storm' Premieres  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SUKIENNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVERS, Mass. (AP) -- Proud to see the New England premiere of
''The Perfect Storm'' and mindful that it pays tribute to local men
who died, loyal fans lined up to see the film -- and the actors
starring in it.
</P>
<P>
   Former ''ER'' star George Clooney and rapper-turned-actor Mark
Wahlberg attended Wednesday night's showing.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we thought was that if we did it right, we could come
back and say with any luck we served their story,'' said Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on the best-selling book by Sebastian Junger,
tells the story of the ill-fated ''Andrea Gail'' and its crew, who
were lost in a ferocious storm that struck the North Atlantic in
October 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very difficult. It was, you know, like a white-knuckle,
holding on,'' said Rusty Shatford, the brother of crewman Bobby
Shatford, who is played by Wahlberg. ''I wanted it to end, but I
didn't want it to end. I was happy with the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The film seemed to capture the audience's attention -- no one
strayed from their seat as the 129-minute movie unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous chuckles from audience members who recognized local
landmarks and fellow Gloucester residents quickly melted into rapt
silence. Audience members fought back tears as the film nears its
end with a memorial service to the fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a wonderful job,'' said Mary Anne Shatford, sister of
Bobby Shatford. ''After seeing this I am proud to be Bobby's
sister, and proud to be from Gloucester.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy. I hope everyone remembers that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, Wahlberg and director Wolfgang Petersen all spoke of
the film as a tribute to fishermen and to Gloucester, a city that
has lost 10,000 people to the sea since 1623.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that we did a tribute to their life here,'' Petersen
said. ''I want to give people a feeling of what's behind the
swordfish on their plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg, a Boston native, said he was mindful of the sensitive
nature of the story about the Gloucester-based crew.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very sensitive subject,'' Wahlberg said. ''This is not
something that happened a century ago. It happened a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans started lining the street outside of the Loew's 20 Theater
in Danvers hours before the 8 p.m. invitation-only premiere. Mary
Lou Koch, 25, of Quincy -- a Clooney fan for years -- got to the
theater at 1 p.m.

it (does well) for the relatives of the people from Gloucester.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Surgery Screw Suit  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Thursday to consider
killing a lawsuit in which more than 5,000 people accuse a company
of fraudulently winning federal approval for marketing bone screws
for use in spinal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will decide whether federal regulation of
medical devices precludes such a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A decision is expected sometime in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal said such fraud claims, if allowed, ''would allow
state judges and lay jurors to create havoc with the federal
regulatory scheme by deciding that an administrative agency's
decision should be ignored even when the agency itself, in full
possession of the relevant facts, does not believe that any fraud
was committed.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that the Buckman Co., a consultant for
medical device manufacturers, used misrepresentations to obtain the
Food and Drug Administration's go-ahead in 1986 for marketing a
device known as Variable Screw Placement Spinal Plate Fixation
System.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had rejected Buckman's two previous applications, made
in behalf of AcroMed Corp., for marketing the device. But a third
application, which separated the device into its component parts
and indicated that the screw would be used in arm and leg bones
rather than in the spine, was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people who contend they were injured after the bone
screws were implanted into their spines sued Buckman, alleging that
it had perpetrated a fraud against the FDA. The lawsuits,
eventually consolidated into one massive case, sought monetary
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawsuits said Buckman won FDA approval under a pretext
because it had been intended all along to market the bone screws
for use in spinal surgery. The agency did not approve the marketing
of bone screws for spinal surgery until 1995, years after their use
became routine for such operations.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge in Philadelphia threw out the case, ruling
that federal regulation of medical devices bars such private
lawsuits. But a 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned
the judge's ruling and, by a 2-1 vote, reinstated the lawsuit in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1996 Supreme Court
decision that said makers of medical devices can be used in state
courts over alleged defects in their products.
</P>
<P>
   In that ruling, the court said compliance with federal laws and
regulations does not necessarily protect a heart pacemaker
manufacturer from product-liability lawsuits filed under state
laws. But the scope of the ruling was clouded by the court's
splintered voting.
</P>
<P>
   In the case acted on Thursday, Buckman's appeal was supported in
a friend-of-the-court brief submitted by Danek Medical Inc., the
nation's largest supplier of spinal implant devices. The
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Medical
Device Manufacturers Association also urged reversal of the 3rd
Circuit court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for those surgery patients who sued Buckman Co. told
the justices there was no need for review.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Committee, 98-1768.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Thursday as investors'

<HEADLINE> Court To Resolve N.H.-Maine Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Thursday to resolve a
border dispute between New Hampshire and Maine over which state
gets to claim the area of Portsmouth Harbor containing the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   The justices allowed New Hampshire to ''sue'' Maine in the
nation's highest court without first having the dispute heard in
any other court. The court invoked its ''original jurisdiction''
and agreed to serve as a trial court in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The justices likely will appoint a ''special master'' to conduct
hearings and collect evidence. Such cases usually take years to
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Maine had argued that the Supreme Court already resolved the
issue in its favor in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire contends it has authority over all of Portsmouth
Harbor, including the islands on which the naval shipyard is
located. State officials say the state boundary extends to the
low-water mark on the Maine shore of the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Maine says the border between the two states lies in the
harbor's deepest channel, which would put the shipyard on Maine's
side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shipyard has always been culturally, economically and
politically connected to New Hampshire,'' that state's attorney
general, Philip T. McLaughlin, said in court papers. However, he
added, ''The Navy has increasingly treated Maine as the state with
jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the shipyard is owned by the federal government, the
state in which it is located can exercise some authority.
McLaughlin said the boundary dispute is important now that the Navy
has begun leasing some areas of the shipyard to private companies.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire said there is ''substantial historical and legal
evidence'' dating back to pre-Revolutionary times to support its
claim of authority over the entire harbor. Rockingham County, N.H.,
was established in 1770 as including the entire harbor, the state's
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1740 boundary-setting decree signed by King George II did not
divide the harbor, New Hampshire's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Maine Attorney General Andrew Ketterer contended the
Supreme Court resolved the issue in a 1976 case that decided the
king's 1740 decree set the boundary in mid-harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Official New Hampshire maps place the boundary in the middle
of the river,'' Ketterer said. ''The state of Maine should not be
put to the expense of re-establishing this boundary.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is New Hampshire v. Maine, 130 Original.

<HEADLINE> Cezanne Painting Fetches $18 Million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A painting by French Impressionist Paul Cezanne
has sold at auction for more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still Life with Fruit and Pot of Ginger'' received a top bid,
including buyer's premium, of $18,191,936 at a London sale by
Christie's auction house Wednesday. It was bought by a U.S. dealer,
but no further information was provided.
</P>
<P>
   The 1895 oil painting is regarded as one of Cezanne's most
important works. A sometime lawyer and banker turned painter, he
was derided during his lifetime, but is now hailed by many as the
father of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was sold on the open market for the first time by
descendants of Bruno Cassirer, a Berlin publisher and early
champion of Cezanne's work. It had been on loan to the National
Gallery in London since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   It was the centerpiece of a $46 million sale of Impressionist
and post-Impressionist art that included works by Edgar Degas,
Pierre-August Renoir, Robert Delaunay and Claude Monet.
</P>
<P>
   The record price paid for a Cezanne was $56 million by an
anonymous buyer at Sotheby's in New York in May 1999 for ''Still
Life with Curtain, Pitcher and Bowl of Fruit.'' It was the
fourth-highest price ever paid for a painting.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate sale Wednesday, a rediscovered painting by the
20th-century British artist Francis Bacon was bought for
$4,469,546.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's 1952 ''Study for Portrait (Man Screaming),'' last seen
in public in 1962 and for decades known only through a
black-and-white catalogue photograph, was rediscovered in a private
collection. One in a series of characteristically intense and
tormented portraits, it had been expected to get between $2.1
million and $2.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Reno Mulls New Laws After Elian  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno and immigration
officials will review whether the case of Elian Gonzalez
demonstrates a need for new procedures or regulations, such as a
minimum age for children seeking asylum on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the questions I want to ask is, what if anything,
should be done,'' Reno said at her weekly news conference Thursday.
''We will be looking at it to see if there is any lesson learned,
anything that should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's own legal briefs conceded that Immigration and
Naturalization Service regulations were silent on how old a child
must be in order to apply for asylum without consent from parents.
</P>
<P>
   The INS concluded that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
should speak for the 6-year-old in immigration matters, and Juan
Miguel wanted to return the boy to his home in Cuba. Elian's Miami
relatives tried unsuccessfully to get U.S. courts to force the
government to accept what the relatives said was Elian's own
application for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where do you draw the line between a 6-year-old and a
12-year-old? How do you make these judgments?'' Reno asked. She was
referring to an appellate court ruling in the 1970s case of Walter
Polovchak, who sought asylum rather than return to the Soviet
Union, that age 12 was the lower limit of when a child should be
allowed to speak separately from parents on such issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno stopped short of advocating a regulation fixing a
specific age.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to depend on the child,'' she said. ''All I
want to do is ... see if there is anything that we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, she said, the case is ''a mixture of so many different
things: A little boy who lost his mother, a country that is not
free. It is one of the few countries that is not a democratic
nation in this hemisphere. It's a story of families that have
disagreements. It is a story of so much of human life.
</P>
<P>
   ''And yet, in the end, he is with his father, and I am glad of
that. I just wish he were with his father in a democratic, free
country.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names New No. 2 at CIA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has selected a career
intelligence officer to serve in the No. 2 spot in the Central
Intelligence Agency, CIA Director George Tenet announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton designated John E. McLaughlin as acting deputy director
of central intelligence. He succeeds Air Force Gen. John Gordon,
who was sworn in on Wednesday as director of the new National
Nuclear Security Administration in the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, 58, has served as CIA's deputy director for
intelligence, the CIA's analysis division, since July 1997. Before
that, he served as vice chairman for estimates at the CIA and as
acting chairman of the National Intelligence Council.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that Clinton was expected to formally nominate
McLaughlin to the post soon but that the paperwork was not yet
ready.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin was put in on an acting basis, in the meantime,
because it was important to fill the CIA vacancy, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once formally nominated, McLaughlin's post is subject to Senate
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin has worked at the CIA since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''His knowledge of both world affairs and the American foreign
policy process is deep and wide,'' Tenet said in a statement.

Ridgeland, the scene was strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and whites, from school-age youngsters to senior
citizens, were standing huddled in a circle, heads bowed and eyes
closed. The early morning prayer service was just ending, and Andy
Beaird, a young, white man reached out his hand to introduce
himself to Martha Turner, a 47-year-old black woman.
</P>
<P>
   It is this kind of fellowship that brings a smile to face of
Dolphus Weary, executive director of Mission Mississippi, an
organization formed in 1993 to get Christians of all races to
worship under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not about the business of trying to reconcile the whole
community. We're specifically about the business of getting the
church to reconcile across racial lines,'' Weary said.
</P>
<P>
   Racial lines are sharp in churches across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only about 10 percent of the congregations in the United
States are integrated or interracial,'' said Mark Chaves, an
associate professor at the University of Arizona, quoting findings
of his National Congregations Study. The study, based on 1998 data,
found 69 percent of congregations were almost all-white, 18 percent
mostly black.
</P>
<P>
   ''People speak of the 11 o'clock hour on Sunday being the most
segregated hour in the country, and they're right,'' said the Rev.
Gus Shelley, the pastor of First United Methodist in Gulfport, a
1,500-member congregation that is predominantly white.
</P>
<P>
   To move toward more diverse congregations, ministers first may
need to determine why the races choose to stay separate when it
comes to worship.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not an easy answer,'' said Keith Harper, a professor
of church history at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Wake Forest, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''Races stay separate in part because of lingering racism, but I
think there's a very healthy dose of tradition, personal comfort
levels and class assumptions,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   The nondenominational, Jackson-based Mission Mississippi has a
prayer gathering twice a week, alternating between black and white
churches and usually drawing about 50 people. The group also hosts
a breakfast for businessmen once a month and various dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're developing relationships and people are getting to know
each other,'' Weary said. ''We're trying to break down
stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaird, who is Presbyterian and has been a participant in
Mission Mississippi for over a year, said unfortunately Christians
''have perpetuated a religion that is racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who works with the Jackson Public Schools, said her
involvement in Mission Mississippi has helped her ''make more of a
commitment to God'' by meeting people of all races and
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group operates on a $300,000 annual budget,
garnered from donations from churches, individuals and small
foundations. As part of another ministry some years ago, Weary
traveled across the nation -- making stops in Seattle, Denver and
Los Angeles -- preaching a message of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Though church segregation is a nationwide phenomenon, Weary said
Mississippi, with its infamous history of racial strife, is now his
focus. He said many in the state see one-race churches as a residue
of the institutional segregation of the past, and they want to ''do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it's difficult for any denomination to enforce a decree
of integrated worship, said Harper, the Wake Forest professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my perception that some churches have perhaps done a
better job, but I can't give high marks to denominations,'' Harper
said. ''I don't know if anyone has cornered the market on how to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Terrell, Texas, two Baptist ministers -- one black, one white
-- say they have found a formula for unity.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad track separates the Rev. Bob Price's mainly white
Cornerstone Baptist Church and the Rev. Clarence Robertson's mostly
black congregation at New Mt. Calvary Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   The two men began discussing racial reconciliation after a Ku
Klux Klan march was planned in their town about eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the impetus that started Clarence and I to say, 'If
they're coming to destroy relationships, there ought to be somebody
to build relationships.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Price and Robertson have held joint services and
socials, including a Thanksgiving program in which the two
delivered the sermon as a team. The Southern Baptist Convention
spotlighted the pastors at its recent meeting in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has to happen for reconciliation to come about is that it
has to start at the top,'' Price said. ''Clarence and I go to lunch
together. We go to Rangers (baseball) games together. We do things
in public so people can see it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kind of sad that this is not the norm,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Price said the congregations have begun to follow their pastors'
example, and people in the town of 15,000 sometimes seek advice
from them on racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   To Price, the key to ending segregation in the church is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes two guys that are willing to love each other, and
that's it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Documentary Shows Dvorak in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPILLVILLE, Iowa (AP) -- To a modern visitor, the verdant,
undulating countryside around this northeast Iowa town looks like a
Grant Wood painting.
</P>
<P>
   To Czech composer Antonin Dvorak in the 1890s, it looked like
home.
</P>
<P>
   While living in the United States as director of the National
Conservatory of Music in New York, Dvorak spent the summer of 1893
in Spillville, a town of 390 that works hard to keep memories of
that visit alive.
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak's time in this country and its influences on his music
are examined in the documentary ''Dvorak and America,'' to be shown
Monday at 10 p.m. Eastern on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything was motivated by the music,'' said New York
filmmaker Lucille Carra, who wrote, directed and co-produced the
film. ''It's music-driven, so we tried to find emotional points to
the music to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before leaving for Japan to work on her documentary
''The Inland Sea,'' Carra had heard Dvorak's most famous work,
Symphony No. 9 in E Minor (From the New World), popularly known as
the New World Symphony, on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just really listened, maybe for the first time, and kind of
took it in,'' Carra said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, Carra and her co-producer, Brian Cotnoir,
got stuck in the mud on a mountaintop in Japan. As they worked to
extricate themselves, they heard bells pealing in the distance. The
music was from the Largo, or the ''Going Home'' segment, of the New
World Symphony. It was 6 p.m., going-home time in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then we bought some CDs and it was like it all came
together,'' Carra said. ''I was reading the liner notes, and about
Spillville, and everything occurred to me. It just snowballed from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Dvorak's move from Bohemia -- a region in the
Czech Republic -- to America, and looks at the relationships he
forged while living in this country from 1892 until 1895.
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak opened the National Conservatory to all comers, including
African-Americans. Black composers Harry T. Burleigh and Will
Marion Cook were among his students, and they opened his eyes to a
new form of music.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gets invited to New York to start this grand conservatory
of music, to crystallize and develop an American musical
tradition,'' said Chris Rossi, executive director of Humanities
Iowa, which helped fund the film. ''So he gets here and finds that
well, by golly, we already have an American musical tradition and
it's embedded in the Negro spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dvorak pointed that out in an article he wrote for the New
York Herald, run under the headline ''Real Value of Negro
Melodies,'' he helped legitimize African-American music. He also
stirred up a furor among traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here was this quaint, shy, awkward person who comes and sees
something about us that Americans are not seeing themselves,'' said
Peter Alexander, a musicologist at the University of Iowa. ''What
sounds American to anybody in the world -- Broadway, jazz, pop music
-- that all comes from the African-American influence. Dvorak
somehow foresaw that.
</P>
<P>
   ''This film stresses that very, very successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   It also stresses the importance of Dvorak's time in Spillville,
where Carra and her crew spent several days filming and talking to
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak had been invited to Spillville by musician Josef Kovarik,
who had studied in Prague and felt the Iowa town, which had been
settled by Bohemians, would give the renowned composer and his
family a taste of home.
</P>
<P>
   It did. The film shows how Dvorak delighted in the rural
landscapes, his morning walks along the Turkey River, the singing
of the birds and the oinking of pigs. He wrote to a friend about
the ''endless acres of field and meadow,'' the herds of cattle
dotting the pastures and the graves of Czech countrymen ''who sleep
their last sleep here.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Spillville, Dvorak composed the String Quartet in F
Major and String Quintet in E Flat. In a letter to a friend the day
before leaving, Dvorak referred to those two pieces and the New
World Symphony when he wrote, ''I should never have written these
works just so if I hadn't seen America.''
</P>
<P>
   The house in which Dvorak and his family stayed is now a museum,
the first floor showcasing a collection of extravagantly carved
clocks and the second floor devoted to Dvorak. The displays include
two organs on which he composed and a violin he was believed to
have played.
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak also composed on the massive, 18-foot-tall pipe organ
that sits in a loft above the entrance to St. Wenceslaus church.
The organ, bought for $1,100 in 1876, underwent a $45,000
restoration in 1996 and is still used.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you put Iowa smack in the middle of the film, it pops out
at you,'' Carra said. ''You really see the kind of music he wrote
in Spillville. It's smaller format. He wrote more chamber music.
But musically, it holds a lot of weight.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Loses 111; Nasdaq Sheds 75  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Thursday as investors'
enthusiasm disappeared following the Federal Reserve's announcement
on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 111.41 at 10,416.42.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 13.99 at 1,440.83, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 74.85 at 3,865.49.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged, but noted
that inflation risks remain in the economy. The warning on
inflation led many analysts to expect that the Fed will raise rates
at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the game is over. This is more like the seventh
inning stretch,'' said John Forelli, senior vice president at
Independence Investment Associates in Boston. ''The Fed is waiting
to see whether economic activity slows substantially. I don't think
any investors can rule out action in August.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, analysts said, the market may find excuses to
remain stalled in a narrow range. Stocks had advanced modestly in
the days leading up to the meeting, leading investors to take some
profits Thursday. Also, traders said investors were unloading some
stocks ahead of the Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to rising interest
rates, pulled the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan fell $2.063 to $114.563
and American Express fell 75 cents to $52.438.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were also taking profits from the technology
stocks that have risen in recent sessions. LSI Logic fell $5.75 to
$53.25 and Cisco fell $2.375 to $61.188.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Eli Lilly soared $13.125 to
$100.25 after announcing that an independent board gave a favorable
review to its drug Zovant, used to treat sepsis. The experimental
drug, if approved, would be the first drug approved for the
treatment of sepsis, a disease in which the body's systems fail due
to infection.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys plunged $8.25 to $15.375 lowered guidance on its
second-quarter revenue and earnings. Investors are enacting fierce
penalties on companies that demonstrate any evidence of earnings
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 458.39 million
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.10 to 512.89.

<HEADLINE> Voice of Rocky the Squirrel Returns  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- June Foray can be the voice of
reason as Rocky the Flying Squirrel, the cartoon companion to
lovably dopey Bullwinkle Moose.
</P>
<P>
   Foray can be the voice of childlike bewilderment as Cindy Lou
Who asking the Grinch why he is taking away the family Christmas
tree.
</P>
<P>
   And Foray can be the voice of menace. Seated in her home
surrounded by souvenirs of the dozens of cartoon voices she has
done over the decades, Foray launches into the memorably chilling
dialogue she once recorded for a ''Twilight Zone'' episode about a
maniacal talking doll.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm Talky Tina,'' Foray utters in a girlish but threatening
tone, ''and I'm going to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   The last survivor of the voice talents who originated ''Rocky
and Bullwinkle'' on television in the late 1950s, Foray reprises
her role as the can-do squirrel in the big-screen adaptation ''The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Foray, 74, saw the finished film last weekend and found it
''completely reminiscent of our series. It had the wit and humor,
the good story with a beginning, middle and end, which some movies
don't have. It had all the charm of Rocky and Bullwinkle. And
Rocky's the same as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The original ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' aired in 326 short
installments as part of a series featuring other cartoon creations
by Jay Ward. A sharp Cold War spoof, the cartoon pitted the moose
and squirrel against the bumbling spies Boris and Natasha and their
boss, Fearless Leader.
</P>
<P>
   The movie lifts Rocky and Bullwinkle into the real world as
computer-animated characters. Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader
appear in the flesh, played by Jason Alexander, Rene Russo and
Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   Foray took particular interest in how Russo handled Natasha's
comically Soviet accent. Besides the voice of Rocky, Foray had also
done Natasha for the cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''She did a really good job,'' says Foray, whose own voice
carries a trace of Rocky's plucky tone. ''She captured Natasha
very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Springfield, Mass., Foray moved with her parents as a
teen-ager to Los Angeles, where she began working on radio
programs.
</P>
<P>
   She did voices for the animated movies ''Cinderella'' and
''Peter Pan'' in the 1950s, eventually hooking up with Ward and
Bill Scott, who originated the voice of Bullwinkle. Ward and Scott
died in the 1980s; for the movie, Bullwinkle's voice was done by
Keith Scott, who is unrelated to Bill Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Foray did voices for other Ward series, including ''Dudley
Do-Right'' and ''George of the Jungle,'' as well as ''The
Simpsons'' pilot, ''Mulan,'' ''The Smurfs,'' ''Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?'' and Cindy Lou in ''The Grinch That Stole Christmas.'' Her
Warner Bros. cartoon credits include Witch Hazel and Tweety's
Granny.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, Foray is getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame, right next to Ward's.
</P>
<P>
   Her home is filled with posters, stuffed animals and caricatures
of her many characters. It is clear from the number of Rocky and
Bullwinkle items, though, who is her favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody asks me that,'' said Foray, who wears a golden
pendant of Rocky sculpted by one of her nieces. ''I think the fans
kind of answer that for me. Everybody loves Rocky. I get letters
from Belgium, Germany, all over. People don't think of him as a
squirrel. They think of him as a person. And he's a good little
person.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Mulls Prescription Drug Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are hailing their House-passed
prescription drug bill as a historic new Medicare benefit, but its
prospects are iffy in the Senate and President Clinton has
threatened a veto to force major changes in a measure Democrats
claim is an election-year scam.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is sound, it is in Medicare, it is an entitlement
program and it is a guaranteed benefit,'' Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., a chief architect of the GOP plan, said Wednesday night
as the measure cleared the House in a close, mostly party-line
vote, 217-214.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he had received
assurances from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that
''they are going to take it up,'' and added that his door was open
for negotiations with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always said we're willing to sit down with the
president,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who chairs the Senate
Finance Committee, said his panel was working behind closed doors
on bipartisan Medicare legislation he would like to begin action on
in July, after Congress returns from its Independence Day break.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrat Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia said he
wasn't confident that the result would be a viable bill, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we going to have a better chance of compromise after the
July Fourth recess? I very much doubt it,'' Rockefeller said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto any bill reaching his desk that
looks like the House GOP measure. It would rely on a blend of
private insurance companies and federal subsidies to spread
coverage nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want the American people to know that the bill that
they passed is an empty promise to most of our seniors,'' Clinton
said Thursday at an Oval Office announcement on his nomination of
Norman Mineta as new commerce secretary. ''The bill passed along
partisan lines and it offers a flawed, unworkable private insurance
prescription benefit that the insurance companies themselves -- to
their everlasting credit -- have said, 'This will not work.'
</P>
<P>
   ''This provides more political coverage for the Republicans who
voted for it than insurance coverage for the seniors who need to
buy medicine,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democrats instead are advocating a costlier
alternative: a uniform, government-run prescription drug benefit,
offered to all 39 million elderly and disabled Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But majority Republicans, arguing that the $100 billion price
tag over five years for the Democratic version exceeded the $40
billion allotted in their budget, refused to allow a House vote on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Polling indicates the issue of prescription drugs is a priority
for Americans 65 and older, a group that accounted for more than
one-quarter of voters in the 1998 elections and is regarded as a
key swing group in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Adding drug coverage to Medicare would be the biggest expansion
of the program since its creation in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   AARP, the nation's largest organization of older adults, is
remaining aloof from either party on what is shaping up to be a
highly competitive election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a lot of details to be worked out on both plans,
and it seems to us a little bit premature to be bringing this to a
vote in such a rushed fashion,'' AARP public policy director John
Rother said.
</P>
<P>
   With elections to determine control of the House a little more
than four months away, the House debate was thoroughly political.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Democrats questioned the motivation of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sham. It's a hoax. It's public relations. It's
electioneering. It is not writing a plan that will help people,''
said Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who led his rank
and file in delaying tactics, including a brief walkout, that added
hours to Wednesday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, citing reports that Democrats already have tested
campaign advertisements on the issue, said, ''My friends, put those
commercials away. America is sick and tired of bickering. Americans
just want us to create a product that will benefit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the House Republican and Democratic proposals include
provisions to help low-income senior citizens and those with
particularly high annual drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Fees charged by private insurers under the GOP plan could vary,
but Republicans estimated a $35 to $40 monthly premium, a $250
annual deductible and a 50 percent co-payment up to $2,100 in
covered costs. Catastrophic coverage would then kick in if a senior
spent $6,000 out of pocket in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said their plan would have a premium beginning at $25
a month, doubling as benefits are gradually increased over several
years. There would be no deductible and a 50 percent co-payment up
to $2,000 in covered costs, eventually rising to $5,000.
Catastrophic coverage would kick in at $4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, several bipartisan drug plans have been
introduced but have garnered little discernible attention from
either party's leadership.

<HEADLINE> HUD Gun Safety Coalition Grows  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that
support continues to grow for a gun safety coalition even though
the House of Representatives recently voted to block federal
funding of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by Reps. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., and more than a dozen police officials from around the
country, Cuomo said at a press conference that more than 500
communities have signed up for the Communities for Safer Guns
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The continued growth of the coalition and now the added
support from the law enforcement community shows there is a
widespread belief in what it was created to do,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition formed in March around a pledge signed by Smith &AMP;
Wesson, the nation's largest gun maker, and federal officials
seeking to make guns safer. As part of the pact, cities would give
Smith &AMP; Wesson a preference when buying guns for law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The preference provision of the agreement is the subject of a
federal lawsuit filed by seven gun makers and a gun industry trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawmakers have sent mixed messages on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the House voted, 218-207, to prevent HUD from
working with the Communities for Safer Guns Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, the House narrowly beat back an effort to scuttle
the government's pact with Smith &AMP; Wesson for the use of safety
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday vote, on an amendment to a spending bill sponsored by
Rep. John Hostettler, R-Ind., was a setback to rival gun makers and
the National Rifle Association, which have criticized the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Hostettler has called the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement ''backdoor
gun control through coercion and through threat of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am outraged by the attempt of the congressional Republicans
to tie the hands of these local law enforcement officials as well
as federal agencies in their efforts to reduce gun violence,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bill Seeks Slave Labor Recognition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two black members of Congress introduced a
bill Thursday that recognizes contributions by slaves in the
construction of the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., and John Lewis, D-Ga., are seeking to
create a task force to study the history and contributions of slave
laborers in the construction of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time the role African-Americans played be fully realized
and they be given the honorable recognition that they deserve,''
Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   A report last March by Washington's WRC-TV estimated that 400 of
the 650 laborers working on the Capitol building in the 1790s were
enslaved blacks.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Senate historian's office said little research has
been done on this issue. ''Our knowledge of the laborers, black or
white, is not very good,'' said Betty Koed, the Senate's assistant
historian.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 62; Nasdaq Off 40  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Thursday as investors' enthusiasm
disappeared following the Federal Reserve's announcement on
interest rates. But some consumer issues posted gains as investors
looked for stocks that will perform well even if the economy slows.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 61.61 at 10,466.63.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 7.15 at 1,447.67, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 39.65 at 3,900.69.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged, but noted
that inflation risks remain in the economy. The warning on
inflation led many analysts to expect that the Fed will raise rates
at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the game is over. This is more like the seventh
inning stretch,'' said John Forelli, senior vice president at
Independence Investment Associates in Boston. ''The Fed is waiting
to see whether economic activity slows substantially. I don't think
any investors can rule out action in August.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, analysts said, the market may find excuses to
remain stalled in a narrow range. Stocks had advanced modestly in
the days leading up to the meeting, leading investors to take some
profits Thursday. Also, traders said investors were unloading some
stocks ahead of the Independence Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to rising interest
rates, pulled the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan fell $2.625 to $114 and
Citigroup fell 56.25 cents to $63.563.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were also taking profits from the technology
stocks that have risen in recent sessions. LSI Logic fell $5.313 to
$53.813 and Cisco fell $1.875 to $61.688.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Eli Lilly soared $15.75 to
$102.875 after announcing that an independent board gave a
favorable review to its drug Zovant, used to treat sepsis. The
experimental drug, which still needs approval from the Food and
Drug Administration, would be the first drug approved for the
treatment of sepsis, a disease in which the body's systems fail due
to infection.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys plunged $8.25 to $15.375 after warning that its
second-quarter revenue and earnings would be disappointing.
Investors are punishing companies that demonstrate any evidence of
earnings weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks made the most convincing gains, rising on
the hope that whether the economy grows or falters, products like
toothpaste and soap will continue to drive sales. Kimberly Clark
rose $2.063 to $56.125 and Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 87.5 cents to
$98.875.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 686.81 million
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.22 to 515.77.

<HEADLINE> Court Blocks La. Drug Tests  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court just said ''no'' Thursday to
a state's plan to require its elected officials to take random drug
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The justices refused without comment to revive a Louisiana law
that allowed such random testing.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana officials had argued that the tests, even though
required of people not suspected of any crime, would not violate
the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches because the state
has ''special needs'' to deter drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court in 1977 ruled in a Georgia case that
states cannot force political candidates to take drug tests merely
to demonstrate the government's commitment to the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's drug-testing law focused not on candidates but on
elected officials. The law required elected officials, except for
judges, to undergo random tests to ensure they ''are persons of
integrity, sound judgment, reliability and seriousness of
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials were to be tested for illegal drugs including
marijuana, opiates, cocaine and amphetamines. An official who
failed two tests could end up before a public hearing, be censured
and fined up to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged in federal court by Avery C. Alexander
and Arthur A. Morrell, state lawmakers representing Orleans Parish.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge struck down the law, and the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld that ruling in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public's interest in preventing drug abuse among elected
officials, while not insignificant, cannot supersede one of the
Constitution's most fundamental proscriptions,'' the appeals court
said. It noted that the Constitution's Fourth Amendment generally
bans searches without ''probable cause'' to suspect a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In previous rulings, the Supreme Court has allowed random
searches for railroad workers and U.S. Customs agents who enforce
anti-drug laws, citing public health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The court also has allowed random drug testing of student
athletes in public schools because of the national concern over
drug use by youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Thursday, Louisiana's lawyers
acknowledged there had been no proof state officials had abused
drugs. But they said elected officials ''must be beyond reproach.''

<HEADLINE> Big Mac Attack Leader Goes on Trial  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- In a nation that loves its dinner, the mustachioed
folk hero who led a Big Mac Attack is leapfrogging his vandalism
trial into a planetary protest against what he calls malbouffe:
lousy food.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eating is not a neutral act,'' Jose Bove tells reporters,
explaining how what began as a riposte to a punitive U.S. duty on
French cheese bloomed into a popular uprising against big
agriculture and globalization in general.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30,000 people are expected Friday in Millau, in the
heart of Roquefort country, where Bove and nine others were
arrested last August after trashing a soon-to-open McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   The food fight began when France refused to import hormone-laced
U.S. beef unless it was labeled. Washington added a 100 percent tax
to Roquefort, foie gras and other French delicacies. Bove's farm
lobby group struck back.
</P>
<P>
   A Millau court will hear arguments Friday and Saturday and
deliver a judgment later this summer. But the Confederation
Paysanne, the farmers' group Bove heads, seized the moment to
display support.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen open-air forums led by activists from around the world
plan to skewer multinationals and industrial cuisine. A free rock
concert will entertain sympathizers arriving by bus from across
France.
</P>
<P>
   American speakers include Lori Wallach, president of Global
Trade Watch, and Bill Christison, who heads the Washington-based
National Family Farm Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll learn to think twice before locking us up,'' Bove
said. And, he added, French leaders who assume the rotating
European Union presidency on Saturday will see they must resist
genetically altered food imports.
</P>
<P>
   Bove spent three weeks in jail last year until he decided to
post bail. He held aloft his manacled wrists for a photo that
crystalized his fame.
</P>
<P>
   Although he chose ''McDo'' only as a symbol of a larger foe,
others attacked the franchise chain across France. In April,
Brittany separatists blew up a McDonald's, killing the young French
woman who managed it.
</P>
<P>
   Bove has served an unrelated eight-month suspended sentence for
plowing up a field planted in transgenic corn. The McDonald's
charge carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a
hefty fine.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of defense witnesses is to include South American
farmers and anti-globalization economists. Bove promised to walk
out of the trial if any were excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Bove's book, ''The World Is Not Merchandise,'' has sold 80,000
copies, and he jets from Seattle to the South Pacific to espouse
his cause. Business Week named him among 50 movers who are shaping
a new Europe.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac has gone from avoiding him to embracing
him and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin takes him to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Bove's alfalfa-roots movement has galvanized the fractured left
wing of French politics, while winning wide support from
conservative leaders who recognize a phenomenon when they say it.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bove bills himself as a sheep farmer who produces milk
for Roquefort, his early years were spent in Berkeley where his
parents studied biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   As a young intellectual, he traveled with Greenpeace to protest
French nuclear tests in Tahitian waters. As a farmers' advocate, he
translates complex socio-economic theory into barnyard language.
</P>
<P>
   Asked once in an interview why he didn't resolve his differences
by having McDonald's put Roquefort on cheeseburgers, he replied,
''That would be like selling holy water in a sex shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove's specific appeal in France is his remarkable symbolic
similarity to Asterix, a cartoon figure who gulps magic potion like
Popeye eats spinach to knock Romans out of their sandals with a
vicious left uppercut.
</P>
<P>
   Both are compact, with an outsized mustache, a wry grin and a
mission to save workaday Frenchmen from an evil empire.
</P>
<P>
   Bove's main targets are the World Trade Organization,
multinationals and governments that push scientifically engineered
food. This, he said, crushes the small-time producers who insist on
quality and taste.
</P>
<P>
   His complaints are vague about McDonald's, which counters that
well over 90 percent of its meals sold in France come from French
farms. Eighty new outlets are to open this year, joining the 800 in
every corner of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Millau McDo is closing Friday and Saturday for reasons its
manager considers obvious. But McDonald's workers who sympathize
with Bove's cause say the farmers promised to protect the place.
</P>
<P>
   In its pretrial coverage, the Paris daily ''Liberation'' sampled
customers who liked both Bove and Ronald McDonald without being
troubled by the paradox.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper concluded: ''So it looks like you can be crazy
about Bove while throwing yourself at a 'Best of Big Mac' menu and
chocolate brownies.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pressed on Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forty-five U.S. experts on China have written
to President Clinton urging him to delay his decision on building a
national missile defense. They argue that a ''precipitous
decision'' would increase tensions and lead China to accelerate the
modernization of its relatively small nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. plans for (national missile defense) are viewed by China
as a sign of increased hostility toward their country,'' they wrote
in a letter to the president Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Defense Secretary
William Cohen will travel to Beijing next month to discuss missile
defense and other security issues with his Chinese counterpart and
possibly with President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen will stress that the U.S. plan for missile defense ''is
not a system we're building in response to what China is doing''
and is entirely defensive in nature, Bacon said. He said the
Pentagon is convinced China will continue modernizing its military
forces regardless of whether the United States has missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also strongly opposes the missile defense project, which
is designed to protect all 50 U.S. states against attack by
long-range missiles. North Korea, Iraq and Iran are cited by the
Pentagon as potential threats, although none has yet tested a
ballistic missile capable of reaching American territory.
</P>
<P>
   The current plan for a network of missile-tracking radars,
anti-missile interceptors and high-speed computers -- if deployed as
envisioned by the Pentagon -- would ''adversely affect U.S.
relations with China,'' the China experts wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is due to decide this fall whether to give the go-ahead
for early construction work that would keep the Pentagon on
schedule for eventual deployment of a missile defense system by the
end of 2005. More production and legal decisions would be faced by
Clinton's successor before the system would be ready for use.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, urged Clinton not to ''dance on the pinhead of
rhetoric'' when he makes a decision this fall on whether to begin
construction of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who wants Clinton to give the formal go-ahead for the
missile defense, spoke after the committee's senior Democrat, Sen.
Carl Levin of Michigan, suggested Clinton might make only a partial
commitment by authorizing work to begin on a high-powered radar
station on remote Shemya Island in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Other decisions could be left to Clinton's successor, Levin
suggested. Furthermore, Levin said Clinton was unlikely to take any
action unless he was able to negotiate a ''framework agreement with
Russia'' that construction of the radar station did not violate the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In his second day of congressional testimony, retired Air Force
Gen. Larry Welch, head of a Pentagon-appointed panel of experts
overseeing the missile defense program, told the Senate panel that
brutal weather at Shemya Island, in the Aleutian chain, could pose
the biggest threat to the Pentagon's hopes of meeting a 2005
deadline for the system.
</P>
<P>
   Asked directly by the panel if he though it was likely the
system would be ready to be deployed in 2005, Welch said: ''Do I
believe it's feasible? Yes. Do I believe that's most likely? No.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Clinton said he had not made a
final decision but intended to do so in the next several weeks. One
factor in his decision-making will be the outcome of a test,
scheduled for July 7, in which an interceptor missile will be
launched from California to attempt to collide with a mock warhead
over the Pacific Ocean. In two previous such tests, one succeeded
and one failed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that among other factors he will consider is the
likely reaction of the Chinese and other foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to the president, the 45 private experts said
China is likely to respond by modernizing its nuclear weapons.
Currently, China has about 18 long-range missiles capable of
reaching U.S. territory. Although the Pentagon says the missile
defense system it proposes is not intended to negate China's
nuclear deterrent, it will be designed to knock down as many as a
couple of dozen warheads.
</P>
<P>
   China ''believes that even a simple missile defense
configuration will leave its nuclear arsenal vulnerable,'' the
letter said. It urged Clinton to take more time to consider the
implications for U.S. foreign relations and to ''develop
cooperative approaches to curbing missile proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   The signatories to the letter include Arthur W. Hummel Jr., a
former U.S. ambassador to China, and Paul H.B. Godwin, a retired
National War College professor who has had extensive private
contacts with Chinese officials in recent years.

<HEADLINE> FAA Plans Airline Maintenance Checks  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal inspectors will launch special
maintenance audits of the nation's largest airlines over the next
four months, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as the FAA reported that Alaska Airlines,
under intense scrutiny since a January crash off the coast of
California, has made sufficient improvements to continue doing
maintenance on its planes.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had threatened to strip the airline of the right to
do maintenance -- a step that could have eventually grounded all its
planes -- unless its programs were improved.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Lacey, FAA director of flight standards, said his
inspectors will continue to closely monitor Alaska, but ''we are
... encouraged by what we have seen so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased that the FAA has accepted our plan ... we
really tried to go above and beyond what they asked for,'' Alaska
Airlines President John F. Kelly said at a briefing in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said three teams of a half-dozen safety inspectors each
will fan out starting July 17 to look at the maintenance programs
of the nation's nine other major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, Lacey said, is to identify successful programs and
safety practices so airlines can share them with one another. If
problems are found, however, he said, the FAA will not hesitate to
act.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey declined to reveal which airlines will be visited first,
but said he expects to make the findings public. The nine major
carriers are American Airlines, America West, Continental, Delta,
Northwest, Southwest, TWA, US Airways and United.
</P>
<P>
   After those audits are done, he added, inspectors will turn
their attention to the larger regional airlines and cargo carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The close inspection of Alaska Airlines was launched after the
Jan. 31 crash of Flight 261 in the Pacific Ocean off Los Angeles,
killing all 88 aboard. Allegations of unsafe maintenance work,
which first surfaced in 1998, were thrust back into the spotlight.
The cause of that accident remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But in its audit the FAA uncovered nearly 150 cases in which
aircraft maintenance could not be documented. A reinspection of the
planes showed that the work had actually been done, but the lack of
documentation raised serious concerns about supervision and could
eventually lead to civil fines.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said that unless the airline came up with improvements
in its procedures it would lose the authority to do maintenance.
That would have meant that the carriers' planes would be grounded,
one by one, as they came due for work.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the FAA said Alaska has developed a plan to hire 150
additional maintenance workers -- 82 have been hired so far -- filled
previously vacant safety executive posts, revised its heavy
maintenance procedures and made other changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said FAA inspectors will continue to monitor the carrier
until mid-July to make sure it is continuing to follow its plan.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not satisfied with continuing progress, he added, the
FAA will not hesitate to lift its maintenance authority ''or take
stronger action, if the facts warrant.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if all goes well the FAA will recheck Alaska's
program 90 days after the mid-July report and again six months
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Changes are also being made in the way the FAA routinely
supervises Alaska, he said, with the normal complement of
inspectors to be increased from 12 to 18.

<HEADLINE> Russia Mines Emit Choking Gases  </HEADLINE>
By ANATOLY MEDETSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARTIZANSK, Russia (AP) -- When Maria Grogulenko needs to fetch a
bucket of potatoes or a jar of jam from her basement pantry, she
dons a gas mask.
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbor, Valery Shchekolda, hooks up a vacuum cleaner to a
ventilation pipe coming out of his cellar and runs it for half an
hour before he'll venture down for a few minutes. Then he rushes
back up.
</P>
<P>
   The 59,000 residents of this town in Far Eastern Russia thought
the worst had happened when Partizansk's unprofitable mines started
shutting down in 1996, robbing townspeople of work.
</P>
<P>
   But then they faced a new, even more worrying problem: a mix of
carbon dioxide and nitrogen seeping out of the closed mine shafts
has replaced almost all the oxygen in residents' cellars, making
the air there potentially lethal.
</P>
<P>
   After a few gulps of air in the cellar, it gets difficult to
breathe, and people break out in a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Three people have been hospitalized over the past three years
after being found unconscious in their cellars, starved of oxygen;
many more have been hauled out by neighbors, friends or family
members standing by above-ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, it's scary, very scary,'' Grogulenko said. ''But we
have to store food somewhere. We eat what we raise on the plot.
What we harvest gets us through the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 90 years that the mines worked, water was pumped out of
Partizansk's swampy ground into a nearby river to keep the
underground passages dry. But after the mines closed, the water
started rising and pressing a mix of carbon dioxide and nitrogen
upward from the shafts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials supervising the closed mines have prohibited local
residents from using about 600 cellars. But most have ignored the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went down and felt bad. I dashed back up and couldn't
understand anything,'' Grogulenko said of her first dizzying trip
to the cellar, where she stores the potatoes, onions, tomatoes and
cucumbers she grows. She couldn't afford to move elsewhere, so she
bought a gas mask.
</P>
<P>
   ''Descent to cellar prohibited'' is scrawled in chalk on the
door to Schekolda's garage, which is over his cellar. Below the
warning are the results of an air probe in his cellar: there is 6.1
percent carbon dioxide and just 1.9 percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Mine safety experts say that oxygen levels below 10 percent
cause many people to lose consciousness, and that carbon dioxide
levels above 0.5 percent are considered unhealthy. But Shchekolda
still ventures down often.
</P>
<P>
   ''A person needs to eat,'' he said. ''It's too expensive to
build another garage and where else to keep food? You can't keep it
in the house, and to buy food in stores is expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts assume the gases will stop gathering when the water
reaches the surface. According to the Primorye Center for
Ecological Monitoring, the process may last two or three more years
in Partizansk.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 180 mines closed across Russia since 1994, 19 are in the
Far Eastern Primorye region, where Partizansk is located. Five of
them are in Partizansk.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that even when the gases have dispersed,
Partizansk could be in for more ecological damage from the closed
mines. Vladimir Okavity, deputy chief of the local branch of the
Russian Natural Resources Committee, said that as the water rises,
it could carry pollution from the mines, including phenols and
nitrates, into the town's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Partizansk's water pipes are in such bad repair that mud seeped
into them last year, causing an outbreak of hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that in the near future, Partizansk will be declared a
national emergency zone,'' Okavity said.

   HAVANA (AP) -- In the end, the seven-month battle over Elian
Gonzalez that divided Americans and united Cubans concluded with a
simple ceremony at Havana's international airport attended by the
little boy's family and 800 schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   While the children cheered his arrival, there were no
spontaneous celebrations along Havana's streets when his plane
touched down at a remote terminal of Jose Marti International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   There were no speeches, no car-honkings that might have been
expected somewhere else for such a momentous occasion. Cuban
President Fidel Castro didn't even show up.
</P>
<P>
   The anticlimactic end to the international custody battle was no
accident: The Cuban government -- intent on sparing Elian the
''circus-like'' atmosphere that surrounded his Miami stay -- told
Cubans not to take to the streets in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   They dutifully obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans watched the arrival of their 6-year-old ''prince'' on
television, quietly thrilled they had won the latest round in the
four-decade-old battle with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy,'' said Magniuris Ordunez as she waited for a
flight to Baracoa at the airport, where Elian's arrival was
broadcast live on TV monitors. ''I've never met him, but he is
marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Cuban television replayed Elian's airport
arrival and ran old photos of him in his school uniform. Granma,
the official daily of Cuba's Communist Party, headlined ''Finally,
in his homeland'' and ran a photo essay of his grandparents and
other relatives embracing him at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's saga -- launched by a failed crossing to the United
States in November and decided by a 26-word Supreme Court decision
Wednesday afternoon -- concluded shortly before 8 p.m. Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   A jet carrying him and his family pulled up on the tarmac to a
group of 800 of his classmates -- bused from Cardenas 90 miles to
Havana in their school uniforms. The children jumped up and down
and waved plastic Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   As the boy emerged, smiling shyly and apparently overwhelmed as
his father helped him down the steps, the children chanted ''Elian!
Elian! Elian.'' They then broke into a round of the Cuban national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly and
Castro's point man on the Elian case, attended the welcoming, but
made no official remarks.
</P>
<P>
   After being embraced by his grandparents and other relatives,
the family sped off in a motorcycle-led motorcade to an undisclosed
location for a private reunion. Reportedly, they spent the night at
a special boarding school in the capital's upscale Playa
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Streets around the two-story house were blocked off Thursday
morning, and police barred reporters from passing.
</P>
<P>
   Official announcements on Cuban state radio and television said
the family and some of Elian's classmates and teachers would stay
there for two or three weeks before returning to Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's teachers must ''undertake the masterful work of making
him a model child,'' said the statement, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who took his wife and
infant son to the United States in April to bring his boy home,
told reporters before leaving Washington that he hoped the episode
could improve relations between the Cold War rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am extremely happy ... being able to go back to my homeland.
I don't have words, really, to express what I feel,'' he said just
before boarding the jet at Washington's Dulles International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez grabbed his son's hand and led him up the steps of the
chartered jet, where Elian said goodbye to America with a wave and
a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Elian seized the attention of America and Cuba from the moment
he was found clinging to an inner tube on Nov. 25 by two men on a
fishing trip off the Florida coast. The boat taking him on the
90-mile voyage from Cuba to the United States sank, drowning his
mother, her boyfriend and nine others.
</P>
<P>
   For five months he stayed in Miami's Little Havana with his
father's uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who was granted temporary custody
and fought to keep him in a battle that rallied Florida's
anti-Castro community.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 22, federal agents knocked down the door of Lazaro
Gonzalez's house and whisked Elian away to his father, waiting in
the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez and his daughter Marisleysis Gonzalez had no
immediate comment on Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many more women and children must die before the world
hears the cries of the Cuban people?'' their spokesman Armando
Gutierrez asked.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was happy that the
United Nations was not dragged into the dispute. ''I am relieved
that this saga is now over,'' he said during a visit to Hungary on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has vowed that Elian's homecoming will not end the
massive mobilizations, which will now be aimed at changing U.S.
policies -- trade sanctions and asylum rules, for example -- that it
says encourage the kind of illegal migration that led to Elian's
plight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy he's arrived -- but it doesn't change anything,''
Rafael Saldano Roque said Wednesday evening outside Coppelia's, a
popular ice cream parlor in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first announcements Cubans heard Wednesday afternoon
on state television and radio told of a rally of 200,000 people
planned for Saturday in the southeastern city of Manzanillo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us always remember that our fight has just begun,'' said
the announcement, ''and that a long road still remains before us.''

<HEADLINE> Italian Menswear Gets Flashy Look  </HEADLINE>
By DANIELA PETROFF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italian designers who previewed next
summer's menswear on the Milan runway this week are asking a lot of
their male fashion followers.
</P>
<P>
   Basically to be ''in'' next season requires an entire wardrobe
change from classic tailoring to loose fitting garments and from
bland black and gray to bold color.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Armani, particularly upbeat this season, sees this
change as liberating.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Armani man seeks total freedom in new cuts, original
colors and innovative use of fabrics,'' the designer wrote in his
fashion notes.
</P>
<P>
   His show Thursday was the high point of the last day of the
five-day showings, and one of the liveliest moments of this round
of ''moda Milanese.''
</P>
<P>
   In a big change for the staid designer, male models danced down
the runway in brightly colored slippers, wearing the easy going
outfits that mark the new collection.
</P>
<P>
   The new suit is fashioned in light and often shimmering techno
fabric. The classic jacket has a single button and the trousers are
loose. A softer shirt jacket complete with slanted pockets offers a
more casual approach to office wear.
</P>
<P>
   In the younger Emporio line, Armani suggests short tunic shirts
that hug the chest and free the neckline to be worn with over-sized
bermudas, or under a perfectly baggy linen suit.
</P>
<P>
   Color doesn't come easy to Armani, but he is slowly working it
into his fashion world, here a purple sweater, there a pair of
green buckskin shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The good mood that permeated the collection is partly due to the
exhibit the Guggenheim Museum in New York is dedicating this fall
to the man responsible for putting the ''moda Milanese'' on the
international fashion map.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which opens Oct. 20, will trace 25 years of Armani
fashion history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very excited,'' the designer said of the exhibit, as he
accepted praise backstage after the show.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, American designer Calvin Klein, who shows
his menswear in Italy, where it is manufactured, surprised the
fashion crowd by shedding his black cocoon and bursting into color.
</P>
<P>
   His bright summer palette ranged from cherry red to sky blue,
from lime green to lemon yellow. The change earned him long
applause after his Wednesday evening show.
</P>
<P>
   Gold played an important role in this round of Italian menswear,
appearing as fabric, embroidery and jewelry. Shunned by both Armani
and Calvin Klein, gold medallions, chains, bracelets and belts
showed up almost everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   For the less ostentatious, Valentino offered a polka dot bandana
wrapped around the neck, and Tom Ford for Gucci presented a black
leather wrist band. But Ford also splashed gold on his luxuriously
printed karate pants.
</P>
<P>
   Sequins, beads and other forms of glittery decoration are
another sign that menswear is taking on a flashier look.
</P>
<P>
   A simple T-shirt when studded with rhinestones becomes a glam
garment, while a few jewels work wonders on a pair of tattered
jeans. Best at this rags-to-riches look were the Dolce and Gabbana
duo.
</P>
<P>
   Party pooper in all of this fun was Miuccia Prada, who on
Wednesday showed a little snob in rimmed glasses who shuns bright
colors and wouldn't be caught dead in anything that glitters.
</P>
<P>
   His security blanket is a scarf around the neck, or a terry
cloth towel carried over the arm as if he were just going to or
coming from the gym. But the only muscles he flexes are in the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   The silhouette of the spring-summer 2001 is in keeping with the
light-hearted spirit. Ultra light fabrics fall loosely on the body.
Jackets both single and double breasted are short but not snug,
pants are at times tapered but never tight. Some collections such
as Karl Lagerfeld for Fendi and Donatella Versace, harked back to
the rock star glamour of the 1970's.
</P>
<P>
   In the beachwear department, there are lots of coordinates with
short-sleeved cotton shirts and matching shorts. Gucci showed
bikini briefs under transparent bermudas, but most designers opted
for sporty swim trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Leather sandals, sometimes with gold or embroidered decoration,
are the favored footwear.
</P>
<P>
   Following are a few tips for those who like to be a fashion step
ahead. Next summer:
</P>
<P>
   -- Never button up your shirt -- not even the sleeves, which you
will leave either long and loose, rolled up, or one of each.
</P>
<P>
   -- Throw away your hat and let your hair grow. Buy a dryer.
</P>
<P>
   -- Use running shoes only for sports, but keep the socks to wear
with sandals.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ties, superwide and sequined, or ultra skinny, are optional,
better a bandana.
</P>
<P>
   -- Watch the Fellini film ''Dolce Vita'' over and over until you
get the hang of that medallion.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Legislators Sue EPA  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wisconsin legislators sued the Environmental
Protection Agency on Thursday over clean air regulations they blame
for high gas prices in southern Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District court here, claims EPA
failed to consider the price consequences of new formulation
requirements for cleaner-burning gasoline. It seeks suspension of
the rules, which went into effect June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said the air quality problems that had been the
basis for imposing the regulations had significantly improved,
making costly reformulated gas unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''These regulations have had a devastating impact on the price
of gas,'' said State Rep. Mark Green, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen said the reformulated
gas that EPA required was costing consumers in some areas of the
state anywhere from 25 to 50 cents more per gallon. EPA officials
had calculated the cost going to the ethanol-blended gas at just
1.2 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson told the House Judiciary Committee
on Wednesday that he blamed the Clinton administration's
''overbearing environmental policies'' for gasoline price surges in
the Milwaukee and Chicago areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a problem borne of the federal government ... and a
problem that must be solved by the federal government,'' the
Republican governor said. ''The administration has refused to give
us any relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Thompson and Illinois Gov. George Ryan, also a Republican,
have asked EPA for waivers from regulations aimed at reducing
pollution in high smog urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin lawmakers, all Republicans, complained that
temporary waivers had been granted to St. Louis, home of House
Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, while southern Wisconsin had not
had its needs addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are basically at our wits' end trying to get relief from
the EPA,'' said State Rep. Paul Ryan. ''We need solutions, not
finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokesman Dave Cohen said the agency was ''very concerned''
about prices in Milwaukee and Chicago, but was hesitant to grant a
waiver.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are keeping all options open, because we will do whatever
is necessary to bring prices down,'' said Cohen, ''but we know from
our initial investigation that the problem does not stem from
reformulated gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices in the Milwaukee area reached more that $2 but have
fallen in recent days. The average price Wednesday for unleaded
regular was $1.86 a gallon, according to AAA Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Male Athletes Lose Court Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court appeal by male athletes
challenging Illinois State University's elimination of its men's
wrestling and soccer teams to help equalize opportunities for both
genders failed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the justices left intact rulings that threw out
the lawsuit against ISU and its officials.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law, known as Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, bans gender discrimination by any program receiving federal
money. Virtually all of the nation's universities and colleges
receive some federal aid, and the law has been used to force
schools to equalize the money spent for men's and women's
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ISU attorney Carol Posegate said the ruling upholds the
decision-making authority of individual institutions. ''The courts
have been reluctant to stand in the shoes of the various colleges
and universities and make decisions about how the money is to be
spent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Posegate said the decision does not embrace any particular
method for establishing Title IX equality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the law was ever intended to dictate the
specifics of how it is achieved,'' she said. ''There are going to
be great differences from one campus to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago attorney Lou Goldstein, who represents the male athletes
who sued, did not immediately return telephone messages seeking
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the male athletes argued that eliminating the men's
teams in 1995 made them victims of illegal and unconstitutional
gender bias. Similar lawsuits have been filed by male students at
other schools throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts disagreed, saying Illinois State's elimination of
the two men's teams, along with the addition of a women's soccer
team, was a legal way to comply with the equality in athletics that
federal law and regulations require.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations say schools generally comply with Title IX
when they show that the number of women participating in athletics
is ''substantially proportionate'' to their enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding the university's decision last December, the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said, ''A holding that universities
cannot achieve substantial proportionality by cutting men's
programs is tantamount to a requirement that universities ... add
women's sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This result would ignore the financial and budgetary
constraints that universities face,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal acted on Thursday drew the support of a prominent
former wrestling coach, House Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Illinois
Republican joined in a friend-of-the-court brief urging the
justices to rule that some remedy should be available when ''men's
teams are ... cut for no reason other than to meet the
proportionality quota -- and not to increase opportunities for
women.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Boulahanis v. Board of Regents, 99-1561.

<HEADLINE> College Pupils Warned on Meningitis  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- College freshmen living in dorms should be told
about the risks of contracting meningitis, and a vaccine should be
made available to those who want it, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was issued by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of meningitis among college students living in
dormitories is about 4.6 per 100,000, higher than that of any age
group other than children under 2. Still, the rate for college
students falls under the threshold for a mandatory vaccination
campaign of 10 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased the CDC has finally published its
recommendation regarding college students and the increasing threat
of meningococcal disease on campus,'' said David Spilker, president
of the Meningitis Foundation of America.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis strikes as many as 3,000 Americans each year and is
responsible for about 300 deaths annually. Symptoms include
headache, fever and a stiff neck.
</P>
<P>
   Among college students, there are 100 to 125 cases of meningitis
annually, resulting in five to 15 deaths. Another five to 15
students suffer serious damage such as deafness, brain damage or
loss of limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said freshmen who were vaccinated three to
five years before entering college should consider revaccination
because antibody levels decline rapidly over two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Bozof of Atlanta was relieved to hear the government
recommendations. Her son, Evan, was a junior at Georgia
Southwestern in Americus in 1998 when he died of bacterial
meningitis, 26 days after calling home with a bad headache.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know anything about meningitis. I didn't know a
vaccine existed,'' Bozof said. ''To find out it had been around for
30 years, can you imagine how I felt?''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''I'm really glad that the information will be
getting out to students and parents so they can now make informed
decisions about their health and take charge of it.''

<HEADLINE> More HMOs Planning To Drop Medicare  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least 711,000 elderly and disabled
Americans would be jettisoned by HMOs planning to close their doors
to Medicare beneficiaries next year, an industry group says.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs say Medicare payment limits and regulations enacted by
Congress in recent years have made serving senior citizens
cumbersome and unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''This program has been overregulated and underpaid, said Karen
Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans,
which represents HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   AAHP said Thursday that an informal survey answered by 37 of the
largest HMOs serving Medicare beneficiaries turned up 18 that are
planning to withdraw service in at least one county in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Those 18 health plans, which the association did not name,
reported the anticipated withdrawals would affect 711,055
enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   The predicted 2001 closings would double the more than 700,000
beneficiaries already stung by a swarm of HMO pullouts that have
plagued Medicare since 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When an HMO closes, Medicare beneficiaries who were enrolled do
not lose health insurance coverage. But they must find another HMO,
which may mean having to switch doctors, or else return to
submitting medical bills directly to Medicare, losing the extra
benefits many HMOs offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medicare beneficiaries who are affected by plans leaving
Medicare should remember that no matter what, they are still
covered by a strong Medicare program,'' said Medicare Administrator
Nancy-Ann DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle stressed that those affected by HMO closings can stay in
their health plans until the end of the year and should not rush to
make a change.
</P>
<P>
   For HMOs that continue in Medicare, changes in premiums,
copayments and extra benefits are expected and will not be final
until fall, when Medicare mails information to beneficiaries about
their choices.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Medicare says that of its 39 million beneficiaries,
27 million have at least one HMO open to them and 6.5 million are
enrolled in one.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs participating in Medicare must officially inform the
government by July 3 of intentions to withdraw from the program in
2001. But some announced their plans to the public earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Aetna U.S. Healthcare said Thursday that it will
not renew its Medicare contract next year in 11 states:
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine, Ohio, Texas and Washington. Some counties in New
York, Pennsylvania and Northern California would be cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Aetna withdrawals alone, effective, Dec. 31, would touch
355,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Other large HMOs that have
announced Medicare withdrawals in some areas so far include Cigna
HealthCare and Foundation Health Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, inadequate government reimbursements have made
operating a number of our Medicare HMOs no longer viable,'' said
Aetna CEO William H. Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare payments were curbed in 1997 by legislation to balance
the federal budget. AAHP officials said the 2 percent annual raises
HMOs have been getting since then do not keep up with health care
costs that are rising by 6-8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers of both parties, facing angry senior citizens as
elections near, have pledged to look for more money this year for
HMOs from expected budget surpluses. President Clinton has made a
similar promise.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Bronze Stars Reaffirmed  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has reaffirmed the awarding of
Bronze Star medals to service members who participated in the air
campaign against Yugoslavia last year but were not in the combat
zone.
</P>
<P>
   After a review prompted by articles in the military newspaper
Stars and Stripes, Bernard Rostker, the under secretary of defense
for personnel, found that the medals were properly awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have determined that there was a precedent set for the
awarding of the Bronze Star medal under similar conditions,''
Rostker wrote in letters Wednesday to the civilian chiefs of the
Air Force and Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen,
said Thursday that Rostker's review showed that U.S. servicemen
stationed on Guam during the Vietnam War had been awarded Bronze
Stars for their contributions to that war even though they were not
in the combat zone.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 321 Bronze Stars were awarded for the Kosovo air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Stripes newspaper reported that a majority went to
people who were not even in the Balkans. At least five Bronze
Stars, for example, went to Air Force officers at Whiteman Air
Force Base in Missouri, home of the B-2 bombers that flew roundtrip
missions to the Balkans. None was for a pilot because the Defense
Department criteria for awarding Bronze Stars specifically say the
honors are not for ''participation in aerial flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars and Stripes also said Bronze Stars were awarded to three
colonels in Germany who worked on overflight clearances and basing
rights in Europe for U.S. aircraft supporting the air campaign in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon regulation on awarding Bronze Stars says they can
be given to a military member who ''distinguishes himself or
herself by heroic or meritorious achievement or service'' under any
of three circumstances:
</P>
<P>
   --''While engaged in an action against an enemy of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   --''While engaged in military operations involving conflict with
an opposing foreign force.''
</P>
<P>
   --While serving with friendly foreign forces in which the United
States is not a belligerent party.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 95; Nasdaq Slips 41  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Thursday as investors' enthusiasm
disappeared following the Federal Reserve's announcement on
interest rates. But some consumer issues posted gains as investors
looked for stocks that will perform well even if the economy slows.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 95.11 at 10,432.68.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 7.82 at 1,447.00, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 41.40 at 3,898.94.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged, but noted
that inflation risks remain in the economy. The warning on
inflation led many analysts to expect that the Fed will raise rates
at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the game is over. This is more like the seventh
inning stretch,'' said John Forelli, senior vice president at
Independence Investment Associates in Boston. ''The Fed is waiting
to see whether economic activity slows substantially. I don't think
any investors can rule out action in August.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, analysts said, the market may find excuses to
remain stalled in a narrow range. Stocks had advanced modestly in
the days leading up to the meeting, leading investors to take some
profits Thursday. Also, traders said investors were unloading some
stocks ahead of the Independence Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to rising interest
rates, pulled the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan fell $2.813 to $113.938
and Citigroup fell 31.25 cents to $62.938.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were also taking profits from the technology
stocks that have risen in recent sessions. LSI Logic fell $5.688 to
$53.313 and Cisco fell $1.938 to $61.625.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Eli Lilly soared $15.75 to
$102.875 after announcing that an independent board gave a
favorable review to its drug Zovant, used to treat sepsis. The
experimental drug, which still needs approval from the Food and
Drug Administration, would be the first drug approved for the
treatment of sepsis, a disease in which the body's systems fail due
to infection.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys plunged $8.375 to $15.25 after warning that its
second-quarter revenue and earnings would be disappointing.
Investors are punishing companies that demonstrate any evidence of
earnings weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks made the most convincing gains, rising on
the hope that whether the economy grows or falters, products like
toothpaste and soap will continue to drive sales. Kimberly Clark
rose $1.938 to $56 and Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 93.75 cents to
$98.938.
</P>
<P>
   The sector-to-sector rotation that has characterized the market
in the past few weeks is likely to persist until the Fed's next
meeting, analysts said, because it still isn't clear how successful
the Fed's six rate increases in the past year have been in slowing
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, another sign of robust growth rattled some
investors. The Commerce Department said the country's total output
of goods and services, called the gross domestic product, rose at
an annual rate of 5.5 percent during the January-March quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a key inflation measure took its biggest leap since
late 1994, largely reflecting surging energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 838.49 million
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.66 to 514.33.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Endangers African Penguins  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- At least two fifths of the
world's African penguin population are endangered by an oil spill
in an environmental disaster that keeps growing, conservation
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The spill has struck the waters off Cape Town, especially Dassen
Island, which holds the world's largest colony of African penguins,
and Robben Island, home to the third largest.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers were working to round up as many as possible of the
55,000 penguins on Dassen and the 19,000 on Robben.
</P>
<P>
   ''This evacuation is the biggest-ever effort to save sea birds
worldwide,'' said Horst Kleinschmidt, a senior official in South
Africa's environmental department.
</P>
<P>
   The oil has soiled or is threatening to soil more than 40
percent of the estimated 150,000-180,000 African penguins in the
world, said conservationist Estelle van der Merwe.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials have asked the South African defense
force to send vehicles, planes and ships to help volunteers and
international experts working to capture birds on the two islands.
The military is considering the request.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster began when a Panamanian tanker, the Treasure, sank
six miles off Cape Town on June 23 and two of its fuel tanks
ruptured. The slick quickly hit Robben Island and on Wednesday
reached Dassen.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least 20,000 penguins have been oiled,'' said van der
Merwe, of the Southern African National Foundation for the
Conservation of Coastal Birds. ''It's really devastating what's
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 soiled birds have been brought to the
foundation's rehabilitation centers so far. About 50 have died, van
der Merwe said, adding she expected many more deaths. It takes two
people up to an hour to clean each bird.
</P>
<P>
   The spill came in the middle of the penguins' breeding season,
and thousands of chicks and eggs are expected to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic sheeting fencing has been placed on Dassen Island to
prevent penguins from reaching the polluted water, said David
Daitz, chief executive of the Western Cape Nature Conservation
Board.
</P>
<P>
   After they are evacuated, the birds will be taken about 560
miles east to the town of Port Elizabeth on the mainland, where
they are to be released into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are expected to swim home in about 11 days, which
authorities hope will give them time to clean up the spill.
Officials hope 95 percent of the penguins will survive the
relocation.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred Robben Island penguins were evacuated to Port
Elizabeth earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were still assessing how the spill would affect bird
populations north of Dassen, Kleinschmidt said. The island is
located about five miles off South Africa's west coast, and about
37 miles north of Cape Town. Robben is about four miles north of
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasure went down carrying 1,300 tons of heavy bunker oil.
About 900 tons are estimated to remain in its tanks. An operation
to pump it into other vessels was due to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before sinking, the Treasure developed a 17-by-10 yard hole in
the hull -- apparently either from rust or a crack related to its
age.
</P>
<P>
   The African penguin, also known as the jackass or Blackfooted
penguin, can be found along the coast of South Africa, and is the
only penguin species to live on the continent. On average, African
penguins are more than 18 inches high and weigh about 7.5 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Other penguin species, with populations numbering in the
millions, live in Antarctica and the southern tip of South America.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Releases N. Korea Energy Aid  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton released a $20 million
installment in energy aid to North Korea on Thursday, saying the
communist regime appeared to be living up to a commitment to freeze
its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The funds go to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization to buy fuel oil to help generate electricity while an
international consortium completes work on two new nuclear reactors
in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The payments are made under a 1994 agreement and can only be
freed if Clinton certifies that North Korea is complying with its
obligations under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea asserts that it has neither the intention nor the
capacity to develop nuclear weapons amid its economic difficulties.
But last November, a congressional report suggested there was
''significant evidence that undeclared nuclear weapons development
activities continues'' in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, in his certification, Clinton asserted that, ''the
United States has made and is continuing to make significant
progress on eliminating the North Korean ballistic missile threat,
including further missile tests and its ballistic missile
exports.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton at a news conference on Wednesday praised North Korea's
recent efforts to ease frictions with South Korea, but added,
''They still have a missile program. And so it's still something
that the United States has to be mindful of and to prepare and to
deal with and ... to keep up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1994 agreement, North Korea promised to freeze its
suspected nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for a U.S.-led international consortium to build
two nuclear reactors in North Korea and provide fuel oil until the
first reactor is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union are
providing funds for the $4.6 billion project by the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The organization had planned to build the first of the reactors
by 2003. But officials recently said the completion might be
delayed by ''several years.''

<HEADLINE> How To Find Doctors' Records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agencies responsible for licensing physicians
in 40 states and the District of Columbia provide the names of
doctors they discipline on their Web sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of information disclosed varies from state to state,
as does the frequency of updates. Some state medical boards that
name disciplined physicians on their Web sites still require
consumers to contact the agencies directly to receive specific
information about the misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 states that provide no information over the Internet
about doctors disciplined by their licensing boards are Alaska,
Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Louisiana, Montana, New Mexico, North
Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Medical boards in California, Florida, Idaho, Massachusetts, and
Tennessee also provide data on the Web sites about malpractice
claims paid by physicians in their states. California, Florida,
Idaho, and Massachusetts also report disciplinary actions hospitals
take against doctors.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms To Expand Army Housing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army on Thursday announced that it
selected Fort Hood Military Housing, LP, a joint venture between
companies in California and Georgia, to renovate and expand
military family housing at Fort Hood, Texas. It said the work could
be worth $4 billion to the companies over the coming 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The participating companies, Lend Lease Actus of Napa, Calif.,
and Trammell Crow Residential of Atlanta, will spend the rest of
the year developing a blueprint for the work, and construction will
begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Mahlon Apgar IV, the assistant Army secretary for installations
and environment, told a Pentagon news conference that the
government expects to save $300 million by putting the housing in
private hands. The companies are expected to invest about $300
million of their own money for housing renovation and construction
at Fort Hood; their revenues will come from the soldiers'
government housing allowances.
</P>
<P>
   Apgar said it would take six to 10 years for all the 5,500
houses at Fort Hood to be renovated or replaced. In that time
period, about 1,140 new homes are to be built. Fort Hood is one of
the biggest U.S. Army bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Hood project is the second in a series of experimental
privatization projects the Army is under taking. The first was at
Fort Carson, Colo., and the next will be at Fort Lewis, Wash.

<HEADLINE> Elian Begins New Chapter at Home  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Now that his American saga has drawn to a close,
Elian Gonzalez began a new chapter Thursday in his homeland, where
officials say they will work to provide the boy with as normal a
life as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of turmoil -- and with Cuba's government
planning to continue the mass mobilization inspired by his plight --
normalcy will be a big transition for the brown-haired 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   On his first full day back in Cuba, Elian was far from the
public eye, with his father, stepmother, baby half-brother and
other relatives in a specially prepared boarding school in Havana's
upscale Playa neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I imagine that Elian and his family must be very happy that
they have now returned to daily Cuban family life,'' Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Aymee Hernandez said Thursday. ''At this
moment he must be doing what all children do in Cuba, having
breakfast, sharing closeness with his papa and his papa's wife, who
will take on the role of his mama.''
</P>
<P>
   In several weeks, Elian will return to his former life in the
small port city of Cardenas, live in the same modest home with his
father. He will go back to the Marcelo Salado elementary school,
where his classmates transformed his empty desk into a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he doesn't receive any special treatment, the little
boy who loved kites in Cuba and wore a Batman cape in Miami will
always be special.
</P>
<P>
   He will be remembered by the hundreds of thousands of Cubans who
marched and chanted and wore T-shirts with his portrait during a
seven-month campaign to bring him home as the ''boy hero,'' the
''symbolic child,'' the ''elfin prince.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He will always be, rather than a normal citizen, a symbol, an
example and a glory for all the children of Cuba and pride for all
the teachers of Cuba,'' the government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ''our self-denying teachers and pedagogues must
undertake the masterful work of making him a model child, worthy of
his history, his strengths and talent,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives in Miami, who fought a bitter battle to retain
custody, argued the boy would be subjected to political persecution
if he returned. They took Elian in after he was rescued off
Florida's coast when the boat carrying him from Cuba sank, killing
his mother and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of returning Elian to Cuba predicted he would be
forced to denounce his mother as a traitor for attempting to take
him to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there's been no sign so far that or any other persecution.
Cuba has described Elian's mother as a good woman whose boyfriend
bullied her into taking the child on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Elian's return also fear the boy will be
indoctrinated in communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   In a socialist society, with a father who is a Communist Party
member, that will be inevitable -- and not just for Elian. The Cuban
Child Code calls for all youth to be protected from ''influence
contrary to their communist formation.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also hopes to push forward with the mass
mobilization inspired by the Elian campaign to press for an end to
the 40-year-old U.S. embargo on Cuba and to U.S. laws that grant
asylum to any Cuban who makes it to American shores.
</P>
<P>
   A new rally is already organized for Saturday in the
southeastern city of Manzanillo, which an estimated 200,000 people
are expected to attend. Cuban officials say the U.S. laws encourage
illegal, dangerous trips across the Florida Straits like the one
that killed Elian's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Elian, we have saved a marvelous child, but millions of
innocent creatures, older or younger than Elian but equally loved
run the risk of drowning, dying or suffering horrible tragedies,''
a government statement said in the official newspaper Granma.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian will work on his studies, helped by his
teachers and classmates, who moved into the boarding school with
him to help him complete the first grade in time to begin the
second in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family moved into two-story white stucco house by
the sea after a muted arrival Wednesday at Havana's Jose Marti
airport. They will stay there the shortest time necessary to
restart his life ''the most normal and peaceful conditions,'' the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was unhappy about what
values taught during his son's brief time at a private Miami
school. The Lincoln-Marti School teaches students that President
Fidel Castro oppresses Cubans. Classes are taught in English and
children salute the American flag -- a hated symbol of Cuba's
fiercest enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was returned to his father by federal agents who raided
the Miami relatives' home on April 22. He then spent two months in
the Washington area with his father, relatives and friends waiting
for legal appeals to play out.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Elian reportedly made much scholastic progress
and the government says he can now read and write.
</P>
<P>
   Once ready, his family will return to Cardenas, where the
government said the people will do everything to ensure that Elian
has as normal a life as possible ''after all the suffering he has
put up with and which converted him into the most famous and
well-known child in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Mandela Honored for Achievements  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The mother of a black British teen-ager slain by
white youths presented Nelson Mandela with a lifetime achievement
award Thursday in recognition of his fight to end apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that I can speak for all South Africans, black and
white, that this award is recognition of their struggle for peace
and democracy in our country,'' the former South African president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, 81, received the BT Ethnic Multicultural Media Award
from Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was stabbed to death at a
London bus stop in 1993. She said Mandela was the only person of
world stature to take up her cause.
</P>
<P>
   After a long campaign by Lawrence, an official inquiry found
that police bungled the investigation and were racist. None of the
five white suspects was successfully prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the award
ceremony ranked among the important occasions of his life, adding,
''There's a possibility that one day I might die, and when I reach
the new world I will have many fond memories.''

<HEADLINE> Meg Ryan, Dennis Quaid Separating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid have announced they
are separating after nearly 10 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Their publicist, Lisa Kasteler, declined to say whether the two
plan to divorce. She said the separation began about six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The couple hope that the press will respect their privacy
during this difficult time,'' Kasteler said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 38, who began filming the kidnap thriller ''Proof of
Life'' in May, endeared herself to American movie audiences with
such romantic comedies as ''When Harry Met Sally,'' ''Sleepless in
Seattle,'' and ''You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Quaid, 46, starred in the sci-fi time traveling tale
''Frequency'' in May and is known for roles in ''Breaking Away,''
''The Big Easy'' and ''Wyatt Earp.''
</P>
<P>
   The two met in 1987 on the set of ''Innerspace.'' They married
in 1991 and have an 8-year-old son. They also appeared together in
''Flesh and Bone'' in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Database Records Doctors' Discipline  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a database kept secret from patients, the
government has recorded the names of nearly 500 doctors and
dentists across the country who have been slapped with at least 10
disciplinary actions and malpractice payments over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   One of every seven U.S. doctors and one of every eight dentists
has at least one malpractice payment or disciplinary report in the
National Practitioners Data Bank, which the Department of Health
and Human Services has been compiling since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and a key congressional Republican are
pressing to disclose the names to help patients shop for doctors.
Medical experts oppose such a release, fearing the data is skewed
by malpractice insurance settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel that I'm dangerous to my patients at all. I feel
like I've always acted in my patients' best interests,'' said Dr.
Gary Hall, a Phoenix ophthalmologist who has paid $5.3 million in
malpractice claims and is listed 27 times in the federal database.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was censured last year by the Arizona Board of Medical
Examiners, fined $15,000, placed on three years probation and
barred from performing one type of eye surgery, radial keratotomy.
</P>
<P>
   Being identified as one of the doctors with the most records in
the database ''makes you look very guilty,'' he acknowledged. But
he said most of the malpractice cases were settled by insurers
''for economic reasons'' without his consent.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires insurance companies, hospitals and state
and federal health care regulators to report malpractice payments
and disciplinary actions against doctors, dentists and other health
care providers. It is a voluntary compliance system -- with no
auditing by the government -- and nearly 60 percent of hospitals
have yet to make a report.
</P>
<P>
   The government provides a version of the database to the public,
but strips out the names of doctors and dentists and other
identifying information. That's because the 1986 law that created
the database allows the identities and most details of the
malpractice payments and disciplinary actions to be shared only
with insurance companies, hospitals and federal and state health
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Although many states disclose their disciplinary actions against
doctors, patients don't have a single national repository where
they can check their practitioner's history.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, is considering releasing over the Internet the names of
the 200 doctors and dentists with the worst records, according to a
committee aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   At a committee hearing earlier this year, Bliley said it's
''unconscionable that consumers have more comparative information
about the used car they purchase or the snack foods they eat than
the doctors in whose care they entrust their health and
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' lobby opposes the release.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Reardon, president of the American Medical
Association, said the raw data on malpractice payments ''is not
reflective of competency or quality.'' He said only one malpractice
settlement in five concerns negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concept of the databank was to collect data for licensing
and credentialing'' of doctors, he said, ''not for release to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's push to open the database follows decisions by 41 state
medical boards since 1996 to begin disclosing on their Web sites
the names of doctors they discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News and The Hartford Courant used that
information and court records earlier this year to identify doctors
with large numbers of malpractice payments or disciplinary actions.
The Associated Press used the national database with no names to
calculate the national figures and used state records to identify
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News identified 15 medical practitioners with the most
malpractice lawsuits in the state of New York. Four have had their
licenses suspended. The Courant identified Hall and seven other
doctors nationwide with at least $3 million in malpractice payments
and 25 or more reports in the databank. Four still are practicing.
</P>
<P>
   AP's review of court records and state disciplinary records
found:
</P>
<P>
   --Michigan dentist Thomas Neumeier had 37 malpractice payments
totaling $550,000 over three decades before the state licensing
board put him on probation for three years in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Neumeier sees 12 to 14 patients a day, and blames most of his
troubles on a single lawyer who helped patients file more than 20
lawsuits against him. ''I could have fought every one of these
cases, and nine-tenths of them I would have won,'' the dentist
said.
</P>
<P>
   --Oklahoma City surgeon Joe Dan Metcalf faced more than 30
lawsuits and was ordered to pay nearly $300,000 in malpractice
judgments in the early 1990s, state and court records show. His
license was suspended for one year in 1996 after he pleaded guilty
to illegally importing silicone-gel breast implants. A five-year
probation was imposed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   --In Wisconsin, three-fourths of the 54 doctors who made
malpractice payments of $1 million or more in the 1990s faced no
disciplinary action from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The filing and paying of a malpractice action does not mean a
doctor is bad,'' Patrick Braatz, administrator of Wisconsin Health
Professions and Services Licensing. ''That doesn't mean the doctor
is good, either. You have to look at the underlying facts of each
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, the Phoenix ophthalmologist, said he wouldn't object to
allowing patients access to the data if the government put the
numbers into context. For instance, Hall said, the 27 complaints
against him amount to less than 0.1 percent of the eye operations
he has performed since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research
Group, said opening the database would provide patients with a
central place to check records of prospective doctors or dentists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It needs to be in one place and it needs to be nationally
based,'' said Wolfe, whose consumer group compiles a report every
two years on state-disciplined physicians. ''When you go to the
state, all you get is the disciplinary actions taken by that state
against doctors licensed in that state.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Manes, a Long Island, N.Y., orthopedic surgeon, said
information in the database ''could be misleading to the layman
unless they have access to both sides of a particular case.''
</P>
<P>
   With 26 reports in the database, including $3.9 million in
malpractice payments, Manes said his own practice has suffered
since he was identified by both the Courant and Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure it's had some detrimental effect but I still have a
very good practice and my patients still have confidence in me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manes blamed his large number of malpractice payments on the
large volume of patients he sees and on the fact that Long Island
has the most malpractice cases per resident in the country.

<HEADLINE> Asian American Takes Cabinet Post  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Norm Mineta literally came across town
Thursday to stand with President Clinton as the nation's first
Asian-American Cabinet secretary. But his real journey began much
farther away, in the internment camps of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta had just turned 10 when he joined more than 120,000
Japanese-Americans who were rounded up and sent to the camps after
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. He was herded to
Wyoming with his family, in his Cub Scouts uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that tender age, Mineta rejected claims that the move
was for his family's protection. ''I could see the machine guns and
the barbed wire faced inward,'' he once recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In claiming another place in history Thursday, Mineta did not
put those harsh memories on display.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned his parents, who immigrated from Japan nearly a
century ago only to lose their home and insurance business during
their four-year internment. He mentioned the people he never forgot
as a congressman, those interned Americans for whom he secured an
official apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am honored and humbled to be walking across this very
historic threshold with you,'' Mineta told Clinton in an Oval
Office ceremony where the president's choice was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''The substance of your actions today must never be
underestimated or forgotten. You have the eternal gratitude of not
just Japanese Americans or Asian-Pacific Americans, but I believe
every American.''
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Mineta, 68, would become the
nation's 33rd Commerce secretary. Among Asian-Americans, Mineta
long has been a man of firsts: first to serve as mayor of a major
city -- his native San Jose, Calif. -- and the first to serve as
chairman of a congressional committee, the House Transportation
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta earned a bachelor of science degree from the University
of California at Berkeley, then was an Army intelligence officer in
Korea for three years. He returned to San Jose to run the Mineta
Insurance Agency and won a city council seat in 1967. He became
mayor in 1971 and was elected to Congress in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Mineta wrote laws governing airports, transit
systems and roadways, and was an early advocate for high-tech
Silicon Valley in the heart of his district.
</P>
<P>
   But Mineta's heart never strayed far from his people, and he
pushed until he won passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988,
through which the United States apologized for the internment camps
and paid reparations of $20,000 to each survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Norman Mineta is a true hero and embodies what the American
dream is all about,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta served 20 years in Congress. In 1995 he stepped down to
take a job as senior vice president of Lockheed Martin Corp., one
of the largest employers in his district.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that decision from the bedroom of the house in San
Jose where he was born, then headed off to run the company's
transportation systems from Bethesda, Md., in suburban Washington.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Sen Is Judges' Gatekeeper  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jeff Sessions' eyes widen and his voice
rises as he reads aloud an essay penned by a law professor.
</P>
<P>
   He slows down when he gets to a particular sentence, shakes his
head in disbelief and reads it again, slower still. In the passage,
Gerard Lynch warns the legal community not to overemphasize words
from ''18th- and 19th-century dictionaries'' when interpreting the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions, R-Ala., grins as if he were Hercule Poirot or Sherlock
Holmes and the clues just clicked. Then he pounces, accusing Lynch
of judicial activism, an assault on the Constitution, a call to
legislate from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it was a reason to vote against the Democrat's
nomination to the federal bench in New York. Lynch was ultimately
approved on a 63-36 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel it's important to raise these issues, even if sometimes
you don't win,'' Sessions said. '' ... It's a question of what is
my responsibility as a senator if I have information that this
person wouldn't be a good judge?''
</P>
<P>
   In his four years in Congress, Sessions has gained a reputation
as the senator most likely to object to a judicial nominee.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange twist for the former U.S. attorney whose own
judicial nomination was scuttled 14 years ago by the Judiciary
Committee on which he now sits. Democratic opponents, led by
then-Alabama Sen. Howell Heflin, questioned his racial sensitivity
in light of his role investigating vote fraud in some predominantly
black Alabama counties.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Heflin retired and Sessions was elected. Since
then, Democrats have watched uneasily as Sessions has sought to
sidetrack some of President Clinton's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The senator insists he isn't out for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually, I'm more sensitive to their personal feelings,''
Sessions said of the nominees. ''If I disagree with someone, I try
to be sure I'm not attacking their integrity. And I don't think
anyone can show that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Sessions opposed Merrick Garland's nomination to
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,
saying there was no need to fill the vacancy because the court's
caseload was the country's smallest, an argument critics dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a Republican president, I'll guarantee he won't
find one district that has too low of a caseload,'' said Delaware
Sen. Joseph Biden, who was Judiciary Committee chairman when
Democrats controlled the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Current Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he welcomes the
scrutiny Sessions provides and said he does not believe his
colleague politicizes the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen it come out in a vindictive or antagonistic
way,'' Hatch said. ''But he does take the nomination process as
seriously as anyone on the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions says reviewing judicial appointments is among his
favorite parts of the job. Hatch chuckles at that. Barring the
occasional controversial Supreme Court nominee, it's a fairly
boring process.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing upsets Sessions more than the possibility that a nominee
will try to make laws rather than interpret them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can redefine the meaning of the words, you can make the
Constitution say whatever you want it to say,'' he said. ''The only
way you really honor the document is realize it's a contract
between the people and their government, and the words have
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden says Sessions has helped create an atmosphere in which
politics takes precedence over the qualifications of judicial
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I worry about most is there are going to be new senators
like Sessions with no institutional memory who will do the same bad
policy,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions countered: ''I would like to believe that when I leave
this office, I will have played a role in getting superior judges
on the bench.''

<HEADLINE> Chinse News Agency To Sell Building  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chinese news agency has agreed to sell a
building it recently bought near the Pentagon, putting to rest U.S.
concerns about possible spy activities.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said the Xinhua news
agency notified U.S. officials that it wanted department
authorization to sell the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to authorize the sale,'' Reeker said Thursday,
adding that Xinhua agreed not to use the building while it is being
marketed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., one of China's most outspoken
foes on Capitol Hill, said last week that ''what well could be an
arm of Communist Chinese intelligence is now overlooking the
Pentagon and has a bird's eye view electronically of everything
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said at the time that
countermeasures have been developed over the years to thwart
surveillance efforts.
</P>
<P>
   State Department rules require approval of property purchases by
the news agency. But the sale was carried out earlier this month
without State Department knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The first official word the State Department received about the
transaction occurred last Monday when China delivered a copy of a
May 22 letter that department officials said they had never
received.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to work with the Xinhua news agency and the
Chinese embassy to bring this whole matter to a conclusion,''
Reeker said.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes, Assembly debates budget; Whitman seeks more for surplus </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Senate overwhelmingly approved a
$21.5 billion budget Thursday and Assembly debate on it was under
way by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the stage is set for Gov. Christie Whitman to cut out at
least $25 million by Friday. It would be a fairly small percentage
of overall spending, but could involve eliminating pet projects
inserted by lawmakers last week.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will have until midnight Friday to sign a new
budget for the 2000-2001 fiscal year that begins at 12:01 a.m.
Saturday. If the proposed spending is maintained, it would increase
spending by 10 percent from the budget signed into law one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the budget with only one senator, John Lynch,
D-Middlesex, voting no, though he refused to elaborate on his
objections. Assembly Democrats proclaimed their support for the
budget early in the debate, although a few dissenting votes are
likely there as well.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some strong objections Thursday from one person
with a key vote, the governor, who over the next 24 hours will
exercise her line-item veto to cut items and then sign the document
into law. She is one of the few chief executives in the United
States with the authority to strike spending without further
consulting the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has insisted on a minimum surplus - a reserve of cash
that remains unspent - of $850 million, and has said she would veto
spending that digs into that surplus too deeply.
</P>
<P>
   During floor debate Thursday, lawmakers proclaimed their budget
bill maintained a surplus of $869 million. However, Whitman
spokesman Peter McDonough said administration officials disagreed
with their mathematics, saying the bill provides for only $825
million for surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is not over the budget itself but rather concerns
the amount of money being left over from the current fiscal year
which ends at midnight Friday. McDonough said Whitman will make the
changes necessary to restore the full surplus to $850 million,
presumably with cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the budget increases funding by $157 million for the
30 so-called ''special needs'' districts defined in the Abbott v.
Burke court rulings. Overall school aid will hit $6.65 billion,
with $2.75 billion of it earmarked specifically for the Abbott
districts where the Supreme Court has ordered ''parity'' with the
amount spent on pupils in the state's 100 wealthiest school
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also spends $701 million for the Transportation Trust
Fund, lowering the amount that will need to be financed with
long-term bonds.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Dutch tall ship Eendracht has slipped into
New York harbor - a prelude to a Fourth of July spectacle billed as
the largest maritime event in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel, docked Thursday in Manhattan's South Street Seaport
awaiting Opsail 2000, ''was the first in,'' said Eric Ray, a
spokesman for the latest - and largest - gathering of wind-powered
tall ships.
</P>
<P>
   It harkens an era when commerce poured into New York from around
the world by sea. Little more than a century ago, a forest of masts
rose above the same piers near Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   This year, about 150 tall ships from at least 50 nations will
share the waters with 40 modern warships of 23 navies - a weeklong
spectacle expected to draw more than 4 million people. It begins on
Sunday, with the arrival of the modern naval fleet in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of a ship is when she's driven by the wind,'' said
retired Admiral Paul Welling, a 35-year U.S. Coast Guard veteran
and OpSail's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   In a tip to modern times, each tall ship is now equipped with an
auxiliary engine. Timing the complex display means the
antique-style vessels will be engine-powered as they move into
place, with sailors perched atop the rigging, Welling said Thursday
at a Manhattan briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tall ships will file into the harbor in formation on
Monday, to be berthed on the Hudson River and at the South Street
Seaport.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth of July festivities will begin early, with President
Clinton present for the International Naval Review of a fleet with
almost 10,000 U.S. and foreign military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 8:05 a.m., Clinton plans to board the guided missile
cruiser USS Hue City to review the cruisers, destroyers and
frigates anchored in a 17-mile line from the George Washington
Bridge to the Verrazano Narrows.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. fleet will be blessed by the chaplains aboard each,
using language that goes back to George Washington's time, said
Capt. Woody Berzins, a Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 10 a.m., the president is to move to the aircraft
carrier USS John F. Kennedy, anchored off the Statue of Liberty.
Passing by at about the same time will be the flagship of the
waterborne parade, the U.S. Coast Guard training barque, Eagle,
originally seized from Nazi Germany in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see everything from the technology of today's ships to
the majesty of the tall ships,'' said Berzins, the Navy spokesman.
''It captures history, the present and the future - all in one
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with other Navy guests on the flight deck, the president
will watch the procession of schooners, brigantines, barques and
square-riggers as they pass up the harbor, while 80 aircraft buzz
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   On the JFK, Clinton and other guests will be entertained by 43
performers from Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   The aging, conventionally powered carrier, based at Norfolk,
Va., is allowed to enter New York harbor, from which the Navy's
newer, nuclear-powered carriers are barred.
</P>
<P>
   To watch the maritime extravaganza, as many as 70,000 other
craft are expected to flood area waters - nearly three times the
number at the 1986 Statue of Liberty centennial, according to the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The first tall ship in port this week was the Eendracht. Built
in the Hague in 1989, the 194-foot ship was docked at Pier 16 in
lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the official vessels participating are used for naval
training, including the Chilean navy's 371-foot four-master
Esmerelda and Germany's 295-foot barque Gorch Fock, a sister ship
to Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the USS Mount Whitney, the USS Nassau and five
other U.S. warships, American vessels include the Amistad, a
recreation of a famed 19th century slave ship, and the HMS Rose, a
replica of an Elizabethan-era vessel raised at Portsmouth Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Past naval reviews commemorated events in U.S. history, while
this year's joint event marks the Navy's official observance of the
millennium, dubbed ''A Celebration of Seapower for the
Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   OpSail is to be capped by a spectacular July 4 fireworks display
using 13 barges at five different harbor locations.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the main port of call in the tall ships' nine-week
coastal cruise from San Juan, Puerto Rico on May 25 to Portland,
Maine, on July 31, with stops in Miami, Norfolk, Va.; Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sail, established by President John F. Kennedy in 1961
to promote international relations and cultural exchange, also has
organized the 1964 New York World's Fair, the U.S. Bicentennial in
1976, and the Christopher Columbus Quincentennial in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Senate approves right-to-die attorney for judgeship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey Senate has approved
right-to-die attorney Paul Armstrong for a judgeship in Somerset
County.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday also confirmed appointments of Glenn
Wenzel, David Waks and Thomas Brogan for three judgeships in
Passaic County. Christine Allen-Jackson was confirmed for a
judgeship in Gloucester County.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of 428 positions still remain unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved
Armstrong over objections from the New Jersey Right to Life.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has been at the forefront of legal cases dealing with
biomedical ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong successfully argued for the family of Karen Ann
Quinlan to disconnect her from respirator, leading to New Jersey
Supreme Court's 1976 landmark decision granting the right to die,
the nation's first such court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Quinlan had slipped into a coma at a party in April 1975. She
died in a Morris Plains nursing home in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Public help still needed to combat virus  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) - Although no evidence of the West
Nile-like strain of the encephalitis virus has been found in
Connecticut this year, state environmental officials are again
asking for the public's help in reducing the mosquito population.
</P>
<P>
   Since an outbreak of the virus last year, state officials have
intensified a mosquito trapping, testing and larvicide program. The
virus did not cause any human illness in Connecticut, but infected
72 people in New York, killing seven.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which first surfaced in the Western Hemisphere last
year, also killed hundreds of birds in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   This season four crows in Rockland County, N.Y., tested positive
for the virus. Another crow tested positive in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut environmental officials held a public education
session at Sherwood Island State Park on Thursday to reassure
residents and describe efforts to reduce the likelihood of another
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   They asked homeowners to help eliminate mosquito breeding
grounds by removing any standing water on their property - in
gutters, old tires, sandboxes and even items as small as flower
pots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our best defense against West Nile virus ... is protection,''
said First Selectman Diane Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Andreadis, chief entomologist for the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station, said the state has tested 11,000
mosquitoes trapped at 73 locations around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of today, we have no evidence of West Nile virus activity
in mosquitoes,'' Andreadis said.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on 54 dead birds have also come back negative.
</P>
<P>
   Iris Nemni, a Westport resident, said she attended the public
briefing to learn more about preventing another outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned a little bit ... not dramatically though,'' she
said. ''I know they are taking care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection, said the state next week will begin
airing 30-second television spots to increase public awareness
about the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said stations in Connecticut and New York have agreed
to run the ads, which show a couple emptying standing water from
various items outside their home. Radio announcements are planned
for later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who become infected either show no reaction or
become mildly ill with flu-like symptoms. The vast majority suffer
no long-term problems. The most vulnerable are the elderly and
those with immune deficiencies.

<HEADLINE> SEC investigates Xerox for alleged accounting irregularities in Mexico division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - In the latest in a string of problems,
Xerox Corp. is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for accounting irregularities in the company's
Mexico operations.
</P>
<P>
   The business machines maker announced the investigation
Thursday, but released no specifics, saying only that the SEC was
looking into ''accounting issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the company said problems in its Mexican
business were expected to drag down second-quarter earnings by
about 6 cents per share. At that time, a company spokeswoman said
Xerox was doing an internal investigation related to problems with
bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Xerox spokesman Bill McKee said the company could
not reveal details of either the SEC investigation or its own
internal investigation. He said the company would reveal details of
the investigations when it releases its second-quarter earnings on
July 26.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC can bring civil actions in federal court. McKee would
not comment on whether a separate criminal probe is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will certainly cooperate in any way,'' McKee said of the
SEC probe. ''Because this is a formal, legal investigation, we are
really limited in what we can say.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Mexico operations pulled in revenues of about $400
million in 1999. There are more than 3,000 Xerox employees in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Xerox has been beset with problems that have
depressed earnings and the company's stock, including a cumbersome
realignment of its sales force along industry lines rather than
geographic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the company asked Chief Executive Rick Thoman to step
down after just 13 months at the helm. His firing came a month
after the company reported a $243 million loss in the first
quarter. The loss had been expected following the announcement in
March that Xerox would lay off 5,200 employees and close several
plants as part of an effort to cut costs to remain competitive with
rivals Hewlett-Packard and Canon.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the company's stock fell nearly 19 percent
the day it warned that second-quarter earnings would be well below
Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said its earnings per share, before unusual items, would
likely be near the first-quarter level of 30 cents per share. A
recent First Call/Thomson Financial's survey found analysts
expecting Xerox to earn 42 cents a share in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   John Heine, a spokesman for the SEC, said the commission does
not confirm nor deny investigations.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 130; Nasdaq Sheds 63  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Thursday as investors worried that
rising interest rates have begun cutting into corporate profits and
will continue to pinch earnings if the Federal Reserve boosts rates
again at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A series of earnings warnings toppled a market already
struggling to digest the Fed's decision on Wednesday to leave
interest rates unchanged but warn about risks of inflation. Selling
was broad-based.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has been fixated on the Fed, and it will continue
to be,'' said Brittain Ellis Prigge, vice president at Balentine &AMP;
Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129.75 to close at
10,398.04.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 12.43 at 1,442.39, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 63.11 at 3,877.23.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered earnings disappointments dragged the market lower.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys plunged $9.063 to $14.563 after warning that its
second-quarter revenue and earnings will miss analysts'
expectations. The company said clients have deferred several large
technology contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear fell $2.125 to $21.25 after saying it expects to report
earnings of about 37 cents a share for the quarter. Analysts had
been expecting earnings of 58 cents. Analysts said the shortfall
comes from the tire maker's unsuccessful attempt to raise prices to
offset the rising cost of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings sent a chill through a market that was already hurt
by the Fed's announcement on Wednesday. The central bank's warning
on inflation led many analysts to expect that the Fed will raise
rates at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the game is over. This is more like the seventh
inning stretch,'' said John Forelli, senior vice president at
Independence Investment Associates in Boston. ''The Fed is waiting
to see whether economic activity slows substantially. I don't think
any investors can rule out action in August.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, analysts said, the market may find excuses to
remain stalled in a narrow range. Stocks had advanced modestly in
the days leading up to the meeting, leading investors to take some
profits Thursday. Also, traders said investors were unloading some
stocks ahead of the Independence Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to rising interest
rates, pulled the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan fell $4.125 to $112.50 and
Citigroup fell $1.50 to $62.625.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also taking profits from the technology stocks
that have risen in recent sessions. LSI Logic fell $5.75 to $53.25
and Cisco fell $2.375 to $61.188.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Eli Lilly soared $15.125 to
$102.25 after announcing that an independent board gave a favorable
review to its drug Zovant, used to treat sepsis. The experimental
drug, which still needs approval from the Food and Drug
Administration, would be the first drug approved for the treatment
of sepsis, a disease in which the body's systems fail due to
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks made the most convincing gains, rising on
the hope that whether the economy grows or falters, products like
toothpaste and soap will continue to drive sales. Kimberly Clark
rose $2.313 to $56.375.
</P>
<P>
   The sector-to-sector rotation that has characterized the market
in the past few weeks is likely to persist until the Fed's next
meeting, analysts said, because it still isn't clear how successful
the Fed's six rate increases in the past year have been in slowing
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes six to nine months for rate hikes to really be felt
in the economy,'' Prigge said. ''I think we will ultimately see
that the Fed has been successful, but we might be in a holding
pattern for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, another sign of robust growth rattled some
investors. The Commerce Department said the country's total output
of goods and services, called the gross domestic product, rose at
an annual rate of 5.5 percent during the January-March quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a key inflation measure took its biggest leap since
late 1994, largely reflecting surging energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.10 billion
shares, compared with 1.05 billion at the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.41 to 512.58.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 2.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Internet Retailers, FTC Settle  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission agreed Thursday
to a settlement in the case of three large Internet retailers it
said was engaged in deceptive advertising in the sale of low-cost
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a consent agreement, the FTC said the companies, Buy.com of
Aliso Viejo, Calif., Value America in Charlottesville Va., and
Office Depot, based in Delray Beach, Fla., ran ads that did not
disclose the true price of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The consent agreement is a settlement, and does not mean that
the companies pleaded guilty of any crime. The agreement is
expected to take effect on July 31. If the companies continue their
controversial advertising after then, they would be subject to
substantial fines.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the once-popular ''free'' or cheap computers that
include substantial rebates based on the purchase of three years of
Internet service with a provider such as CompuServe or the
Microsoft Network. The advertising included in some cases tiny
print with the many restrictions, such as the cost of the Internet
subscription or penalties for early cancellation, or no disclosure
at all of the strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shouldn't need a Ph.D. to figure out the cost of a PC,''
said Jodie Bernstein, the head of the FTC's consumer protection
division. ''These advertisers should have done a better job of
disclosing the details so consumers could figure out the deal. The
fact is that consumers and businesses all benefit when disclosures
are prominently placed and in plain English.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com, one of the top five e-commerce companies with 1999
revenues of almost $600 million, said in a statement that it
thought customers understood the intricacies of the deal, and that
they received no customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are glad we were able to work together with the FTC to
resolve this issue,'' said Mitch Hill, Buy.com's CFO. ''As soon as
we became aware of the concern with the computer advertisement,
Buy.com pulled the ads to eliminate the possibility of any
potential confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the FTC's complaint against Buy.com, the commission took
issue with both print and online ads that advertised a Compaq
computer at $269. At the bottom of some of the ads, the company
said that the $269 cost included two rebates -- one from CompuServe
in return for a 3-year Internet contract, and one from Compaq.
Since the customer must pay for 3 years of service at $21.95 per
month, the total cost of the computer is $790.20. In other ads,
there was no disclosure of the rebates at all.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also took issue with the fact that CompuServe does not
have local access phone numbers in all areas, so users may have to
pay a long-distance charge.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Value America said that it would change its
practices ''to ensure consumers are able to make better informed
decisions about purchases involving price rebates.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Value America also failed to disclose that the
Internet service provider rebates would take 12-17 weeks to arrive
and that the company failed to ship products within the promised
delivery time.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also alleged that both Value America and Office Depot,
the world's largest seller of office products, advertised that
their ''free'' computer system offer included a free monitor. The
monitor had to be bought separately. Office Depot representatives
did not return a call for comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lazio counterattacks in controversy over missed House vote  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio derided Hillary Rodham
Clinton on Thursday for running a TV ad criticizing him for a
missed House vote, saying she was at a fund-raiser for a Democratic
congressman who was skipping the same June 15 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''She clearly knew by the time she went on the attack against me
... that she didn't have clean hands on this issue,'' Lazio said in
a telephone interview from Washington. ''What she's trying to do is
fool the people of New York and I just think her lack of straight
talk is going to reverberate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign fired back that Lazio is trying to shift
focus away from himself. ''I just think it's downright sad that
Congressman Lazio would divert attention from the fact that he
missed this critical vote,'' said Clinton campaign spokesman Howard
Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, missed the vote
on a $10 million funding bill that would have established a 2
million barrel home heating oil reserve. The bill, which he
championed, was defeated 195-193. Lazio was flying back to New York
for campaign events when the vote took place around 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of 47 House members, including five New York
Democrats, who missed the vote. The other New Yorkers were Reps.
Eliot Engel, Charles Rangel, Jose Serrano, Jerrold Nadler and Nydia
Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
   Engel skipped the vote to attend a fund-raiser for his campaign,
held in Westchester County, which Clinton also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Engel, in his re-election bid, faces a Democratic primary
challenge by state Sen. Larry Seabrook. Engel said in a statement
that he was told by House GOP leaders there would be no votes after
6 p.m. that day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican leadership misled many members of Congress,
including their own, by not telling members that votes were being
scheduled for after 6 p.m. until members were leaving Washington
for their districts,'' Engel said. ''The people of the northeast
must be wondering if they were hurt by Republican ineptness or
Republican duplicity in misleading members about when voting would
take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the missed vote, Lazio contended that there would
be occasions during his abbreviated Senate campaign when he might
miss House votes. The Long Island congressman entered the race in
mid-May after New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out to have
more time for treatment of his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to miss some votes, because I need to get around
the state,'' he said then. ''We got into this race very late. It's
the nature of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The following week, the Clinton campaign released a television
ad in upstate New York that criticized Lazio over the missed oil
reserve vote:
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress just defeated a plan - by only two votes - to lower
home heating oil costs for New York and the Northeast. How did Rick
Lazio vote? He didn't. He skipped the vote. Rick Lazio. The more
you know, the more you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio on Thursday questioned Clinton's truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ''For her to know that she was at a fund-raiser with a
Democratic member who missed that vote and turn around and to try
and place the blame on me,'' he said, ''I think it speaks once
again to the issue of character, integrity and truthfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson countered that Lazio ''will do anything he can to avoid
taking responsibility. He should stop pointing fingers and take
responsibility. ... The last time I looked Hillary Clinton was not
a member of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio repeated Thursday that he is not considering resigning
from the House to avoid criticism on future votes he might miss
while campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am committed to filling out my term and serving the people
who sent me here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bill requires systems in all college and university dorm rooms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - With technical differences ironed out, the
state Assembly voted unanimously Thursday to require fire
sprinklers in every dorm room at every college and university in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Public and private colleges would have to install the fire
safety systems over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is in response to a fire at Seton Hall
University in January that killed three students and injured 62
others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly this legislature has a responsibility to take
appropriate action to ensure this unfortunate tragedy does not
happen again, because it could very well have been prevented,''
said Assemblyman John V. Kelly, R-Essex, a bill sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman plans to sign the bill Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I commend the Legislature for so quickly passing this
important legislation,'' Whitman said in a statement. ''I look
forward to signing this bill to provide a measure of comfort to
parents who are sending their young people away to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Several colleges and universities, including Seton Hall, are
already moving ahead with installing sprinklers in every room in
time for the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, Rowan University in Glassboro, William Paterson
University in Wayne and Seton Hall have announced plans to put fire
sprinklers in all or some dorm rooms by fall.
</P>
<P>
   At Rutgers, nearly 2,000 students will find new sprinklers in
their rooms on some campuses in September.
</P>
<P>
   The original Senate version called for a two-year deadline, but
lawmakers extended the time frame after school officials and
contractors complained the schedule was too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities would also have to submit a plan to
the state Department of Community Affairs four months after the
bill is signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would appropriate $90 million to help pay for the
sprinklers. Public and private colleges and universities would get
zero-interest loans, while boarding schools, military academies and
other schools that have dorms would have to repay the loans at 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows exemptions for certain buildings. That would
most likely apply to ''very small'' buildings, state officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate that more than 36,000 college dorm beds
are located in rooms without sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have heard all the arguments. We have debated the merits of
multiple plans and time limits. Now, it is finally time to get this
bill signed and see these sprinklers installed,'' said state Sen.
John J. Matheussen, R-Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am hopeful Gov. Whitman takes the opportunity to sign this
bill quickly and gives colleges and universities a not-too-subtle
message not to wait four years to do this,'' said Sen. John A.
Girgenti, D-Passaic.

<HEADLINE> Former Congressman Gets Cabinet Post  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton nominated former Rep. Norman
Mineta, an executive with America's biggest defense contractor, to
lead the Commerce Department and become the first Asian-American
Cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He brings an in-depth understanding of American business and a
strong sense of the needs of our high-tech economy,'' the president
said at an Oval Office announcement ceremony Thursday. ''But he
also has a deep concern for people, for people in places who are
not yet fully participating in this economy.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former member of Congress, Mineta is expected to win strong
support in the Senate. If confirmed, he would succeed William
Daley, who is stepping down July 15 to run Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, a Japanese-American who spent his childhood in a Wyoming
internment camp during World War II, served 21 years in the House
representing the Silicon Valley area surrounding San Jose in
Northern California. He rose to become chairman of the House Public
Works and Transportation Committee in 1993 but lost his title after
Republicans won control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta resigned midterm in 1995 to join Lockheed Martin, the
nation's largest defense contractor, as senior vice president of
its transportation systems and services division.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lockheed Martin received $12.7 billion in defense
contracts in fiscal year 1999, Mineta role was in helping the
company lessen its dependence on a shrinking Pentagon pie. His
company, Lockheed Martin IMS, builds and operates electronic toll
collection systems designed to allow vehicles to go through booths
without stopping.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Mineta was a leader of efforts to build high-tech
transportation systems. His handiwork was apparent in the 1991
transportation law, which included $660 million for research into
intelligent highway systems.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta's nomination raised questions about how he would distance
himself from decisions affecting his former company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly there is the potential for conflict there,'' said
Charles Lewis, head of the Center for Public Integrity, a
government watchdog group. ''The question is how does he handle
that potential. If he's smart he will recuse himself for a period
of time. The normal time is usually a year or two years although
some have done even longer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mineta's case, the Clinton administration will leave office
in less than seven months.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Mineta would abide
by all relevant ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Mineta took issue with the notion that he would
not have enough time in his job to make a difference. ''Six months
is a virtual eternity in the new economy,'' Mineta said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of immigrants from Japan, Mineta said his nomination was
the triumph of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''The substance of your actions today must never be
underestimated or forgotten,'' Mineta said. ''Mr. President, you
have the eternal gratitude of not just Japanese Americans or
Asian-Pacific Americans but I believe every American.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Mineta, leaving the internment camp after the
war, ''vowed to work to make sure that kind of injustice could
never happen to anyone else.'' Tracing Mineta's political career in
San Jose as the first Asian-American mayor of a major American city
and then in Congress, Clinton said, ''He never stopped fighting for
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that Mineta's effort led to legislation
which provided an apology and compensation for every survivor of
the wartime internment camps.

<HEADLINE> Big Business Pushes Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. business leaders stepped up their
campaign for a Senate vote next month on a bill to expand trade
with China, voicing fears that it might wind up a casualty of
election-year politics if further delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are calling on the Senate leadership to schedule the vote
and complete action this summer before the upcoming nominating
conventions,'' said Cal Cohen, president of the Emergency Committee
for American Trade, a business coalition that is pushing the
China-trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the bill to extend permanent normal trade
relations to China in May on a 237-197 vote, but it has since
languished in the Senate, despite wide bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., earlier this week
said he hoped to bring up the bill in July, but declined to set a
timetable. He has suggested that the Senate first must work on a
set of crucial spending bills needed to keep the government
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   If the China trade bill dies because Congress runs out of time,
''America will pay the consequences for decades,'' said U.S.
Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate speech, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a leading Senate
sponsor of the bill, also called on Lott ''to set a date certain in
July'' on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prompt passage and enactment of this bill should be a top
bipartisan priority,'' Baucus said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation hope that the Senate will accept
the House-passed version and not adopt additional amendments that
would further delay proceedings and require yet another House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lott announced earlier this week that one major obstacle had
been cleared with the scheduling of a separate vote on a proposal
by Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
that could lead to sanctions against Beijing for spreading nuclear
weapons or missile technology to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Thompson and Torricelli promised not to offer their
plan -- strongly opposed by the Clinton administration -- to the
China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   But other potential amendments, both from the political left and
the political right, threatened to drag out debate on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> Push for tougher penalties for designer drugs awaits Whitman's signature </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman asked for it, now she
has it: a dramatic increase in criminal penalties for the designer
drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, Whitman urged both houses of the Legislature to
agree with her and work quickly to ratchet up prison terms for
dealers and users.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the state Assembly did its part, voting 79-0, three
days after the Senate's unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now Whitman's signature is all that is needed for Ecstasy users
and dealers to face 20-year prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ''The swift passage of this bill through both houses of the
Legislature sends a clear message to both drug traffickers and
users that we intend to address this problem seriously,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman plans to sign the bill at a ceremony Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers claim the drug now popular among teens
and young adults at so-called rave parties can cause sudden
illness, including artificially high temperatures that can kill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, Ecstasy will be in the same legal class as
heroin and cocaine. People holding 5 ounces or more - about 500 of
pills that carry a street price of $20 - would face a prison term
of up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What drug users call Ecstasy is the synthetic compound 3-4
methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, or MDMA. Other similar compounds
found to be dangerous have sometimes been sold under the same name,
and other nicknames include ''X,'' ''XTC,'' and ''Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   Possessing Ecstasy now rates as a third-degree criminal drug
offense with a maximum prison sentence of five years. State law
sets no degrees of punishment for offenders with increasing amounts
of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law keeps the third-degree offense only for those
caught with less than half an ounce. Offenders with between half an
ounce and 5 ounces would face up to 10 years in prison, a
second-degree crime. Each ounce is about 100 pills.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also provide for warnings to parents and
teen-agers through the state Health and Education departments about
the risks of Ecstasy. The warning will include letters home and
posters for schools and health facilities.

<HEADLINE> Animal Park Owner Aspinall Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- John Aspinall, a millionaire gambling tycoon and
owner of two wild animal parks, died Thursday of cancer, his family
said. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Aspinall was born in India in 1926 and moved with his family to
England at age 6.
</P>
<P>
   He was already a well-known high roller during his student days
at Oxford University, and in the 1950's became a regular patron of
London's black market gaming clubs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time gambling was legalized in the 1960's, Aspinall was
operating traveling Baccarat games for the privileged classes, and
expanded his operations to include gaming rooms in London, New
Zealand and France.
</P>
<P>
   A large win at the horse races helped Aspinall buy his first
home in 1956 -- an 18th-century country house near Canterbury in
southeast England. Aspinall used the 40-acre property as a base to
collect gorillas, tigers, elephants and rhinos.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, when the collection became too large, Aspinall bought
an early 20th century mansion in nearby Port Lympne on 275 acres.
Two years later, he opened both animal parks to the public and
eventually transferred ownership to a charity foundation under his
name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never been able to afford anything in my life. I just
take plunges and hope the gods smile on me later. They always have,
until now,'' Aspinall said in a television interview after he was
diagnosed with cancer several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Aspinall's parks were lauded as successful breeding grounds, and
over the years staff oversaw the birth of 73 gorillas and six black
rhinos.
</P>
<P>
   But Aspinall's game parks were best known for their unorthodox
approach to animal management, in particular his policy of
encouraging close personal relationships between staff and wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors regularly saw keepers playing with tigers or gorillas,
which Aspinall believed helped the animals' emotional well-being.
But his philosophy was not without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, five employees died while caring for the
animals. The latest victim was a Port Lympne gamekeeper who was
crushed by an elephant in February.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Canterbury's city council took Aspinall to court,
arguing that keepers should be banned from entering cages unless
the animals were young or immobilized. Aspinall won the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Aspinall was undergoing surgery for throat and
jaw cancer at London's Royal Marsden Hospital. He would battle the
disease for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Immortality comes from your genes, provided you pass them on.
I am amazed that any religion can demand more than that,'' Aspinall
said in February. ''I have two stout sons, one of whom has bred and
another who will breed, and a daughter who has bred. So I've no
wish to float through space as a soul. It is just a greedy
illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Aspinall is survived by his wife Sarah, two sons Damian and
Bassa, daughter Amanda and two stepsons Jason and Amos Courage.
Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Psychiatrist Says Elian Needs Help  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once he was reunited with his father, Elian
Gonzalez was able to regain the ''life of a child and not an icon''
but he will still need help in Cuba to cope with the trauma of
losing his mother at sea, his U.S. government-appointed
psychiatrist said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In her first interview since finishing consultations with the
6-year-old shipwreck survivor, Dr. Paulina Kernberg told The
Associated Press the boy lived with fear, uncertainty and stress in
his first five months in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He spent that time in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, where
his America relatives cared for him and tried to get him asylum
against return to communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''As things unfolded, there was always the fear that somebody
was going to come and take him away,'' said Kernberg, a child
psychiatrist and professor of psychiatry appointed to the case by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was kept away from school, there were barricades around
the house, and his caretakers -- great-uncle Lazaro and cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez -- eventually cut back on his outings out of
their own fears for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg said Elian's fear abated after he was seized from that
home and reunited April 22 with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
stepmother, Nersy, and infant half brother Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beyond a doubt he felt safe ... and I think the people who
provided that were his father and stepmother,'' Kernberg said,
calling them ''very receptive and sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Elian's Cuban playmates restored even more of his
past life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His life regained a sense of safety with a routine appropriate
to the life of a child and not an icon,'' said Kernberg, director
of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York-Presbyterian
Hospital and professor of psychiatry at the Cornell University
Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg was among the doctors appointed to help the warring
sides of the family arrange an emotionally smooth transfer of the
boy back to his father. When negotiations failed and the boy was
taken from Miami, she visited Elian and his reunited Cuban family
every two weeks in Maryland and the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Her task was to check on how they were doing and be available
for counseling if needed, she said, adding that her last visit was
June 19.
</P>
<P>
   She said Nersy, ''who has been quiet in all this process,'' is a
more important figure than she appeared as the saga played out
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is the stepmother with whom Elian has been very close and
spent most of the time before he arrived in the United States,''
Kernberg said. ''She is really very important, a real surrogate,
more than a surrogate mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian also developed ''a very important relationship'' with his
Miami relatives, she said, adding that while Elian doesn't
necessarily ''need them'' in his future, she hopes the two sides of
the family can reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good extended family, one that we would wish for
every child to have,'' Kernberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately ... the grown-ups couldn't negotiate, come to
terms, accept differences and keep the tie, which is what happens
to many cases of divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   But most important for Elian, Kernberg said, is that he have
help from his family or professionals in Cuba in talking through
the ''big scare'' and trauma of seeing his mother drown in their
failed crossing to America.
</P>
<P>
   ''I trust that they will have ... our professional counterparts
there to continue the work that the little boy will still need to
... (talk through) the grief, the loss of his mother and all the
stresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Those included ''being without his father and family, of not
knowing when he would see them again, of being in the limelight day
and night and being in the role that went beyond a regular child's
role.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was turned into an icon and that was stressful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg said Elian has ''begun some of this process of
mourning, of grief.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Redlener, a pediatrician who in April also consulted
with the government on Elian's case, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener visited the Cuban family socially for two hours on May
31 and said Elian ''looked terrific ... like a completely normal
6-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing ... that would suggest he would need
anything special except to get some stability with his family,
going to school and being home,'' he said, except for the help with
his mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener is a professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College
of Medicine and president and director of community pediatrics at
the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York. He assembled the
panel of mental health specialists, including Kernberg, at the
request of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, this is a little boy who had an
unbelievably traumatic experience of watching his mother die at
sea,'' Redlener said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a child I would pay close attention to.''

<HEADLINE> Courts To Study State Abortion Bans  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some abortion foes acknowledge their states'
bans on ''partial-birth'' abortion are doomed by a new Supreme
Court ruling. But others vow to fight for some type of restriction
that would survive legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A day after striking down Nebraska's law as an undue burden on
women's right to end their pregnancies, the Supreme Court acted
Thursday on three other state laws that sought to prohibit the
procedure opponents call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ordered a federal appeals court that had upheld
laws from Illinois and Wisconsin to reconsider them in light of the
standards set by Wednesday's 5-4 ruling in the Nebraska case. And,
in one of many orders issued in the wake of the 1999-2000 term, the
justices let stand a federal appeals court ruling that struck down
Iowa's partial-birth abortion law.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, state officials and advocates on both sides of the
abortion issue are examining the Nebraska decision for its impact
on laws in their states.
</P>
<P>
   ''In practical terms, it means that the South Dakota statute is
unenforceable,'' said state Attorney General Mark Barnett. ''Our
hands are tied. They've expressed the law and we must follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas state Rep. Tony Powell, an anti-abortion leader, said,
''I will be honest with you, I don't know what we will do. ... Am I
giving up? No, not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress also are looking to retool their
proposed legislation. ''This opinion will be studied intensely,''
said House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vetoed proposed partial-birth abortion bans in
1996 and 1997, saying they did not provide adequate exceptions to
protect the health of the mother. Both times, Congress failed to
override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said the Nebraska law could criminalize other
abortion procedures besides the one opponents said they were
targeting. The law's other big flaw, the court said, was its lack
of an exemption to allow the procedure if a doctor concludes it is
the best way to preserve a woman's health.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, national president of Planned Parenthood, said
Thursday, ''Our lawyers believe that most, if not all, of the laws
would almost inevitably be unconstitutional under this ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she added, ''We assume we will be back in court on
the question of whether there is any state interest that will
justify a more narrowly written'' ban on the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Nebraska, 30 states enacted bans on partial-birth
abortion. Many of those laws have been blocked or invalidated by
lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's law was invalidated by a state judge a few months after
it was enacted in 1997. After Wednesday's ruling, state Attorney
General Bruce Botelho said he instructed the state's lawyers to
withdraw an appeal in the Alaska Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Dorinda Bordlee, an attorney who argued in favor of Louisiana's
law, said the justices' ruling effectively kills her state's
statute.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very extreme decision which has the effect of striking
down the partial-birth abortion bans all over the nation,'' Bordlee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle said Thursday his state's
law clearly is unconstitutional under the Nebraska ruling. ''The
court premised its holding on its view that in order to be
constitutional the law must protect the women's health. The
Wisconsin law does not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said if his state's law is thrown
out when reconsidered, he will ask lawmakers to pass another one
that might have a better chance of meeting constitutional
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Right to Life spokeswoman Gen Wilson said the Supreme
Court's ruling ''isn't a great blow to Georgia because our
partial-birth abortion law was virtually impotent.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a court challenge by doctors to the 1997 law, Georgia
officials agreed to interpret it to ban only abortions performed
after the fetus could live outside the womb, and to include an
exception to protect the mother's health.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who provided the fifth vote to
strike down Nebraska's law, said a partial-birth abortion law could
pass muster if it were limited to that particular procedure and
included an exception to preserve the mother's life and health.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a co-author with O'Connor of the
court's 1992 ruling that upheld abortion rights, wrote in dissent
Wednesday that her assurance that Nebraska could redraft the law
was ''meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws in Ohio and Utah seek to target only one procedure, and
both have an exception designed to protect the woman's life and
health.
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota, Jane Bovard, administrator of the Red River
Women's Clinic in Fargo, said she hoped the Supreme Court's ruling
would prompt another look at North Dakota's ban on the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to keep fighting every time they come up with one
of these ways to challenge'' abortion rights, Bovard said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russia Spy Harmed US Spying  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Russian spy working in U.S. military
security crippled American intelligence gathering in the critical
period leading to the Korean War, a newly declassified report says.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Agency report on cryptology says William
Weisband, described as a linguist recruited by Soviet intelligence
in the 1930s, caused ''perhaps the most significant intelligence
loss in U.S. history.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisband, who lived in Fairfax, Va., and died in 1967, was never
charged with spying, although he was removed from the Armed Forces
Security Agency, the NSA's predecessor, and spent a year in prison
for refusing to cooperate with a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Russian immigrants is believed to have passed to the
Soviets information about U.S. ability to decipher their messages,
which restricted monitoring of the communist bloc after World War
II, said the report by NSA researchers David A. Hatch and Robert
Louis Benson.
</P>
<P>
   In rapid succession, every one of (the) cipher systems went
dark,'' the report said. ''This dreary situation continued up to
the Korean War, denying American policymakers access to vital
decrypts in this critical period.''
</P>
<P>
   John Earl Haynes, a Library of Congress political historian,
said Thursday that Weisband's importance as a spy has been
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the evidence they had was plenty convincing, the Justice
Department determined that unless they wanted to reveal a lot of
stuff, it wouldn't be sufficient for criminal prosecution,'' Haynes
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A report Thursday in The (Baltimore) Sun described Haynes as one
of the first people outside the intelligence agencies to focus on
Weisband's role.
</P>
<P>
   The NSA historical analysis is part of a series of documents
officials hope to declassify as part of the 50th anniversary of the
Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The report analyzes U.S. intelligence gathering leading up to
the Korean War and says monitoring of Korea was not a high priority
until the surprise invasion by North Korea in June 1950.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were caught unprepared for the invasion or for
China's entry into the war later that year.
</P>
<P>
   The report said some North Korean communications were
intercepted between May 1949 and April 1950 because the Koreans
were using Soviet communications procedures. But coverage was
dropped once analysts confirmed the non-Soviet origin of the
material.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 200 messages had been intercepted by the time the
war began, but none had been processed, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the outbreak of war, there were at least two hints of
''more than usual interest in the Korean peninsula by communist
bloc nations,'' the report said, but neither was sufficient to
provide a specific warning of the June invasion.
</P>
<P>
   One was an increase in Soviet targeting of communications in
South Korea and the other was large shipments of bandages and
medicines from the Soviet Union to North Korea and Manchuria
starting in February 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ''These two actions made sense only in hindsight,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even later analysis of the unprocessed messages disclosed no
message that would have given advance warning of the invasion, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Tests Reveal Possible Fat Fighter  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists were testing a possible cancer
treatment when they spotted a side effect that might prove rather
valuable: The experimental drug made mice lose a dramatic amount of
weight, without apparent side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Just 20 minutes after taking the chemical, the rodents'
appetites were wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery indicates scientists may be able to regulate a
major pathway in the brain responsible for appetite and
fat-building. The chemical apparently fooled the brain into
thinking the mice had eaten, so their metabolisms never slowed and
they burned fat, researchers report in Friday's edition of the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real trick. The mice drop their weight like a stone,
losing 25 percent of their body mass in a couple of days,'' said
Dr. Frank Kuhajda, who led the research team at Baltimore's Johns
Hopkins University that produced the chemical, code-named C75.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows if C75 would work in humans, experts caution.
More animal research is needed before dieters could even test it.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Hopkins discovery is ''extraordinarily intriguing and
provocative,'' said Denis McGarry, an expert on fat metabolism at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. If
confirmed, he said, ''it would obviously have a profound impact on
the field of obesity research.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long hoped for better weight-loss treatments. Over
half of all Americans are overweight, and about one-quarter are
obese, government estimates show.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is ''fatty acid synthase'' or FAS, an enzyme system
pivotal for turning carbohydrates into the building blocks of fat.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, in the early 1990s scientists discovered cancer
cells use FAS to produce their own fat for fuel, Kuhajda said. No
one knows why. But the Hopkins researchers created a FAS blocker to
see if it could fight cancer. In mouse testing, this so-called C75
made cancer cells die without harming nearby normal cells, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the mice all had a stunning side effect: They stopped eating
and dramatically lost weight until the drug wore off.
</P>
<P>
   Weight loss in a cancer patient is a serious problem, so the
puzzled scientists began hunting an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that production of a brain chemical called
neuropeptide Y -- a well-known appetite regulator -- plummeted in the
C75-treated mice. Normally when animals fast, neuropeptide Y
sharply jumps and appetite consequently increases. But the C75
prevented that, fooling animals into thinking they were fed,
Kuhajda said.
</P>
<P>
   How? To build fat, FAS uses another molecule called malonyl-CoA.
Blocking FAS didn't stop the body's normal production of that
molecule. Instead, malonyl-CoA just piled up without that next step
in the fat-building assembly line. High levels of the molecule
somehow signaled the brain not to produce neuropeptide Y, Kuhajda
said.
</P>
<P>
   C75 didn't permanently harm the appetite system. When scientists
injected C75-treated mice with neuropeptide Y, they immediately
stuffed themselves. When C75 wore off, they ate normally and
regained weight.
</P>
<P>
   But C75 had another important benefit, the researchers reported.
One reason dieting is so hard is that fasting slows metabolism.
Metabolism didn't seem to slow in the C75-treated mice, however --
they lost 45 percent more weight than untreated mice deprived of
food.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopkins researchers are pursuing C75 as a possible cancer
treatment, figuring appetite suppression isn't an insurmountable
side effect. But the newest findings ''give us some hope'' of a new
way to fight obesity, too, Kuhajda concluded.

<HEADLINE> Senate, Assembly pass budget but Whitman seeks more for surplus  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Both houses of the Legislature
overwhelmingly approved a $21.5 billion budget Thursday, but the
stage is set for Gov. Christie Whitman to cut out part of it in
order to enlarge the surplus she wants for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is expected to use her line-item veto power to
remove at least $25 million by Friday, a fairly small percentage of
overall spending but a cut that could touch some of the pet
projects lawmakers inserted last week.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald DiFrancesco said it was a tiny amount in
the overall scheme of things. ''This is her prerogative, and I
don't think it is a major cause of concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is scheduled to sign the budget Friday afternoon.
The state constitution gives her until midnight Friday for the
2000-2001 fiscal year that begins at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. If the
budget remains largely intact, as expected, it would increase
spending by 10 percent from the budget signed into law one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the budget with only one ''no'' vote from Sen.
John Lynch, D-Middlesex, who criticized Whitman and the Republicans
for doing too little to reduce debt. ''The theme of this budget
cycle is one of missed opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly passed it 75-4 with Democratic leaders proclaiming
their support for it early in Thursday's debate. Two Democrats and
two Republicans voted no.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Assemblyman Joseph Suliga, D-Union, condemned the
increase in spending at a time when local towns and schools are
being held to much tighter caps. ''My parents always taught me if
you earn a little more, you save a little more for the future. This
budget does not do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also strong objections Thursday from one person with
a key say in the matter, Whitman, one of the few chief executives
in the United States who can use the line-item veto without further
consulting the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has insisted on a minimum surplus - a reserve of cash
that remains unspent - of $850 million, and has said she would veto
spending that digs into that surplus too deeply.
</P>
<P>
   During floor debate Thursday, lawmakers proclaimed their budget
bill maintained a surplus of $869 million. However, Whitman
spokesman Peter McDonough said administration officials disagreed
with their mathematics, saying the bill provides for only $825
million for surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is not over the budget itself but rather concerns
the amount of money being left over from the current fiscal year
which ends at midnight Friday. McDonough said Whitman will make the
changes necessary to restore the full surplus to $850 million,
presumably with cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the budget increases funding by $157 million for the
30 so-called ''special needs'' districts defined in the Abbott v.
Burke court rulings. Overall school aid will hit $6.65 billion,
with $2.75 billion of it earmarked specifically for the Abbott
districts where the Supreme Court has ordered ''parity'' with the
amount spent on pupils in the state's 100 wealthiest school
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also spends $701 million for the Transportation Trust
Fund, lowering the amount that will need to be financed with
long-term bonds.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Signs Free Trade Pact  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico signed a free trade pact Thursday with
three Central American nations, extending a free-market crusade
that president Ernesto Zedillo said should lead to Latin American
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The treaty we sign today is a firm step toward the true
integration of Latin America,'' Zedillo said, ''an integration that
will always be respectful of the sovereignty and identity of each
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Also signing were presidents Francisco Flores of El Salvador and
Alfonso Portillo of Guatemala, as well as William Handal,
representing Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty that takes effect on Jan. 1 includes 124 million
consumers -- three-quarters of them in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations with the so-called ''Northern Triangle''
countries took eight years. The treaty lifts tariffs on many
agricultural and manufactured goods within 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo said the treaty was a step toward building the
continent-wide free trade pact that countries in the region have
agreed to seek by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we all signed with Mexico, why can't we sign among
ourselves?'' Portillo said, referring to Central America's problems
in reaching its own free trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama also attended
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has had free trade agreements with Nicaragua since 1998
and Costa Rica since 1995, and it is negotiating with Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The trade pact is among several that Zedillo has clinched as he
prepares to leave office in December. A free trade agreement with
the 15-nation European Union takes effect Saturday, and Mexico
recently reached one with Israel. It reached a pact on automobile
trade with Brazil in April.
</P>
<P>
   Excluded from the agreement between Mexico and Central America
are key agricultural goods, including coffee, sugar, bananas and
corn.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for only limited opening in steel and beer, key Mexican
exports, said Eduardo Solis, a Mexican negotiator. Cement is also
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico will end tariffs on agricultural goods covered by the
agreement within 10 years, while the Central American countries
will have up until 12 years to do so. Mexico will lift tariffs on
manufacturing exports within nine years, while the Central American
nations get up to 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way trade between Mexico and the three Central American
countries totaled $1.05 billion last year, only 0.4 percent of
Mexico's total trade, according to the Mexican Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way trade was $626.2 million with Guatemala, $262.7 million
with El Salvador and $163.7 million with Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's drive to expand trade relations reflects an effort to
wean itself from dependence on the United States, which accounted
for 83 percent of total Mexican trade last year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 130; Nasdaq Falls 63  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Thursday as investors worried that
rising interest rates have begun cutting into corporate profits and
will continue to pinch earnings if the Federal Reserve boosts rates
again at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A series of earnings warnings toppled a market already
struggling to digest the Fed's decision on Wednesday to leave
interest rates unchanged but warn about risks of inflation. Selling
was broad-based.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has been fixated on the Fed, and it will continue
to be,'' said Brittain Ellis Prigge, vice president at Balentine &AMP;
Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129.75 to close at
10,398.04.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 12.43 at 1,442.39, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 63.11 at 3,877.23.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered earnings disappointments dragged the market lower.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys plunged $9.063 to $14.563 after warning that its
second-quarter revenue and earnings will miss analysts'
expectations. The company said clients have deferred several large
technology contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear fell $2.125 to $21.25 after saying it expects to report
earnings of about 37 cents a share for the quarter. Analysts had
been expecting earnings of 58 cents. Analysts said the shortfall
comes from the tire maker's unsuccessful attempt to raise prices to
offset the rising cost of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings sent a chill through a market that was already hurt
by the Fed's announcement on Wednesday. The central bank's warning
on inflation led many analysts to expect that the Fed will raise
rates at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the game is over. This is more like the seventh
inning stretch,'' said John Forelli, senior vice president at
Independence Investment Associates in Boston. ''The Fed is waiting
to see whether economic activity slows substantially. I don't think
any investors can rule out action in August.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, analysts said, the market may find excuses to
remain stalled in a narrow range. Stocks had advanced modestly in
the days leading up to the meeting, leading investors to take some
profits Thursday. Also, traders said investors were unloading some
stocks ahead of the Independence Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to rising interest
rates, pulled the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan fell $4.125 to $112.50 and
Citigroup fell $1.50 to $62.625.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also taking profits from the technology stocks
that have risen in recent sessions. LSI Logic fell $5.75 to $53.25
and Cisco fell $2.375 to $61.188.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Eli Lilly soared $15.125 to
$102.25 after announcing that an independent board gave a favorable
review to its drug Zovant, used to treat sepsis. The experimental
drug, which still needs approval from the Food and Drug
Administration, would be the first drug approved for the treatment
of sepsis, a disease in which the body's systems fail due to
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks made the most convincing gains, rising on
the hope that whether the economy grows or falters, products like
toothpaste and soap will continue to drive sales. Kimberly Clark
rose $2.313 to $56.375.
</P>
<P>
   The sector-to-sector rotation that has characterized the market
in the past few weeks is likely to persist until the Fed's next
meeting, analysts said, because it still isn't clear how successful
the Fed's six rate increases in the past year have been in slowing
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes six to nine months for rate hikes to really be felt
in the economy,'' Prigge said. ''I think we will ultimately see
that the Fed has been successful, but we might be in a holding
pattern for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, another sign of robust growth rattled some
investors. The Commerce Department said the country's total output
of goods and services, called the gross domestic product, rose at
an annual rate of 5.5 percent during the January-March quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a key inflation measure took its biggest leap since
late 1994, largely reflecting surging energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.30 billion
shares, compared with 1.28 billion at the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.41 to 512.58.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 2.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Internet Retailers, FTC Settle Case  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission agreed Thursday
to a settlement in the case of three large Internet retailers it
said was engaged in deceptive advertising in the sale of low-cost
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a consent agreement, the FTC said the companies, Buy.com of
Aliso Viejo, Calif., Value America in Charlottesville Va., and
Office Depot, based in Delray Beach, Fla., ran ads that did not
disclose the true price of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The consent agreement is a settlement, and does not mean that
the companies pleaded guilty of any crime. The agreement is
expected to take effect on July 31. If the companies continue their
controversial advertising after then, they would be subject to
substantial fines.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the once-popular ''free'' or cheap computers that
include substantial rebates based on the purchase of three years of
Internet service with a provider such as CompuServe or the
Microsoft Network. The advertising included in some cases tiny
print with the many restrictions, such as the cost of the Internet
subscription or penalties for early cancellation, or no disclosure
at all of the strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shouldn't need a Ph.D. to figure out the cost of a PC,''
said Jodie Bernstein, the head of the FTC's consumer protection
division. ''These advertisers should have done a better job of
disclosing the details so consumers could figure out the deal. The
fact is that consumers and businesses all benefit when disclosures
are prominently placed and in plain English.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com, one of the top five e-commerce companies with 1999
revenues of almost $600 million, said in a statement that it
thought customers understood the intricacies of the deal, and that
they received no customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are glad we were able to work together with the FTC to
resolve this issue,'' said Mitch Hill, Buy.com's CFO. ''As soon as
we became aware of the concern with the computer advertisement,
Buy.com pulled the ads to eliminate the possibility of any
potential confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the FTC's complaint against Buy.com, the commission took
issue with both print and online ads that advertised a Compaq
computer at $269. At the bottom of some of the ads, the company
said that the $269 cost included two rebates -- one from CompuServe
in return for a 3-year Internet contract, and one from Compaq.
Since the customer must pay for 3 years of service at $21.95 per
month, the total cost of the computer is $790.20. In other ads,
there was no disclosure of the rebates at all.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also took issue with the fact that CompuServe does not
have local access phone numbers in all areas, so users may have to
pay a long-distance charge.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Value America said that it would change its
practices ''to ensure consumers are able to make better informed
decisions about purchases involving price rebates.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Value America also failed to disclose that the
Internet service provider rebates would take 12-17 weeks to arrive
and that the company failed to ship products within the promised
delivery time.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also alleged that both Value America and Office Depot,
the world's largest seller of office products, advertised that
their ''free'' computer system offer included a free monitor. The
monitor had to be bought separately.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was in our best interest to work with them (the FTC),''
said Eileen Dunn, a spokeswoman for Office Depot. ''We want to make
sure our customers understand the deals and are not disappointed.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Passes Disclosure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress approved the first restrictions on
campaign financing in two decades Thursday, sending President
Clinton legislation that forces tax-exempt political organizations
to reveal who is paying for their campaign-style TV ads, radio
spots and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised to sign the bill, meaning those reports should
be available before this fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved by an overwhelming majority in the Senate on
Thursday, would leave many interest groups free to continue
broadcasting commercials without naming their donors. And groups
affected by the legislation may reorganize themselves under the tax
laws to avoid disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   But backers argued it was crucial to preserving one of the
pillars of post-Watergate reforms: public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is only the first step,'' said Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who led a bipartisan group of lawmakers as they rolled the
measure past GOP leaders in the House and Senate. ''It is indeed a
great day for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill only requires disclosure of donations made after it
becomes law. Some backers feared GOP leaders might drag their feet
in sending the bill to the White House, and supporters speculated
that affected groups were now scrambling to raise money before the
bill is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite initial opposition from Republican leaders, the
legislation was approved by huge majorities in each chamber of
Congress. It passed the Senate 92-6 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Senate's fiercest opponent of campaign finance reform
urged his GOP colleagues -- particularly those up for re-election --
to vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not think this is a spear worth falling on four months
before an election,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the legislation only affects groups that organize under
the increasingly popular section 527 of the tax code, which is
reserved for groups created for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Other tax-exempt interest groups and companies remain free to
run ads meant to influence elections without disclosing their
donors -- as long as they do not directly advocate a candidate's
election or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a piece of legislation affects almost nobody, it's easy
to move it rapidly,'' said McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by just five others, all Republicans, in voting
no: Sens. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, Jesse Helms of North Carolina,
Connie Mack of Florida and James Inhofe and Don Nickles of
Oklahoma. Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,
did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was clearly a win for those who want to overhaul
campaign finance laws, especially for McCain, who built a
presidential bid around his reputation as a campaign finance
reformer although he has yet to see a bill become law.
</P>
<P>
   The last significant change to campaign finance law came in
1979, when disclosure rules were clarified.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passage of this bill proves that public interest can triumph
over special interests,'' Clinton said. Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush also praised the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation requires section 527 groups to notify the
Internal Revenue Service that they exist within 24 hours of
forming. And groups that raise at least $25,000 per year would have
to report contributions of $200 or more and spending of $500 or
more. Reports would be due four times a year, plus immediately
before an election, and should be available before voting this
November.
</P>
<P>
   Reserved for political groups, section 527 has generally been
used by political parties and political action committees. But
while parties and PACs report their contributions and spending to
the Federal Election Commission, a new brand of 527 does not,
claiming to be engaged in ''issues'' not electioneering.
</P>
<P>
   Other interest groups make this distinction as well, though
unlike 527 groups, they face restrictions on their political
activity. The Christian Coalition, for instance, created a 527
group after the IRS clamped down on the organization for its
political activity.
</P>
<P>
   Cleta Mitchell, an attorney who represents several 527 groups,
said she would consider a court challenge to the bill's
constitutionality. In the meantime, she said she would advise her
clients to ''do whatever is necessary to avoid having to report,''
including reorganizing under a different section of tax code.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop a little bravado from Sen. Russell Feingold,
D-Wis.: ''We're going to find them,'' he said, ''and we're going to
nail them.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4762.

<HEADLINE> American Express president in testimony acknowledges company mistakes </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The president of American Express described
blunders by his company that left it envious of the cozy
relationship its competitors had developed with U.S. banks during
testimony Thursday in the government's case against Visa and
MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth I. Chenault, who takes over as the company's chief
executive officer next spring, told how American Express blossomed
after issuing its first charge card in 1958, only to squander its
dominant position later.
</P>
<P>
   He is a key government witness in a civil case in which the
Justice Department seeks to prove that Visa and MasterCard violated
antitrust laws by joining with banks to create rules that block the
banks from doing business with American Express and Discover.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones in
Manhattan to prevent some of the nation's largest banks from
continuing to unduly influence the two credit card networks, thus
stifling competition. The government also wants to eliminate the
rule that prevents banks offering Visa and MasterCard from issuing
other credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Visa International, based in Foster City, Calif., and MasterCard
International Inc., headquartered in Purchase, N.Y., are nonprofit
associations made up of some 8,500 banks. Together they control
about three-fourths of the bank credit card market in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   CardWeb.com, which studies the industry, said that as of the end
of 1999, Visa had a 49 percent market share, while MasterCard had
about 28 percent. American Express Co., headquartered in New York,
had a 17 percent share, while Discover, which is owned by the New
York-based Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. brokerage firm, has 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chenault testified that Visa and MasterCard as early as 1981
mounted an effective public relations campaign to convince the
nation's banks that American Express was competing against the
banks for bank customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to steal your customers,'' he said the banks
were told.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering suspicions about American Express' intentions,
along with a lucrative relationship between the banks and the Visa
and MasterCard networks, made it difficult to persuade banks to
promote American Express products, Chenault said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Banks were not actively pushing our products,'' he said. ''It
became very clear to me that the partnership with banks was
incredibly powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Chenault, though, blamed American Express executives for making
poor decisions in the last two decades which, he said, held the
company back as competitors surged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were losing relevance with our customers,'' he said at one
point. ''We were trying to be all things to all people with a few
products.''
</P>
<P>
   He said American Express in the early 1990s needed to
aggressively expand the number of merchants who accepted the card
but did not realize how out of favor it had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I needed a wake-up call, it would be called the Boston Fee
Party,'' he said of the decision by some Boston restaurant owners
to boycott the card because they believed American Express charged
them too much per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, American Express analyzed its fees and restructured
them, lowering them in some markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his company's rejection of an opportunity to team up
with American Airlines was a ''big, big mistake,'' especially since
so many American Express customers were business people who
traveled a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in fact did not understand that this was a terrific valve
for our core customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then American Express did not aggressively attempt to team up
with AT&AMP;T when the company wanted to offer its own charge card with
no fee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a mistake for us not to be more aggressive,'' he said.
''The free-for-life offer sent shock waves through the credit card
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Chenault said he remains convinced that American Express
ultimately must forge good relationships with banks and continue to
sign up merchants who accept the card.
</P>
<P>
   On cross examination, he conceded that American Express had
missed some opportunities over the years because of its own
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Volume would give us lower costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Hanft, deputy general counsel for MasterCard, said there
was nothing in Chenault's testimony to indicate that consumers were
being harmed or that competition was hindered by the Visa and
MasterCard networks.
</P>
<P>
   Chenault, he said, ''testified that, in the past, Amex made bad
business decisions that significantly affected their ability to
compete in the marketplace and that their desire to work with banks
was part of their attempt to compensate for these mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Presta, vice president of Visa USA, said it showed that
American Express ''would rather whine in court than compete in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that although Discover was a younger company, it had
used mail and phone promotions to put more cards in the market than
American Express, which ''proves that competition in the payment
card industry is rampant.''

<HEADLINE> Controversy Over Used Air Bags  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An industry group contends air bags taken from
junk vehicles are unsafe, but salvage yard owners dispute that and
say such bags offer consumers a cheap alternative to new safety
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing an air bag that has been deployed or stolen can cost
$2,500 with installation, while an air bag that comes from another
vehicle can be as cheap as $200.
</P>
<P>
   There are no figures on how many ''recycled'' air bags have been
installed, but the Automotive Occupant Restraints Council said more
are available because 10-year-old vehicles that contained the first
mass-produced air bags are showing up in greater numbers at junk
yards. And, air bag thefts have been increasing because there is a
ready market.
</P>
<P>
   The council, made up of seat belt and air bag manufacturers,
said air bags that come from other vehicles may not provide
adequate protection in a crash if they have been exposed to
excessive heat, shock or water.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is purely a safety issue,'' AORC President George
Kirchoff said. ''All restraint systems, including air bags, are
designed and manufactured to very distinct requirements that are
vehicle-specific.''
</P>
<P>
   Their campaign to convince vehicle owners to demand new air bags
when they need a replacement has put them at odds with the
Automotive Recyclers Association, a group that includes salvage
yard owners.
</P>
<P>
   The association tested 196 salvaged air bags and all worked
properly, except one that had been damaged in a flood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our research that we have done and is ongoing shows it is a
viable use when properly installed, shipped and identified,'' said
Michael E. Wilson of ARA.
</P>
<P>
   However, ARA agrees air bags should not be put in a different
model than the one for which they were manufactured and that
damaged bags should not be reused.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are salvage people out there that aren't reputable,''
acknowledged ARA spokesman Brad Slater. ''Professionals will use an
air bag from the same type of car.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states have undertaken efforts to prohibit the use of
recycled air bags. California passed a law last year making it a
misdemeanor to sell or install air bags that have deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Department of Motor Vehicles issued a rule blocking
the sale of salvaged air bags but in March the state Supreme Court
issued an injunction saying the state did not back its claim that
such devices were unsafe.

<HEADLINE> Hospital and DYFS accused of discriminating against HIV-positive mother </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A lawsuit charges that a pregnant woman
whose blood was tested for the virus that causes AIDS without her
consent later had her newborn taken from her by state officials who
filed false documents after she refused to give an anti-AIDS drug
to the child.
</P>
<P>
   The child was ultimately returned, said Lenora Lapidus, legal
director for the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
</P>
<P>
   A Trenton hospital and the state Division of Youth and Family
Services are defendants in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District
Court here Wednesday on behalf of ''Jane Doe'' of Mercer County by
the Women and AIDS Clinic at Rutgers Law School and the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   DYFS spokesman Andy Williams said the agency cannot comment
because it had not seen the lawsuit, and also because it cannot
discuss specific families.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, the agency acts upon referrals. HIV
exposure alone is not a reason to remove a child, or to become
involved with a family, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There would have to be some sense that the child's health or
safety is involved,'' Williams said. ''The standard of removal
should always be the safety of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the hospital, Capital Health System's Mercer
Campus, could not comment on the lawsuit because they had not yet
been seen the complaint, and also because they did not know who the
woman was since she was not named, said spokeswoman Luann McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about hospital policy, McCarty said, ''We do not release
any information without the patient's consent. The only exceptions
would be if we are required to do so by court order, statute, or if
a regulation mandates us to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinic lawyer Cynthia M. Dennis said the state AIDS Assistance
Act does have exceptions, ''but we're alleging that there was an
unlawful breach of confidentiality in this instance.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the information went to someone who should not have
received it, Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother went to the hospital in July 1998 and was tested for
HIV without her consent, in violation of the law, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because a woman is pregnant doesn't mean she loses that
right,'' Lapidus said.
</P>
<P>
   She tested positive, and the information was given to DYFS,
violating her confidentiality, Lapidus said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother refused to give the child AZT, an anti-AIDS drug,
which was recommended ''based solely on the mother's HIV test,''
Lapidus said.
</P>
<P>
   To support its efforts to remove the child, DYFS filed false
affidavits stating that the woman was involved with drugs at the
time of her pregnancy, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was out of the mother's custody for about 20 days,
Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis and Lapidus declined to disclose the mother's town or the
child's HIV status or gender.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified money damages.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Health System's Mercer Campus was formerly known as the
Mercer Medical Center. Capital Health was formed at the end of 1997
by the merger of Mercer Medical Center and Helene Fuld Medical
Center, which is also in Trenton.

<HEADLINE> Declaration of Independence copy sells for $8.1 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A 1776 copy of the Declaration of Independence
sold for $8.14 million Thursday in an electronic auction on
Sotheby's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The auction house said the price was the highest for any item
ever sold on the Internet and for any American historical document.
</P>
<P>
   Two would-be buyers fought for the copy, posting 29 separate
bids that began at $4 million and ended at $7.4 million. Sotheby's
commission brought the price to $8.14 million. The buyer's name was
not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   The copy was produced by John Dunlap, a Philadelphia printer,
the night of July 4, 1776. It is one of 25 that survive from the
hundreds that were printed and sent to the 13 colonies proclaiming
their independence from Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   All but four of the surviving copies are in museums or public
institutions. Sotheby's has said this copy may be the last one to
come up for sale because the other private owners plan to donate
theirs to museums.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than any other document in the world, this is the
embodiment of the values of America,'' said Craig Moffett,
president of Sothebys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's had initially predicted the document would sell for
between $4 million and $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The same copy was sold by Sotheby's at a live auction in 1991
for a then-record $2.4 million to Thursday's seller: Visual
Equities, a fine-art investment firm in Atlanta. It failed to sell
at auction in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   An amateur collector found the document in 1989 hidden behind a
torn painting, which he bought for $4 at an Adamstown, Pa., flea
market because he wanted the frame.

<HEADLINE> White House May Delay Execution  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House suggested Thursday that it
would hold up the Aug. 5 execution of a federal inmate -- the first
since 1963 -- if the Justice Department isn't able to finish
updating clemency guidelines for federal death row prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly know that the clemency issue is something that has
to be completed before we would move forward on the -- on any
federal execution,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said.
''Obviously the guidelines have to be there -- there has to be a
procedure for an inmate on the equivalent of federal death row to
apply for clemency.''
</P>
<P>
   Until ''the process is complete, there won't be'' an execution,
Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the clemency rules ''are almost complete'' but that it
is unclear whether the process, which includes a period of public
comment, would be finished by Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela set an Aug. 5
execution date for convicted killer Juan Raul Garza, ordering the
43-year-old inmate to be executed by injection at 6 a.m. in the
federal death chamber in Terre Haute, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Prisons and Justice Department officials wanted
the court to delay scheduling the execution until they could finish
reviewing the draft of a detailed technical manual about the manner
of conducting the execution, including rules for last-minute
clemency appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge set execution date anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, there are at least three ways the government could stop
or delay the execution: Government lawyers could persuade a federal
appeals court to delay the execution. President Clinton could
commute Garza's sentence to less than death. Or the president could
grant Garza a temporary reprieve while his case or his appeal for
clemency is further considered.
</P>
<P>
   The last reprieve was granted in 1937 by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt. Typically, reprieves merely postpone the sentence for 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Garza was convicted in Brownsville, Texas, in August 1993 for
killing three men between April 1990 and January 1991. A 10-count
indictment named him as the boss of a drug ring that imported tons
of marijuana into the United States between 1983 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Garza told a reporter for The Associated Press in 1994: ''I
didn't kill any of these people. ... I got the shaft.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Veto Bankruptcy Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time this month, President
Clinton threatened Thursday to veto legislation rewriting the
bankruptcy laws that he contends is unfair to ordinary debtors.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to congressional leaders, Clinton said he believes
the legislation, which lawmakers have been tinkering with for weeks
behind closed doors, still lacks the needed balance of protecting
deserving debtors while also stemming abuses of the bankruptcy
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to sign a balanced consumer bankruptcy bill that
would encourage responsibility and reduce abuses of the bankruptcy
system on the part of debtors and creditors alike,'' he wrote. ''We
can target the abuses without placing unnecessary barriers before
those in need of a fresh start who turn to bankruptcy as a last
resort.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed differing versions of the
legislation, which would make it harder for people to sweep away
their debts in bankruptcy proceedings. Both bills cleared with
veto-proof margins, but reconciling the differences between the
two, for a final vote by the two chambers, has been an arduous task
for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said their negotiations have produced a measure that
''has lost some of the balance that the Senate bill had tried to
achieve, albeit imperfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I will veto the bill that we understand the Republicans plan
to forward to my desk. But I continue to urge Congress to
reconsider and send me a fair bill that meets the test of
balance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a chief sponsor of the
legislation, called Clinton's letter an ''obstructionist tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to continue putting the best legislation together
that we can because there is such broad, bipartisan support for
reforming the system,'' Grassley said. ''In fact, the level of
support is so strong, when the dust settles, the White House might
conclude that a veto would be unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who has used his senatorial
power to hold up the bankruptcy legislation, said the renewed veto
threat will strengthen its opponents in Congress. ''I look forward
to working with the president to defeat it,'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would apply new standards for determining
whether people filing for bankruptcy should be forced to repay
their debts under a court-approved reorganization plan instead of
having them dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   It has been pushed by banks, credit card companies and other
consumer-credit businesses, but has raised protests recently from
consumer advocates, unions, women's groups and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton renewed his objection to a provision that would exempt
debt collectors from current law prohibiting harassment of debtors
if they are trying to collect on bounced checks that have been
outstanding for 30 days or more. Creditors would be allowed to use
tactics such as late-night telephone calls to debtors and repeated
dunning over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he also was concerned that the legislation
doesn't adequately crack down on wealthy debtors who use homestead
exemptions in some states to shield their assets from creditors in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unfair to leave this loophole for the wealthy in
place,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton said he was disturbed by ''inadequate'' language in
a provision that would prohibit people found to have violated laws
protecting abortion clinics from using bankruptcy proceedings to
escape fines and civil judgments.

<HEADLINE> Traficant Plans To Back Republican  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant of Ohio said
Thursday he'll break ranks and vote to keep a Republican, Rep.
Dennis Hastert, as speaker of the House next year -- a pledge that
complicates his own party's bid to gain control in the fall
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the nationally syndicated ''Hannity &AMP;
Colmes'' radio program, the maverick eight-term Democrat said
''Hastert's a good man and I'm going to vote for for him for
speaker and I don't give a damn who knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote for speaker is the first major roll call taken when a
new Congress convenes in January. The party that wins that vote
controls the flow of legislation to the floor for the next two
years and appoints chairmen of all committees and subcommittees.
</P>
<P>
   If Traficant follows through, Democrats would have to win seven
seats in November; right now, they're only six seats behind.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt's office had no comment
about Traficant's remark. If Democrats gain a majority of House
seats, Gephardt would be in line to become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant's statement came a day after Hastert, an Illinois
congressman, signed off on a huge plum for the Democrat from
Poland, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert agreed to allow some $30 million to be earmarked in a
supplemental appropriations bill for a convention center project in
Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   The entire kitty for lawmakers' special projects in that bill
was roughly $100 million, and it was viewed as part of the
courtship of Traficant that Hastert allotted such a large portion
of it to a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Traficant is no ordinary Democrat. He has been flirting with
party-switching for years, negotiating what he can for his Rust
Belt district and keeping leaders of both parties guessing. He also
has a record of getting bills and amendments through Republican-led
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Traficant did something unthinkable for any
other Democrat. While other members of his party were salivating at
the prospect of being able to run campaign ads blasting Republicans
for refusing to raise the minimum wage, Traficant went to a
GOP-only meeting and advised Republicans to support a minimum wage
bill lest they lose the House majority.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant doesn't participate in many events with his fellow
Ohio lawmakers, but has many good one-on-one relationships. During
his primary battle this spring, three Republican colleagues signed
a letter supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant later complained that officials of his own party sided
against him in that primary. Democratic leaders denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes, and I think rightly so, that the leadership of
his party hung him out to dry in his recently concluded primary,''
March 7, said Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-0hio.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant is approaching the end of his eighth term in the House
amid uncertainty over his future. He has always been a popular
political figure in eastern Ohio's 17th Congressional District, but
a series of federal subpoenas has led him to declare that he
expects to be indicted as part of a wide-ranging Youngstown
corruption probe.

<HEADLINE> British Oarsman Tries Pacific Cross  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A flotilla of local fisherman from the
southern coastal town of Ilo paddled alongside British rower Jim
Shekhdar on Thursday as he embarked on a solo voyage across the
Pacific to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Shekhdar, 53, plans to cross 8,500 miles of ocean in an odyssey
that he hopes will take less than six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel apprehensive and anxious to go,'' he told The
Associated Press by phone before climbing into his
technology-packed, 23-foot boat, the Le Shark. ''I just want to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If successful, Shekhdar will claim the longest, coast-to-coast
solo crossing of the Pacific on record, according to the
London-based Ocean Rowing society.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, the management consultant for the European
Union completed a 3,013-mile, two-man rowing voyage across the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   This journey comes nearly three months after another British
oarsman and a French rower each had to be rescued during similar
solo crossing attempts of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In early April, a Coast Guard plane reached Andrew Halsey about
1,200 miles southeast of Hawaii. That rescue came three days after
French rower Jo Le Guen was retrieved one-third of the way into his
attempted 5,580-mile Pacific crossing. Eight of his toes had to be
amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Shekhdar said he's carrying an eight-month supply of food,
satellite positioning equipment, communications devices, and a
satellite phone to keep in contact with his wife and two daughters
in England.

<HEADLINE> Youth Is Served at NBA Draft  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson had
ditched their expensive suits for T-shirts by the early morning
hours Thursday as they walked together along the downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   The two youngsters already have shared an apartment in Chicago,
and they'll be seeing a lot more of each other in the years ahead
as teammates with the Los Angeles Clippers -- the team that emerged
as the big winner in the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody always gets a chance to start over. This here is a
golden opportunity for a lot of young guys,'' Richardson said,
''and we'll get a chance to go in there and start something
sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers acquired Miles, Richardson, Corey Maggette, Derek
Strong and Keyon Dooling through the draft and trades to restock a
roster that has gone through annual defections, as the low-rent
franchise remained mired in a losing mode.
</P>
<P>
   But things should be different next season for the Clippers, who
suddenly are a lot better and a lot younger.
</P>
<P>
   Miles is 18, and Richardson, Maggette and Dooling, a point guard
from Missouri whom the Clippers acquired from Orlando, are all 20.
Theirs were some of the baby faces on display during a draft night
that furthered the trend of the NBA getting younger and younger.
</P>
<P>
   After senior Kenyon Martin of Cincinnati was selected first, the
next 10 picks were underclassmen. In all, 19 first-rounders were
underclassmen or high school players, breaking the record of 17 set
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game's getting younger and younger,'' said Michigan's
Jamal Crawford, who played less than one full year with the
Wolverines and was taken by the Cavaliers at No. 8, then traded to
the Bulls for Texas junior Chris Mihm, the seventh pick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will continue to get that way,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the staid, old Utah Jazz got in on the act, drafting high
schooler DeShawn Stevenson of Fresno, Calif., who got into a brawl
involving 20 youths at a gymnasium shortly after he was drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Lopez, a school custodian who saw the fight, said
Stevenson was jumped.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got punched and then landed some punches of his own,'' he
said. ''Then four of them chased (Stevenson) up in the stands and
beat on him before he got away.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was escorted to his new Lexus SUV as some of the
combatants gave chase.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, 19, will have a chance to take over the shooting
guard spot being vacated in Utah by Jeff Hornacek. Stevenson's
competition for the spot will come from second-year pro Quincy
Lewis, perhaps the most babyfaced player in the NBA, who was
coincidentally in attendance Wednesday night at the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Besides taking Stevenson with the 23rd pick, Utah holds rights
to 6-9 Russian forward Andrei Kirilenko, a skinny 19-year-old
drafted in the first round last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't usually taken these gambles,'' coach Jerry Sloan
said. ''We've always tried to be a little more secure, but we're in
a position now where the structure of our team has changed almost
completely for what it's going to be down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Another team making a bold move -- or a series of them -- was the
Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando jettisoned two of its three lottery picks, along with
Maggette and Strong, to position the team $21 million under the
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando can now go out and sign two maximum-salaried free agents
from a list that includes Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Eddie Jones,
Tracy McGrady and Jalen Rose. Teams can begin negotiating with free
agents Saturday but can't sign them until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Without the extra cap room, the Magic would have been forced to
try to work out a sign-and-trade deal with one of the teams that
will be losing one of their stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might have been able to sign two free agents before, but
the sign-and-trade thing would have come into play. It would have
been tougher,'' Magic coach Doc Rivers said. ''We have the money
now to go out and get it done.''

<HEADLINE> Met Hamilton's Rehab on Hold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- New York Mets outfielder Darryl
Hamilton, sidelined by a toe injury, has left the team's St. Lucie
farm club to see a doctor in California.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, out since the first week of the season, played his
first minor league rehab game Wednesday, going 1-for-3 as the
designated hitter in St. Lucie's 10-8 loss to Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure everything is fine with it until we take
it to the next level,'' Hamilton said. ''They want me to see the
doctor who performed the surgery. He'll make the decision as to
whether it's OK or not and we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was lifted for a pinch hitter when he was slated to
come to the plate for his fourth at-bat Wednesday. St. Lucie
manager Dave Engle said Hamilton was replaced because he needed to
pick up a new prescription from a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not on a timetable,'' Hamilton said. ''I'm kind of taking
it easy and making sure everything is fine because I don't want to
come back too soon to where I'd have to go on the DL again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton split last season with Colorado and New York, hitting
.339 in 55 games for the Mets.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 7, Angels 2  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- John Olerud hit two homers to drive in three runs
as the Seattle Mariners moved into first place in the AL West by
beating the Anaheim Angels 7-2 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud's second homer, a two-run shot to center off Kent
Bottenfield (4-7), broke a 2-2 tie in the sixth inning. It came
after Bottenfield hit Edgar Martinez with a pitch, his second hit
batter of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Javier put the game out of reach with a two-run homer off
Mark Petkovsek in the seventh. Robert Machado hit a solo homer off
Derrick Turnbow in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, signed as a free agent by the Mariners in December after
helping the New York Mets get into the playoffs last season, had
his 12th career two-homer game.
</P>
<P>
   Extending their club-record streak by winning their eighth
series in a row, the Mariners grabbed sole possession of the
division lead for the first time since June 2, as Oakland lost to
Texas 3-1 Thursday. Seattle finished its best-ever 10-game
homestand at 8-2 to push its June record to 19-7.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Paniagua (1-0) replaced Seattle starter Gil Meche in the
sixth and gave up an RBI groundout to Troy Glaus to tie the score.
He then walked two, one intentionally, before getting Benji Gil to
ground out with the bases loaded to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave Seattle a 1-0 lead with an RBI single in the first
and Anaheim tied the score in the third on Orlando Palmeiro's RBI
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud hit his sixth home run of the season in the fourth to put
the Mariners ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield gave up four runs on six hits and one walk in 5 2-3
innings
</P>
<P>
   Meche went 5 1-3 innings, allowing two runs on five hits and
three walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With starter Dan Wilson sidelined and backup Tom Lampkin
out for the season with a torn ligament in his right elbow, the
Mariners are looking for some catching help -- but not a No. 1
catcher. ''We've got a number one catcher,'' manager Lou Piniella
said before Thursday's game. ''We're looking to get an experienced
catcher who can hit the ball from the left side. Truthfully, we can
use a left-handed bat.'' Wilson has been on the disabled list since
June 15 with a pulled muscle in his side. He began throwing
Wednesday and is expected back after the All-Star game. Lampkin
will have ligament replacement surgery Friday. The Mariners' top
catcher right now is Joe Oliver, 34. ... Mariners RHP Freddy
Garcia, who has been on the DL since April 22 with a hairline
fracture of his right tibia, will make a rehabilitation start for
Tacoma on Saturday against Colorado Springs. He made two
rehabilitation starts for Class A Everett. ... Olerud had his first
two-homer game since April 18, 1999, against Montreal. ...
Bottenfield has lost four of his last five decisions, including two
in a row since coming off the DL last Saturday. He was sidelined
with tendinitis in his right shoulder. In his last seven starts,
he's given up 12 home runs. ... Mariners CF Mike Cameron threw out
Darin Erstad at the plate for a double play after catching Tim
Salmon's fly ball in the first inning.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Packer Craig Newsome Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- Former NFL cornerback Craig Newsome was
charged Thursday with using a false drug prescription to obtain a
painkiller.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome, 28, who has been coaching the La Crosse River Rats of
the Indoor Football League, was charged with one count of obtaining
a controlled substance by fraud, a felony that carries a maximum
six years in prison and a $30,000 fine upon conviction
</P>
<P>
   ''He went to a pharmacy with a prescription in the name of
another individual. He gave it to them and got the drug, Lortab,''
La Crosse County Assistant District Attorney Todd Bjerke said.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription was for 100 tablets of Lortab, and a Shopko
pharmacist filled it Sunday before becoming suspicious and
contacting Newsome's doctor, who said he did not recognize the
woman's name and never wrote a prescription for her, the criminal
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   A police search of Newsome's La Crosse apartment Wednesday found
''various prescription drugs,'' some of which had been prescribed
for Newsome and his wife but some that were in the name of another
person, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the charge against Mr. Newsome is serious, it alleges
that he improperly obtained a prescription medicine often used to
treat severe pain,'' said James Kroner, Newsome's attorney. ''This
case does not have anything to do with the use or distribution of
illicit drugs. Calling this a drug bust as some in the press have
done is misleading and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroner declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome, who spent last season with San Francisco after four
years with Green Bay, was released from the La Crosse County Jail
on Wednesday night after posting $5,000 bond, said sheriff's Sgt.
Steven Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Michael Mulroy set July 27 for a status hearing,
Bjerke said.
</P>
<P>
   River Rats general manager Lee Snapp said Thursday that Newsome
has been ''relieved of his duties'' as coach. Snapp said offensive
coordinator John Schimon will serve as coach for the River Rats'
remaining game July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned about his family and his future and are
hoping everything works out for him,'' Snapp said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no telephone listing for Newsome in the La Crosse area
when The Associated Press tried to reach him for comment.

<HEADLINE> Assembly postpones vote on massive school construction bill  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey schools will have to wait a
little longer for state funds to pay for new or renovated
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   While the state Senate on Thursday approved a multibillion
dollar school construction bill that includes last minute changes
made by Gov. Christie Whitman, the Assembly postponed scheduled
action.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins complained earlier in the day that
his members had no time to read Whitman's changes, which were
delivered late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But senators, who received the governor's suggested changes at
the same time as the Assembly, needed no extra time. They voted
38-0 to accept the new version and send it back to the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which includes $6 billion for the state's 30
so-called special needs districts and $2.6 billion for all other
New Jersey schools, is now scheduled for Assembly action July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Once signed, the bill is designed to satisfy a state Supreme
Court order that the state provide full funding to repair or
replace crumbling schools in the special needs districts. But the
state has already missed the court's ''spring 2000'' deadline for
new construction projects to commence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, districts will receive a minimum 40 percent
state grant for their construction projects, with the poorest
schools receiving 100 percent funding.
</P>
<P>
   State borrowing would be capped at $8.6 billion, although
lawmakers could appropriate more if they need to.
</P>
<P>
   But to the dismay of some Assembly Republicans, Whitman stripped
the Legislature of any veto power over individual school projects,
a change endorsed by the Senate Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This and other changes were part of Whitman's conditional veto
of the original bill, which previously passed both houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The program must be legally sufficient so that it meets
constitutional requirements,'' Whitman said in her veto message to
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   She also expressed concerns about the cost of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''If costs are permitted to expand beyond what is fiscally
sound, the program will become unsustainable, benefitting no one,''
her message said.
</P>
<P>
   To control costs, the governor included construction ''soft
costs'' such as design work and site acquisition in a set $138 per
square foot allowance that the state will fund. These costs were
previously outside the allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes among the myriad in her 52-page veto message
included adding preschool construction costs to the program, and
allowing community development projects around new schools in six
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Collins told reporters his members did not feel ''comfortable''
voting on such a comprehensive set of changes soon after being
briefed on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is, my members just walked in 40 minutes ago, and
I don't think they're ready to vote on the state's largest building
project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people want us to make sure we do it right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker predicted that the bill will eventually pass, but he
declined to say whether he will support it. He said he was
particularly concerned about the decision to deny him oversight of
the projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think any time the Legislature is denied powers that are
rightfully theirs, that rankles me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough said Collins is expecting
too much. The Supreme Court would not allow legislative tinkering
with the mandatory full funding for the poor districts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the court order. It's pretty clear that the districts
need to be funded at 100 percent. Putting roadblocks in the way is
probably a violation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, who sponsored the bill in the
Senate, said he was not concerned that the Assembly was delaying
final passage past the court deadline.
</P>
<P>
   He sidestepped questions about whether Collins may be playing
political games with Senate President Donald DiFrancesco. Both the
Assembly speaker and the Senate president are likely 2001
gubernatorial candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding is, he's calling the Assembly back into
session. That sounds like good faith to me,'' Gormley said. ''The
best jockeying is to get the bill passed.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco confessed he did not know what Collins was up to. He
also said he does not fear that the bill may be derailed in the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   A two week delay ''should not make a difference to the passage
or implementation of the bill,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Draftee in Fight in H.S. Gym  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLOVIS, Calif. (AP) -- DeShawn Stevenson got into a brawl at a
gym shortly after the high school star was drafted in the first
round by the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old guard was in the middle of a fight involving 20
youths following a high school all-star game Wednesday night,
witnesses told the Fresno Bee.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was punched during the melee and was able to get to
his car and drive away, the newspaper said. Witnesses said police
arrived and placed two men in a squad car.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson arrived at the gym after halftime. He signed
autographs, shook hands with fans and sat in the center of the
bleachers to watch the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Lopez, a school custodian who saw the fight, said
Stevenson was jumped.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got punched and then landed some punches of his own,'' he
said. ''Then four of them chased (Stevenson) up in the stands and
beat on him before he got away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez and a second witness, Will Goldbeck, said Fresno City
College basketball coach Denny Aye escorted Stevenson to his new
Lexus SUV in the Buchanan High School parking lot as some of the
combatants gave chase.
</P>
<P>
   Aye declined to comment to the Bee and attempts to reach
Stevenson were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, David Allred, vice president of public
affairs for the Jazz, said the fight did not affect Stevenson's
standing with the team or the scheduled Thursday press conference
to introduce him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think DeShawn is the victim in this situation,'' Allred
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, a 6-foot-5 shooting guard, had signed with Kansas but
made himself eligible for the draft when it wasn't certain if he
would be eligible as a freshman. He was selected by the Jazz as the
23rd pick overall.
</P>
<P>
   Jayhawks coach Roy Williams has called Stevenson one of the most
gifted recruits he ever pursued. Last season, Stevenson averaged
30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds and 6.2 assists a game as a senior at
Washington Union High School.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan administrator Lemarr Treadwell also witnessed the fight
and told the Bee he saw Stevenson leave the gym with two
individuals in pursuit. One of those, according to Treadwell, was
ex-Clovis High School standout and Fresno State football recruit
Chris Sims, who played in the all-star game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris was put in a squad car, and one other man was put in a
squad car,'' Treadwell said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman at the Clovis Police Department, who declined to
identify herself, said she was not allowed to comment. She said a
report might be available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said four Clovis police cars arrived at the scene shortly
after Stevenson's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were several small fights going on at the same time all
over the gym,'' Lopez said.

<HEADLINE> Forest Svc. Can't Say If Goals Met  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency responsible for 192 million
acres of forests cannot say whether basic goals such as fire
prevention and stream cleanup are being met, government inspectors
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service's report last year on whether the agency met
its goals was based on flawed data, so there is no way to tell how
the service performed, the Agriculture Department's inspector
general said.
</P>
<P>
   The flawed report ''has likely reinforced the public perception
that the agency lacks credibility,'' the inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agency is still years away from providing the Congress and
the public with a clear understanding of what is being accomplished
with taxpayer dollars,'' said Jim Wells, the GAO's director of
energy, resources and science issues.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms came during a House Resources forests
subcommittee hearing on agency accountability. Forest Service
officials said progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
   A new version of a 1997 strategic plan, due in September, will
focus on issues such as land health and customer satisfaction
rather than past standards of roads built or minerals harvested,
said Vincette Goerl, the agency's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize we don't have it right yet and have a lot of room
for improvement,'' she told the subcommittee. ''But we will not
back away from strategic planning that is supported by
performance-based budgeting and performance accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's second-largest land manager has long been
troubled with financial problems. The inspector general concluded
in 1995 and 1997 that the agency's financial statements were
unreliable, and the General Accounting Office in 1999 placed the
Forest Service on its list of agencies at the highest risk of fraud
and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But while the agency has improved its finances, it lags in
performance accountability, investigators said. Agency leaders want
to do better, but the Forest Service culture needs to change and
field offices must improve, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said, for example, that while Forest Service officials
track the acres of land where they log and take other steps to
prevent fires, they do not measure whether they have actually
reduced the risk of fire to nearby communities.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general also said it found errors and omissions in
performance evaluations at each of four national forests it visited
as part of an audit.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, the Idaho Republican who chairs the
subcommittee, said the GAO findings come as the Forest Service ''is
probably suffering the worst customer satisfaction rating in its
history.''

<HEADLINE> Attorneys deliver closing arguments in Sands bankruptcy hearing  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN (AP) - Attorneys for Park Place Entertainment Corp. and
billionaire financier Carl Icahn delivered their closing arguments
Thursday in the Sands Casino Hotel bankruptcy case, wrapping up
several days of hearings over who should rescue the ailing casino.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Judith Wizmur announced she will
issue her decision on the competing plans to pull the Sands out of
Chapter 11 bankruptcy after July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place proposes spending $40 million on the property,
receiving 57.5 percent of the new stock in exchange. It would
provide bondholders with $128 million in new bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn plans to invest $65 million in property, receiving 46.3
percent of the new Sands stock. He would issue $110 million in new
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place attorney Michael Chertoff argued that Park Place
essentially is offering a merger or joint venture with the other
casinos it already operates, allowing the Sands to share costs and
providing it with new, experienced management.
</P>
<P>
   Chertoff characterized Icahn's proposal as a cash infusion that
keeps existing managers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Icahn plan provides more of a cash cushion, said his
attorney, Ed Weisfelner. He denied the argument that casinos must
be large to compete in Atlantic City, arguing that large Trump
casinos have been in and out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ''To hear them tell it you have to be out of your mind to have a
single property in Atlantic City,'' Weisfelner said. ''The notion
that bigger is always better ... is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisfelner also stressed that the Icahn plan has the support of
Sands management, as well as the 1,500 vendors who are owed $6.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place has the support of Merrill Lynch Asset Management,
which argued that the Sands is in a poor location and needs a good
management team.
</P>
<P>
   Because Park Place owns 28 casinos, including the three in
Atlantic City, it may face opposition from regulators on the Sands
acquisition. New Jersey casino law allows authorities to decide on
a case-by-case basis whether granting a license would result in
economic concentration.

<HEADLINE> Senate gives final OK to tax credit for the working poor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Poor working families will get a check in
the mail next year under a bill passed by the Senate on Thursday
and ready for the governor's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously with its vote to approve the state budget, the
Senate approved Gov. Christie Whitman's major budget proposal of
the year designed to assist low-income families by creating a tax
credit. The Assembly passed it last month.
</P>
<P>
   The program would provide checks similar to income-tax returns
totaling $48 million to 280,000 lower-income working families. Most
of the families are below the threshold for paying any state income
taxes now, but will be able to file income-tax returns to qualify
for the checks of up to $400.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation would be based in the federal Earned Income Tax
Credit, which increases federal tax deductions for the working
poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keeping more of what you earn is especially important to the
working poor, the people who go to work every day but don't earn
enough to make themselves economically sufficient,'' the governor
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, families earning $15,000 would get a check
from the state ranging from $196 to $338. Those earning between
$15,000 and $20,000 would get a credit of between $114 and $229
that would offset their total tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts would increase each year until the program is fully
implemented in 2003 at a cost of $106 million a year.

<HEADLINE> Suns Pick Arrives in Phoenix  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Iakovos ''Jake'' Tsakalidis arrived in Phoenix on
Thursday, some 18 hours after the Suns made him their first-round
pick in the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how long the 7-foot-2, 282-pound starting
center for Greece's national team can stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek club AEK, for whom the 21-year-old Tsakalidis has
played for since 1996, sent letters to all NBA teams before
Wednesday's draft warning they would not release him from his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix officials and Tsakalidis' representatives believe a
settlement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some uncertainty as to when Jake can join us in
uniform. The details have yet to be worked out,'' said Suns
president Bryan Colangelo, adding that the team is negotiating a
$350,000 buyout of Tsakalidis' contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely want to be here,'' said Tsakalidis, who speaks
limited English and let his agent, Bill Pollack, do most of his
talking during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jake has emphatically stated that he wishes to play here in
the NBA,'' Pollack said. ''Our job is to analyze exactly what legal
tasks are at hand and to come up with solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a complex problem because it involves different
schools of thinking. In 1996, Jake was still a youngster and they
asked him to sign a four-year contract. It was an amateur
basketball contract because he was underage. On June 10 of this
year, they tendered him a new five-year contract, a new unilateral
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't sign it. He didn't negotiate it. It was sort of like
it came in the mail. Greek law says you can do that. You can't do
it just about anywhere else. So we're going to find out about the
validity of the contract being tendered to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Costales, who was Tsakalidis' agent in Greece and now is
his interpreter, said the center told teammates he wanted to go to
the NBA two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't believe he would leave. They felt it would be too
much of a culture shock. They didn't think he would come to another
country where his knowledge of the language is not very good,''
Costales said. ''They kept telling him he was not ready for the
NBA. But the teams he worked out for believe he was, with a little
bit of work.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Suns think, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a unique talent,'' Dick Van Arsdale, Phoenix's vice
president for player personnel said of Tsakalidis, who averaged 9.2
points and 7.0 rebounds last season and shot 59 percent from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a tremendous upside because he hasn't played basketball
very long. He's very mobile for a big man and can play some
defense. We didn't think he'd be around (at No. 25 overall). The
only reason he dropped was because of the contract situation.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Family Care health insurance program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Senate on Thursday approved a
bill to bring health insurance coverage to 125,000 low-income and
working families.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, S-1467, passed by a 39-0 vote and now goes to the desk
of Gov. Christie Whitman, who made Family Care one of her
priorities for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The program would provide subsidized health insurance for
working New Jersey residents.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, applicants must be a parent or child caretaker whose
family income does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty
level, or a single adult or childless couple whose income does not
exceed 100 percent of the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Although KidCare, the children's insurance program, was slow to
get started in 1998, it has since built enrollment of children to
more than 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, officials have more robust forecasts for quick
enrollment in Family Care because many of the KidCare families are
already screened and qualified to enroll in the larger program.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's $21.5 billion budget for the new fiscal year includes
$80 million for Family Care, with additional funding drawn from
federal matching funds and the state's share of the national
tobacco settlement.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Rally For Political Future  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- A referendum to gauge support for a
political system credited with creating stability but criticized as
undemocratic drew a reportedly light voter turnout Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The nonbinding ballot question asked voters whether they
supported President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement
or wanted a multiparty system. Traditional political parties,
allowed to exist in name only, called for a boycott of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comment on the vote, Museveni said Thursday
if his Movement received less than 60 percent of the vote, he would
consider changing Uganda's political system.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are no problems in the organization of the elections
or natural causes like rain preventing all the registered voters
from casting their ballots, and the Movement gets less than 60
percent, I will know there is a serious problem with the Movement
system,'' Museveni told the Integral Regional Information Network,
a U.N. information service.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we shall make a judgment after looking at the results and
the voter turnout,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The private Central Broadcasting Station radio reported a
generally low turnout nationwide. Some polling stations in Kampala
said only half the registered voters on their lists had turned up.
</P>
<P>
   The 16,500 polling stations closed at 5 p.m., and vote counting
got under way immediately. Results are to be announced by Saturday.
The Electoral Commission said 9.6 million voters had registered in
the country of 22 million.
</P>
<P>
   News media reported a higher turnout in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Uganda, where an estimated 700,000 people have been
displaced by a long-running rebellion, the turnout was reported to
be extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed little doubt, however, that most Ugandans are
likely to stick with Museveni's Movement, credited for the longest
period of peace and economic prosperity since Uganda's independence
from Britain in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In groups of 10 and 20, voters lined up under intermittent rain
at churches, schools and hospitals in Kampala, to pick out their
names on long lists, then take a ballot and circle the yellow bus
to show they favored the Movement or the sky-blue dove to
demonstrate their wish to return to a multiparty system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not mature yet for the multipartyism,'' said a
45-year-old civil servant who asked not to be named as he cast his
ballot in favor of Museveni's National Resistance Movement. ''I'm
not so young not to remember what the past was like.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Uganda's recent, bloody history would seem to play
in the Movement's -- and Museveni's -- favor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Idi Amin ousted the corrupt, repressive regime of
President Milton Obote. But things fell apart for Amin after he
expelled more than 70,000 people of Indian background who were the
country's economic mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   Amin's forces killed at least 200,000 people and were only
stopped by the intervention in 1979 of the Tanzanian army -- and
Ugandan exiles including Museveni. They restored Obote to power in
what turned out to be nearly another decade of chaos and terror
that ended only when Museveni and his movement won a five-year bush
war in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Museveni was elected president over two other
candidates and has presided over a remarkable transformation of the
economy and an overall improvement in human rights and press
freedom.

<HEADLINE> Conectiv may build power plant on site of Roebling factory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLORENCE, N.J. (AP) - Conectiv, the state's third-largest
utility, said earlier this month it is considering building a $300
million power plant on the site of the abandoned John A. Roebling
Steel Works.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Delaware-based utility presented the Florence
Township Redevelopment Agency with preliminary plans to build two
gas-fired power plants on the 200-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   The Roebling factory has been empty since 1982. It was declared
a federal Superfund site in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Conectiv, which serves 473,000 customers in eight southern New
Jersey counties, said it wants to build two 500-megawatt plants on
about 75 acres. A third of those acres would serve as a buffer.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Conectiv, said Thursday that
the utility presented a proposal with the flexibility to build a
second plant on the site. The company's immediate plans call for
one combustion turbine generating station to be built, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conectiv is looking at several locations from New Jersey to
Virginia, but it hasn't picked one yet. Roebling is a favorable
prospect, she said, because of its proximity to the Delaware River
for cooling and nearby railways for fuel delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The utility needs township officials to sign a letter of intent
before it can proceed with preliminary studies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was met with displeasure from residents
who wanted restaurants and retail shops to be built there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was shocked,'' resident Marlyn Argast told The Courier-Post
of Cherry Hill. ''I don't think we're going to be able to do the
kinds of things at this site we had hoped to do, like put
restaurants in. You know no one is going to want to have dinner
where a plant is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to keep an open mind,'' said planning board member
Colleen Carney. ''But I think It's going to be a hard sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Conectiv should make a final decision by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Congress Preparing Relief Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders broke through a final
snag on Thursday and lawmakers prepared to vote on an emergency
package bearing billions for Colombia's drug war, the Pentagon and
storm victims at home.
</P>
<P>
   Months in the making, the $11.2 billion measure seemed likely to
get House approval on Thursday. The Senate planned to follow suit
by Friday, when Congress' Fourth of July break is scheduled to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget director Jack Lew signaled that President
Clinton would probably sign the measure, telling reporters, ''The
most terrible, most objectionable provisions appear to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The last impasse was broken after House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., relented and agreed to keep language lifting food sanctions
against Cuba off the bill. Senate opponents who said it did not
liberalize trade enough had threatened to derail the entire
spending bill unless it was free of the sanctions language.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuba provision, worked out earlier this week between
farm-state and anti-Castro lawmakers, will now wait for inclusion
in the final version of an agriculture spending bill later this
summer, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the emergency package was $1.3 billion to help
Colombia battle drug producers and their heavily armed guerrilla
allies, who control much of the southern part of the country.
Clinton and Hastert made that aid a priority as part of an effort
to stanch the flow of Colombian cocaine and heroin into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money is for purchasing 60 Blackhawk and Huey
helicopters for the Colombians, training and equipping
counternarcotics battalions, and intelligence activity. There would
also be money for human rights programs in Colombia, for Bolivia,
Ecuador and other nearby countries and for U.S. aircraft performing
anti-drug surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But the election-year bill was also packed with hundreds of
millions of dollars for lawmakers' home districts.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of U.S. Senate candidates -- Reps. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and
Bob Franks, R-N.J. -- had projects to boast about. Lazio was
trumpeting $6 million for homeless shelters nationwide, part of
which was going for a veterans' shelter in Buffalo, N.Y. Franks won
$41 million for New Jersey communities damaged by floods spawned by
last September's Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   There was also $500,000 to extend a bicycle path in the northern
Virginia district of Rep. James Moran, D-Va.; $1 million to repair
a federal hurricane-chaser plane based in the Tampa district of
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.; and $5
million to continue work on a sealife institute in Seward, Alaska,
home state of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., top Democrat on the Appropriations
Committee, won $25 million for a federal firearms training center
and $7 million for Army research on computer security, both in his
home state. And there is $16 million to clean up uranium processing
plants in Kentucky and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., won
language clearing the way for the $273 million Lewis and Clark
rural water system, which will serve the southeastern portion of
the state. The bill only supplied $600,000 for a study.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also included $2 billion to repay the Pentagon for the
costs of 5,700 U.S. members of the NATO peacekeeping team in
Kosovo. There was also $4.4 billion more for fuel, health care and
other Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there was $661 million for rebuilding from the
government-set fires that ravaged Los Alamos, N.M., and about $360
million to help North Carolina and other states recover from last
September's Hurricane Floyd and other agricultural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed a $5.2 billion package at the beginning of the
year, and the House approved its own $13 billion version in March.
But the bill ground to a halt in the Senate, where Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said it threatened to grow too large.
</P>
<P>
   But steady pressure for action was applied by Colombian
President Andres Pastrana and the Pentagon, which was facing budget
shortfalls because of the expenses of deploying U.S. troops as
peacekeepers in Kosovo. GOP leaders decided two weeks ago to try
finishing the bill before July.

<HEADLINE> Two physicians indicted in sexual assaults on European tourists  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan physician has been indicted on
charges of drugging and sodomizing two female European tourists and
second doctor has been indicted for allegedly hindering the
prosecution of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Selim Can Alkoc, 29, a psychiatry resident at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, met the 21-year-old women in Canada and
invited them to his West 59th Street apartment where, on May 23, he
allegedly drugged, raped and sodomized them, said Barbara Thompson
of the Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, said Thompson, the women filed complaints
against Alkoc. Medical exams showed that the women, both
Scandinavian, had been physically injured in ways consistent with
sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, a Manhattan grand jury indicted Alkoc on charges of
rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and assault, Thompson said. She said
Alkoc fled to his native Turkey before he was arrested or indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a St. Luke's-Roosevelt anesthesiology resident, Dr.
Turker Sengul, 28, was indicted on charges of hindering prosecution
and tampering with evidence, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Sengul, who lived in the same hospital-subsidized
building as Alkoc, helped his colleague and countryman collect
mail, get clothing from his apartment and even carried Alkoc's
pager to mislead police.
</P>
<P>
   A court complaint says Sengul admitted to a prosecutor that the
day after Alkoc was indicted, he went to Alkoc's apartment to
remove several videotapes hidden under a bed and in a vacuum
cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The court complaint says Sengul also admitted that, at Alkoc's
direction, he took video equipment and a computer from the
apartment. A law enforcement source who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the tapes show Alkoc in sexual encounters with other
women who appeared to be drugged.
</P>
<P>
   Sengul was arrested June 15 and released on $20,000 bail. After
his arraignment Thursday, he was jailed without bail pending a
hearing Friday. Prosecutors said they feared he, too, might flee to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But Alkoc's lawyer, Brian Perskin, said his client had not fled.
He said Alkoc had not been charged with anything two weeks after
the Swedish women complained to police, so he moved back to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Perskin said he believes extraditing Alkoc will be difficult if
not impossible because he is a Turkish national.
</P>
<P>
   Sengul's lawyer, Al Brackley, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mandler, spokesman for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, said Alkoc and
Sengul were suspended without pay pending the outcome of the
investigation. Meanwhile, he said, the hospital is cooperating with
the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The top charges against Alkoc, rape and sodomy in the first
degree, are punishable by up to 25 years in prison. The charges
against Sengul - hindering prosecution and tampering with evidence
- carry prison terms of up to four years.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Moves To Isolate Hostage-Takers  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Gunmen holding 27 Fijian lawmakers hostage
briefly detained 16 journalists Thursday after the army spoke of
plans to cut water, electricity and telephone lines to the besieged
compound
</P>
<P>
   Guards armed with machine guns stopped the journalists from
leaving the parliamentary compound where the government hostages,
including deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, are being held.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, the journalists were released, but the incident
has raised fears the gunmen might try to take more hostages in the
government crisis now in its sixth week in the Pacific island
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It actually marks a dangerous escalation in this business,''
said Michael Field, a reporter for Agence France-Presse who was
among those held. Nine of the detained journalists were from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The incident followed an announcement by Fiji's military rulers
that they planned to cordon off Parliament to isolate and cut off
supplies to the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People moving freely at any moment will have to be stopped,
media will have to be stopped,'' army spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo
Tarakinikini told Fiji TV. He said officials were considering
cutting water, electricity, and telephone lines to the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday evening, there was no evidence that any of the
measures had been put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Before relenting, rebel leader George Speight said it would be
too dangerous for the journalists to go back to their homes and
hotels because of the army presence outside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which declared martial law 10 days after Speight
and six gunmen stormed Parliament on May 19, had never threatened
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   During Speight's news conference Thursday, he said that if the
parliament compound were cordoned off and supplies cut, the
hostages' safety could be jeopardized because rebel supporters
inside the compound would become ''very angry'' and might harm
them.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether his supporters might shoot indigenous Fijians
hostages, he replied: ''I would say they would start by shooting
our Indian brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cordon the area was to protect citizens'
''security'' and to make sure the rebels take no more captives,
army spokesman Capt. Eroni Volavola told The Associated Press
earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Volavola did not say if isolating the compound was a precursor
to further military action, but it appeared to raise the stakes in
the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after Fiji's military rulers said
they will appoint a new civilian government without any input from
the hostage-takers, who have demanded a role in the administration
before releasing their captives.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his supporters had been involved in selecting new
ministers but were frozen out of the process Wednesday after
refusing to sign an accord that would pave the way for the
immediate release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Tarakinikini said excluding Speight from the negotiations was
''the most pragmatic'' response to the crisis, which had caused
thousands of people to lose their jobs and resulted in ''the whole
country being held for ransom.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rebels' demands to disenfranchise Fiji's Indians
have been met, including the firing of Chaudhry and the elimination
of the country's 1997 multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels led by Speight, a former insurance executive, have said
the hostages would die in any attempted rescue. Chaudhry is the
first ethnic Indian to lead Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who says he represents the native Fijians, claims
Chaudhry favored Indians at the expense of the indigenous
population.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff has pitted Fiji's poor majority against its
relatively affluent Indian minority, whose ancestors were brought
to Fiji by English colonialists more than a century ago to work in
the country's rich sugar cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   About half the hostages are indigenous Fijian and half are
Indian. On Thursday, the rebels allowed the two groups to see each
other for the first time since they were taken hostage on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement
deploring ''both the hostage taking and efforts to deny political
rights to some citizens of Fiji.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the United States is ''considering a range of
steps in consultation with other nations that could have a serious
impact on Fiji.''

<HEADLINE> Still crazy after all these months: Rocker in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - New York Mets fan Mike Adler had waited since
last October to ask - actually scream - a question for John Rocker.
So when the loudmouth lefty went out to run windsprints Thursday
night, Adler was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't you show us respect?'' shouted Adler, proudly
wearing a Mets shirt. He was speaking for his fellow fans, but the
question applied to gays, immigrants, unwed mothers and most other
groups offended by Rocker's insensitive, inane remarks about New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker answered semi-pleasantly, autographed two baseballs, then
issued a public apology. But it did little to lower the level of
bile directed at the man Mets fans, among others, love to despise.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's apology, shown on Shea's giant screen in left-center
field, was greeted with lusty boos by the crowd. He went out to the
bullpen, with its special protective cover, without incident before
the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Rocker had taken a circuitous route to the ballpark.
With a quick wave and dead silence, he backed off his pledge to
mingle with the denizens of the No. 7 subway.
</P>
<P>
   He instead climbed into a black van to meet with representatives
of the players union, who encouraged him to stay off the train. He
returned to his hotel before heading out to Shea Stadium in another
van with tinted windows.
</P>
<P>
   Once safely at the ballpark, he read a brief statement saying
the media has overstated his importance: ''I'm merely a baseball
player guys,'' he said, looking briefly into the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed riders of the Queens subway line instead turned out
at the ballpark to greet the pitcher turned poster boy for
insulting comments. One early arrival sported a sign declaring,
''Rocker Is Da Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to get booed, big time,'' warned Darwin Pena, 20,
who exited the subway wearing a No. 7 train T-shirt. ''People in
New York don't like being insulted. He might be dodging
batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   At a sparsely attended anti-Rocker rally beneath the subway,
demonstrators held signs proclaiming ''NYC Says No to RocKKKer''
and the less-imaginative ''Rocker's A Bigot.'' Among the
demonstrators were a half-dozen Queens Little Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to boo like crazy,'' promised Peter Verry, 17, who
wore a T-shirt with a suggestion that Rocker would undoubtedly
ignore. ''He's shown a lot of disrespect for people and for major
league baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The fastballer was dubbed ''The Ku Klux Kloser'' after his
racist, homophobic and xenophobic comments in Sports Illustrated
last December. This trip was his first to New York since last
fall's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rocker had promised to ride the subway to Shea Stadium,
wiser heads (and there are plenty) prevailed on the hurler to
choose a less public form of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good idea, given that Rocker had redefined political
incorrectness by describing straphangers on the No. 7 line as
''some kid with purple hair ... some queer with AIDS ... some
20-year-old mom with four kids.'' He also complained that New York
has too many foreigners and added: ''How the hell did they get in
this country?''
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of preparations were in place for the Shea return
of reliever Rocker, christened ''Johnny Rotten'' and ''Punk
Rocker'' by the New York tabloids. Despite the city's enmity toward
him, Rocker received the type of security ordinarily reserved for
heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to police at his hotel, 700 officers were assigned
to Shea instead of the 60 for most games - New York's finest to
protect Atlanta's swinest. There were police on bicycles and
horses, in vans and buses, in uniform and plainclothes.
</P>
<P>
   A limit on beer sales was imposed. A special protective cover
was erected over the Braves' bullpen in left field. During batting
practice, fans were barred from sitting in the first four rows
behind the Braves' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Walter McCaffrey, D-Queens, sent the Braves a
letter asking the team to donate its portion of the gate receipts
to defray the extra security costs. That could add up, since more
than 50,000 fired-up New Yorkers were expected at the game.
</P>
<P>
   There were already hints that the crowd could turn ugly, as some
fans recently handed out fliers on the No. 7 platform advertising
''John Rocker Battery Night.'' Fans were encouraged to bring and
fling their AAs to greet Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   In response, New York Mets officials promised a zero tolerance
policy against fans behaving badly in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The road trip to hell is just the latest in a series of
self-inflicted woes for Rocker: a suspension for his comments, his
threats against the writer of the SI piece, and a brief demotion to
the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hindsight being 20/20, I would've loved to have missed my
meeting with the Sports Illustrated reporter and I never would've
had to deal with the whole situation,'' Rocker told TBS. ''But then
again, that's the hand I've been dealt and I'll have to make the
best of it.''

<HEADLINE> Capitals Agree With Billington  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Craig Billington agreed to terms on a
three-year contract Thursday with the Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will pay the 33-year-old goalie $787,500 next season,
$827,000 in 2001-2002 and $868,000 in the final year.
</P>
<P>
   Billington recently finished his first season with Washington in
which he appeared in 13 games. He was 3-6-1 with a 2.75 GAA and
.910 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with No. 1 goalie Olaf Kolzig, the Washington duo had
the fourth lowest team GAA (2.33) in the NHL last season.
</P>
<P>
   Billington was acquired by the Capitals from Colorado on July
16, for future considerations. He has also played for New Jersey,
Ottawa and Boston in a 12-year career.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Upset Over Water Rules  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state lawmakers angry over proposed water
pollution regulations are taking out their frustration on a senior
official at the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment added to a USDA spending bill Thursday would cut
off funding, starting Oct. 1, for the office of James Lyons, USDA's
assistant secretary for natural resources. The amendment was
approved on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' critics say he didn't speak up for farm interests that
oppose a plan by the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up
polluted streams and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Agriculture deserves to have a voice and especially when
regulations are being developed,'' said Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark.,
who sponsored the amendment. Rep. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., said the
amendment would ''send a message'' to the administration that ''we
in Congress are going to continue to work to establish common sense
in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons did not return a telephone call Thursday. USDA spokesman
Andy Solomon said that Congress ''shouldn't make policy disputes
personal, which is what they appear to be doing in this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Thursday threatened to veto the spending bill
because it doesn't provide as much money as President Clinton
wanted for food safety and other programs. The House will not
finish action on the legislation until July.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday,
Lyons conceded that the EPA plan was so unpopular with farm
interests that it had become the ''new four-letter word in rural
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which the EPA intends to make final this summer,
would require states to submit plans within 15 years to clean up
every waterway that fails to meet water quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners would be required to get a pollution discharge permit
if the EPA found they were contributing to nearby water quality
problems and if a state had failed to draft an adequate plan for
improving water quality.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimates that there are more than 20,000 streams and
lakes that don't meet water-quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4461.

<HEADLINE> Fizer, Floyd Reunited With Bulls  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Before he ever played high school basketball,
Marcus Fizer had already made his choice of coaches. He wanted to
play for Tim Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   And now he gets that chance once again, reunited with the man
who recruited him and coached him at Iowa State for one year before
leaving for the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   While Fizer developed as one of college basketball's top
players, helping the Cyclones get within one win of the Final Four
last spring, Floyd suffered through his second season of one-sided
losses. His two-year NBA mark is just 30-102.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, selected fourth in Wednesday's NBA draft, wants to help
Floyd experience being a winner once more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's been completely frustrating to see him walk off
the court a lot of nights and understand how much it hurts to lose
so much,'' Fizer said of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I watched him wanting to win so bad and not having the
resources to do it. I could still see the fire burning in his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Bulls, Floyd's only losing season in 12 years
of college ball came in 1997-98 when the Cyclones finished 12-18 in
Fizer's freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to lose and one of biggest things that has weighed on
my heart and always made me feel down is that his first losing
season ever came with me playing for him. It has always been my
desire to come here and make up for that,'' Fizer said.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer became acquainted with Floyd before high school through
Floyd's wife, Beverly. Beverly Floyd's grandmother was in a nursing
home in Arcadia, La., and her caretaker was Sheila Frazier, Fizer's
guardian.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Floyd was the coach at New Orleans and when his
wife was showing her grandmother the school media guide one day,
Frazier asked what it was. Then she wanted to know if Beverly would
talk with Fizer, who at the time was a budding player.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the media guide and meeting the coach's wife, Fizer was
hooked immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''He apparently carried the media guide around like a bible for
four years,'' Floyd said. ''He always wanted to go play for me
because of Bev.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Fizer developed into a top college prospect with many
big-name schools recruiting him, his choice was simple when Floyd
called.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Coach you don't have to worry, I'm coming,''' Floyd
remembers. ''He turned down a lot of things from other schools to
come and so you feel this special bond. It was not a popular
decision for him at that time to go to Iowa State.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they are reunited and their relationship is close to
father-son. When Floyd gets tough on Fizer it won't be a big deal.
''We're close. He'll be able to handle it. We go back too far,''
Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Floyd challenged Fizer after he'd played in only a
couple of college games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said I thought he'd never be the player he could be if he
didn't rebound at a high enough level,'' Floyd said. ''Then he went
out the next game and got 21 rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Fizer, 6-foot-8 and 260 pounds, is leaner and stronger and
ready for the NBA after three years of college. He'll have to learn
the small forward role because his customary power spot is already
manned by Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
   But Fizer, who averaged 22.8 points last season, knows he can
change because his coach did, too.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd was a jacket-thrower on the sidelines during his college
days. In the NBA, he keeps his coat on most nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew he could do it if he really put his mind to it,'' Fizer
said with a laugh. ''At Iowa State it wasn't 30 or 40 seconds
before it came off. It's a little different at this level.''

Ecuador
past Peru 2-1 Thursday in a qualifying game for the 2002 World Cup.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chala initiated the scoring in the 14th minute with a
shoulder-high shot on a ball softly passed by Hurtado with his

</P>
<P>
   Hurtado scored the second goal in the 50th minute, taking
advantage of a bouncing free kick in front of the Peruvian net.

   After a listless first half in Quito, Peru came back to score
its lone goal in the 74th minute on a free kick by Nolberto Solano
that Juan Pajuelo nudged past goalie Jose Cevallos with his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador dominated the first half, demonstrating an orderly
offense, keeping the play in front of Peru's net. However, Ecuador
forward Agustin Delgado missed two clear opportunities to score.
</P>
<P>
   Peru came back in the second half after Ecuador coach Hernan
Dario Gomez pulled midfielder Alex Aguinaga and forwards Hurtado
and Agustin Delgado in the 70th minute.

<HEADLINE> Senate KOs Broad Gene Bias Measure  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Days after scientists announced the decoding
of the human genome, the Senate rejected Democratic legislation
Thursday that would let people sue for discrimination if genetic
information is misused in the workplace or by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, senators opted for a more narrow Republican version
focused only on limiting the way insurers and group health plans
can use such information. They said the broader bill needed more
study and could result in a raft of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue deserves and requires a thorough discussion in its
own forum,'' said Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who promised
comprehensive hearings in the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee he heads.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came on amendments to the annual appropriations bill
that funds the departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human
Services. President Clinton has threatened to veto the $352 billion
spending bill -- expected to pass Friday -- over spending levels and
for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did approve two competing ''lockbox'' provisions
aimed at preventing budget surpluses in the Medicare program from
being used for spending or tax cuts, which is similar to
legislation already passed by the House. Clinton praised the
Democratic version.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we make any other major budget decisions this year, we
should agree that Medicare funds should not be used to finance tax
cuts or other spending,'' he said in a statement Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The genetics votes followed this week's landmark announcement
that public and private researchers had essentially deciphered the
entire human genetic code, or genome. The breakthrough opens a new
universe of possibilities in preventative medicine but also raises
fears that private health information could be used to discriminate
against people prone to certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot take one step forward in science and two steps
backward in civil rights,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. ''Discrimination based on genetic factors is just
as unacceptable as that based on race, national origin, religion,
sex or disability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 54-44 along party lines to defeat Daschle's
proposal, which would prohibit employers from using genetic
information in hiring and workplace promotion or salaries. It also
would prevent insurance companies from basing coverage or premiums
on genetic information, from requiring such tests as to get
coverage and permit an individual to take discrimination claims to
court.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Senate opted by a 58-40 vote for Jeffords'
alternative setting up similar restrictions on use of genetic
information by insurance companies and group health plans but doing
nothing on workplace discrimination or a right to sue. Republicans
said the Democratic approach was hasty and would result in numerous
court claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't the right way to do it,'' said Sen. Mike Enzi,
R-Wyo. ''This becomes a turnstile for trial attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced before the overall spending bill even reached
the Senate floor that he would veto it, contending it would not
reduce class sizes by providing money he wants to hire 100,000 new
teachers and would not guarantee $1.3 billion in loans and grants
to repair crumbling schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Senate last week added another provision
opposed by the administration that would block Labor Department
rules giving workers new protections against repetitive motion
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4577.

<HEADLINE> Schools, other groups mull impact of gay Scout ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - One United Way group in New Jersey has
already cut off funding to the Boy Scouts of America over the youth
organization's rule barring gay troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that
free-association rights allow the Boy Scouts to legally exclude
homosexual Scoutmasters, other United Ways on Thursday were mulling
whether they should end or limit grants to their local Boy Scout
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, officials with groups representing New Jersey school
districts and municipalities were consulting attorneys on the issue
Thursday, but said they expect it will be left up to individual
schools and towns to decide whether they will still let Boy Scout
troops use their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' ''hollow victory'' will cost them support ''because
now the public will see them for what they are, an anti-gay
organization,'' said Lenora Lapidus, legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At the ACLU Lesbian &AMP; Gay Rights Project in New York, director
Matt Coles predicted the Boy Scouts will fade into obscurity within
a few years if they don't change the anti-gay policy. Coles said
schools and government agencies often give Scouts special deals
such as free camping not available to other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''In states that have passed anti-discrimination laws (such as
New Jersey), the government probably has to stop giving them
sweetheart deals,'' Coles said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, several officials said, how other groups and
government entities deal with the Boy Scouts' Supreme
Court-sanctioned discrimination - by severing their ties, doing
business as usual or something in between - will be determined in
state courts. They anticipate someone eventually will sue a school
district, for example, for either allowing or barring use of its
public facilities by a Boy Scout group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wouldn't be surprised to see legal actions by other
groups,'' said Steffanie Bell, a spokeswoman for Gov. Christie
Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state Attorney General's Office filed a brief with
the Supreme Court supporting the right of Eagle Scout James Dale to
be an assistant scoutmaster in Matawan, Bell said the governor is
not planning to issue any policy statement to guide schools or
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   However, spokesman Mike Yaple said the association plans to soon
send the state's 602 school districts an advisory saying that they
could continue renting space to Boy Scouts - and risk being
challenged in court - or adopt a policy on discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a school board wants to adopt a policy that says it will
not rent to any group that discriminates based on sexual
orientation, they'd be on very solid ground with that,'' Yaple
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month before the high court's ruling, United Way of
Somerset County ended 18 months of negotiations with the local Boy
Scout council by deciding to cut off all funding to the group as of
this month, according to president Robert Zdenek.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are now around 10 United Ways around the country that
are no longer affiliated with the Boy Scouts. We're the first in
New Jersey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a strong anti-discrimination policy'' requiring all 50
groups that receive funding to agree not to discriminate against
anyone on a number of factors, including sexual orientation, Zdenek
said. ''The Boy Scouts would not sign the policy because of the
sexual orientation provision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At United Way of Monmouth County, where the Dale case
originated, executive director Jim Bourque said the agency has
already approved a $39,000 allocation to the Scouts for the fiscal
year starting Saturday. He said the agency's board will discuss
what to do at its next meeting in August, when it should have legal
advice from attorneys with United Way of America.
</P>
<P>
   In Camden County, though, where the United Way has allocated
$70,000 to the Boy Scouts for the fiscal year beginning Saturday,
President Mike Moynihan said the board of directors is setting up a
task force to study the situation.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative would be limiting financial support to specific
programs open to everyone, such as the popular school-based
''Learning for Life'' program that teaches at-risk boys and girls
of all ages how to make good decisions in dealing with drugs,
gangs, violence and other problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be very careful and do what we feel is best for
the community,'' Moynihan said.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs final version of highway funding bill, but Assembly balks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Senate Thursday approved minor
revisions to a four-year, $3.75 billion program to fund road and
rail projects, but the Assembly postponed a vote for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With a special July session scheduled to deal with school
construction, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Democratic minority
leader Joe Doria, D-Hudson, agreed to wait on the Transportation
Trust Fund bill as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Trust Fund is the major agency that finances
$900 million a year in road and rail projects, and its funding
technically expires at midnight Friday. However, extra money
available from a voter referendum last November and some leftover
funds can keep the Trust Fund solvent for several extra months.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, Assembly and Whitman administration had been at odds
this spring over the funding and spending in the four-year package.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, the Trust Fund usually was fueled by a new
funding source like higher gasoline taxes. But this year the main
sponsor, Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, proposed diverting
money out of the existing budget and dedicating it to highways for
the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Republicans were concerned about the high spending, and
Whitman was concerned about tying up so much state revenue in
future budget years. Two years ago she had proposed a gasoline tax
increase, but lawmakers scuttled it.
</P>
<P>
   But these issues were resolved in the main bill. The snag
Thursday involved only a minor provision concerning how much
borrowed money could be used to pay for engineering and
professional staff costs in the design of projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday voted to comply with Whitman's veto
message, but the Assembly, receiving the document late, decided to
wait until July.

<HEADLINE> School: Arizona Guard Took Money  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Former University of Arizona All-America
point guard Jason Terry took more than $11,000 and other benefits
from agents after his junior year and as a senior, violating NCAA
rules, school officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the university has forfeited its only 1999 NCAA
basketball tournament game and will repay $45,362 to the NCAA, but
will not have to forfeit its regular-season games for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Pacific-10 Conference and the NCAA have accepted and
agreed with the university's self-imposed sanctions, after
completing their own investigations, athletic director Jim
Livengood said. Neither has recommended any additional sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Terry, now with the NBA's Atlanta Hawks, was chosen as a lottery
pick a year ago after being a 1999 first-team AP All-America as a
senior.
</P>
<P>
   He disclosed that he took more than about $4,500 from New York
sports agent Larry Fox after his junior year, Livengood said. Terry
also received about $7,000 from Ndidi Opia, a San Francisco agent,
while a senior, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Livengood said the violations made Terry ineligible for his
entire senior year.
</P>
<P>
   The university has forfeited its first-round, 61-60 NCAA
tournament loss to Oklahoma, and will pay back a 45 percent share
of its tournament television revenue, under NCAA requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But because a Pac-10 review found no evidence the university
knew about Terry's violations until afterward, forfeiture of the
entire 1998-99 schedule will not be necessary. It had initially
intended to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Terry has agreed to reimburse the university for the money to be
repaid to the NCAA, Livengood said.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone listings for Terry, Fox and Opia could not immediately
be found.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats coach Lute Olson said he talked earlier this month with
Terry, who conducted a week long basketball camp in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say he feels badly is an understatement,'' Olson said.
''There's no question about his feelings in terms of what he's done
to himself, primarily, but also the position that he placed the
basketball program in.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry knew that what he did was wrong, Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry will be ineligible for the university's sports hall of
fame and to have his jersey number retired, which Arizona now does
for players named national player of the year. Terry was voted that
honor by at least two organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted receiving cash, checks and wire transfers from Fox
and attended a fitness camp in Florida in August 1998 that Fox
arranged, but Terry never was billed for the airfare or camp fees,
Livengood said.
</P>
<P>
   Both agents have denied making payments to Terry, the university
said.
</P>
<P>
   Livengood said Terry and his mother, Andrea Cheatham, said Opia
also gave him legal advice without charge and had helped arrange
for catastrophic injury insurance, both considered preferential
treatment for a college athlete.
</P>
<P>
   The university began an 11-month investigation after Terry's
mother sent a letter to the National Basketball Players Association
on April 8, 1999, suggesting improprieties concerning extra
benefits for a student-athlete. A copy had been faxed to assistant
basketball coach Jim Rosborough three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Rosborough said he told NCAA investigators he first considered
the allegations ''flat-out, unequivocal hogwash. Pure baloney.''
Terry initially denied them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The university subsequently reprimanded Rosborough because he
waited about three days before notifying Livengood about the
letter. Rosborough acknowledged he should have notified Livengood
immediately.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Booed by Mets Fans  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets fan Mike Adler had waited since
last October to ask -- actually scream -- a question for John Rocker.
So when Atlanta's loudmouth lefty went out to run windsprints
Thursday night, Adler was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't you show us respect?'' shouted Adler, proudly
wearing a Mets shirt. He was speaking for his fellow fans, but the
question applied to gays, immigrants, women and most other groups
offended by Rocker's insensitive and inane remarks about New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker answered semi-pleasantly, autographed two baseballs, then
issued a public apology. But it did little to lower the level of
bile directed at the man Mets fans, among others, love to despise.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's apology, shown on Shea Stadium's giant screen in
left-center field before the start of the game between the Mets and
the Atlanta Braves, was greeted with lusty boos by the crowd. He
went out to the bullpen, with its special protective cover, without
incident before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Rocker had taken a circuitous route to the
ballpark. With a quick wave and dead silence, he backed off his
pledge to mingle with the denizens of the No. 7 subway.
</P>
<P>
   He instead climbed into a black van to meet with representatives
of the players' union, who encouraged him to stay off the train. He
returned to his hotel before heading out to Shea in another van
with tinted windows.
</P>
<P>
   Once safely at the ballpark, he read a brief statement saying
the media has overstated his importance: ''I'm merely a baseball
player guys,'' he said, glancing into the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed riders of the Queens subway line instead turned out
at the ballpark to greet the pitcher-turned-poster boy for
insulting comments. One early arrival sported a sign declaring,
''Rocker Is Da Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to get booed, big time,'' warned Darwin Pena, 20,
who exited the subway wearing a No. 7 train T-shirt. ''People in
New York don't like being insulted. He might be dodging
batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   At a sparsely attended anti-Rocker rally beneath the subway,
demonstrators held signs proclaiming ''NYC Says No to RocKKKer''
and the less-imaginative ''Rocker's A Bigot.'' Among the
demonstrators were a half-dozen Queens Little Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to boo like crazy,'' promised Peter Verry, 17, who
wore a T-shirt with a suggestion that Rocker would undoubtedly
ignore. ''He's shown a lot of disrespect for people and for major
league baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The fastballer was dubbed ''The Ku Klux Kloser'' after his
racist, homophobic and xenophobic comments in Sports Illustrated in
December. This trip was his first to Shea since last fall's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rocker had promised to ride the subway to the ballpark,
wiser heads -- and there are plenty -- prevailed on the hurler to
choose a less-public form of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good idea, given that Rocker had redefined political
incorrectness by describing straphangers on the No. 7 line as
''some kid with purple hair ... some queer with AIDS ... some
20-year-old mom with four kids.'' He also complained that New York
has too many foreigners and added: ''How the hell did they get in
this country?''
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of preparations were in place for the Shea return
of the reliever, christened ''Johnny Rotten'' and ''Punk Rocker''
by the New York tabloids. Despite the city's enmity toward him,
Rocker received the type of security ordinarily reserved for heads
of state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to police at his hotel, 700 officers were assigned
to Shea instead of the 60 for most games -- New York's finest to
protect Atlanta's swinest. There were police on bicycles and
horses, in vans and buses, in uniform and plainclothes.
</P>
<P>
   A limit on beer sales was imposed. A special protective cover
was erected over the Braves' bullpen in left field. During batting
practice, fans were barred from sitting in the first four rows
behind the Braves' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Walter McCaffrey asked the Braves to donate its
portion of the gate receipts to defray the extra security costs.
That could add up, since more than 50,000 fired-up New Yorkers were
expected at the game.
</P>
<P>
   There were already hints that the crowd could turn ugly, as some
fans recently handed out fliers on the No. 7 platform advertising
''John Rocker Battery Night.'' Fans were encouraged to bring and
fling their AAs to greet Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   In response, New York Mets officials promised a zero-tolerance
policy against fans behaving badly in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The road trip to hell is just the latest in a series of
self-inflicted woes for Rocker: a suspension for his comments, his
threats against the writer of the SI piece, and a brief demotion to
the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hindsight being 20/20, I would've loved to have missed my
meeting with the Sports Illustrated reporter and I never would've
had to deal with the whole situation,'' Rocker said in an interview
with TBS, which is owned by the same company that owns the Braves
and Sports Illustrated. ''But then again, that's the hand I've been
dealt and I'll have to make the best of it.''

<HEADLINE> Senate gives final approval to funds for Korean War memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Senate voted Thursday to put the
final $500,000 in place for a Korean War veterans memorial in
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will feature a 12-foot statue of a mourning soldier
clutching dog tags. To his left, two soldiers and a nurse will be
seen emerging through a sheet of water that cascades into a
reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
   Also planned is an eternal flame above a wall featuring the
names of the New Jersey people who died or were missing in action
during the conflict, which lasted from 1950 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ''This site is a place where family and friends can reflect upon
the sacrifices made by the men and women of our armed forces,''
said state Sen. Louis F. Kosco, R-Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   Private funds contributed to building the memorial, but
supporters fell $500,000 short.
</P>
<P>
   When the memorial was conceived several years ago, it was
originally hoped that it could be dedicated on June 25, the 50th
anniversary of the start of the war. But thanks to construction
delays and other problems, that target date could not be met.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the most recent delays, organizers do not have a date
scheduled, although they hope the memorial can be unveiled in the
fall.

<HEADLINE> FCC Nears Bell Long-Distance Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, for only the second time,
are on the verge of allowing a Bell company to offer long-distance
telephone service to its local customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is expected to approve the
bid by SBC Communications to provide long-distance in Texas, one of
the states within its local calling region.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has until Wednesday to issue its decision, but
experts have widely predicted that SBC would receive regulatory
approval, and on Thursday, a Texas House lawmaker said a majority
of the commissioners had approved the application.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said in a Thursday
afternoon press release that the commission had approved the deal.
Green said his office was notified early in the day that an
announcement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Green said other lawmakers, including Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, received similar
word from the FCC. Dingell's staff confirmed that they were
contacted by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he spoke personally with FCC Chairman William Kennard
in the afternoon. Based on that conversation, Green said he
understood that a majority of the commissioners had voted to
approve the application
</P>
<P>
   ''I think SBC will be given the right to enter long-distance,''
Green said. ''That's good for Texas and the people I represent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thinks a final announcement may not come until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, FCC officials asserted that no final action
had been taken yet. Commission actions do not become final until
all five members have voted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have a commission action on this soon,'' said FCC
spokeswoman Joy Howell.
</P>
<P>
   SBC spokesman Matt Miller said the company had not been notified
of any decision.
</P>
<P>
   SBC's application has been bolstered by support from the Justice
Department and Texas state regulators. Although the FCC has the
final word, it must give weight to both evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the application seemed particularly favorable
since the Justice Department gave its recommendation. It marked the
first time the department has backed a Bell company's attempt to
offer long-distance service within its local calling region.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department originally recommended that SBC's
application, filed at the beginning of this year, be denied. Bell
companies must satisfy a 14-point checklist meant to ensure their
market is open to rivals before they get approval to offer
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department supported the application after it said
the company provided data showing it improved handling rivals'
requests to use its lines for high-speed Internet service. SBC also
improved the processing of orders to switch local phone customers
to competitors, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 telecommunications law sought to increase competition
in local markets by allowing Bell companies to offer long-distance
service if they opened local service to competitors. The approval
would be another step toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic became the first company to secure FCC permission
to offer its local customers long-distance calling last year,
earning that right in New York state.

<HEADLINE> OpSail 2000: Dutch tall ship previews 'largest maritime event in history' </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Dutch tall ship Eendracht has slipped into
New York harbor - a prelude to a Fourth of July spectacle billed as
the largest maritime event in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel, docked Thursday in Manhattan's South Street Seaport
awaiting OpSail 2000, ''was the first in,'' said Eric Ray, a
spokesman for the latest gathering of wind-powered tall ships.
</P>
<P>
   It harkens an era when commerce poured into New York from around
the world by sea. Little more than a century ago, a forest of masts
rose above the same piers near Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   This year, about 150 tall ships from at least 50 nations will
share the waters with 40 modern warships of 23 navies - a weeklong
spectacle expected to draw more than 4 million people. It begins on
Sunday, with the arrival of the modern naval fleet in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of a ship is when she's driven by the wind,'' said
retired Admiral Paul Welling, a 35-year U.S. Coast Guard veteran
and OpSail's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   In a tip to modern times, each tall ship is now equipped with an
auxiliary engine. Timing the complex display means the
antique-style vessels will be engine-powered as they move into
place, with sailors perched atop the rigging, Welling said Thursday
at a Manhattan briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tall ships will file into the harbor in formation on
Monday, to be berthed on the Hudson River and at the South Street
Seaport.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth of July festivities will begin early, with President
Clinton present for the International Naval Review of a fleet with
almost 10,000 U.S. and foreign military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 8:05 a.m., Clinton plans to board the guided missile
cruiser USS Hue City to review the cruisers, destroyers and
frigates anchored in a 17-mile line from the George Washington
Bridge to the Verrazano Narrows.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. fleet will be blessed by the chaplains aboard each,
using language that goes back to George Washington's time, said
Capt. Woody Berzins, a Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 10 a.m., the president is to move to the aircraft
carrier USS John F. Kennedy, anchored off the Statue of Liberty.
Passing by at about the same time will be the flagship of the
waterborne parade, the U.S. Coast Guard training barque, Eagle,
originally seized from Nazi Germany in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see everything from the technology of today's ships to
the majesty of the tall ships,'' said Berzins, the Navy spokesman.
''It captures history, the present and the future - all in one
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with other Navy guests on the flight deck, the president
will watch the procession of schooners, brigantines, barques and
square-riggers as they pass up the harbor, while 80 aircraft buzz
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   On the JFK, Clinton and other guests will be entertained by 43
performers from Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   The aging, conventionally powered carrier, based at Norfolk,
Va., is allowed to enter New York harbor, from which the Navy's
newer, nuclear-powered carriers are barred.
</P>
<P>
   To watch the maritime extravaganza, as many as 70,000 other
craft are expected to flood area waters - nearly three times the
number at the 1986 Statue of Liberty centennial, according to the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The first tall ship in port this week was the Eendracht. Built
in the Hague in 1989, the 194-foot ship was docked at Pier 16 in
lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the official vessels participating are used for naval
training, including the Chilean navy's 371-foot four-master
Esmerelda and Germany's 295-foot barque Gorch Fock, a sister ship
to Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the USS Mount Whitney, the USS Nassau and five
other U.S. warships, American vessels include the Amistad, a
recreation of a famed 19th century slave ship, and the HMS Rose, a
replica of an Elizabethan-era vessel raised at Portsmouth Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Past naval reviews commemorated events in U.S. history, while
this year's joint event marks the Navy's official observance of the
millennium, dubbed ''A Celebration of Seapower for the
Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   OpSail is to be capped by a spectacular July 4 fireworks display
using 13 barges at five different harbor locations.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the main port of call in the tall ships' nine-week
coastal cruise from San Juan, Puerto Rico on May 25 to Portland,
Maine, on July 31, with stops in Miami, Norfolk, Va.; Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sail, established by President John F. Kennedy in 1961
to promote international relations and cultural exchange, also has
organized the 1964 New York World's Fair, the U.S. Bicentennial in
1976, and the Christopher Columbus Quincentennial in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Korean Red Cross Discusses Reunions  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Red Cross officials from North and
South Korea were close to signing a deal on reuniting families
separated a half-century ago by the Korean War, and on repatriating
aging communist spies in the South, news reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides reported progress in talks, being held at a hotel on
a scenic mountain on the North's east coast. They agreed Tuesday to
exchange 100 separated family members for temporary reunions in
mid-August. But the talks had then stalled over when to repatriate
North Korean spies being held in the South after having served long
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea had insisted the repatriation take place before the
reunions, while South Korea wanted it the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, North Korea made a ''very concessive
offer'' by proposing that the spies be repatriated in early
September, after the family reunions in August, the North's
official Korean Central News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The South's national Yonhap news agency and other media quoted
unnamed government sources as saying a formal deal would be signed
Friday. Government officials could not be reached late Thursday for
comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Park Ki-ryun, head of the South Korean delegation, said Thursday
that ''both sides brought revised proposals and narrowed
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross contact grew out of a deal reached at the
first-ever summit of the two Koreas, where the two countries'
leaders pledged to promote reconciliation and unification.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the North also proposed continuing talks for more
family reunions, following the first August exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But it wanted the repatriation of all convicted northern spies
who wanted to return home. Human rights groups in South Korea said
there were 88 convicted North Korean spies in South Korea, 58 of
whom had families and wanted to go home to the North.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea repatriated one convicted spy in 1993, but Pyongyang
accused Seoul of having tortured him in prison. Accusing the North
of propaganda, the South has not since returned any spies.
</P>
<P>
   In the first family reunion in 1985, the Koreas allowed 50
people from each side to cross the border for hometown visits.
Efforts to arrange more reunions have failed because of political
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million people fled what is now North Korea during the
1950-53 Korean War to settle in South Korea, Seoul officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean border is sealed and manned by nearly 2 million
troops deployed from both sides. There is no mail, telephone or
other direct means of communication between the countries.

<HEADLINE> 12 Dodgers Suspensions Overturned  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Twelve members of the Los Angeles Dodgers had
their suspensions overturned Thursday for their roles in a brawl
with fans at Wrigley Field last month.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen players and three coaches originally were suspended for
a total of 76 games in the wake of the melee in the stands in
Chicago on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a victory for us in the big picture,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ''We went from 16 players to five, and
from 60 days to 24 on their suspensions, so they were cut by more
than half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased about that, but we're going to allow the appeal
process to possibly rectify and take care of the rest of the
suspensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, among the NL leaders in homers and RBIs, is the
only everyday player that did not have his suspension overturned.
But the players' association immediately appealed to commissioner
Bud Selig on behalf of Sheffield as well as for reserve outfielder
F.P. Santangelo, pitcher Carlos Perez and backup catcher Chad
Kreuter, who was the flashpoint of the fight with fans.
</P>
<P>
   That means none of the suspensions can start until a hearing
before Selig and another decision.
</P>
<P>
   Malone worried that the original suspensions, if upheld, would
have dealt a severe blow to the Dodgers' season and their division
title hopes.
</P>
<P>
   He believes their situation is acceptable now, even if Sheffield
has to serve his five-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have most of the team back. If we can't win without a
key player for a few days, then we're not a championship-caliber
team,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the players, coach John Shelby began serving his
eight-game suspension Thursday night as the Dodgers played the San
Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The original 16 suspensions were believed to be the most ever in
a single case in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer, overturned
three-game suspensions for pitchers Terry Adams, Darren Dreifort,
Eric Gagne, Onan Masaoka, Alan Mills, Antonio Osuna and Chan Ho
Park; catcher Todd Hundley; first baseman Eric Karros; and
outfielders Geronimo Berroa and Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Glenn Hoffman's eight-game suspension also was overturned,
and pitcher Mike Fetters' four-game ban was reduced to one game.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston upheld the penalties, issued by baseball disciplinarian
Frank Robinson, for Kreuter (eight games), Perez (five games) and
Sheffield and Santangelo (five games each).
</P>
<P>
   An eight-game suspension also was upheld for coach Rick Dempsey,
who like Shelby, had no other avenues of appeal remaining. Fines to
all the Dodgers involved also were upheld.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some mixture of satisfaction and disappointment,''
union lawyer Gene Orza said. ''We're pleased they've rejected the
idea that any player who goes into the stands, now matter what,
even as a peacemaker, is deserving of a three-game suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   Orza said Kreuter's penalty and those of other players should
all have been reduced by at least three games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The enormity of the remaining penalty portrays him as the
villain,'' Orza said. ''He was provoked. We're still waiting for
major league baseball to say something on behalf of Chad.''
</P>
<P>
   If and when the Dodgers players who are appealing wind up
serving their suspensions, their absences will be staggered
according to a schedule set up by baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The brawl started when Kreuter, in the bullpen, said a fan
struck him in the back of the head and grabbed his cap. Kreuter
went into the stands and his teammates and coaches followed. It
triggered a brawl that delayed the game for nine minutes.

<HEADLINE> Last C-141s leaving Charleston Air Force Base  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - The end of an era is at hand at the
Charleston Air Force Base as the last C-141s flying out of
Charleston are retired after decades of service as the transport
workhorse of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the last Air Force Reserve squadron at the base to
fly the planes - the 707th Airlift Squadron - said goodbye to the
aircraft on Wednesday as the members were drenched in water and in
champagne. The squadron will be deactivated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Airlift Squadron, the last active-duty squadron to fly
the planes, will be deactivated on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The C-141s, which first came to Charleston 35 years ago, are
being retired throughout the Air Force, replaced by the newer
C-17s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been flying C-141s at Charleston since 1971,'' said
Senior Master Sgt. Bobby Jameson of North Charleston who retires
Friday after a career that spanned from Vietnam to Bosnia with the
Persian Gulf War and Grenada in between.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had a few scary moments,'' he said, adding those moments
came from a few near midair collisions, not with problems with the
aircraft. ''It's been a good, safe airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, there was one two-aircraft flyover of the base.
Then the reserve crews were doused by base fire trucks dousing the
planes, then with a bottle of champagne. Only six of the planes
remain in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Some bases, such as McGuire Air Force Base, N.J., will continue
flying C-141s for a few years. But by 2005, only certain reserve
and Air National Guard units will have the planes.
</P>
<P>
   The flyover was nostalgic for Larry Laverne, a retired Air Force
Reserve C-141 pilot from Atlanta. His son, Capt. Mark Laverne of
Marietta, Ga., flew one of the planes Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark was 2 years old when I took him aboard the same aircraft
that he's flying today,'' the elder Laverne said. ''Now he's in the
same squadron I flew in. I would never have thought this could
happen when I started flying them 32 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Laverne said he would probably start flying C-17s
now as a reservist. In his civilian job he flies Boeing 727s for
United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The 707th squadron flew for 28 years - a total of 110,000 flying
hours - without an accident. The squadron will cease to exist on
Friday when it folds its unit colors during a retreat ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Female Nuke Worker Mortality Probed  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Working in the nuclear weapons industry during
the Cold War may not have been any more dangerous for women than
other jobs, unless they were exposed frequently to radiation, a
study of thousands of female defense workers suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted for the government by a private researcher,
examined mortality rates among nearly 68,000 women who worked at 12
nuclear weapons plants or related companies between the 1940s and
1980.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the mortality rate generally was no higher
for these workers when compared with other women and, in some
cases, was lower than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   The author, epidemiologist Gregg Wilkinson of the State
University of New York-Buffalo, said that the study found ''nothing
alarming'' among the general group of women who worked in the
weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did see an increase risk of leukemia'' and a higher
incidence of breast cancer and other cancers among women exposed to
external radiation, even low levels for long periods of time,
Wilkinson said. He said the findings ''were still based on a
relatively small number'' of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the women, or 21,440 who worked at 10 sites,
were believed to have been exposed to external radiation as part of
their jobs. A higher than expected number of deaths from leukemia
was seen among these workers, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that between the 1940s and 1993, there
were 13,671 deaths among the female workers, or about 4,435 fewer
than would be expected from a similar sized group in the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers suggest that the death rate among female nuclear
workers was not much different than other among other groups of
workers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But the nuclear workers did have higher incidences of death from
mental disorder, diseases related to the genital and urinary organs
and ''ill-defined conditions,'' said the study, conducted under a
contract with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health and also for the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important contribution to our understanding of the
mortality rates of our department's past female nuclear weapons
workers about which in the past very little information was
known,'' the Energy Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear weapons sites studied were:
</P>
<P>
   --Tennessee's Oak Ridge compound, which includes the K-25 Gaseous
Diffusion Plant, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Y-12 Plant.
</P>
<P>
   --Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   --The Zia Company, which provided security at Los Alamos during
the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   --Rocky Flats in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   --Hanford reservation in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   --Ohio's Mound and Fernald plants.
</P>
<P>
   --South Carolina's Savannah River complex.
</P>
<P>
   --Texas' Pantex plant.
</P>
<P>
   --The Linde facility in New York, which closed in 1949.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Broadcasts Executions  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- In nationwide television broadcast, two
members of a Guatemalan kidnapping ring were executed by lethal
injection Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With every channel in the Central American nation focused on the
death penalties, Guatemalans watched as Amilcar Cetino Perez said
his last words, what appeared to be a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Cetino and Tomas Cerrate Hernandez were members of a notorious
kidnap gang believed to be responsible for death threats against
the family of President Alfonso Portillo, prompting Portillo to
send some relatives to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the kind of thing you want to watch, but you can't
stop yourself,'' said Nerry Rinales, who saw the execution with
three of his employees while opening his Guatemala City body shop.
</P>
<P>
   What Rinales and other Guatemalans saw was a black curtain
opening to reveal Cetino, strapped to a gurney. At 6:05 a.m., toxic
chemicals flowed into his arm from a wall-mounted intravenous bag.
</P>
<P>
   As he died over the next 11 minutes, television showed the line
of a heart monitor start to flatten, then it cut back to Cetino's
hand as it quivered, then lay still.
</P>
<P>
   ''You start to feel sorry for a guy like that when he's lying
there and he's dying,'' said Ana Pinada, a secretary at a
photocopying store who watched both executions as she made a
breakfast of tortillas and plantains. ''But then you think about
what he did and you think, 'I'm glad this is happening to him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The executions, which were rebroadcast continually for hours,
caused such a stir here that the Guatemala City newspaper Nuestro
Diario said it will publish 220,000 copies of its daily tabloid
Friday -- a Guatemalan record for circulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the grim show was not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I turned off the television when I saw what was going on,''
said Sara de Leon, 49, who said she did not want her two children
to watch the executions. ''What kind of message can a child learn
from that?''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of often wild speculation about possible jailbreaks
and kidnappings planned by the Los Pasaco gang in defense of their
condemned associates, the executions of Cetino, 35, and Cerrate,
39, tool place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything here has been extremely quiet,'' Luis Rivas, a
spokesman for the Guatemala City fire department, said outside the
Pavon rehabilitation work farm, 18 miles southeast of Guatemala
City, where the executions took place. ''There was no reason for us
all to be so nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The fears prompted Portillo to send his mother, sister,
brother-in-law and two nephews to Canada. Portillo said his mother
and sister would return to Guatemala Friday. The others do not have
immediate plans to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Cetino and Cerrate were sentenced to death for their role in the
January 1997 kidnapping and death of Bonifassi de Botran, 80, an
heir to the Botran liquor distillery fortune.
</P>
<P>
   De Botran's family paid a ransom, but days later her body was
found in a nylon sack inside a shabby home outside Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the victim's family also left Guatemala for the
United States this week. They did not say when they plan to return.
</P>
<P>
   Cerrate's execution began shortly at 7:15 a.m. Television showed
him shaking badly as he was led to the death chamber and prison
doctors said the condemned prisoner had ''a complete nervous
breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men died proclaiming their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Cetino and Cerrate were the second and third Guatemalans to be
executed by lethal injection. The 52 other Guatemalan executions
last century were carried out by firing squad, the last of which
was televised live in September 1996.

<HEADLINE> Seat Belts Used As Accessory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Airplane passengers are taking requirements
to wear their seat belts a little too literally, nabbing the canvas
straps to hold up their pants, Norway's largest domestic carrier
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial-looking belts with the hefty metal clasp have
become high fashion for Norwegian youths and their extremely baggy
pants, and are disappearing from the company's planes at a rate of
about five a day, Braathens airline spokesman Stig Martin Solberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we know is that it is in fashion for the street look,''
Solberg said. ''It is easy to spot people on the street with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion stores offer similar belts, but the real thing seems to
have more status. The privately owned airline has been losing seat
belts for a year, and the situation has gotten worse, Solberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Several suspects have been caught and reported to the police.
The airline was also making it harder to remove the belts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The belts cost only about $30 to replace, but the real expense
can be much higher -- particularly if a passenger is left without a
belt during flight or if a flight has to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The airline was considering suing seat-belt thieves for those
costs, which could make the straps one of the season's most
expensive fashions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gama of Brazil Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian soccer team Gama on
Thursday reportedly was suspended indefinitely from playing matches
by FIFA.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's international governing body accused Gama of
violating a FIFA statute when it filed suit in a civil court
against the Brazilian national federation. Gama protested the
team's demotion from Division 1 in last year's Brazilian
championship, Globo television said.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA allows its clubs to file suit only in sports councils. If
the CBF doesn't clear up the matter, it too will face punishment,
according to several media reports.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all Brazilian teams are prohibited from establishing
relations with Gama.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA's disciplinary commission plans to meet in September in
Sydney, Australia, to re-evaluate the decision, the Jornal do
Brasil news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gama president Agricio Braga said his club did not file a
lawsuit. Attempts to contact CBF went unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Quinnipiac College to become university after growth phase  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) - Quinnipiac College's 15-year transformation
from a small, rural school to a well-known name in health care,
media, law and politics will culminate Saturday in one more change.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the school will be known as Quinnipiac University.
</P>
<P>
   The name change actually is the smallest transformation the
school has seen since it was founded as a junior college commuter
school in New Haven in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a strategy to make Quinnipiac more competitive in a
region crowded with top colleges, said university President John L.
Lahey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quinnipiac had very solid academic programs, especially in
business and health, but it was not marketed well. We were not too
well-known outside of Connecticut,'' Lahey said.
</P>
<P>
   Economics Professor Mark Gius, who is chairman of the faculty
Senate, said Quinnipiac really became a university years ago, when
it absorbed the old University of Bridgeport law school and many
graduate programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''By changing the name to Quinnipiac University, we're telling
the world we no longer are a little tiny college,'' Gius said.
</P>
<P>
   Some school activities, especially the polling institute that
operates in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has helped make
Quinnipiac a national name.
</P>
<P>
   Class of 2000 graduate Justin Louis said when he came to
Quinnipiac from Highland Park, N.J., no one had heard of the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ''The poll was just getting started, and people would say 'It's
Quinna-what?''' Louis recalled. Now, he said, people say they hear
about his alma mater all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many students, Louis was drawn by the 200-acre campus in
the shadow of Sleeping Giant State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Some new brick buildings sport the names of famous donors:
television personality Ed McMahon and bagel entrepreneur Murray
Lender.
</P>
<P>
   A new $6 million library is nearly complete, and building will
begin soon for a sports complex and graduate campus.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment has doubled in 10 years, to 6,000, and new degrees
and programs were added in fields few area schools offer, such as
masters' degrees in journalism and degrees in forensic nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Its teams are competing at the top college level - Division 1A -
in selected sports that appeal to prospective students such as
lacrosse and ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   When Lahey arrived at Quinnipiac in 1987 about two-thirds of the
students were from Connecticut, and many were commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 30 percent of Quinnipiac's students are from New York, 15
percent are from New Jersey and 25 percent are from Connecticut;
almost all live on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all Quinnipiac has remained a hands-on college
that helps students get good jobs, as opposed to the liberal arts
or research focus of schools such as Yale, UConn or Wesleyan
University.
</P>
<P>
   Gius said a few professors balked at the name change because
they feared it would alter the school's tradition of small classes,
taught by professors and not graduate students. Lahey and others
assured them that the traditions would not change.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac took advantage of the last recession to offer
competitive pay to professors who were at schools facing cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Wesleyan President Douglas Bennet said he has watched with
admiration as Quinnipiac transformed itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any institution of any kind needs to be asking themselves
these kinds of strategic questions. It's a sign of, I think,
terrific institutional health when the institutions are able to
actually implement them,'' Bennet said.
</P>
<P>
   But Quinnipiac has its growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   It remains a mostly white, upper-middle-class school. About 8
percent of undergraduates are racial minorities, and 14 percent of
law school students are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Academically, freshmen are middle-of-the-road. The average SAT
score for the 1999 freshman class was 1080, a little better than
the national average that year of 1016.
</P>
<P>
   As at most colleges, tuition at Quinnipiac increased through the
'90s. Undergraduate tuition is $17,000 for the coming school year;
with room and board, the price tag is almost $26,000, compared with
$14,200 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent of students get some kind of financial aid.
Because of Quinnipiac's small endowment and competition for some
programs, financial aid falls behind schools such as Wesleyan,
which admits students regardless of their ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of some students gets noticed. Gius said a student
once dropped off his deposit after flying to Connecticut by
helicopter. A joke around campus is that the cars in the student
parking lot are nicer than the cars in the faculty parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The endowment, while still small, has grown from $5 million to
$60 million. Lahey said his goal in the next few years is $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want to be financially viable, we're really going to
have to do it,'' Gius said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Faces Hard Mideast Decision  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Tangled in intractable discord, Israel and the
Palestinians are leaving it to President Clinton to decide whether
to host a Mideast summit or find some other formula to keep peace
talks alive. The president said Thursday he had not decided how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief run of shuttle diplomacy, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright found the two sides far apart on Palestinian
statehood, the future of Jerusalem and other knotty issues they had
vowed to settle by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's determination to score in the history books becomes a
larger factor as the clock ticks down on his White House years. He
has less than seven months left in office and a senior U.S.
official said Thursday he was prepared to mediate between Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
until his last days in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to do whatever I can in the time I have left to help
them make peace,'' Clinton said in an Oval Office ceremony as he
named former Rep. Norman Mineta as the new commerce secretary. ''So
whatever I do or don't do will be based on my calculation that it
will maximize the possibilities of ultimate success. But I don't
know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the president was debriefed for 45 minutes by
Albright and Dennis Ross, a senior U.S. mediator in the
negotiations. White House spokesman P.J. Crowley declined to
divulge specifics of Albright's conversation with the president,
saying only: ''It was not a decision meeting. I think that her
focus was on the Palestinian front.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wide gap, Albright left open the possibility Clinton
would call a summit. She stopped here to make a speech on prospects
for democracy in the Balkans and then headed home to report to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's summit strategy a week ago was to try to limit the
risk of failure by holding off on invitations until the two sides
were closer to an accord. She was unable to move them, but Clinton
could decide to go ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could make a decision as early as the weekend, said a
senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane home to the United States, she told reporters she
would see the president Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to find out what flexibility there is,'' said
Albright, adding that the parties are trying to make sure ''their
own ultimate goals are met.''
</P>
<P>
   She indicated that a summit may not be imminent but President
Clinton intends to see the process through until his very last day
in office. ''We have plenty of time to do what needs to be done,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a White House news conference, Clinton said the
issues would not ''get any easier with the passage of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the time was right for him to host a summit, Clinton
said none had been scheduled. He added, however, ''I do not believe
that they can resolve the final most difficult issues without
having the leaders get together in some isolated setting and make
the last tough decisions, or decide not to make them, as the case
may be.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric from both sides was sharp as Albright shuttled
between Jerusalem and Ramallah on the West Bank, meeting with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said, ''It's time for the
Israeli government to prepare its people'' for the steps needed to
make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy urged the Palestinians to
compromise and halt ''inflammatory speeches and declarations.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the disagreement between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority ''does not mean everything stops.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical that the parties continue their efforts with
one another to narrow the gaps,'' Albright said at a joint news
conference with Yasser Arafat in Ramallah on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat, in an interview, said lower-level negotiations with
Israel would resume in Washington next week, with Clinton to make
an assessment on a summit two or three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   However, a State Department official, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity, said there was no agreement to resume the
lower-level talks.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat described the gaps with Israel as ''enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, after a 70-minute meeting with Albright,
Barak expressed skepticism that his differences with Arafat could
be resolved except possibly at a summit, with Clinton's direct
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The substantial negotiations will begin only if and when there
will be a summit meeting,'' Barak said. And, he went on, ''we will
negotiate only an agreement that will strengthen Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the prospects for a summit, it was clear that
Albright's separate talks with Barak and Arafat over two days had
made no dent in their stands on how much land Israel would transfer
to the Palestinians, the future of Jerusalem and the claims of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat insisted Israel must turn over all of the West Bank, Gaza
and East Jerusalem for a Palestinian state. Barak, however, said
''agreement can be reached only if movement and flexibility will be
shown from both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting deep disagreement seven years after negotiations
began, Israeli Foreign Minister Levy dismissed Arafat's demands.
''This would be capitulation'' and not ''a process of peace.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ranks Quality of Life  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Twenty-four African countries trail the rest of
the world in quality of life, with Sierra Leone lodged at rock
bottom, according to a United Nations report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As ministers at a special General Assembly meeting in Geneva
thrashed out a statement on eradicating world poverty, a Human
Development Report identified 35 countries as suffering from ''low
development'' -- all but six of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Canada topped the list of the 174-country Human Development
Index, which takes into account income, education, life expectancy
and health care. It was followed, as last year, by Norway and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 150th-ranked Haiti was the worst-performing nation in the
Americas. Japan was the top Asian country, in ninth place, while
Bangladesh was the lowest, in 146th place.
</P>
<P>
   War-ravaged Sierra Leone, where a male's life expectancy is only
36&AMP;frac12; years, followed Niger and Burkina Faso at the bottom of the
list.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations says some 1.2 billion people live in absolute
poverty -- on less than a dollar a day -- and aims to halve that
number by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   But improving the lot of the people of the world means focusing
on a wider range of issues, according to the study, produced by the
U.N. Development Fund. The way governments respect individual
rights, for example, was just as important as how much money people
had.
</P>
<P>
   ''Holding governments accountable is a bottom-line
requirement,'' even as globalization advances, the 290-page study
said.
</P>
<P>
   The top U.N. authority on human rights, Mary Robinson, welcomed
the report: ''Human rights and economic and social progress are
inextricably linked,'' she said. ''For far too long we have looked
at development and human rights separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, noting the report, called the fight against
poverty ''one of the biggest challenges facing humanity in the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Necessary food, health assistance, education and work do not
represent only objectives of development,'' the pope told pilgrims
gathered in St. Peter's Square on Thursday. ''They are fundamental
rights still denied, unfortunately, to millions of human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 101 nations tracked since 1975, all but Zambia improved their
score in the index. However, 22 countries -- mostly in Africa and
East Europe -- saw their scores diminished since 1990, mostly due to
the AIDS epidemic, economic stagnation and violent conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''AIDS is clearly an unprecedented development crisis which is
undermining achievement in social development,'' said Kathleen
Cravero, deputy executive director of the joint U.N. program on
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that more than 100 multiparty democracies have
been established in the past 20 years, but they were of varying
quality.
</P>
<P>
   President Olusegun Obasanjo of 151st-placed Nigeria said,
though, that democracy alone was not enough to motivate people to
lift themselves out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democracy is an imperative, not a luxury, and it has come to
stay,'' he told reporters. But ''we must have the resources to be
able to give our people what I call a democracy dividend.''
Obasanjo urged rich countries to write off more of the developing
world's debt and offer more development assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The picture wasn't entirely rosy for the highest-ranked nations,
where the report noted problems of adult illiteracy and
unemployment. In Britain, the United States and Ireland, more than
one in five adults are functionally illiterate, meaning that they
read below fifth-grade level, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Fleisher Ties Record at Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa, (AP) -- Bruce Fleisher wouldn't even let Hubert
Green sleep on it.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Green had the best opening round in the 21-year
history of the U.S. Senior Open, Fleisher went one stroke better.
His 7-under-par 64 Thursday tied the record for the lowest score in
any round of the Senior Open, matching Orville Moody's third round
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''I drove the ball well, but it's early,'' Fleisher said. ''A
lot can happen in three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher held a one-stroke lead over Green and was two strokes
in front of Dave Stockton, Isao Aoki and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin finished the 18th hole at Saucon Valley Country Club after
a 95-minute rain delay. Play was suspended for the day at 8:24 p.m.
EDT with nine players still on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ''The score I am standing on right now is probably not
indicative of how I hit the ball,'' Irwin said. ''It was one of the
uglier five under par rounds I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus shot a 67, which tied his best round in any Senior
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't played a good round of golf in a long time,'' said
Nicklaus, who excited the gallery with his performance. ''It was
kind of fun. I haven't seen anywhere near a major for a while
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bruner also shot a 67, while four players had 68s.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Dave Eichelberger shot a 1-over 72.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher and Green sit atop the leaderboard for the second time
in a month. The two squared off in a playoff last month at The Home
Depot Invitational before Fleisher won it with a birdie on the
third extra hole.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher parred the first four holes Thursday before finishing
the front nine with four birdies in his last five holes.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied eight holes overall, including three straight
beginning at No. 14. He parred nine holes and bogeyed the 18th. His
longest putt was a 15-footer at No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started slow, but I kept playing and hit the ball well,'' he
said. ''I was able to hit some shots from close. I feel good right
now, but a lot can happen in three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher and Stockton benefited from playing in the same
threesome as their competitive juices were flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tied him at five under (at No. 13) and I think I made him
mad,'' Stockton said. ''He went nuts there at the end. We fed off
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Told what Stockton said, Fleisher joked: ''Yeah, I saw him
eating peanuts and he didn't offer me any.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the only ones playing with emotion. After making a
putt for a birdie on No. 11, Aoki did a little dance routine,
evoking a loud roar from the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said when he gets surprised, he dances like that,'' said
Nobi Kuga, Aoki's interpreter. ''He said he's been playing so bad
that it's a fluke he played so good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no fluke how well Fleisher has been playing, though.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, 51, has been dominant since joining the Senior PGA
Tour last year. He's No. 2 on the money list and is seeking his
fourth title of the year and 11th since coming aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt very relaxed. I can't even tell you why,'' Fleisher
said. ''This sort of golf course, you have to stay in the fairway.
It's the only way to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Green sensed he would be involved in the competition when he
felt the butterflies in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   He overcame his nerves and shot his best round since a 62 in the
third round won him the Audi Senior Classic in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was talking to my caddie and said that I hadn't been this
nervous in a long time on the first fairway,'' Green said. ''It's a
great feeling to get those butterflies jumping around in your
stomach again.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Green's 65, only six golfers had shot a 66 in the opening
round of the Senior Open, most recently by Bob Charles in 1996.
Charles' round came on a par-72 course, with the other five on
par-71s.
</P>
<P>
   Five golfers shot a 66 or better Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this is the most difficult golf course we would
play an Open on, but we are not playing the U.S. Open,'' Nicklaus
said. ''We are playing the Senior Open. Most of the Senior Open
golf courses are set up a little softer than the U.S. Open,
probably far more suited for the games of fellows over 50.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Arnold Palmer, a native of Latrobe, Pa., attracted the
largest gallery even though he isn't a threat to win the
tournament. Palmer shot a 5-over 76. ''I'm living on hope these
days, so I hope it's going to be a lot better,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Says Torch Already Passed  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus dismissed talk of passing of
the torch to Tiger Woods during the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a press thing,'' Nicklaus said Thursday after shooting
a 4-under-par 67 in the first round of the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''You guys have to have something to write about, it might as
well be that. He is dominating the game right now. I haven't played
well enough in the last 10 years to really say I am passing
anything. I passed the baton a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, though, won't rule out a return to the U.S. Open. A
victory at Saucon Valley this week would give him an automatic
berth in the 2001 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a very nice reception at the 18th hole at Pebble
Beach,'' he said. ''Unless I am playing well enough to be
competitive, I don't really want to go play again and beat my head
against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Nicklaus still has to win. He's three strokes behind
Bruce Fleisher with 54 holes left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''No guarantees I am going to win here,'' Nicklaus said. ''Let's
see one thing at a time. Let's go win this tournament, then we will
worry. Ask me that question Sunday evening, then I have got an
option.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Tom Watson's first trip to the U.S. Senior Open
isn't turning out the way he expected. Watson, 50, shot a par-71 in
the first round while playing in a threesome with Hubert Green, who
shot a 65.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I left something on the golf course, but I got what
I deserved,'' he said. ''I think the golf course will continue to
yield low scores. I just hope I am one of them. I played with a
player who played the way he should have played, Hubert Green, and
he shot a 65.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, in his first season on the Senior PGA Tour, is No. 11 on
the money list. He finished ninth last week in Cadillac NFL Golf
Classic after two straight runner-up finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put myself in some unsavory places and it caused me to
struggle a little bit,'' he said. ''The course is there for the
taking. The greens are not particularly firm so you can get the
ball close to the holes, even the holes on the little plateaus.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite shot a 72 and Andy North had a 77. Both are playing in
their first Senior Open as well.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   COURSE RECORDS: Fleisher shot a 7-under-par 64 to tie the record
for the lowest score in any round of the Senior Open, matching
Orville Moody's third round in 1989. It also was the lowest 18-hole
score at Saucon Valley in a USGA event. Nicklaus opened his round
with three birdies, which had never been done here before. Jim
Thorpe registered four straight birdies, setting a record for
consecutive birdies in a U.S. Open at Saucon Valley. The 1992
Senior Open was played here.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   MONEY MATTERS: The purse is $2.25 million, up from $1.75 million
in 1999. The winner receives $400,000, which is $85,000 more than
1999's top prize. In comparison, this year's winner's check will be
20 times what Roberto De Vicenzo took home after winning the
inaugural tournament in 1980. De Vicenzo pocketed $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   RAIN DELAY: Hale Irwin had to sit through a 95-minute rain delay
before finishing up the 18th hole. He still managed to par the
final hole. ''It's like seeing the cartoon after the main
feature,'' Irwin said. ''You have momentum going. You have a
mindset going and you try to regenerate that. And I hit a good
putt.''

<HEADLINE> Smith Corona will sell stock, keep assets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORTLAND, N.Y. (AP) - A month after declaring bankruptcy and
announcing it would shed its assets, typewriter maker Smith Corona
said Thursday it will sell 49 percent of its stock and retain its
name.
</P>
<P>
   The stock purchase with Pubco Corp., a Cleveland-based
manufacturer of thermal printers and thermal and impact printer
supplies, is part of Smith Corona's ongoing reorganization plan and
replaces an earlier deal with Carolina Wholesale Office Machine Co.
</P>
<P>
   The original deal, announced in May, had Carolina buying all of
Smith Corona's assets including inventory, accounts receivable,
intellectual property, equipment, dies and molds and certain
contracts and licenses in a deal valued at about $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Corona spokeswoman Rivian Bell said a value of the Pubco
stock purchase has not been determined but said it was a ''higher
and better offer'' than the Carolina deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, approved in bankruptcy court,
Smith Corona would be reorganized under Chapter 11 and continue to
exist as an ongoing entity. Upon completion of the Chapter 11
proceeding, Pubco would buy 49 percent of the stock in the
reorganized Smith Corona.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 51 percent of the new common stock would be issued
to creditors and, if allowed by the court, to stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Pubco also would take over Smith Corona's secured debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stock purchase agreement with Pubco provides more value to
satisfy creditor claims than the Carloina Wholesale asset purchase
deal,'' said Martin D. Wilson, president and chief executive
officer of Smith Corona. ''In addition, Smith Corona's business
will continue to operate under the Smith Corona name with the
opportunity to introduce products of the Pubco companies through
the Smith Corona distribution channels.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization plan should be final by December, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   May's bankruptcy filing was the second time in five years the
troubled 97-year-old company sought protection from its creditors
under federal bankruptcy laws. In April, Smith Corona was dropped
from the Nasdaq stock listings.
</P>
<P>
   The filing listed $14.4 million in liabilities and $12.4 million
in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Corona stopped making products when it emerged from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1997.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs' Durazo Placed on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- First baseman Erubiel Durazo on Thursday became
the third member of the Arizona Diamondbacks to be placed on the
disabled list this week.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, who had surgery on his right wrist to repair cartilage
damage June 1, was placed on the 15-day disabled list before
Thursday night's game against the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo joins third baseman Matt Williams and right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre on the 15-day disabled list. Like Williams, sidelined
with a right quadriceps strain, Durazo is expected to return after
the All-Star break. Stottlemyre isn't expected to return until
September because of tendinitis in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo played two games since he was activated June 24, hitting
a three-run homer during the Diamondbacks' 8-3 victory over
Colorado on Sunday. Durazo is hitting .276 with seven homers and 27
RBIs in 47 games.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona manager Buck Showalter said Durazo will begin his
rehabilitation assignment on July 4 in Tucson while the
Diamondbacks travel to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo was replaced on the 25-man roster by outfielder Jason
Conti, who hit .308 in 78 games for Triple-A Tucson.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels Fight Drug Effort  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS POZOS, Colombia (AP) -- Rebels vowed to battle a planned
U.S.-backed offensive against drug crops in Colombia -- a source of
wealth for the insurgents -- and appealed Thursday for aid to help
farmers develop alternative livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said they might even introduce surface-to-air
missiles into Colombia's war, which would mark a sharp escalation
of the 36-year civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Washington's $1.3 billion aid package -- approved by
the House Thursday night and expected to pass the Senate Friday --
have said it will intensify the war and pull the United States into
a quagmire. Analysts expect the rebels to fiercely resist attempts
by U.S.-trained Colombian troops, backed by U.S.-supplied
helicopters, to fumigate and seize coca-growing areas. Coca is the
raw material for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rios, a commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, said Wednesday that his group would arm coca farmers if
needed to resist ''U.S. aggression.'' Asked if rebels may also
purchase surface-to-air missiles to shoot down combat helicopters --
which form the most expensive component of the U.S. aid package --
Rios said it was now a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have thus far refrained from using such missiles,
apparently fearing it would force the government to sharply
escalate the war, and are not known to currently possess any. But
with millions of dollars in proceeds from their drug-protection
racket and with links to arms dealers, surface-to-air missiles
would be within the rebels' reach.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's assistance is an attempt to stem the flow of
cocaine and heroin, which are both produced in Colombia in massive
quantities, from Colombia and to shore up the country's
long-standing democracy. But Rios, speaking Wednesday in an
interview in Los Pozos, a village in Colombia's coca-growing south,
said the aid is tantamount to ''throwing fuel on the fire'' of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''The peasants will defend themselves and we will stand by
them,'' said the bearded rebel, a 9-milimeter pistol and a large
knife bulging from his olive-green fatigues. ''It's going to be war
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, delegates from 21 countries and the United Nations
arrived here in the sweltering rolling hills of Caqueta State for a
two-day conference on alternative policies for curbing Colombia's
world-leading cocaine production.
</P>
<P>
   Envoys from Europe, Canada and Japan flew into a FARC-controlled
airport whose brick control tower bears a huge painting of a
grinning Manuel ''Sureshot'' Marulanda, the rebel group's
70-year-old founder and leader, who was also present at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Buses escorted by rifle-toting rebels on motorcycles whisked the
envoys to lodgings at a military base evacuated 19 months ago when
President Andres Pastrana ceded five townships to the rebels as
goodwill gesture for peace. Peace talks have stalled, however.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 coca farmers who were bused in for the event chanted
slogans such as: ''No to fumigation, yes to education.'' Coca
farmers made fiery speeches denouncing the U.S. policy of promoting
fumigation instead of providing more aid to grow legal crops. The
crowd erupted in applause as Colombian government delegates sat
stony-faced.
</P>
<P>
   Government peace negotiator Camilo Gomez told diplomats and
others gathered for the meeting, and watched over by rebels
including gun-toting women in combat fatigues, that coca has done
nothing but bring fleeting prosperity. He said the government
wanted coca growers to gain legitimate livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want is penal action against drug traffickers and
social action for the farmers,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.S. aid plan, the Colombian military will receive
advanced helicopters and Green Beret training for new army
battalions tasked with ''securing'' coca plantations where the
rebels are entrenched. Drug crops guarded and taxed by the FARC and
rival paramilitary militias would undergo aerial fumigation.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are expected to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FARC has been in Caqueta and Putumayo for decades, so why
would they give it up without a fight?'' said Adam Isacson, a
Colombia specialist with the Center for International Policy in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Government plans are also being drawn up to resettle as many as
50,000 people who could be displaced by the so-called ''Push into
Southern Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of poor peasants traveled for days to the alternative
development conference to speak out against aerial fumigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fumigation kills the coca, but it also kills animals, makes
children sick, and destroys nature,'' said Heymer Cobo, a coca
farmer from neighboring Putumayo State where about two-fifths of
Colombia's coca is grown.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which suspended contacts with the FARC after
a rebel unit killed three Americans civilians last year, boycotted
the conference.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Stottlemyre Eyes Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre already has made one amazing
comeback. Now he hopes to make another.
</P>
<P>
   One year after returning sooner than expected from two tears in
his right rotator cuff, the 35-year-old right-hander is hoping to
return early from an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a chance that I can pitch like I did two starts ago
and pitch those kind of games in September, that's what I'm going
to do,'' Stottlemyre said Thursday before the Arizona Diamondbacks
played the Houston Astros. ''If I was going to bet, I'd bet that I
was going to be back in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre was placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday with
tendinitis in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre originally had been told he'd miss only three weeks
because of this second recurrence of tendinitis. But that estimate
was pushed back on Wednesday after an examination by team doctor
David Zeman also revealed a microscopic muscle tear.
</P>
<P>
   Zeman said on Wednesday that such a soft tissue injury normally
requires two months of rest to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre was on the disabled list from May 30 to June 14 with
the same ailment. He came back for two strong starts, but took
himself out of the game after the first inning of Sunday's game
against Colorado because of intense pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little concerned with the amount of pain I had in the
first inning but I wasn't going to jump to any conclusions until I
knew the results,'' said Stottlemyre, who is 8-5 with 4.24 ERA. ''I
think everyone knew I was waiting for him (Zeman) to get back into
town. The relationship we developed has gone beyond doctor-patient.
I listened to what he had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre was adamant that this injury was unrelated to the
rotator cuff tears that sidelined him for three months last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything wrong with my shoulder,'' said
Stottlemyre, who opted to begin an intense weightlifting program
rather than undergo season-ending surgery last year. ''My shoulder
today with two tears is stronger at 35 than it was with no tears at
22. When it's time for them to start digging in my shoulder, I'm
going to be doing something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Stottlemyre had admitted he had considered
retirement but loved playing for the Diamondbacks and owner Jerry
Colangelo and wanted to help them win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Any such thoughts since have been pushed to the back of his
mind, Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each time on the DL gets a little more frustrating,''
Stottlemyre said. ''But I'm passing on any of those thoughts until
something's conclusive, until I'm not capable of going out there
and pitching or not capable of going out there and putting together
a full season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan, the 40-year-old veteran signed this spring as a
long reliever and emergency starter, will take Stottlemyre's turn
in the rotation Friday when the Diamondbacks open a four-game
series against the Cincinnati Reds.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Medical Privacy Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee approved
legislation Thursday that would require financial companies to get
customers' consent before sharing their medical data with other
firms or using it to make decisions on granting credit.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 26-14 to approve the bill sponsored by its
chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa. Although Republicans are in the
majority on the panel, the vote was carried by Democratic
lawmakers: all 22 Democrats present voted for the bill, while 14 of
the 18 Republicans present opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the measure is similar to the medical-data
provisions of legislation proposed recently by the Clinton
administration and Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals go beyond privacy rules included in sweeping
legislation, which President Clinton signed into law in November,
removing Depression-era barriers and allowing banks, brokerage
firms and insurers to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not acted on similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said his bill ''ensures privacy protection in an area of
great sensitivity to all Americans: personal health and medical
records.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a consumer applying for a loan or credit card
from a bank, for example, shouldn't have to worry about getting
rejected because of medical data provided to the bank by an
insurance company with which it is affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry is divided over new voluntary guidelines
for protecting consumers' private data, including their medical
information.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that Congress will complete the job the Banking
Committee began today by passing this year the privacy protections
Americans expect and deserve,'' Tresury Secretary Lawrence Summers
said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The medical privacy bill would:
</P>
<P>
   --Require financial companies to obtain customers' express
written consent before disclosing ''individually identifiable''
health or medical data to an affiliated company or any other firm,
such as a telemarketer.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit financial companies from using health or medical data
in deciding whether to grant credit without the prospective
borrower's express consent.
</P>
<P>
   --Require separate and specific customer consent for disclosure
of information regarding mental health, substance abuse treatment
and sexually-transmitted diseases including HIV and AIDS, as well
as genetic information.
</P>
<P>
   --Give consumers the right to inspect, copy and correct their
health or medical data that are under the control of a financial
company.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit financial companies from requiring or coercing
consumers to agree to sharing of their health or medical data as a
condition of getting a loan or other financial product.
</P>
<P>
   --Give consumers the right to sue companies if they misuse their
health or medical data in violation of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R.4585.

<HEADLINE> Gore PLabor Standards Plan Advances  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is taking another
step toward making good on a promise Vice President Al Gore made to
labor unions three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Thursday released a revised proposal for
regulations that would bar companies from doing business with the
federal government if there is strong evidence they aren't
complying with labor, tax, environmental or consumer protection
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Private businesses routinely take into account a potential
suppliers record of performance, reputation and integrity before
deciding to do business with them -- so should the federal
government,'' said a statement from the White House Office of
Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gore first promised the new government contracting rules in
February 1997 during a speech at an AFL-CIO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to do business with the federal government you had
better maintain a safe workplace and respect civil, human and union
rights,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators raised strong objections, however,
threatening to block the 1997 confirmation of Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It did not resurface until last summer, when the White House
issued a formal written proposal. That also met with strenuous
protests from the GOP and business groups, who have called it a
''blacklisting'' threat.
</P>
<P>
   The new, modified version comes as Gore is trying to solidify
union support for his presidential campaign after a series of
actions that have angered labor leaders. Among them: Gore's support
for a U.S.-China trade deal and his decision to hire President
Clinton's chief Capitol Hill lobbyist for the deal, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, as his new campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers said changes in the proposal were
insufficient and accused the administration of political pandering.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has taken Vice President Gore three years to deliver on his
1997 promise to the AFL-CIO leadership, and he has delivered just
as the campaign for president begins to hit full stride,'' said
House Workforce Committee Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has long denied any political motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This policy is obviously good for taxpayers and working
families,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''It's the
Republicans on Capitol Hill who want to politicize everything under
the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The modified proposal more explicitly delineates the corporate
wrongdoing federal contracting officers could consider, and would
require companies that are disqualified from competition to be
notified and allowed to challenge that determination before a
contract is awarded.
</P>
<P>
   It still includes provisions that would bar federal contractors
from billing the government for expenses associated with activities
intended to influence workers' decisions to unionize, such as
hiring legal consultants or printing pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   The revised proposal will be open for public comment for 60 days
before it is finalized, the administration said.

<HEADLINE> Show Falcon Wins After Jockey Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Show Falcon won the $62,900 feature race
at Churchill Downs by disqualification Thursday following a mishap
near the finish that injured jockey Tony D'Amico.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico's mount, Claire's Honor, became entangled in the legs of
Ican'thearyou and went to his knees as those horses and Show Falcon
battled for the lead in the 1 1/16-mile race. D'Amico was thrown to
the turf and struck by the hoof of a trailing horse.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico was motionless on the track for several minutes, and the
track's attending physician, Dr. Robert Crouch, said D'Amico was
briefly unconscious. After he regained consciousness, D'Amico was
transported to the emergency room at University of Louisville
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico was ''awake and alert'' and suffering from some back and
shoulder pain later, Crouch said. Ican'thearyou crossed the finish
line a neck in front of Show Falcon, but stewards disqualified the
apparent winner for failing to maintain a straight course.
Ican'thearyou was placed last in the six-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, jockey Pat Day won the seventh race aboard Alpine at
Clark to move within three victories of 2,000 for his career at
Churchill Downs. Day has eight scheduled mounts on Friday's card.

<HEADLINE> Judge Denies Waco Case Dismissal  </HEADLINE>
By MATT SLAGLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The ''ground was dancing'' from the bullets
that whizzed from the Branch Davidian compound as agents tried to
approach it for the first time, 51 days before the compound was
destroyed in a deadly fire, a federal agent testified Thursday in a
wrongful death case against the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud boom and I fell face forward and had been shot
in my chest. I thought, 'You need to get up, these guys are
shooting bullets at you ... this isn't a game,''' said Eric Evers,
an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Evers was among the first witnesses called by government
attorneys as they began presenting their defense in the $675
million wrongful death case filed by raid survivors and Davidian
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys wrapped up their case earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Evers, who was shot in the forearm and whose bulletproof vest
blocked the two shots to his chest, testified he never pulled the
gun from his holster as he lay bleeding in a ditch near the
compound for two hours on Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was too scared to move from where I was,'' he said. ''The
ground was dancing and bullets whizzed by.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, sect members and the government reached a
cease-fire. Once the cease-fire had been called, Evers, still
laying injured, said he remembered hearing someone yell: ''Leave
our women and children alone! You got four minutes to get out or
else!''
</P>
<P>
   Four agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and
six Davidians died in the raid designed to serve search and arrest
warrants on sect leader David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorney Marie Hagen then questioned ATF agent Kris
Mayfield, who testified he saw Koresh standing unarmed at a door of
the complex as agents approached the building.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Koresh entered the building, closed the double
doors behind him and gunfire broke out, Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen showed jurors the left side of the battered door which was
riddled with 13 bullet holes. Nine holes were from outgoing and
four were from incoming shots, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a military official testified that three surveillance
helicopters were shot at as they approached the compound during the
raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the pilots made a call that he was taking fire and
started to turn away from the compound,'' testified Air Force Col.
William G. Petit, who was a passenger in one of the helicopters.
''It took me by surprise because we were not anticipating any fire
from the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers presented jurors with a gashed metal panel
from the rear of Petit's helicopter that supposedly was caused by a
bullet shot from the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination Petit conceded he could not tell whether
the gunfire came from sect members or from friendly fire from other
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs claim that during the initial raid federal agents
fired indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   They also allege that on the day the siege ended, federal agents
violated an approved plan when they had tanks punch holes in the
building to spray tear gas, contributed to or caused at least some
of the three fires that engulfed the compound, and failed to have
firefighting equipment at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   After plaintiffs rested their case, U.S. district Judge Walter
Smith without comment denied government attorneys' request to
dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford claimed that evidence presented
since June 19 when the trial began failed to prove the government
shares responsibility for the deaths of more than 80 people killed
in the raid and seven weeks later on the final day of the sect's
standoff with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford estimated the government could wrap up its case in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member jury will act only as an advisory panel to Smith,
who will deliver the verdict. Separately, Smith will consider the
question of whether federal agents shot at Davidians during the
siege's fiery end.

<HEADLINE> OAS To Oversee Reforms From Lima  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Organization of American States said
Thursday that it will set up a permanent office in Lima to oversee
democratic reforms following President Alberto Fujimori's
re-election, which some local and international groups charged was
tainted.
</P>
<P>
   A high-level OAS delegation said Fujimori and government
opponents had agreed with its agenda to strengthen the country's
damaged democracy and the permanent office would supervise the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be establishing an ongoing mission here in Peru to
maintain an OAS presence,'' said Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy, co-leader of the OAS delegation. ''A lot more work needs
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria, the other leader of the
mission, said the agenda had been accepted by both sides ''and we
will try to advance in the process in terms of the mechanisms and a
realistic timetable for carrying out the reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies had
rejected any demand for a timetable, but Gaviria insisted a
schedule had to be established for implementing the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the latest we expect this process to be concluded before
the next municipal elections'' at the end of 2002, Gaviria said at
a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Alejandro Toledo, who boycotted the May 28
presidential runoff after charging that Fujimori planned to rig the
outcome, praised the OAS success in establishing an agenda aimed at
strengthening Peru's democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The democratic forces of Peru have achieved a great victory,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS agenda calls for reforms to establish an independent
judicial system, guarantee press freedom, correct flaws in the
electoral process and provide oversight of the armed forces and
intelligence services, which have been key allies in helping
Fujimori tighten his grip on all branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   The government had no comment Thursday on the OAS announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has been pressing the OAS to force Fujimori to call new
elections, and he reiterated Thursday that he expects the reforms
''to lead inevitably to a new election.''
</P>
<P>
   But the OAS mission has said that its mandate is to push for
democratic reforms, not new elections, because without substantial
changes new elections would produce the same flawed results.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, police used tear gas to prevent Toledo from
leading some 1,500 supporters in a march to the luxury hotel being
used by the OAS delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were stopped three blocks shy of the hotel in
the heart of Lima's business district shortly after midnight. They
responded by hurling rocks and burning tires and garbage in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Cable news station Canal N reported at least five people
injured, including a local reporter struck in the face with a rock.
Police at the scene confirmed that injuries occurred, but could not
provide details. No arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori pledged to fortify Peru's democratic institutions after
winning an unprecedented third five-year term, following a campaign
riddled with irregularities and allegations of government fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS refused to monitor the May 28 ballot after Fujimori
refused to delay it and correct irregularities, but sent the
follow-up delegation to ensure Fujimori keeps his postelection
promise.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland's Colon Walks First Four  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Cleveland's Bartolo Colon became just
the fourth pitcher in history to walk the first four batters in a
game Thursday night, tying the major league record.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander walked Kansas City's Johnny Damon, Jeff
Reboulet and Mike Sweeney, loading the bases. Then on a 3-2 count,
he walked Jermaine Dye.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Quinn had a sacrifice fly and Joe Randa an RBI fielder's
choice, giving the Royals three runs in the inning without getting
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 pitches Colon threw in the inning, 20 were balls.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a pitcher began a game by walking the first four
hitters was April 18, 1997 by Roger Pavlik of Texas.

<HEADLINE> Blackthorne murder-for-hire trial goes to jury  </HEADLINE>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Prosecutors closed their case Thursday in the
murder-for-hire trial of Allen Blackthorne, portraying the
millionaire as a man who hated his ex-wife and who, after a string
of custody battles, turned his hatred into a scheme to have her
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Using Blackthorne's own words from earlier testimony, prosecutor
Richard Durbin repeated several times, ''He didn't hate Sheila
Bellush. He just hated the things she did.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing statements came after three weeks of testimony in
the federal trial. Jurors began deliberations shortly after 6 p.m.,
following three hours of final arguments. After a couple of hours,
they ended deliberations until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Lubin argued that the prosecution's
case was built on the testimony of ''a sociopathic liar,'' Daniel
Rocha. Rocha is serving life without parole for solicitation of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rocha is a complete and total manipulator. He has told so many
stories he can't even keep them straight,'' Lubin said. ''His
entire life is a hustle. He always has an angle, always a scam,
always a scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubin said prosecutors put Rocha on the witness stand early in
the trial so jurors would forget how outrageous and disreputable he
is.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed on Nov. 7, 1997, about two months after
moving with her second husband, Jamie Bellush, and six children,
including quadruplets, to Sarasota, Fla. The 2-year-old quadruplets
from her second marriage were discovered unharmed in the house, two
of them crawling in their mother's blood. Jamie Bellush and the
children now live in Sussex County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne, 45, is charged with interstate conspiracy to commit
murder-for-hire and with interstate domestic violence. He faces a
mandatory life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Bellush won custody of their youngest
daughter, Daryl, and left the state.
</P>
<P>
   That, Durbin said, led Blackthorne to hunt down his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush and Blackthorne were divorced in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne testified Monday that he once became so upset after
a daughter fell out of a second-story window that he told Bellush
he would kill her if ''anything happens to my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne has denied accusations that during a trip to Oregon
he asked Rocha, a golfing buddy, to find a hit man to kill his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha testified on the first day of the trial that he contacted
a friend, Sammy Gonzales, who hired his cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro,
the alleged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales also is serving a prison term in Florida for
solicitation of murder. Del Toro, 23, a former high school football
star in Uvalde, is scheduled for trial next month in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin told jurors that in making their decision, they must
consider whether Rocha and Gonzales pinned the murder on
Blackthorne to win a deal as part of a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Allen had nothing to do with this, and the prosecution has not
shown that he does,'' Lubin said. ''The prosecution has to prove
Allen is guilty, and they haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   In rebuttal, assistant U.S. Attorney John Murphy showed once
again photos from the crime scene, including photos of two of
Bellush's quadruplets with blood on their cheeks. The photos
elicited sobs from several of Bellush's friends who were in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''For two and a half years, these people have lived with this
horror,'' Murphy said, pointing to family members. Then he pointed
to Blackthorne. ''The only person with a reason, a motive to kill
Bellush is that man.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy added:
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a motive for it, and that motive was money, and that
motive came from him. He's just as guilty as if he had gone over
and done it himself.''

<HEADLINE> Coleman Testifies at Umpires Hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former National League president Len Coleman
testified Thursday as the grievance resumed for 22 umpires trying
to regain their job.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman issued the decisions last summer of which 13 NL umpires
were let go among the 34 who submitted resignations. He resigned
late last year after commissioner Bud Selig and baseball owners
decided to eliminate the position of league president, effective
with the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was due back Friday before arbitrator Alan Symonette.
While lawyers originally thought testimony would wrap up this week,
it now appears the case will stretch into next month, with
additional hearing dates set for July 14-16.
</P>
<P>
   After owners released the 22 umpires, including nine from the
American League, Richie Phillips' Major League Umpires Association
filed a grievance in an attempt to regain their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While umpires replaced the MLUA during the offseason with the
World Umpires Association, dominated by AL umpires who opposed
Phillips, federal labor law calls for the old union to argue the
grievance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, owners have offered during current bargaining a new
labor contract to rehire an unspecified number of the 22 umps. The
next bargaining session is scheduled for July 5.

<HEADLINE> Fire Roars at Wash. Nuke Reservation  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- A wildfire ignited by a car crash raged
across the dry sagebrush of the Hanford nuclear complex Thursday,
raising fears that the flames would spread radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 homes were destroyed, and about 7,000 people were
driven from their homes by the second blaze in two months to
threaten a U.S. nuclear weapons installation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a fireball two or three times taller than our
house,'' said Marty Peck, 43, who watched the flames approach his
house in Benton City from a mountain about two miles away.
</P>
<P>
   No radiation releases had been detected by state or federal
air-monitoring devices, Department of Energy spokeswoman Julie
Erickson said, though the fire had spread across three old
radioactive waste sites on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which began Tuesday, had scorched 190,000 acres by
Thursday afternoon. The National Weather Service warned of wind up
to 30 mph and a continuation of 100-degree temperatures. Erickson
said the fire was at least 40 percent contained.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was headed to Hanford and
planned to survey the damage Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a blaze that was set to clear brush near the Los Alamos
nuclear weapons laboratory in New Mexico raged out of control,
forcing more than 25,000 people to evacuate and destroying more
than 200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said nuclear material was safely protected in bunkers
at Los Alamos, though there are now fears that radioactive material
in the soil could be washed into rivers and streams from hillsides
denuded by fire.
</P>
<P>
   At Hanford, which contains the nation's largest volume of
radioactive waste from nuclear weapons, the fire was about three
miles from highly radioactive material in an area that once handled
spent nuclear fuel, Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel any of our facilities are imminently threatened
at this time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to discuss how authorities would handle a fire at
nuclear sites or whether radioactive releases were possible under
such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous of the radioactive waste at Hanford -- about
170 miles southeast of Seattle and northeast of Portland, Ore. -- is
in underground tanks. Additional firebreaks were cut to protect
nuclear sites, and Erickson said most are surrounded by gravel.
</P>
<P>
   At about noon Thursday, the fire burned over a former
radioactive waste-disposal area, used to store low-level
radioactive liquid waste during plutonium production, near the
center of the 560-square-mile Energy Department site.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the fire also burned over two waste-storage ponds
that had not been used for many years, Erickson said. Both were dry
and overgrown with vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, on-site monitoring ''indicates there is no
problem,'' said Katie Larson, another DOE spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   All three sites are near the center of the reservation, where
firefighters were working to extinguish two ''hot spots'' Thursday.
The fire line was about three miles from highly radioactive
contamination in an area that once handled spent nuclear fuel,
Erickson said earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-nuclear group warned the fire could burn radioactive
soil and spew contaminated particles into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urge state officials to independently monitor to protect
the public and firefighters from the hazards of airborne
radioactive contaminated particles,'' said Gerald Pollet, director
of Heart of America Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Al Conklin, head of the state Health Department's division of
radiological protection, said the state is using monitoring
devices, and ''we're not going let the Department of Energy get
away with anything if we find anything positive.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point Wednesday, the Energy Department declared an
emergency as flames neared a lab where nuclear and hazardous waste
samples are stored. Winds later pushed the fire away.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the roughly 7,000 people forced from their homes
Wednesday in the communities of West Richland and Benton City, just
south of the reservation, were allowed back into their homes on
Thursday, though residents were warned that they could be asked to
leave again. The Red Cross set up shelters and Gov. Gary Locke
activated the National Guard to assist in evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flames were about three miles away. I could see them from
my living room. They were coming fast. That's when we split,'' said
50-year-old Richard Newby of Benton City, who spent Thursday at an
emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford was established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project
to build the atomic bomb. Plutonium was produced at the site until
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Today, workers at Hanford are cleaning the waste up. About 8,000
non-essential personnel were told to stay home Thursday, leaving
400 to 500 at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the fire season already is the worst since 1996.
More than 48,000 fires have burned 1.3 million acres.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Limited Patient Rights  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted
Thursday night for limited new patient protections, including a
restricted right to sue HMOs, overriding Democratic protests that
the plan was an election-year sham.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 51-47, largely along party lines, and capped two
weeks of intense partisanship in both the House and Senate over
health care issues expected to resonate in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Senate GOP Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the proposal marked a
''significant concession'' over legislation that Republicans
approved last year that barred lawsuits. He also said the proposal
had built on progress made in months of closed-door negotiations
with Democrats on the issue of patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., countered that the bill had
been ''drafted solely by Republicans,'' and fell short of covering
all 161 million insured Americans who would be covered under a
rival plan backed by Democrats and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The vote did little to clarify the future of patients' rights
legislation, one of two major health-related measures that Congress
is considering with in the run-up to the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other, a bill to provide prescription drug coverage to
Medicare recipients, cleared the House on Wednesday under political
circumstances akin to the Senate's vote on patients' rights. On
that issue, it was House Republicans exercising their majority
muscle to advance a bill that Democrats said would do little to
address the needs of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came on an amendment to a spending bill for several
federal agencies. The overall bill was expected to clear the Senate
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan provides several guarantees, including
access to emergency room care, out-of-network physicians and
specialists for an estimated 56 million insured individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that wasn't nearly enough, and instead pushed a
proposal requiring that any protection apply to all Americans with
insurance, a group more than three times larger than the one
Republicans proposed covering. The proposal was rejected 51-47.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Democrats were proposing health insurance run
by the federal government. ''There are a lot of people who don't
want a national health care plan,'' said Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.
''And I can tell you that if I even considered one, they wouldn't
send me back here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., derided the Republican approach
as ''Honey, I shrunk the plan,'' and taunted GOP lawmakers to say
straight out that they oppose patient protection legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association also criticized the bill.
''This is a ploy to feed Big Insurance's deep desire to kill
effective reform,'' said Dr. D. Ted Lewers, board chairman for the
nationwide doctors' lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came on the eve of a 10-day recess, and some GOP
strategists said the political impact of the vote would be to allow
Republicans to be able to tell their constituents they were now on
record in favor of a right to sue HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any Republican who goes back to their state and tries to sell
this ... has a thick skin and a safe seat,'' countered Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case as recently as two weeks ago, when Kennedy
and other Democrats forced a vote on their own plan and most
Republicans opposed, including many of the 13 who are seeking
re-election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said patients would be permitted to file suit in
federal court against HMOs that improperly denied care, as
determined by an independent reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   They said the lawsuit provision would apply to 131 million
insured people, who could seek unlimited economic damages and up to
$350,000 in compensatory damages. Punitive damages would be barred,
as would class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The vote left the fate of so-called patients' rights legislation
muddled.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill grants more extensive protections to more
Americans, and Republicans who broke ranks to support it, led by
Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., told a news conference during the day
to say they would accept nothing less than a bill that covered all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The formal compromise talks appear at a dead end, and an effort
last week by House Speaker Dennis Hastert to bring Norwood and
Senate Republicans together on a compromise also failed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the patient protections, the GOP measure includes
several tax breaks designed to make health care more affordable.
They include full deductibility for Americans who purchase their
own insurance, as well as those who are self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   All 51 votes in favor of the Republican measure were cast by GOP
senators. Forty-three Democrats, joined by Republicans Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, John
McCain of Arizona and Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, were opposed.
Democrats Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii did
not vote.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Reed Fractures Left Wrist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets right-hander Rick Reed fractured
his left wrist Thursday night when Atlanta's Andruw Jones lined a
single off him in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Reed grounded out in the bottom of the inning, then left the
game. He was scheduled to be examined Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed four runs and five hits in three innings, leaving
with the Mets trailing 4-2 after New York scored two runs in the
bottom of the third.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, Reed was hit on the left hand by a liner off the
bat of Milwaukee's Marquis Grissom. Reed also sprained his right
wrist in the game. On May 27, he strained a muscle on his left side
pitching against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he went on the disabled list twice, from April 12-May
3 with a slightly torn left calf muscle and from Aug. 9-Sept. 4
with a strained ligament in the middle finger of his pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 34, has a 4.76 ERA, entering the game with a 4-1 record.

<HEADLINE> Toy Cars in Cereal Boxes Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kellogg Co. is recalling 837,000 toy cars
packaged in cereal boxes because the tires can detach from the car
wheels, posing a choking hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle Creek, Mich., company received two reports of the
tires detaching from the car wheels, but no injuries have been
reported, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Pull'N Go Hot Wheels cars are red and yellow with a
white hood. ''Kellogg's'' is written on the hood, and the number
''5'' and ''Terry Labonte'' is written on the roof. The words
''China'' and ''MFG. FOR KELLOGG CO. TM'' is printed on the
underside. Pulling the car backward a few inches on a surface
causes it to roll forward.
</P>
<P>
   Several grocery stores nationwide sold the cars in specially
marked boxes of Kellogg's Tri-Fun-Pak 40-ounce box, Kellogg's Froot
Loops 43.6-ounce box, Kellogg's Mini-Wheats Frosted Bite Size
58.8-ounce box and Kellogg's Crispix 31.4-ounce box. The cars were
distributed inside the boxes from March to June of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are advised to take the toy cars away from young
children immediately, and send the cars to Kellogg to get a free
replacement item and postage reimbursement. The car can be sent to
Kellogg Company, P.O. Box 185654, Battle Creek, MI 49018-5654. For
more information, consumers can call Kellogg at 1-800-962-0037 or

<HEADLINE> Volcano Evacuation Order Lifted  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMITSUKI, Japan (AP) -- Almost 2,000 people returned to their
homes on a Japanese island island after experts determined that the
chances of a volcano erupting had subsided, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, mild earthquakes continued to shake the island in the
Pacific Ocean, 120 miles south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials partially lifted an evacuation order for the island's
southeastern district of Tsubota Thursday evening and the other
affected areas of the island a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Seiji Asanuma, a town official of Miyakejima, said Friday that
all but a few elderly at nursing homes returned to their homes by
around 10:00 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of the evacuation order followed an announcement by
seismologists in Tokyo Thursday afternoon said chances of an
eruption had subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ''The level of volcanic activity is declining, and there is
almost no chance of eruption that would affect the ground level or
the ocean,'' Hitoshi Takeuchi, a seismologist at the government's
Coordinating Committee for the Prediction of Volcanic Eruptions,
told a news conference nationally televised on the nation's
semi-public NHK.
</P>
<P>
   Takeuchi, however, warned Thursday of continuing earthquakes
centered in the waters off the west coast of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders had spent three hot and humid nights at shelters on
the island's northern district of Kamitsuki, said Miyakejima
spokesman Satoshi Enomoto.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation order was issued Monday to about half of the
4,000 people living on the island after intensifying earthquakes
signaled a possible eruption on Miyakejima, also the name of a
2,686-foot volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Miyakejima has erupted several times in the last 60 years,
including in 1983, but the blasts usually came quickly and were
over in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed or injured in the last eruption because
residents were evacuated in time. Eleven people died, and 20 were
injured in a 1940 eruption.

Illinois Suspends Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Driven by some of the highest gasoline prices in
the nation, Illinois today became the second state to suspend its sales tax on
gas. Legislators, voting in a special session, urged gas stations to pass along
the 5 percent tax savings on the gasoline they sell. If they do, drivers could
see prices fall by 7 or 8 cents a gallon in a state where prices in some areas
have soared well above $2 per gallon. The legislation, which was quickly signed
by Gov. George Ryan, suspends the tax for six months, starting Saturday, and
requires each gas pump to display a sign saying the tax has been lowered and
that prices should reflect the change.

Clinton Faces Hard Mideast Decision

he had not decided how to proceed. After a brief run of shuttle diplomacy,

<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The New York Yankees' pursuit of Chicago Cubs slugger
Sammy Sosa ended tonight when the Yankees traded for Cleveland outfielder David
Justice, according to Sosa's agent. The Yankees and Cubs stepped up negotiations
earlier this week after the Yankees' proposed deal for Juan Gonzalez fell
through, but the two teams could not agree on a package of players. Sosa's
agent, Tom Reich, still expects Sosa to be traded.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- With trade talks resolved for now, the New York
Yankees finally started winning again.
</P>
<P>
   After trading Ricky Ledee for David Justice before the game, the
Yankees beat the Detroit Tigers 8-0 Thursday night behind Andy
Pettitte's second career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Deals for sluggers Juan Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa fell through in
the past week, so the Yankees settled for Cleveland's Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of speculation weighed heavily on the World Series
champions, who are 15-26 since reaching a season-high 13 games over
.500 on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps relieved that all the recent trade talk is finally
resolved, New York went out and hammered Tigers starter Dave Mlicki
(2-9). The Yankees scored eight runs in the fourth inning,
including a record-tying three sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte (8-4), who last pitched Sunday at Chicago, was moved up
a day when Ramiro Mendoza was placed on the disabled list Wednesday
with a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte evened his career record for pitching on three days'
rest to 2-2 by allowing just six hits. He struck out five and
walked two in his first shutout since July 5, 1997, at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have been shut out a major league-high 10 times this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who beat the Yankees to finish the Tigers' three-game
sweep May 14, lasted only 3 1-3 innings and gave up six earned runs
and nine hits. Mlicki had missed his last scheduled start because
of a severe sinus infection.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees sent 13 men to the plate and scored eight times on
eight hits and an error.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's two-run double was the big hit. Bernie Williams
had an RBI triple, Chris Turner a run-scoring double and Chuck
Knoblauch an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Three sacrifice flies occurred because Jose Vizcaino reached
first when his fly ball was dropped by left-fielder Bobby
Higginson, allowing Scott Brosius to score from third. Tino
Martinez and Williams hit conventional sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Higginson and Tigers manager Phil Garner argued that
Vizcaino should've been out because the ball came loose as
Higginson was transferring it to his hand for a throw home. But
third base umpire Jeff Kellogg ruled it no catch.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg is the same umpire who ejected Yankees manager Joe Torre
and bench coach Don Zimmer for arguing a double play call against
New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Tigers, who beat New York 13-6 Wednesday, are now 2-9
in games after they've scored in double digits. ... There have been
three sacrifice flies in an inning once before. The Chicago White
Sox did it on July 1, 1962 against Cleveland. ... Williams is
19-for-44 (.432) on the Yankees' road trip. ... The Tigers failed
to get their first home season series sweep of the Yankees since
1988. The Yankees are just 3-9 in Detroit the last two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 12, Orioles 4  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Brian Daubach snapped out of a slump with two
homers and six RBIs and Tim Wakefield pitched seven strong innings
as the Boston Red Sox broke a five-game losing streak with a 12-4
victory Thursday night over the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, 10-for-67 in June, went 4-for-4 with a three-run homer
in the second inning and a solo shot in the seventh, giving him 13
homers for the season. He had a two-run double in the eighth. Scott
Hatteberg added a three-run homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 8-0, Baltimore scored four in the eighth on Albert
Belle's three-run homer off Wakefield, his 18th of the season, and
pinch-hitter Jeff Conine's solo shot, his 10th, off Sang Lee.
Boston rallied for four runs in the bottom of the inning on a
bases-loaded walk to Jason Varitek, Daubach's double and Jose
Offerman's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who complained publicly about not starting after Jeff
Fassero went on the disabled list June 19, made it tougher for
manager Jimy Williams to return him to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth start of the year and first since June 3, he
struck out two and walked none in 7 1-3 innings, leaving after
Belle's homer. It was the ninth hit off Wakefield (3-5), who went
to three balls on just two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield is a victim of his own versatility, making 24 relief
appearances this year. But he had his best season with Boston as a
starter in 1998 when he went 17-8. And in his last three relief
outings this season, he allowed 12 earned runs in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach gave Boston a 3-0 lead when he followed a single by
instant sensation Morgan Burkhart and a walk to Hatteberg with his
homer, a two-out shot off Scott Erickson (3-6).
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's sacrifice fly made it 4-0 in the fourth. In the next
inning, Hatteberg followed singles by Carl Everett and Burkhart
with his second homer.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart, a 28-year-old rookie who played his first major league
game Tuesday night, quickly has become a fan favorite. The first
baseman-designated hitter went 2-for-2 with three walks and is
6-for-10 with four walks in three games. He's reached base in 11 of
his 14 plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Boston organization last year after four seasons
with the Richmond (Ind.) Roosters of the independent Frontier
League where he hit .404 with 36 homers in 80 games in 1998. With
Triple-A Pawtucket this season, he had 17 homers and 54 RBIs and
hit .283.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who won the first two games of the series in extra
innings, lost for the 10th time in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Red Sox placed RHP Pedro Martinez on the 15-day
disabled list with shoulder and side problems. He can be activated
the day of the All-Star game, July 11. ... Boston extended a
dubious club record streak of allowing homers in 14 consecutive
games. ... Will Clark's eighth-inning double made it 72 games out
of 76 in which Baltimore got an extra-base hit. ... Boston ended
B.J. Surhoff's hitting streak at 21 games, matching his career
high. He was tied for the longest streak in the AL this year until
Toronto's Carlos Delgado stretched his to 22 Thursday afternoon.
... Nomar Garciaparra improved his AL-leading average to .390 by
going 2-for-4.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Los Alamos Relief  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven weeks after fire destroyed hundreds of
homes in New Mexico, the House on Thursday approved $661 million in
compensation for residents and government agencies that suffered
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The package for New Mexico fire victims is part of a larger
package of spending including funding for military anti-drug
efforts in Colombia. The House approved it 306-110 Thursday night,
and the Senate was expected to pass the measure Friday before
leaving for the Fourth of July recess.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for President Clinton said he would sign the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service started a fire May 4 to clear brush in
Bandelier National Monument. That fire got out of control and a
backfire started to control the first got out of control itself,
becoming the Cerro Grande fire that burned 47,000 acres. The blaze
destroyed more than 200 homes in Los Alamos and burned over parts
of the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico lawmakers say the measure is only the first step
toward paying for fire damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress is ready to provide this and more compensation
funding if it is needed,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials have acknowledged they are responsible
for the fire and apologized. Bandelier Superintendent Roy Weaver
was suspended and plans to retire Sunday. Park Service officials
have not determined whether anyone else will be disciplined for
their role in the fire.

<HEADLINE> Rocker back at Shea, retires Mets in eighth  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - New York Mets fan Mike Adler had waited since
last October to ask - actually scream - a question for John Rocker.
So when Atlanta's loudmouth lefty went out to run windsprints
Thursday night, Adler was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't you show us respect?'' shouted Adler, proudly
wearing a Mets shirt. He was speaking for his fellow fans, but the
question applied to gays, immigrants, women and most other groups
offended by Rocker's insensitive and inane remarks about New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker answered semi-pleasantly, autographed two baseballs, then
issued a public apology. But it did little to lower the level of
bile directed at the man Mets fans, among others, love to despise.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's videotaped apology, shown on Shea Stadium's
26-foot-tall screen in left-center field before the start of the
game between the Mets and the Braves, was greeted with lusty boos
by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have apologized and have felt badly for anyone who took my
comments personally,'' Rocker said on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also am fully aware that the overwhelming majority of the
people in this city are extremely charismatic and full of
personality, although a bit spirited at times, but, you know, that
doesn't make them bad people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker went out to the bullpen, with its special protective
cover, without incident before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 46,998 - with many police visible throughout the
stands - was taken out of the game early as the Braves jumped out
to a 4-0 lead. Then as the Mets pulled back to 6-4, and Atlanta's
pitching faltered, the crowd began chanting ''We want Rocker!''
</P>
<P>
   He began warming up in the top of the eighth inning and then
jogged to the mound from the bullpen - instead of his usual sprint
- as he replaced pitcher Jason Marquis. A few objects, including a
ball, were thrown at Rocker in left field as the crowd stood and
booed him.
</P>
<P>
   With police in riot gear standing behind the outfield fence,
Rocker then struck out Robin Ventura, retired Todd Zeile on a
grounder to short, and got Jay Payton to ground out to third.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked to the Braves' dugout, Rocker looked at the crowd
with a slight smirk but did not taunt them like he did during the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted with high-fives from his teammates. Two police
officers stood just outside the dugout and three stood on top of it
as fans jeered.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Rocker took a circuitous route to the
ballpark. With a quick wave and dead silence, he backed off his
pledge to mingle with the denizens of the No. 7 subway.
</P>
<P>
   He instead climbed into a black van to meet with representatives
of the players' union, who encouraged him to stay off the train. He
returned to his hotel before heading out to Shea in another van
with tinted windows.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed riders of the Queens subway line instead turned out
at the ballpark to greet the pitcher-turned-poster-boy for
insulting comments. One sported a sign declaring, ''Rocker Is Da
Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to get booed, big time,'' warned Darwin Pena, 20,
who exited the subway wearing a No. 7 train T-shirt. ''People in
New York don't like being insulted. He might be dodging
batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   At a sparsely attended anti-Rocker rally beneath the subway,
demonstrators held signs proclaiming ''NYC Says No to RocKKKer''
and the less-imaginative ''Rocker's A Bigot.'' Among the
demonstrators were a half-dozen Queens Little Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The fastballer was dubbed ''The Ku Klux Kloser'' after his
racist, homophobic and xenophobic comments in Sports Illustrated in
December. This trip was his first to Shea since last fall's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rocker had promised to ride the subway to the ballpark,
wiser heads - and there are plenty - prevailed on the hurler to
choose a less-public form of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good idea, given that Rocker had redefined political
incorrectness by describing straphangers on the No. 7 line as
''some kid with purple hair ... some queer with AIDS ... some
20-year-old mom with four kids.'' He also complained that New York
has too many foreigners and added: ''How the hell did they get in
this country?''
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of preparations were in place for the Shea return
of the reliever, christened ''Johnny Rotten'' and ''Punk Rocker''
by the New York tabloids. Despite the city's enmity toward him,
Rocker received the type of security ordinarily reserved for heads
of state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to police at his hotel, 700 officers were assigned
to Shea instead of the 60 for most games - New York's finest to
protect Atlanta's swinest. There were police on bicycles and
horses, in vans and buses, in uniform and plainclothes.
</P>
<P>
   A limit on beer sales was imposed. A special protective cover
was erected over the Braves' bullpen in left field. During batting
practice, fans were barred from sitting in the first four rows
behind the Braves' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans had recently handed out fliers on the No. 7 platform
advertising ''John Rocker Battery Night.'' Fans were encouraged to
bring and fling their AAs to greet Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   In response, New York Mets officials promised a zero-tolerance
policy against fans behaving badly in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The road trip to hell is just the latest in a series of
self-inflicted woes for Rocker: a suspension for his comments, his
threats against the writer of the SI piece, and a brief demotion to
the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hindsight being 20/20, I would've loved to have missed my
meeting with the Sports Illustrated reporter and I never would've
had to deal with the whole situation,'' Rocker said in an interview
with TBS, which is owned by the same company that owns the Braves
and Sports Illustrated. ''But then again, that's the hand I've been
dealt and I'll have to make the best of it.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Spends Day Out of Spotlight  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Now that his American saga has drawn to a close,
Elian Gonzalez began a new chapter Thursday in his homeland, where
officials say they will work to provide the boy with as normal a
life as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of turmoil -- and with Cuba's government
planning to continue the mass mobilization inspired by his plight --
normalcy will be a big transition for the brown-haired 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   On his first full day back in Cuba, Elian was far from the
public eye, with his father, stepmother, baby half-brother and
other relatives in a specially prepared boarding school in Havana's
upscale Playa neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I imagine that Elian and his family must be very happy that
they have now returned to daily Cuban family life,'' Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Aymee Hernandez said Thursday. ''At this
moment he must be doing what all children do in Cuba, having
breakfast, sharing closeness with his papa and his papa's wife, who
will take on the role of his mama.''
</P>
<P>
   In several weeks, Elian will return to his former life in the
small port city of Cardenas, live in the same modest home with his
father. He will go back to the Marcelo Salado elementary school,
where his classmates transformed his empty desk into a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he doesn't receive any special treatment, the little
boy who loved kites in Cuba and wore a Batman cape in Miami will
always be special.
</P>
<P>
   He will be remembered by the hundreds of thousands of Cubans who
marched and chanted and wore T-shirts with his portrait during a
seven-month campaign to bring him home as the ''boy hero,'' the
''symbolic child,'' the ''elfin prince.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He will always be, rather than a normal citizen, a symbol, an
example and a glory for all the children of Cuba and pride for all
the teachers of Cuba,'' the government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ''our self-denying teachers and pedagogues must
undertake the masterful work of making him a model child, worthy of
his history, his strengths and talent,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives in Miami, who fought a bitter battle to retain
custody, argued the boy would be subjected to political persecution
if he returned. They took Elian in after he was rescued off
Florida's coast when the boat carrying him from Cuba sank, killing
his mother and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of returning Elian to Cuba predicted he would be
forced to denounce his mother as a traitor for attempting to take
him to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there's been no sign so far that or any other persecution.
Cuba has described Elian's mother as a good woman whose boyfriend
bullied her into taking the child on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Elian's return also fear the boy will be
indoctrinated in communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   In a socialist society, with a father who is a Communist Party
member, that will be inevitable -- and not just for Elian. The Cuban
Child Code calls for all youth to be protected from ''influence
contrary to their communist formation.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also hopes to push forward with the mass
mobilization inspired by the Elian campaign to press for an end to
the 40-year-old U.S. embargo on Cuba and to U.S. laws that grant
asylum to any Cuban who makes it to American shores.
</P>
<P>
   A new rally is already organized for Saturday in the
southeastern city of Manzanillo, which an estimated 200,000 people
are expected to attend. Cuban officials say the U.S. laws encourage
illegal, dangerous trips across the Florida Straits like the one
that killed Elian's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Elian, we have saved a marvelous child, but millions of
innocent creatures, older or younger than Elian but equally loved
run the risk of drowning, dying or suffering horrible tragedies,''
a government statement said in the official newspaper Granma.
</P>
<P>
   State television, meanwhile, repeated broadcasts of Elian's
arrival at Havana's Jose Marti Airport a day earlier and showed new
footage of his first few hours on Cuban soil.
</P>
<P>
   A jubilant Elian was seen playing with children his age, running
around a large reception room and laughing as he ate a cracker and
adults and family members chatted in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The footage also showed Elian's motorcade leaving the airport
grounds and being cheered on by residents along the road.
</P>
<P>
   As he readusts to life in Cuba, Elian will work on his studies,
helped by his teachers and classmates, who moved into the boarding
school with him to help him complete the first grade in time to
begin the second in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family moved into two-story white stucco house by
the sea after a muted arrival Wednesday at Havana's Jose Marti
airport. They will stay there the shortest time necessary to
restart his life ''the most normal and peaceful conditions,'' the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was unhappy about what
values taught during his son's brief time at a private Miami
school. The Lincoln-Marti School teaches students that President
Fidel Castro oppresses Cubans. Classes are taught in English and
children salute the American flag -- a hated symbol of Cuba's
fiercest enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was returned to his father by federal agents who raided
the Miami relatives' home on April 22. He then spent two months in
the Washington area with his father, relatives and friends waiting
for legal appeals to play out.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Elian reportedly made much scholastic progress
and the government says he can now read and write.
</P>
<P>
   Once ready, his family will return to Cardenas, where the
government said the people will do everything to ensure that Elian
has as normal a life as possible ''after all the suffering he has
put up with and which converted him into the most famous and
well-known child in the world.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Colombia, Disaster Funds  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders resolved a last-minute snag Thursday
and whisked through the House an $11.2 billion emergency package
bearing money for Colombia's drug war, the Pentagon and storm
victims at home.
</P>
<P>
   Months in the making, the bill was approved by a bipartisan
margin of 306-110. The Senate was all but certain to give it final
approval on Friday, when Congress' Fourth of July break is
scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling that he would sign the measure, President Clinton said
afterward, ''While it contains certain flaws, in total this bill
will make our nation safer and more secure by meeting essential and
long-overdue needs at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The last impasse was broken after House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., relented and agreed to keep language off the bill lifting
food sanctions against Cuba. Senate opponents who said it did not
liberalize trade enough had threatened to derail the entire
spending bill unless it was free of the sanctions language.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuba provision, worked out earlier this week between
farm-state and anti-Castro lawmakers, will now await inclusion in
the final version of an agriculture spending bill later this
summer, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the emergency package was $1.3 billion to help
Colombia battle drug producers and their heavily armed guerrilla
allies, who control much of the southern part of the country.
Clinton and Hastert made that aid a priority as part of an effort
to stanch the flow of Colombian cocaine and heroin into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Their combined drive for the money overcame opposition by
members of both parties. Opponents cited allegations of Colombian
human rights abuses, fear of U.S. involvement in an unwinnable,
four-decade-long conflict, and a preference to use the money for
drug prevention programs at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''A profound mistake,'' is how Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
described the Colombian aid.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money is for purchasing 60 Blackhawk and Huey
helicopters for the Colombians, training and equipping
counternarcotics battalions, and intelligence activity. There would
also be money for human rights programs in Colombia, for Bolivia,
Ecuador and other nearby countries, and for U.S. aircraft
performing anti-drug surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time for us to reach out a helping hand to Colombia,''
Hastert said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But the election-year bill was also packed with hundreds of
millions of dollars for lawmakers' home districts. The House and
Senate each alloted $105 million for members' projects.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of U.S. Senate candidates -- Reps. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and
Bob Franks, R-N.J. -- had projects to boast about. Lazio was
trumpeting $6 million for homeless shelters nationwide, part of
which was going for a veterans' shelter in Buffalo, N.Y. Franks won
$41 million for New Jersey communities damaged by floods spawned by
last September's Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   There was also $500,000 to extend a bicycle path in the northern
Virginia district of Rep. James Moran, D-Va.; $1 million to repair
a federal hurricane-chaser plane based in the Tampa district of
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.; and $5
million to continue work on a sealife institute in Seward, Alaska,
home state of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., top Democrat on the Appropriations
Committee, won $25 million for a federal firearms training center
and $7 million for Army research on computer security, both in his
home state. And there is $16 million to clean up uranium processing
plants in Kentucky and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., won
language clearing the way for the $273 million Lewis and Clark
rural water system, which will serve the southeastern portion of
the state. The bill only supplied $600,000 for a study.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also included $2 billion to repay the Pentagon for the
costs of 5,700 U.S. members of the NATO peacekeeping team in
Kosovo. There was also $4.4 billion more for fuel, health care and
other Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there was $661 million for rebuilding from the
government-set fires that ravaged Los Alamos, N.M., and about $360
million to help North Carolina and other states recover from last
September's Hurricane Floyd and other agricultural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed a $5.2 billion package at the beginning of the
year, and the House approved its own $13 billion version in March.
But the bill ground to a halt in the Senate, where Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said it threatened to grow too large.
</P>
<P>
   But steady pressure for action was applied by Colombian
President Andres Pastrana and the Pentagon, which was facing budget
shortfalls because of the expenses of deploying U.S. troops as
peacekeepers in Kosovo. GOP leaders decided two weeks ago to try
finishing the bill before July.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency money was attached to a routine $8.8 billion
measure financing military construction projects for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is HR4425.

<HEADLINE> Govts. Urged To Back Somali Peace  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council gave strong support
Thursday to a proposal aimed at ending a decade of violence in
Somalia, and urged governments to provide political and financial
backing to the process.
</P>
<P>
   In an open session of the council, the east African nation of
Djibouti, the author of the initiative, said a peace conference
currently under way is making great progress and may be the last
chance to save the Somali people from the ongoing fighting.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 Somali delegates -- including elders and political
leaders -- have been meeting in the town of Arta in neighboring
Djibouti since May 2, with the goal of writing a charter and
establishing a transitional assembly to restore a central
government to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Somali warlords have snubbed the conference
launched by Djibouti's President Ismail Omar Guellah, the Security
Council urged them to join the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The conference ''has made great progress'' so far, Djibouti's
U.N. Ambassador Roble Olhaye told the council, and ''Somalia
appears to be on its way ... to genuine dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the council that delegates were expected to reach an
agreement by July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has not had a central government since 1991, when
warlords conspired to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, then turned
on each other as the country disintegrated into warring fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
   An American-led U.N. peacekeeping mission from 1992 through 1995
failed to reconcile the factions.
</P>
<P>
   Olhaye said the current conference gave voice to the people of
Somalia, rather than only to the factional leaders, who have so far
failed to end fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of the council expressed concern though that
the warlords still refused to take part in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would encourage all regions of Somalia to take part in the
peace and reconciliation process,'' said British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, who governs the breakaway republic of
Somaliland, along with faction leaders Hussein Aidid and Osman Ali
Atto oppose the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States appeared cautious and warned of the
difficulties ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the current discussions in Djibouti produce a
blueprint for an interim government, we must remember that this is
only the first step and perhaps the easiest step toward the
rehabilitation of Somalia,'' said deputy U.S. ambassador Nancy
Soderberg.
</P>
<P>
   Some 750,000 people in Somalia are affected by the severe
drought that has hit the entire Horn of Africa. The council called
on the warring factions to assure the safety and freedom of
movement of humanitarian workers bringing aid to Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 5, Cubs 4, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit a tape-measure homer not long
after learning he wouldn't be traded to the Yankees, but the
Chicago Cubs blew a late two-run lead in losing to Pittsburgh 5-4
in 10 innings Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kendall hit a tying two-run homer in the eighth after the
Cubs' second defensive lapse of the game, then won it with a
bases-loaded single through a drawn-in infield in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Meares singled with one out in the 10th off Tim Worrell
(0-1) and Mike Benjamin, 3-for-6 as a pinch-hitter, blooped a
double down the left-field line. Warren Morris was intentionally
walked before Kendall stroked a single between third and short for
his third RBI of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Wilkins (1-0) got the victory despite walking two in a
scoreless 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brant Brown, reacquired in a trade Chicago was able to make, hit
a go-ahead two-run home run, but the Cubs couldn't hold leads of
3-1 and 4-2 in losing for the eighth time in nine games. They are
2-7 on a 12-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was shut out in trade talks as the Cubs broke off trade
negotiations with the Yankees after New York dealt instead for
David Justice. But he ended an eight-game homerless streak with a
448-foot solo drive into the center-field seats, not long after
play resumed in the eighth following a 40-minute rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   The homer off Josias Manzanillo was Sosa's 21st, his first since
June 18 against Montreal and his 150th since Opening Day 1998 -- a
span of less than 2&AMP;frac12; seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's homer made it 4-2, but the Pirates tied it in their half
of the eighth on Kendall's two-run, two-out homer off reliever Todd
Van Poppel. Kendall was batting only because shortstop Ricky
Gutierrez let an apparent inning-ending grounder by Morris roll
through his legs for the Cubs' second error.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel had retired the first five batters he faced after
replacing starter Kevin Tapani, the first four on strikeouts.
Tapani, 5-1 in his career against Pittsburgh, allowed two runs --
one earned -- over six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who rejoined the Cubs in a three-team trade June 9, broke
a 1-all tie by following Jose Nieves' two-out infield single with a
drive into the right field seats in the sixth off Jose Silva.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Brown was traded to the Pirates after the 1998
season for Jon Lieber, who pitched 7 1-3 innings Wednesday night as
the Cubs ended a five-game losing streak by beating Pittsburgh 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took a 1-0 lead in the third on shortstop Pat Meares'
two-base throwing error on Sosa's grounder. Silva began the inning
by walking Joe Girardi ahead of Eric Young's one-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young hit his 11th homer in the Pirates' fifth. Kendall
scored on Wil Cordero's infield single in the sixth after taking
advantage of a driving rain that made throwing difficult. After
walking, Kendall immediately stole second and moved on to third as
catcher Girardi threw wildly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cordero failed to start for the sixth time in seven games
because of a lingering case of the stomach flu. He entered in the
fourth when LF Bruce Aven left with a strained left hamstring. ...
Tapani failed to last at least seven innings for only the second
time in 12 starts. ... The Pirates have won consecutive games only
once this month. ... The Cubs are 1-5 against the Pirates.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop Unharmed After Standoff  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- An unemployed man from El Salvador who took
the state's top-ranking Catholic clergyman hostage allegedly
threatened to kill them both if the archbishop didn't help him
obtain papers about his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you do not assist me in getting what I need, then I will
commit suicide and I will kill you,'' the man said, according to
Archbishop Patrick Flores.
</P>
<P>
   The man threatened to detonate a hand grenade, but it turned out
the device had no powder and could not be ignited.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old archbishop, who was pushed to the ground at the
beginning of Wednesday's nine-hour standoff but was not hurt, spent
the night in a hospital for observation and was released Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference about two hours later, Flores at
times cracked jokes to the delight of relatives and chancery
workers seeing him for the first time since the ordeal. Asked how
he felt, he replied, ''I'm alive,'' and his eyes welled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said the hostage-taker was distraught over being deported
in December.
</P>
<P>
   The man told Flores that although he has lived in the United
States for 25 years and is married to a U.S. citizen, he was
deported for a 15-year-old marijuana possession charge. Police have
said the man was facing deportation for driving with a suspended
license.
</P>
<P>
   The man said he decided to take Flores hostage to make a
statement ''because he knew that I was very important and because
he wanted to use me as bait,'' the archbishop said.
</P>
<P>
   The man also said he resented the church for accepting the money
of the poor when taking up collections. Flores quoted him as
saying, ''I hate this country. I hate the church. I hate, hate,
hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Antonio Escolero, 40, surrendered Wednesday night after
police faxed him the immigration papers he was demanding. He was
charged with two counts of aggravated kidnapping and was being held
at the Bexar County Jail in lieu of $2 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero's attorney, Pat Hancock, said no decision has been made
on what type of plea to enter, but he will try to get the bond
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Escolero was a construction worker before his
deportation, but that he has not been able to find work since he
returned illegally. He has had trouble providing for his three
children, who are U.S. citizens, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have your family here, you have your wife that you care
about, you have children, you have worked hard in this community
and then you find out that everything's going to be taken away from
you,'' Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero's wife, Dora, said Thursday that her husband had tried
to become a legal resident but continued to run into barriers
because of previous convictions, including burglary of a vehicle
and driving with a suspended license.
</P>
<P>
   She said they couldn't afford a lawyer and she had been pressing
him to get a job to support their children, ages 16, 12 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got depressed, but I didn't think he was going to do a
thing like this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said the man first approached him in the parking lot of
the Catholic chancery around 10 a.m. Wednesday. They went to his
third-floor office to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said the man pushed him to the ground. He called for help
and his 73-year-old secretary, Myrtle Sanchez, came in and also was
taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The man demanded to talk to Attorney General Janet Reno and Gov.
George W. Bush. Flores and Sanchez helped him to make the calls and
ask for Spanish speakers, and ultimately the man got on the phone
with the FBI and San Antonio police officers. He spent several
hours airing his grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 7 p.m., police faxed him the immigration documents
he wanted. And Flores guaranteed him that if he were freed, he
would help the man find a lawyer and provide his family with food.
</P>
<P>
   ''I repeated three or four times, 'In the name of God, in the
name of Jesus, I ask you not to use that weapon,''' Flores said.
''All of the sudden, he said, 'OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man placed the device on the archbishop's desk and both
walked out.

<HEADLINE> Braves 6, Mets 4  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Back at Shea Stadium, John Rocker was in total
control -- of his mouth and his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by police everywhere he went and booed for everything
he did, Rocker ran in from the bullpen and pitched a perfect eighth
inning Thursday night as the Atlanta Braves beat New York 6-4,
ending the Mets' seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Taunted and called ''stupid'' by Rocker last year, Mets fans had
been waiting for this moment long before opening day. Turns out,
they saw more of the Braves reliever than they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, though, did not get to watch him ride the No. 7
subway train to Shea. After an afternoon meeting at the players'
union, he rode an unmarked police van to the park and was the last
Braves player to arrive, escorted in through the shielded-off
picnic area.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes before the first pitch, a videotape of Rocker's
pregame statement to the media was shown on the 26-foot-high
scoreboard. He again apologized for his bigoted remarks about New
York's diverse population that got him a two-week suspension,
adding, ''I am not the evil person that has been portrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, though, he was nasty.
</P>
<P>
   As Rocker jogged in to replace Jason Marquis to start the
eighth, a few objects -- including a ball -- were thrown from the
stands. With an estimated 700 police personnel packed all over the
park, the crowd of 46,998 jeered as Rocker warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker also was booed when he tied his shoelaces and asked for a
change of balls. The heckling did not unnerve him, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker struck out Robin Ventura and retired Todd Zeile and Jay
Payton on grounders. He threw 18 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the Braves dugout -- police were on top, in front and
standing inside -- Rocker looked at the crowd with a slight smirk
but did not mock the fans as he did during last October's NL
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Braves teammates greeted Rocker with high-fives, and he was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an excitable guy. He was throwing about 96 miles an
hour,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He wasn't too
distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker declined to talk after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Up until his appearance, Rocker had a relatively easy night.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker threw a couple of balls into the stands, shook hands and
chatted with fans before the game. Once it began, he wandered under
cover to the bullpen in the fourth inning and even signed a few
autographs for his guards.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker sat beneath on awning especially erected to protect him.
There were plenty of other precautions -- beer sales were limited
and cut off early, surveillance cameras were installed to watch the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga homered, tripled and drove in four runs as
Atlanta won the opener of a four-game series for the NL East lead.
The teams met for the first time since the NL championship series,
which the Braves won in six tense games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza hit a two-run single, giving him an RBI in a Mets
record 12 straight games. He became the first NL player to
accomplish that feat since Rip Collins in 1935 for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza also singled to start a two-run sixth that closed New
York to 6-4. Earlier, the All-Star catcher made a rare mental
mistake, losing track of how many outs there were with two runners
on base.
</P>
<P>
   Winner John Burkett (6-3) started in place of Greg Maddux, who
felt ill after arriving at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   After Rocker worked the eighth, Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a
perfect ninth for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga hit a sinking liner under center fielder Payton's
glove for an RBI triple in the first. Galarraga launched a
three-run homer, his 19th, for a 4-0 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters before he served up Galarraga's homer, Mets
right-handed starter Rick Reed (4-2) sustained a fractured left
wrist when hit by Andruw Jones' line-drive single. Reed will be
examined further on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan hit an RBI single in the Braves fifth, right after
Piazza's mistake. Piazza walked away from the plate holding the
ball after Galarraga struck out, thinking it was the third out, and
Jones snuck from second base to third.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras singled home a run in the sixth for a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: At 13-14 in June, the Braves need to win Friday night to
avoid their first losing month since September 1996. ... Kansas
City's Mike Sweeney had an RBI in 13 straight games last season.
... Maddux will start Saturday. ... Atlanta activated rookie SS
Rafael Furcal from the 15-day disabled list. He had been sidelined
by a strained right hamstring. ... Reed has won only once in his
last 10 starts. ... Braves RHP Rudy Seanez underwent ligament
transplant surgery on his right elbow and will miss the rest of the
season.

<HEADLINE> UN Leaders Pledge To Protect Serbs  </HEADLINE>
By ELIDA RAMADANI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. officials pledged Thursday to
take new steps to protect the Serb community in Kosovo, signing a
deal aimed at persuading moderate leaders to cooperate in
administering the province.
</P>
<P>
   The deal struck by the top U.N. official in Kosovo and a
prominent Serb cleric will create a special security task force to
protect the minority community, which has been targeted in the year
since NATO-led troops entered the province after a 78-day air war.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important moment,'' said the top U.N. official in
Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner. ''We have decided to improve the security
for all communities in Kosovo, mainly the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Serbs have fled the province fearing
attacks leveled in revenge for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's decade-long campaign of repression against ethnic
Albanians. Dozens of attacks in recent weeks have only increased
concerns that alliance peacekeepers had failed to create the
conditions to allow Serbs to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is important to Kouchner, in part because it allows him
to keep the moderate Serbs close to the day-to-day workings of the
province -- and avert an embarrassing retreat from the government.
Serb leaders had been pressuring the United Nations to act in light
of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Serbs agreed last Sunday to resume participation with
ethnic Albanians in the U.N. led interim government after the
second boycott of its workings in the past half year. The boycotts
were prompted by growing concern about the inability to stop
attacks on the dwindling Kosovo Serb community by ethnic Albanians
seeking to get even for the Serb crackdown that ended after
Milosevic pulled his troops out a year ago, and allowed NATO in.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the United Nations promised to improve its
efforts in the realm of criminal justice, promising to ''take
special measures, including the development of a neighborhood watch
system to maximize the protection and freedom of movement of the
Serb community in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The other measures include intensifying efforts to recruit and
train Serbs as part of the local police force; appointing more
international judges and prosecutors and creating a special
committee charged with overseeing the protection of religious
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The document also calls for getting local Kosovo Serb judges to
take part, along with foreign magistrates, in the
war-and-ethnic-crime tribunal to be established in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Royals 6, Indians 1  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Carlos Beltran homered from both sides
of the plate, and Chad Durbin gave up only five hits in 8 2-3
innings as Kansas City rolled to a 6-1 victory Thursday night over
the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin (2-3), who got rocked for nine runs on nine hits in just
1 1-3 innings the other time he faced Cleveland on May 11, allowed
only two runners as far as second base until Russell Branyan hit an
RBI double with two outs in the ninth. It was his first victory
since winning his major league debut on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin, recalled from Triple-A Omaha on June 23, had five walks
and six strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Bottalico got the last out.
</P>
<P>
   After seven innings, the Royals had only three hits, all solo
home runs. Kansas City took a 1-0 lead after Cleveland starter
Bartolo Colon walked the first four batters in the first, tying a
major league record.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were playing their first game without slugger David
Justice. Cleveland's RBI leader was dealt to the New York Yankees
for outfielder Ricky Ledee and two players to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Colon (7-5) began the night by walking Johnny Damon, Jeff
Reboulet and Mike Sweeney. Then on a 3-2 count, he walked Jermaine
Dye to force in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Quinn had a sacrifice fly and Joe Randa an RBI fielder's
choice, giving the Royals three runs in the inning without a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 pitches Colon threw in the first inning, 20 were
balls. Colon went 3 2-3 innings, gave up five runs on just two hits
and six walks. He struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals then added three more runs on solo homers. Randa and
Beltran hit consecutive shots in the fourth, then Beltran homered
from the right side off reliever Andrew Lorraine in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The slumping Beltran, who also singled in the eighth, is just
the fourth man in Royals history to homer both right- and
left-handed in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   After losing 12-1 in the first game of the three-game series,
the Royals held the power-laden Indians to two runs in the next two
games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: After dealing Justice, the Indians made it clear they might
not be done with trades. Manager Charlie Manuel said he's still
looking for ''one more big bat, try to get a starting pitcher and
one back-end bullpen guy.'' ... Roberto Alomar made a great play at
second. With Reboulet on first and none out in the fifth, Sweeney
hit a hard grounder to Alomar's right. He left his feet to make a
lunging catch, then twisted his body around and made an underhanded
scoop throw to SS Omar Vizquel just in time for the force at
second. ... When they score five or more runs, the Royals are
32-12. Scoring fewer than five, they're 5-28. ... The other Royals
to homer from both sides of the plate were Willie Wilson and U.L.
Washington in 1979 and Chili Davis in 1997. ... SS Rey Sanchez tied
a Royals record with his 52nd consecutive errorless game.

<HEADLINE> Affluent village looks to fence itself off  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUXEDO PARK, N.Y. (AP) - Gated communities are favored by the
wealthy set for their tight security designed to keep out
undesirable elements like crooks.
</P>
<P>
   Or deer.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing an outbreak of Lyme disease, and leery of blasting away
at the fuzzy, woodlands creatures, trustees in this affluent Orange
County locale are considering a $2 million fence around the entire,
350-house village to keep out deer which host the ticks that carry
Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   A recent phone survey by the village police department claims at
least 39 residents have had Lyme disease; 32 of whom say they
contracted the illness since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The survey comes as village officials are debating what to do
about homeowners building fences to keep out deer, reported the
Times Herald-Record of Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about appearances, trustees earlier this year put a
temporary ban on fence building and now are drafting a law to
tighten fence regulations once the moratorium is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But trustees hope to render individual fences unnecessary by
building a $2 million fence around the entire village, perhaps as
early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease isn't the only concern. Residents are tired of deer
browsing through gardens, strolling in front of cars and leaving
their droppings on lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Deer hunting is forbidden in the village and some resident worry
about the danger to humans. In March, though, the village began
allowing residents to seek ''damage nuisance control permits'' from
the state Department of Environmental Conservation to kill deer on
their property.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Get Justice From Cleveland  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees acquired a slugging outfielder -- no, it
wasn't Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to boost their struggling team, the Yankees traded
outfielder Ricky Ledee and two players to be named to the Cleveland
Indians on Thursday for David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had a tentative deal for Detroit's Juan Gonzalez
fall through because they couldn't agree to a contract with the
outfielder and their bid for Sosa ended when they couldn't agree on
players with the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs apparently wanted at least five Yankees prospects,
including several considered among the best in the New York farm
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a player who was desirable if they couldn't pull off a
Sammy Sosa or Juan Gonzalez deal,'' Indians general manager John
Hart said. ''We were waiting in line.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of speculation have weighed heavily on the World
Series champions, who are 16-26 since reaching a season-high 13
games over .500 on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy, and hopefully this will quiet things down so we can
focus on baseball,'' manager Joe Torre said after the Yankees beat
Detroit 8-0. ''Hopefully, it takes some of the distractions away so
we can focus.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning three titles in the last four years, the Yankees
would not be one of the four AL playoff teams if the season ended
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are three games behind Toronto in the AL East and
five behind Oakland in the wild-card race. They were 10th in the
league in scoring and fourth in ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who have won five straight AL Central division
titles, are 8&AMP;frac12; games behind the Chicago White Sox in part because
their pitching staff has been decimated by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and New York have combined to win the last five AL
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Traditionally, the Yankees and Indians aren't clubs that can
make a deal,'' Hart said. ''But the Yankees have been struggling of
late and we've been struggling due to injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has been pressuring his
''baseball people'' to make a trade and questioned Ledee's
toughness earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball lawyer said the deal ends the Yankees' pursuit of
Sosa. If the Yankees make another major move, it would be for
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think ultimately Sammy will be traded,'' said Tom Reich,
Sosa's agent. ''This one got real close. But there was a difference
of opinion on the players. But I think ultimately there is a deal
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also are looking to add pitching, with starters
Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright out with injuries. The deal also
frees up money to re-sign Manny Ramirez, who is eligible for free
agency after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Justice is making $7 million a year through 2002; while Ledee is
making just $240,000 this season and isn't eligible for salary
arbitration until after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was simple economics,'' Hart said. ''This ballclub
certainly has it's eyes on winning in '00 and absolutely have our
eyes on retooling for the '01 season.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice, a left-handed hitter who should excel with the short
right-field porch at Yankee Stadium, was hitting .265 with 21
homers and a team-high 58 RBIs for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stunned,'' Justice said. ''But business is business.
That's the game we play. I'll go there and play hard like I do
everywhere. I've never really felt comfortable there as an opposing
player.''
</P>
<P>
   He will likely be used as either a left fielder or designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gives us a powerful force, plus he's a good hitter,'' Torre
said. ''He's gonna do a lot for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, whose name has been linked in rumored trades for Jim
Edmonds, Gonzalez and Sosa, has struggled all season. He is hitting
.241 with seven homers and 31 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never fulfilled his potential as far as the Yankees,''
Indians manager Charlie Manuel said. ''He's got some pop in his bat
and has a chance to be a good bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams have agreed on a list of 5-to-6 second-tier prospects
of which Cleveland can choose two before Aug. 1. Pitcher Jake
Westbrook, who went 0-2 with a 13.50 ERA in three appearances with
New York, is believed to be one of the players on the list.

Senate OKs Limited Patient Rights
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voting largely along party lines tonight, the
Republican-controlled Senate voted for limited new patient protections,
including a restricted right to sue HMOs. Democrats had called the plan an
election-year sham. The 51-47 vote capped two weeks of intense partisanship in
both the House and Senate over health care issues expected to resonate in the
fall campaign. Senate GOP Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the proposal marked a
''significant concession'' over legislation that Republicans approved last year
that barred lawsuits.

   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- A wildfire ignited by a car crash raged across the

flames would spread radioactive material. At least 25 homes were destroyed, and
about 7,000 people were driven from their homes by the second blaze in two
months to threaten a U.S. nuclear weapons installation. The fire, which began
Tuesday, had scorched 190,000 acres and the National Weather Service warned of
wind up to 30 mph and a continuation of 100-degree temperatures.

Illinois Suspends Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Driven by some of the highest gasoline prices in
the nation, Illinois today became the second state to suspend its sales tax on
gas. Legislators, voting in a special session, urged gas stations to pass along
the 5 percent tax savings on the gasoline they sell. If they do, drivers could
see prices fall by 7 or 8 cents a gallon in a state where prices in some areas
have soared well above $2 per gallon. The legislation, which was quickly signed
by Gov. George Ryan, suspends the tax for six months, starting Saturday, and
requires each gas pump to display a sign saying the tax has been lowered and
that prices should reflect the change.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Release 21 Captives  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- Smiling broadly, 21 U.N. peacekeepers
arrived Thursday in the Liberian capital after being held for weeks
at a rebel base in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The country's feared Revolutionary United Front rebels handed
over the Indian captives late Wednesday to Liberian authorities in
the remote border town of Foya, officials said. They were
transported to Monrovia Thursday by a government-chartered
helicopter and expected to arrive back in Sierra Leone on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 U.N. troops from India remained surrounded,
however, in a U.N. compound in the rebel stronghold of Kailahun,
about 200 miles east of the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown. Their
fate, along with 11 unarmed military observers trapped in Kailahun
was still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Mulbah said Liberia ''wants the fighting to stop'' to allow
their safe passage from the area.
</P>
<P>
   The released captives, who had been held in the nearby town of
Pendembu since early June, were ''unconditionally released,''
according to Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah.
</P>
<P>
   The troops said they had been well treated by their captors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a good relationship with the RUF, no problem
whatsoever,'' said Lt. Col. Amit Sharma, as he drank bottles of
Coca-Cola at the Indian consulate in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the move by rebels
and hoped the move would be followed by ''immediate and
unconditional freedom of movement'' for the besieged troops, said
deputy U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council on Thursday neared agreement on a
resolution that would impose an embargo on the sale of Sierra Leone
diamonds and tighten the 1998 arms embargo for at least 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the peacekeepers was negotiated by a team
appointed by Liberian President Charles Taylor, the rebels' closest
regional ally during Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war, which was
supposed to have ended with the signing of a peace accord last
July.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also helped negotiate the release last month of 500 U.N.
peacekeepers seized as rebels resumed fighting in early May. Unlike
the earlier hostages, which were released after being held for
three weeks, the 200 besieged peacekeepers have been allowed to
keep their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Although an alliance of pro-government forces has managed to
push rebels away from the capital in recent weeks, government
soldiers and their allies from a former junta turned their guns on
each other Wednesday in the strategic town of Masiaka, about 45
miles east of the Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Six government and 15 junta soldiers were killed in the
exchange, Sierra Leone military officials said Thursday, speaking
on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear what
prompted the clash between the uneasy allies who fought on opposing
sides during the war.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers were sent to restore order in Masiaka after
the shooting, U.N. military spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Coker said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Leonean government and its backers, including
Britain, accuse Taylor of using his position as mediator to protect
Liberia's alleged economic stake in the rebels' diamond mining
activities in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia has also been accused of sending weapons and mercenaries
to aid the rebels, but vehemently denies the claims.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF rebels killed tens of thousands of civilians and
systematically maimed many more in a campaign of terror.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia-Eritrea Talks Move to D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Indirect talks between Ethiopia and
Eritrea aimed at finding a permanent peace between the warring
neighbors will take place in Washington, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea said they have sent technical teams to the
United States to discuss demarcation of their disputed 620-mile
border, compensation for deportees and the origins of their 2-year
war.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mediation of the Organization of African Unity, the
two impoverished nations agreed June 18 to cease hostilities in a
conflict that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands on both
sides. U.S. special envoy Anthony Lake helped broker the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   However, many issues were left unresolved, and the accord fell
short of a full, unconditional cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of fighting since. But Ethiopia says
it will not withdraw its forces from parts of Eritrea they occupy
until U.N. peacekeepers are deployed in a buffer zone 15 miles
inside Eritrean territory as agreed to under the OAU accord. This
could take months, according to diplomats involved in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Since Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, their
common border has never been formally settled.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said the
talks will start on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian spokeswoman Selome Taddesse and Eritrean presidential
spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel told The Associated Press by telephone
that their delegations, made up of legal and technical experts,
would arrive in the United States on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva on Thursday, the United Nations called for more
control over the flow of arms to the Horn of Africa, highlighting
donors' fears that relief aid could be diverted to war efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The possibility of the diversion of funds from relief and
development programs, aiming to alleviate poverty, to war efforts
remains a recurrent concern,'' said a statement from the U.N. task
force responsible for developing a strategy to protect the region
from the effects of recurrent drought and feeding problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea are heavily reliant on international
assistance to help feed millions of drought victims.

<HEADLINE> Chile 3, Paraguay 1  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Klever Chala and Eduardo Hurtado each scored to push
Ecuador
past Peru 2-1 Thursday in a qualifying game for the 2002 World Cup.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chala initiated the scoring in the 14th minute with a
shoulder-high shot on a ball softly passed by Hurtado with his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado scored the second goal in the 50th minute, taking
advantage of a bouncing free kick in front of the Peruvian net.
</P>
<P>
   After a listless first half in Quito, Peru came back to score
its lone goal in the 74th minute on a free kick by Nolberto Solano
that Juan Pajuelo nudged past goalie Jose Cevallos with his head.
</P>
<P>
   Chile got its first victory in qualifying, beating Paraguay 3-1
at Santiago. In a late game, Argentina was at Colombia.
Ecuador 2, Peru 1
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador dominated the first half, demonstrating an orderly
offense, keeping the play in front of Peru's net. However, Ecuador
forward Agustin Delgado missed two clear opportunities to score.
</P>
<P>
   Peru came back in the second half after Ecuador coach Hernan
Dario Gomez pulled midfielder Alex Aguinaga and forwards Hurtado
and Agustin Delgado in the 70th minute.
</P>
<P>
   But Ecuador hung on to win.
Chile 3, Paraguay 1
</P>
<P>
   Playing in heavy rain, Paraguay started well, but then was
victimized by Chile's speed, which forced an own goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chile went ahead 19 minutes into the game when Paraguay's Nelson
Zelaya deflected a head shot from Ricardo Rojas into his net.
Marcelo Salas made it 2-0 on a pass from Moises Villarroel.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay's Hugo Brizuela was expelled 48 minutes in after
hitting Villarroel with his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors got close when Jose Cardozo connected in the 70th,
but eight minutes later, Ivan Zamorano clinched it with a penalty
kick.

<HEADLINE> Murder-Suicide at Wash. Hospital  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE M. CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Colleagues of a University of Washington medical
resident who killed himself after fatally shooting his supervisor
locked their doors when the man was around, a faculty member said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But his supervisor, Dr. Rodger Haggitt, apparently did not share
their fears. His door was unlocked Wednesday when Dr. Jian Chen
walked in for a meeting and shot Haggitt, 57, four times in the
torso before shooting himself in the head, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Staff and other medical residents at the university's medical
center said they started seeing signs of trouble months ago, when
faculty members told Chen his residency contract -- normally four to
five years -- would not be renewed for the 2001 academic year. It
was to expire Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a 42-year-old United States citizen originally from China,
apparently became upset when told he wouldn't be asked to return
because of English language problems and academic shortcomings,
both of which became apparent soon after he joined the program last
August, faculty members said at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Chen showed no improvement, his workload was cut and he was
offered extra language classes, but it was not clear if he took
them, said Dr. Nelson Fausto, chairman of the department of
pathology, which Haggitt directed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, faculty encouraged Chen to try another
residency program.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was somewhat self-destructive at the end. He wasn't taking
any initiative to get into another program,'' said Dr. Edward Kim,
another pathology resident.
</P>
<P>
   In May, fellow residents became concerned about Chen when they
found a phone book open to gun-shop listings and a map on his
computer showing the shop where Chen later bought the weapon,
campus police Capt. Randy Stegmeier said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear was not so much that he was going to hurt somebody
else but that he was going to hurt himself,'' Fausto said.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting May 23 with campus police and faculty, Chen
reportedly said he wanted the weapon for protection, said Dr. John
Gienapp, director of graduate medical education program assessment
and development. Others there urged him to get counseling, but he
said ''he had no psychological problems that needed to be
treated,'' Gienapp said.
</P>
<P>
   The King County Medical Examiner's Office listed Haggitt 's
death as homicide and Chen's as suicide. Stegmeier said: ''It's
possible that ... Dr. Chen became angrier (during the meeting) and
decided to take Dr. Haggitt's life, or Dr. Haggitt may have tried
to intercede to stop him taking his own life.''
</P>
<P>
   One of several undated letters found in Chen's backpack at the
scene indicated Chen ''did intend to take his own life but did not
intend to take Dr. Haggitt's life,'' Stegmeier said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats spar over women delegates for national convention  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - State Democrats are bickering over the
appointments of three women as delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, a dispute triggered by the national party's push to
send equal numbers of men and women to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' dispute resolution committee on Thursday night
dismissed a complaint by a state delegate to the national
convention for former presidential candidate Bill Bradley, said
Democratic State Chairman Edward Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   The complainant, Audrey Blondin, a Torrington lawyer, said she
submitted a written statement because she was unable to attend the
hearing. A copy of the statement was unavailable Thursday night.
Blondin said it was in her office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process raised questions, that's what we said. The three
delegates were put in and stepped down,'' she said from her home
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blondin said she was contacted by the Gore campaign and agreed
to file a complaint because ''my belief is they make rules and
regulations for a reason and they should be followed. It doesn't
make a lot of sense to have a set of procedures drafted and then
not follow them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the complaint must be forwarded to two separate national
committees for final resolution. Marcus said a decision should be
made within five to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hope is that based on the evidence that was elicited at
the hearing, the rules committee and the credentials committee will
dismiss the charges and certify the delegation,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble started last month, when the Democratic National
Committee told the state party that it didn't have enough women
delegates to the national convention in August. The Connecticut men
outnumbered the women 37-30.
</P>
<P>
   The national party requires that delegates from each state be
equally divided among men and women.
</P>
<P>
   So three male Connecticut delegates - Bridgeport Mayor Joseph
Ganim, former state comptroller William Curry and Stratford
Democratic town chairman Dick Miron - resigned to make room for
three women.
</P>
<P>
   It is the appointment of those three women that was being
challenged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said that he conferred with Vice President Al Gore's
Connecticut presidential campaign coordinator and appointed Ganim's
wife, Jennifer; Curry's sister, Kathleen; and Miron's ex-wife,
Anne.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments surprised 26 party members, who signed a
petition challenging the three new delegates. The petition, which
calls party leaders' actions ''blatant'' violations of party rules,
was the basis for Thursday night's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Blondin said members of Gore's campaign staff asked her to
challenge the appointments of the three women delegates. She said
Marcus broke the rules when appointing them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was concerned enough to not have any problem getting
involved in the process,'' Blondin, a Litchfield selectwoman, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our training as attorneys to be creative and advocate
zealously on our clients' behalf,'' she said. ''But that doesn't
mean we break the rules and use the process in a way it was not
meant to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Blondin declined to say which Gore staff members asked her to
challenge the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's Connecticut campaign coordinator, Marilyn Cohen of
West Hartford, said she was a principal decision-maker in approving
the three women delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes as a surprise to me that I am alleged to have had no
involvement,'' Cohen wrote in a June 12 letter to Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   She said party rules allow the state party chairman and the
state's presidential campaign coordinator to appoint new delegates
to replace delegates who resign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Martin Dunleavy, a former New Haven alderman, has said
that the Democratic National Committee asked him to initiate a
challenge to the three women delegates.	   Marcus said Thursday that Dunleavy is
upset over not getting a
delegate's position.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are good Democrats,'' Marcus said about the delegates in
question. ''Everything was done by and according to the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   After the state party's dispute resolution committee decides the
issue, the matter will then go to the party's rules and credentials
committees, Marcus said.

<HEADLINE> US Embassy in Jordan Cancels Event  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- The U.S. Embassy in Jordan said Thursday it
was canceling a Fourth of July reception, a decision that follows
the mission's announcement it may be a target of a terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   An embassy statement did not spell out the reason for canceling
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian Information Minister Taleb Rifai said in a telephone
interview Thursday that the ''embassy is free to take whatever
measures it deems appropriate, but we don't believe that such
action is necessary at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancelation comes a week after the embassy said the U.S.
government ''has information concerning terrorist targeting'' the
compound in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the U.S. has full confidence in the government of
Jordan's demonstrated ability and willingness to address security
threats, the full dimensions of the threat are not known,'' the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   It said it could not rule out other possible targets in the
country, and urged Americans traveling or residing in Jordan to
''exercise prudence and ... review their security practices, and to
remain alert to changing situations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, three U.S. diplomatic missions have also
decided to cancel a July 4 street party due to security concerns,
State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker attributed the cancellation to the ''particular security
situation and the physical situation of that event.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan had been for the event to be held in a tent on a closed
street.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Jordanian government said 28 Arabs suspected
of links with Osama bin Laden had planned to carry out terrorist
attacks against American and Israeli tourists during New Year's
celebrations in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen have been arrested and are on trial in a military court.
They have pleaded innocent and denied links to bin Laden, the Saudi
exile. The rest are being tried in absentia.

<HEADLINE> Mother, Boyfriend Charged In Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The mother of a 3-year-old girl and the
woman's boyfriend were charged Thursday with killing the child,
whose body was found entombed in concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Foster, 22, and Rakeisa Scott, 23, both of Long Beach,
both pleaded innocent to charges of murder, assault on a child
causing death and child abuse in the death of Milan Anjonet Scott
Wilson. If convicted, they could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Each was ordered held on more than $2 million bond, and a
protective custody order was issued barring them from having any
contact with their infant son.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe Milan was killed on or about Dec. 2 and her
body placed in the trunk of an abandoned car owned by Foster, then
encased in concrete. Investigators chiseled the body out of the
190-pound chunk of concrete Wednesday after Foster's father tipped
authorities.

<HEADLINE> US Takes War Crimes Exemption Step  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States said Thursday it has
negotiated a key first step toward an exemption for U.S. citizens
from prosecution by the world's first permanent war crimes
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador David Scheffer, the ambassador-at-large for war
crimes issues, said he is hoping to win final agreement from more
than 100 countries when the commission preparing for the court's
operation holds its next meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the larger part of our proposal is awaiting debate in
November and December,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dicker, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch, said
the vast majority of countries oppose a U.S. exemption and ''if the
U.S. government thinks otherwise, they have a big surprise coming
in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as the commission's current three-week meeting
neared its Friday deadline, Scheffer was optimistic that the first
hurdle had been crossed and the gateway had been opened for an
exemption, which the United States views as a major national
security issue.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was one of seven countries voting ''no'' when
120 countries approved the treaty to establish the International
Criminal Court in July 1998 in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty, the court will step in only when countries are
unwilling or unable to dispense justice. It can act when either the
country where the crime took place, or the country whose nationals
committed the crime, have ratified the statute.
</P>
<P>
   What the United States objects to is that American citizens can
be subject to the court's jurisdiction if an alleged crime is
committed in a country that had ratified the treaty -- even if the
United States is not a party. Washington says this would leave U.S.
troops and citizens vulnerable to politically motivated
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on the Clinton administration intensified when Sen.
Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, introduced legislation
earlier this month which would bar U.S. cooperation with the court,
as long as the United States has not ratified the treaty creating
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clearly a locomotive coming down on us,'' Scheffer said,
''but I would hope the locomotive stops because it's recognized
that we are making progress in these negotiations to achieve the
very objective that is behind this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer expressed satisfaction that a rule agreed to by
delegates on Thursday would provide ''a gateway'' for the United
States in November to seek an exemption for the surrender of U.S.
citizens through an agreement with the court.
</P>
<P>
   The rule deals with conditions under which the court may procede
with a request for the surrender of a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. view, Scheffer said, the rule does not preclude the
court from entering a separate international agreement with a
country on the surrender of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Dicker, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch,
said ''to interpret this rule as authorizing the court to enter
into international agreements without an amendment to the treaty is
wishful thinking.''

<HEADLINE> Source: UNC's Guthridge To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Guthridge, who led North Carolina to two Final Four
appearances in his three seasons as coach of the Tar Heels, will
announce his retirement at a news conference Friday, The Associated
Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the basketball program, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Thursday that Guthridge recently decided he did
not have the energy to continue coaching the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   The school has called an on-campus news conference for 2:30 p.m.
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge, 62, said just a few weeks ago that he planned to stay
on another five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant to Dean Smith for 30 seasons, Guthridge replaced
his former boss, the winningest coach in college basketball
history, when he retired in 1997 after 36 years as coach of the Tar
Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still planning on going five or six more years, as long as
I enjoy it and think I'm doing a good job and keeping the program
where it belongs,'' Guthridge said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into what would have been the fourth year of a five-year
contract, he had compiled an 80-28 record, averaging more than 26
wins a season, but had not received a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The easy-going Guthridge often worked without a contract during
his years as an assistant to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   A search for Guthridge's replacement will begin immediately, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans criticized Guthridge last season when the Tar Heels
went through a four-game losing streak in January and entered the
postseason with 13 losses. The inconsistent season came on the
heels of a first-round NCAA tournament loss in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina athletic director Dick Baddour has refused to
comment directly on Guthridge's contract, saying the school's board
of trustees discourages him from talking publicly about such
personnel issues.
</P>
<P>
   Baddour has said he's proud of the job Guthridge has done
following Smith, which he admits was not an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the team that lost 71-59 to Florida in the Final Four
will return next season.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loss will be point guard Ed Cota, but he will be
replaced by either highly regarded recruit Adam Boone or Ronald
Curry, the Tar Heels' starting quarterback who is recovering from
an Achilles' tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-footer Brendan Haywood will be back in the middle and
Joseph Forte, one of the most impressive freshmen in school
history, will be back as the shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newcomers will be top 1999 recruit Jason Parker, who
is expected to be academically eligible, and 7-6 Neil Fingleton, a
native of England who played his high school basketball in
Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's lengthy coaching tree will come into play as a
successor is chosen. Kansas' Roy Williams and South Carolina's
Eddie Fogler, both longtime assistants to Smith, will be mentioned
as will former Tar Heel Matt Doherty, who had success in his first
year as a head coach at Notre Dame. Current NBA head coaches George
Karl at Milwaukee and Larry Brown at Philadelphia are both former
Tar Heels who have remained close with the program.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas athletic director Bob Frederick said he talked to
Williams on Thursday night after hearing about Guthridge's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick said that, as in the past, he will continue to
emphasize to Williams ''how strongly the university, the community,
the people in the state of Kansas and all of our alumni and fans
feel about him continuing as the Jayhawk coach forever.''

<HEADLINE> Rocker back at Shea, pitches perfect eighth as Braves win  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - New York Mets fan Mike Adler had waited since
last October to ask - actually scream - a question for John Rocker.
So when Atlanta's loudmouth lefty went out to run windsprints
Thursday night, Adler was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't you show us respect?'' shouted Adler, proudly
wearing a Mets shirt. He was speaking for his fellow fans, but the
question applied to gays, immigrants, women and most other groups
offended by Rocker's insensitive and inane remarks about New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker answered semi-pleasantly, autographed two baseballs, then
issued a public apology. But it did little to lower the level of
bile directed at the man Mets fans, among others, love to despise.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's videotaped apology, shown on Shea Stadium's
26-foot-tall screen in left-center field before the start of the
game between the Mets and the Braves, was greeted with lusty boos
by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have apologized and have felt badly for anyone who took my
comments personally,'' Rocker said on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also am fully aware that the overwhelming majority of the
people in this city are extremely charismatic and full of
personality, although a bit spirited at times, but, you know, that
doesn't make them bad people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker went out to the bullpen, with its special protective
cover, without incident before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd was generally well-behaved, police arrested two
people - one for disorderly conduct, another for entering a
players' only zone - and issued 63 summonses for open containers of
beer, said police spokesman Sgt. Victor Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 46,998 - with many police visible throughout the
stands - was taken out of the game early as the Braves jumped out
to a 4-0 lead. Then, as the Mets came back and Atlanta's pitching
faltered, the crowd began chanting ''We want Rocker!''
</P>
<P>
   They got him.
</P>
<P>
   He began warming up in the top of the eighth inning and then
jogged to the mound from the bullpen - instead of his usual sprint
- as he replaced pitcher Jason Marquis. A few objects, including a
ball, were thrown at Rocker in left field as the crowd stood and
booed.
</P>
<P>
   With police in riot gear standing behind the outfield fence,
Rocker then struck out Robin Ventura, retired Todd Zeile on a
grounder to short, and got Jay Payton to ground out to third. The
Braves went on to win, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's finding his strike zone, he's doing his job,'' said Mets
second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo. ''One-two-three - that's doing his
job.''
</P>
<P>
   As he walked to the Braves' dugout, Rocker looked at the Mets
fans with a slight smirk but did not taunt them as he did during
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted with high-fives from his teammates. Two police
officers stood just outside the dugout and three stood on top of it
as fans jeered.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox then sent Kerry Ligtenberg to pitch the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Rocker took a circuitous route to the
ballpark. With a quick wave and dead silence, he backed off his
pledge to mingle with the denizens of the No. 7 subway.
</P>
<P>
   He instead climbed into a black van to meet with representatives
of the players' union, who encouraged him to stay off the train. He
returned to his hotel before heading out to Shea in another van
with tinted windows.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed riders of the Queens subway line instead turned out
at the ballpark to greet the pitcher-turned-poster-boy for
insulting comments. One sported a sign declaring, ''Rocker Is Da
Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to get booed, big time,'' warned Darwin Pena, 20,
who exited the subway wearing a No. 7 train T-shirt. ''People in
New York don't like being insulted. He might be dodging
batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   At a sparsely attended anti-Rocker rally beneath the subway,
demonstrators held signs proclaiming ''NYC Says No to RocKKKer''
and the less-imaginative ''Rocker's A Bigot.'' Among the
demonstrators were a half-dozen Queens Little Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The fastballer was dubbed ''The Ku Klux Kloser'' after his
racist, homophobic and xenophobic comments in Sports Illustrated in
December. This trip was his first to Shea since last fall's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rocker had promised to ride the subway to the ballpark,
wiser heads - and there are plenty - prevailed on the hurler to
choose a less-public form of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good idea, given that Rocker had redefined political
incorrectness by describing straphangers on the No. 7 line as
''some kid with purple hair ... some queer with AIDS ... some
20-year-old mom with four kids.'' He also complained that New York
has too many foreigners and added: ''How the hell did they get in
this country?''
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of preparations were in place for the Shea return
of the reliever, christened ''Johnny Rotten'' and ''Punk Rocker''
by the New York tabloids. Despite the city's enmity toward him,
Rocker received the type of security ordinarily reserved for heads
of state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to police at his hotel, 700 officers were assigned
to Shea instead of the 60 for most games - New York's finest to
protect Atlanta's swinest. There were police on bicycles and
horses, in vans and buses, in uniform and plainclothes.
</P>
<P>
   A limit on beer sales was imposed. A special protective cover
was erected over the Braves' bullpen in left field. During batting
practice, fans were barred from sitting in the first four rows
behind the Braves' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans had recently handed out fliers on the No. 7 platform
advertising ''John Rocker Battery Night.'' Fans were encouraged to
bring and fling their AAs to greet Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   In response, New York Mets officials promised a zero-tolerance
policy against fans behaving badly in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The road trip to hell is just the latest in a series of
self-inflicted woes for Rocker: a suspension for his comments, his
threats against the writer of the SI piece, and a brief demotion to
the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hindsight being 20/20, I would've loved to have missed my
meeting with the Sports Illustrated reporter and I never would've
had to deal with the whole situation,'' Rocker said in an interview
with TBS, which is owned by the same company that owns the Braves
and Sports Illustrated. ''But then again, that's the hand I've been
dealt and I'll have to make the best of it.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Stop Working on Stadium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- About 100 employees stopped work on the
controversial Olympic beach volleyball venue Friday morning after
high winds sent unsecured timber and metal flying around the work
site.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Ferguson, state secretary of the Construction, Forestry,
Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), said workers would be back
Saturday after a six-man safety crew gave the all-clear.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, metal frames with timber platforms making up the
slat seating went flying after wind gusts blew.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very lucky someone hasn't been killed -- there was a
great potential for a loss of life as there's all sorts of people
who use the beach, not to mention passing traffic,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Coordination Authority spokesman Bob Bowden said the
problem would not affect the stadium being finished on time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The slat seating was caught up in the wind, but it hasn't
caused any damage,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10,000-seat beach volleyball site is the only Sydney 2000
venue yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The start of its construction in May was delayed by protesters
campaigning against the temporary stadium being built along the
city's famous tourist strip.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Back in New York  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets fan Mike Adler had waited since
last October to ask -- actually scream -- a question for John Rocker.
So when Atlanta's loudmouth lefty went out to run windsprints
Thursday night, Adler was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't you show us respect?'' shouted Adler, proudly
wearing a Mets shirt. He was speaking for his fellow fans, but the
question applied to gays, immigrants, women and most other groups
offended by Rocker's insensitive and inane remarks about New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker answered semi-pleasantly, autographed two baseballs, then
issued a public apology. But it did little to lower the level of
bile directed at the man Mets fans, among others, love to despise.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's videotaped apology, shown on Shea Stadium's
26-foot-tall screen in left-center field before the start of the
game between the Mets and the Braves, was greeted with lusty boos
by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have apologized and have felt badly for anyone who took my
comments personally,'' Rocker said on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also am fully aware that the overwhelming majority of the
people in this city are extremely charismatic and full of
personality, although a bit spirited at times, but, you know, that
doesn't make them bad people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker went out to the bullpen, with its special protective
cover, without incident before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd was generally well-behaved, police arrested two
people -- one for disorderly conduct, another for entering a
players' only zone -- and issued 63 summonses for open containers of
beer, said police spokesman Sgt. Victor Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us it was a perfect game,'' said Kevin Hallinan,
baseball's head of security.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 46,998 -- with many police visible throughout the
stands -- was taken out of the game early as the Braves jumped out
to a 4-0 lead. Then, as the Mets came back and Atlanta's pitching
faltered, the crowd began chanting ''We want Rocker!''
</P>
<P>
   They got him.
</P>
<P>
   He began warming up in the top of the eighth inning and then
jogged to the mound from the bullpen -- instead of his usual sprint
-- as he replaced pitcher Jason Marquis. A few objects, including a
ball, were thrown at Rocker in left field as the crowd stood and
booed.
</P>
<P>
   With police in riot gear standing behind the outfield fence,
Rocker then struck out Robin Ventura, retired Todd Zeile on a
grounder to short, and got Jay Payton to ground out to third. The
Braves went on to win, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's finding his strike zone, he's doing his job,'' said Mets
second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo. ''One-two-three -- that's doing his
job.''
</P>
<P>
   As he walked to the Braves' dugout, Rocker looked at the Mets
fans with a slight smirk but did not taunt them as he did during
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted with high-fives from his teammates. Two police
officers stood just outside the dugout and three stood on top of it
as fans jeered.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox then sent Kerry Ligtenberg to pitch the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Rocker took a circuitous route to the
ballpark. With a quick wave and dead silence, he backed off his
pledge to mingle with the denizens of the No. 7 subway.
</P>
<P>
   He instead climbed into a black van to meet with representatives
of the players' union, who encouraged him to stay off the train. He
returned to his hotel before heading out to Shea in another van
with tinted windows.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed riders of the Queens subway line instead turned out
at the ballpark to greet the pitcher-turned-poster-boy for
insulting comments. One sported a sign declaring, ''Rocker Is Da
Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   At a sparsely attended anti-Rocker rally beneath the subway,
demonstrators held signs proclaiming ''NYC Says No to RocKKKer''
and the less-imaginative ''Rocker's A Bigot.'' Among the
demonstrators were a half-dozen Queens Little Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The fastballer was dubbed ''The Ku Klux Kloser'' after his
racist, homophobic and xenophobic comments in Sports Illustrated in
December. This trip was his first to Shea since last fall's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rocker had promised to ride the subway to the ballpark,
wiser heads -- and there are plenty -- prevailed on the hurler to
choose a less-public form of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good idea, given that Rocker had redefined political
incorrectness by describing straphangers on the No. 7 line as
''some kid with purple hair ... some queer with AIDS ... some
20-year-old mom with four kids.'' He also complained that New York
has too many foreigners and added: ''How the hell did they get in
this country?''
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of preparations were in place for the Shea return
of the reliever, christened ''Johnny Rotten'' and ''Punk Rocker''
by the New York tabloids. Despite the city's enmity toward him,
Rocker received the type of security ordinarily reserved for heads
of state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to police at his hotel, 700 officers were assigned
to Shea instead of the 60 for most games -- New York's finest to
protect Atlanta's swinest. There were police on bicycles and
horses, in vans and buses, in uniform and plainclothes.
</P>
<P>
   A limit on beer sales was imposed. A special protective cover
was erected over the Braves' bullpen in left field. During batting
practice, fans were barred from sitting in the first four rows
behind the Braves' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans had recently handed out fliers on the No. 7 platform
advertising ''John Rocker Battery Night.'' Fans were encouraged to
bring and fling their AAs to greet Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   In response, New York Mets officials promised a zero-tolerance
policy against fans behaving badly in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The road trip to hell is just the latest in a series of
self-inflicted woes for Rocker: a suspension for his comments, his
threats against the writer of the SI piece, and a brief demotion to
the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hindsight being 20/20, I would've loved to have missed my
meeting with the Sports Illustrated reporter and I never would've
had to deal with the whole situation,'' Rocker said in an interview
with TBS, which is owned by the same company that owns the Braves
and Sports Illustrated. ''But then again, that's the hand I've been
dealt and I'll have to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker left the park at 11:45 p.m., half an hour after the
Braves departed in their team bus. Accompanied by a woman, he got
into a black van trailed by three security vehicles for the journey
back to Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Deal Ends Pursuit of Sosa  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Sammy Sosa is staying with the Chicago Cubs.
For now, if not for long.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' pursuit of the Chicago Cubs slugger ended
Thursday night when the Yankees traded for Cleveland outfielder
David Justice. The Cubs apparently wanted at least five Yankees
prospects, including several considered among the best in the New
York farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the Justice trade broke several minutes after the Cubs
began their game in Pittsburgh. Sosa hit a 448-foot homer in the
eighth that put the Cubs ahead 4-2, his first homer since June 18,
but the Cubs lost 5-4 in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still in Chicago,'' Sosa said. ''I was ready for anything
that could happen. Everybody was waiting for that moment, I think.
The Yankees went after somebody, but pretty much I feel happy
because a lot of people in Chicago want me to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sosa sounded like a man who prefers to leave. His agent,
Tom Reich, expects a deal with another team will be made.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think ultimately Sammy will be traded,'' Reich said. ''This
one got real close. But there was a difference of opinion on the
players. But I think ultimately there is a deal to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich and Sosa were prepared to talk contract with the Yankees
if a tentative trade was agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were ready to go, and Sammy was ready to go,'' Reich said,
''but there was no trade. They got a guy at a lesser cost, but he's
a formidable guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs president Andy MacPhail also said the Justice trade ended
the Yankees talks, telling Chicago reporters, ''The deal is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Cubs will have other discussions,'' Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   But when? And with whom? Sosa has no idea, and neither does
manager Don Baylor, with whom Sosa has had an uneven relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't heard anything yet,'' Sosa said. ''The situation was
the Yankees and they can't make the deal, for some reason. If
another team wants me, they probably are going to have to go
through the same process. I'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor plans to hold a team meeting Friday in Milwaukee to
address the persistent trade rumors he says are distracting a team
that has lost eight of its last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to discuss it,'' Baylor said. ''Every single day,
guys are talking about who's going where. I'd like to get all of
that behind us and start thinking about baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is signed through next season, but is seeking a significant
pay raise from his current $11 million salary, one the Cubs don't
seem willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I stay here, they probably are going to go out there and
get some good players. They can probably put a winning team out
there,'' he said. ''But we don't know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs scout Ken Kravec, who had been following the Yankees
recently, has watched Tampa Bay and Toronto play the past two days.
The Blue Jays had been rumored to be interested in Sosa, but
manager Jim Fregosi denied the teams had talked.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa seems as confused as anywhere about the direction the Cubs
will go. Asked if he expects something else to be done now, he
said, ''Probably, yes. Probably, no.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, my main concern maybe is if somebody else is going
to come through. But this is not up to me. I've got to keep playing
and keep relaxing. If something happens, I've got to leave.''
