<HEADLINE> Kim Dae-jung Appeals for National Unity to Overcome Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's President-elect Kim
Dae-jung today called for national unity to overcome the current
economic crisis ailing the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing our biggest crisis since the Korean War. We should
unite to overcome the difficulties," Kim said in his New Year's
message to South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who won the 15th presidential election on December 19, said
he will take the lead in pain sharing while the pain should be born
evenly and fairly by all South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would punish those responsible for economic
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
"Stern measures should be taken against those who have caused the
national disaster," said Kim, who will be sworn in as the president
of the country next February.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to faithfully implement an agreement reached between the
Kim Young-sam government and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The nation, last December, signed the agreement with the IMF for a
rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars with harsh conditions.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Korea has to restructure its economy,
open its financial market and cut its budget while it has to face
massive layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Although 1998 will be a tough year for the country, Kim pointed
out that the current crisis is fundamentally a financial crisis,
not a crisis of the country's entire economic system because the
nation still enjoys favorable conditions, such as stabilized
prices, high growth potential, improvements in trade balance,
high-level savings ratio.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect said he is confident that economy of his
country, the 11th largest in the world, will surely recuperate and
get out of the IMF's control within the next two years.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Per-Capita Income Down to 9,400 U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 witnessed
per-capita income in South Korean dropping to 9,400 U.S. dollars
from the previous year's 10,548 dollars, said the Ministry of
Economy and Finance Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the first since 1980 when each Korean suffered a
slide of 50 dollars due to an oil shock around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the decrease to the government's economy
policies and the 40 percent devaluation of South Korean won
against dollar.
</P>
<P>
They said the nation's per-capita income will fall further this
year because of the serious financial crisis began last November.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy, the analysts added, could grind to halt
without speedy assistance from international financial
organizations and industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Up to today, South Korea has received only 9 billion of the
agreed rescue loans totaling 57 billion dollars from the
International Monetary Fund while its won continues to
depreciation.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Vice-president Warns Hutu Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Hutu extremists who are waging
a war in north-western Rwanda will not overthrow the government
by the power of arms, said Rwandan Vice-President and Minister of
Defense Paul Kagame, Rwanda News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the population of five communes of Ruhengeri
on New Year's eve, Kagame made a stern warning to the residents
of the prefectures of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri that they should be
ready to face the consequences of the war they have been dragged
into by Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
"You must dissociate yourselves from criminals who are
inciting you to commit killings and destroy bridges and other
infrastructures," Kagame told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
He warned those who are causing insecurity and destroying
infrastructures to cripple and finally overthrow the government
that "it is a dream."
</P>
<P>
"I repeat it, there is no clique in this Rwanda, even if
supported by foreign countries, that will topple this government
using arms, " Kagame underscored.
</P>
<P>
For Kagame, committing atrocities of all kinds, like ambushing
vehicles and killing passengers, raiding refugee camps and
massacring women and children only because they are Tutsis, will
not affect the governmnet's programs to rebuild the shattered
nations and reconcile all Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
As for alleged killings of civilians by the government forces
put forth by residents of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, he said that the
population is partly responsible.
</P>
<P>
Kagame admitted that there might be some indisciplined
soldiers that could abuse civilians, but those found guilty of
such acts are punished.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) --Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu said, in his adress to the nation on New Year's Eve,
that Rwanda is emerging from the darkness to light, Rwanda News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among the biggest achievements the Rwandan government scored
in 1997, he cited the successful repatriation and resettlement of
over one million Rwandan nationals from neighboring countries,
the consolidation of the policy of national reconciliation and
the stabilization of the national economy that has noted a steady
growth in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He said his government will put an utmost focus on supporting
incoming generating activities aimed at stimulating economic
growth, and eradication of poverty and ignorance.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, also regretted that problems of
insecurity, most specially in the north-west, continue to be a
serious setback to the country.
</P>
<P>
He condemned acts of killings by Hutu extremists who committed
genocide in 1994 and have not given up their heinous agenda.
</P>
<P>
He strongly warned the population of the insecurity-affected
Gisenyi and Ruhengeri prefectures backing the armed rebellion
that they will face the harsh repercussions of the fires
they are fanning.

<HEADLINE> Tough Choices in Year Ahead, Says UK's Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has warned Labor MPs and the general public that 1998 will be a
year of "tough choices" and will require hard work, determination
and discipline.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message published today, Blair said that the
government must continue with welfare reform, as the present
system was "failing" the poor and the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that people in genuine need of help will get it and
that talk of taking any benefit from the most vulnerable in
society is "scaremongering".
</P>
<P>
Blair outlined other key aims as effective economic management
to ensure improved living standards for ordinary families and
improving standards in education.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government is determined to deliver its
"contract with the people", with the "New Deal" for the young and
long-term unemployed being a priority.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that government achievements in the past year
included giving extra money to the National Health Service (NHS),
cutting VAT on fuel and winning referendums on a Scottish
parliament and Welsh assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process and the UK's presidency of
the European Union would be significant in 1998, Blair noted.
</P>
<P>
"Tough choices will come. They must be faced up to. It is then
that our resolve, our strength and our commitment will be tested.
I am confident we can meet that test and change Britain for good,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Peer AIDS Education Scores Success in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 1 (xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS peer education and
awareness campaigns at Zimbabwe's work places could be a
complementary gateway to the control of the deadly pendemic now
killing an estimated 500 people a week, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it is affordable, sustainable and feasible.
</P>
<P>
''With peer education there is less social distance between
the workers and the educator,'' said Michael Mbizvo, a research
officer with the Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention Project (ZAPP), a
collaborative study of the University of Zimbabwe, the National
Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) and Britain's Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 Sub-saharan African countries most affected by AIDS
in Africa, Zimbabwe ranks second after Zambia with an infection
rate of one per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The peer program, which began in 1993, is a departure from
previous HIV/AIDS programs which often focused on defined
high-risk groups which include commercial sex workers, long
distance truck drivers and known STD (sexually-transmitted
diseases) cases, leaving out the general population.
</P>
<P>
ZAPP study carried out in Harare's factories concluded that
the work places offer access to a previously ignored economically
important population.
</P>
<P>
The study, to assess effectiveness of AIDS messages when
workers are lectured to by peer educators, also sought to
determine the impact of peer education on self reported risk
behavior, knowledge and attitudes of workers regarding HIV and
AIDS and to provide counselling services for study participants.
</P>
<P>
From 1993, ZAPP enrolled 3,392 men from 40 factories into the
research program. Of them, 2,719 were HIV negative.
</P>
<P>
The three year research period recorded a 34 percent reduction
in instances of HIV and STD infection in the factories.
conclusions were based on the number of new HIV infection among
those known to have been negative at the inception of the
project.
</P>
<P>
The study designated one peer educator for every 100 workers
to continuously supply free condoms and organize at least one
drama and two presentations by persons living with HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Civilians, 30 Rebels Killed in Burundi Strife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) --Hutu rebels in Burundi on
Wednesday night massacred over 100 civilians near the capital of
Bujumbura in retaliation for the killing of their 30 companions
by the Burundi army, Rwanda News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Burundi army spokesman Mames Sinarinzi
as saying that a very important group of armed Hutu rebels
attempted to storm a military barracks near the capital's airport
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
They were repulsed by the army that killed 30 of the
assailants, who then crossed the airport causing some minor
damages to the airport's vehicles and buildings, he added.
</P>
<P>
But in retreating, the rebels raided the Rukarama Village,
near the capital massacring over 100 civilians, most of whom
women and children who could not run away from the attack,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The casualty figure might rise as we are still finding more
bodies," Mames declared.
</P>
<P>
The government lost two soldiers, three others were wounded in
the attack, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reactions to Moi's Expected Win in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi is taking an early lead in the country's second
multi-party elections held on Monday and Tuesday, causing mixed
reactions from various opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Based on initial results from 145 out of 210 constituencies,
Moi headed the poll with 1,686,742 votes, followed by Democratic
Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki with 1,351,614 votes and National
Development Party leader Raila Odinga with 560,594 votes,
according to Kenya Television Network's evening news reports.
</P>
<P>
Two main opposition presidential candidates announced today
they will not accept Moi as a winner while a leading opposition
lobby group, the National Convention Executive Council (NCEC),
said the poll "must be declared null and void."
</P>
<P>
At this point, a senior officer with the Electoral Commission
told Xinhua that he personally believed the opposition would
finally accept the official polling results which he said is much
likely to come out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki and Odinga, who now take the second and third place in
early results respectively, announced today they will reject a
continuous Moi regime.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fraudulent process, so how can we accept a result
that shows Moi winning?" Kibaki said when answering questions at
a news conference held jointly held by himself and Odinga.
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept a victory for Moi because there is no way
he could have won," Odinga added.
</P>
<P>
However, they failed to reveal their further plans, if they
had any, in case of a Moi victory.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they predicted a joint opposition victory despite all
chaos and confusions occurring in the voting, saying they "are
committed to forming a government of national unity in which all
stake holders are adequately represented".
</P>
<P>
Later, NCEC spokesman Kivutha Kibwana claimed in a statement
that the poll must be annulled because it "is irreparably
manipulated" and "does not reflect the will of the Kenyan
people."
</P>
<P>
The NCEC demanded a government of national unity comprising of
parliamentarians from the just-dissolved parliament, deputies of
NCEC and the religious sector "be instituted by January 9, 1998,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. administration on Wednesday said despite
"bureaucratic flaws" in the polling process, "the Kenyan people
through their actions have demonstrated a powerful commitment to
democracy."
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the level of peaceful, popular
participation in the election" in Kenya, U.S. State Department
Deputy Spokesman James Foley was quoted by reports reaching here
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Officials to Declare Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan officials must declare
their assets and those of their spouses and children starting
from this year, President Yoweri Museveni has said.
</P>
<P>
In his new year speech to the nation broadcast by Radio Uganda
today, the president said officials must also declare the way
through which they get the wealth.
</P>
<P>
All the declarations will be made public to prevent
corruption, according to an amendment to the leadership code
newly approved by the cabinet, Museveni added.
</P>
<P>
No corruptive officials will be allowed to use state organs to
defend his corruption, the president assured the public, adding
that his government commends the efforts made by parliament and
the press to expose corruption in public services.
</P>
<P>
Museveni appealed to the public not to give bribes to
officials, and to report any official asking for a bribe.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the economic performance of the country in 1997,
the president put the rate of growth at five percent, lower than
1996's 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been kept at 6.6 percent, while foreign exchange
inflows has continued to grow to 1.8 billion U.S. dollars, of
which 653 million was from export earnings and the rest from
private inflows.
</P>
<P>
Museveni attributed the lower economic growth rate to the
erratic state of the agricultural sector caused by the temporary
drought earlier last year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector, however, registered a satisfactory
growth of 16 percent. The construction sector grew by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also reaffirmed the country's policy of attracting
foreign investment aimed at more export of finished goods.

<HEADLINE> Takeover Activity Boosts Bonuses Paid to City Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) - The City earned an estimated 1.3
billion pounds (2.08 billion US dollars) in fees during 1997 from
acting on a record 64 billion pounds (102.4 billion US dollars) of
bids.
</P>
<P>
The fees are 200 million pounds (320 million US dollars)higher
than last year, according to Philip Healey, who calculated the
figures for Acquisitions Monthly.
</P>
<P>
British investment banks laid claim to the lion's share of the
spoils in the year, which saw a total of 1801 deals with a
combined value of 64 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
"The figure not only reflects the large number of deals
completed during the year but also shows that the complexity of
many of the transactions pushed up the costs involved," Healey
said.
</P>
<P>
1997 marked the third consecutive year of strong mergers and
acquisitions activity in Britain, with the highest number of
public bids since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Acquisitions Monthly, put Lazard Brothers at the top of the
league table of City advisers. the UK investment bank advised on
34 transaction with a total worth of 21.9 billion pounds (35.04
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
SBC Warburg Dillon Read took second place. The Swiss-owned
bank, which announced a 35 billion pounds (56 billion US dollars)
merger with UBS earlier last month, helped to negotiate 19.8
billion pounds (31.68 billion US dollars) worth of UK takeovers.
</P>
<P>
Third place went to Schroders which notched up 12.3 billion
pounds (19.68 billion US dollars) in transactions.
</P>
<P>
City observers believe that the tide of mergers and
acquisitions is sure to boost the level of bonuses paid to City
bankers in the new year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Announces to Resign Amid Budget Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy today announced to resign over his displeasure with the
draft budget.
</P>
<P>
Levy made public his decision to resign at a news conference
after he had failed to solve the dispute with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over the cuts of spendings on welfare in the
budget.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the planned cuts as "evil policies," he said the
proposed 207 billion-shekel (59 billion U.S. dollars) budget would
not give an answer to the rising unemployment and suffering of the
poor and underclass.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget proposes a cut of 2.6 billion shekels (about
740 million dollars), maily concerning welfare items.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who has long been at odds with Netanyahu over political
and economic policies, said that the five Knesset (parliament)
members of his Gesher Party would vote against the budget.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to speculate if the government would fall if his
party quitted the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had so far declined to comment on Levy's decision to
resign, but he was apparently taking it seriously.
</P>
<P>
He had discussed with his aides the possibility of postponing
the vote on the budget till March 31. If he could make it,
Netanyahu would be able to work on another budget and win time to
calm the coalition partners, including Levy.
</P>
<P>
He had hoped to get the budget passed and then announce the
long delayed decision on carrying out troop pullback from the West
Bank.

main faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators from all walks of life in the Palestinian
territories, shouted anti-Israeli slogans and burned Israeli flags

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The break-way Chechen government
was dismissed today by a decree of Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov, the Interfax news agency reported from Grozny, capital
of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov and
Deputy Premier Akhmed zakayev as saying that Maskhadov has asked
first deputy prime minister Shamil Basayev, formerly a field
commander, to set up a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya needs a government capable of working "under the
conditions of an economic blockade and the continuing undeclared
war against the republic," First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi
Udugov said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, acting prime minister Shamil Basayev
spelled out a plan to restructure the Cabinet by retaining just 22
of the 45 ministries and departments.
</P>
<P>
On the relations with Russia Maskhadov said that he would "not
yield to provocations" and is "ready to seek ways for establishing
civilized relations with Russia."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Chechen president criticized some people, who do
not want to find a civilized way out of the crisis, referring to
the recent armed attack on a Russian military unit in the
Dagestani town of Buinaksk.

<HEADLINE> Israeli University Students Strike for Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 university
students throughout Israel took part in a strike today in protest
against increased allocations to yeshiva students in the new
state budget.
</P>
<P>
The National Union of Israeli Students (NUIS), who organized
the strike, said that "it is unthinkable that a parasitic
public receive budgetary increase of dozens of percent, when the
government doesn't relate at all to the university students."
</P>
<P>
The strike is a direct result of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's surrendering to the extortion of the religious
parties on behalf of draft-exempt yeshiva students, while most
university students serve in the army and pay over 8,570 U.S.
dollars annually for tuition and board, it said.
</P>
<P>
Several students at the Hebrew University, who also boycotted
classes today, said that the strike is a clear signal that
the university students could not accept the unfair treatment
from the government.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Knesset (parliament) postponed the vote on the
1998 state budget Wednesday night because several coalition
parliament members threatened to vote against it.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Vows to Restore Peace to S. Leone in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force known as ECOMOG today vowed to resolve the crisis in Sierra
Leone in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message, ECOMOG commander Major-General Victor
Malu told his soldiers in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, to see
1998 as a year to extend final peace and stability in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Malu
said the force is the first attempt by west African countries at
conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
He wished that the force would always do the same to make the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) proud of it at
all times.
</P>
<P>
Dispatched by ECOWAS seven years ago, ECOMOG has helped end
Liberia's bloody civil war, which leads to the successful general
election to make Charles Taylor the first post-war president.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general expressed his satisfaction that the
dedication of ECOMOG in Liberia has brought abundant security and
peace and drawn investors to the country.
</P>
<P>
This is something that can be done in neighboring Sierra
Leone, he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing 1997 as a very eventful year, Malu commended ECOMOG
soldiers for their exemplary conduct, enthusiastic dedication to
duty, honesty and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
Malu's promise to end the Sierra Leonean crisis comes along
with reports of success by the civil defense group known as
Kamajors against the military junta in the recent fightings in
the east of the troubled country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors is a group of traditional hunters fighting for
the restoration of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah since his ousting
in a coup in May 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
The militia group has reportedly claimed more areas and seized
additional routes in the northeast over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the junta Monday airlifted a group of
journalists to visit a stronghold of the Kamajors in the east of
the country to show its victory in recent fightings with the
hunter militiamen.
</P>
<P>
To flee the fightings, at least 50 people have been reportedly
crossing the Mano River Bridge every day to seek entry in
northwest Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Malu's promise to end the Sierra Leone crisis is seen by
observers as partly expressing the grave concern of the
international community at a time when the peace plan to retore
Kabbah by April this year seems to become something remote.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's 10-year-old national
shipping policy will soon be reviewed to pave way for a
comprehensive maritime policy, the transport minister has said.
</P>
<P>
"In no distant future, Nigeria will have a comprehensive
maritime policy," Major-General Ibrahim Gumel, Minister of
Transport, told a meeting of the National Maritime Authority
(NMA) in the capital Abuja recently, according to the News Agency
of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already set up a committee to review the
policy and work has reached an advanced stage, said Gumel.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not elaborate on the future comprehensive
maritime policy, but stressed the need for the country to start
developing its own maritime fleet so as to remain relevant in the
global shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government is looking into the issue
concerning the involvement of indigenous shipping companies in
the lifting of crude oil, liquefied natural gas and other
lucrative imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
NMA has complained that due to the dependence on foreign
shippers, the country loses an estimated eight billion U.S.
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of its own fleet is expected to help improve
the situation.

According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Befekadu Tolera, chief
of the Addis Ababa traffic police division, said 14 people have
lost their lives while 244 others sustained heavy and light
injuries in the accidents.
</P>
<P>
Garages, both licensed and unlicensed, and service vehicles
involved in the accidents without having the permit from the

<P>
He appealed to the public to cooperate with pertinent bodies
by informing on the drivers who escape causing accidents or break
traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
Befekadu also pledged that the traffic police would do their
best to bring the perpetrators to justice.
</P>
<P>
A total of 64 people died and 543 others were injured in the
traffic accidents occurred in the capital city in the last three
months.
</P>
<P>
Drunk driving and failure to give priority to pedestrians were
major causes for the accidents.

BEIRUT, January 1 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said today that Europe would play a larger and more
effective role in the Middle East peace process in 1998, Lebanon's
official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Beirut International Airport, Richard

The French defense minister stressed that the issue of south
Lebanon was just part of the big problem from which the Middle
East has been suffering, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the deadlock of the peace talks between the
Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine will
visit Lebanon within 10 days, bringing with him important
political ideas about south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>

inspecting the French soldiers in the United Nations peacekeeping
force in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, he flew by helicopter to the
headquarters of the U.N. peacekeepers in Naquora, a town near the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angola's Petroleum, Mining Sectors in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1997 has witnessed
encouraging progress in the petroleum and mining sectors of
Angola, the war-torn African country.
</P>
<P>
The official figures show that during last year, daily output
of petroleum in Angola has increased to a record of 750,000
barrels from 600,000 barrels. Its mining sector has begun
recovery and the production of diamond, a main product of the
sector, is expected to reach 1.2 million carat this year and earn
the country 330 million U.S.Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Angola is rich in petroleum, and the petroleum industry is a
major pillar of its economy, so it has always been a strategy of
the Angolan government to develop the petroleum sector and earn
more fund for the development of other sectors.
</P>
<P>
After several years' efforts, all the existing oilfields in
Angola have been put into operation and the petroleum industry
which had been damaged by the civil war has already recovered.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Angola's daily production of petroleum has recorded a
new high of 750,000 barrels. The figure is expected to reach one
million barrels early in 21st century, according to the Angolan
government's medium term target.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has also made great efforts for oil
exploitation. And in this field, the National Petroleum Company
of Angola and Elf-Aquitaine, a French company, have joined their
hands and made several discoveries.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, under the cooperation between the two
companies, a giant deepwater oilfield with a reserve of 100
million tons was discovered offshore, 200 kilometers away from
Luanda, capital of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The two companies also discovered Dalia Oilfield with a
reserve of 700 million barrels in August last year and Girassol
Oilfield with a reserve of 660 million barrels in May, 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Petroleum, the three oilfields
will be developed in the near future. And the National Petroleum
Company of Angola will also cooperate with other foreign
companies to continue the exploitation of oil in other sea areas.
</P>
<P>
For the development of the petroleum industry, the government
have attached great importance to the restoration and development
of auxiliary enterprises such as Kwanda Oil Logistics Base and
oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in October last year, the Angolan government began
to implement Catoca Program to develop its rich kimberlite
resources. This means that Angola has first developed its
kimberlite resources.
</P>
<P>
At present, the program is still at a pilot phase and the
monthly kimberlite output is 17,000 carat. The program is
expected to be fully implemented early this year and the monthly
production is expected to reach 20,000 carat.
</P>
<P>
In spite of progress made in the two sectors in 1997,
instability in some areas of the country and a large number of
landmines buried underground have become obstacles in the
development of the petroleum and mining sectors.
</P>
<P>
But with the coming of final peace in the country, the two
sectors will have new opportunities to prosper.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Boost Relief Operations in Kenya, Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) is
scheduled to expand its relief operations for flood affected
areas of Kenya and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here today quoted WFP Country Director
for Kenya Mike Sackett as saying that "Major food shortages are
expected over the coming weeks and the emergency situation is far
from over".
</P>
<P>
The WFP has launched phase two of the emergency operation in
Somalia to supply relief food in southern part of the country in
the first three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the WFP will provide 12,000 tons of food
between January and March at a cost of 6.6 million U.S. Dollars,
</P>
<P>
The Somalia operation which started on November 13 last year
has provided 1,000 tons of food and other relief items to the
worst affected areas by aircraft and 2,000 tons of food drawn
from stocks held in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The WFP will also provide a total of 8,000 tons of food, fuel
and medicines to stranded communities in Wajir, Mandera, Garissa
and Tana River districts in northeastern Kenya until the end of
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Since the WFP started air deliveries to those districts on
December 10 last year, a total of more than 600 tons of relief
goods have been delivered.
</P>
<P>
The 124,000 refugees in the Dadaab refugee camps in
northeastern Kenya are now totally dependent on air supplies and
the WFP expects to transport 500 tons of food by air every week
to the refugees until the Garissa-Dadaab road link is restored.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's port city of Mombasa and the capital of Eastern
Province, Garissa, serve as main food dispatch point and
operation center for WFP aircraft, which enable the WFP to move
more than 200 tons of food per day to feed 500,000 people in
Kenya and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The release said that more aircraft are expected to arrive in
January to boost the food relief operations in flood affected
areas in the two countries.

NANCHANG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi
Province is preparing to merge the province's eight biggest
foreign trade companies into a single group to increase its
competitiveness in world trade.
</P>
<P>
The province exported 1.42 billion U.S. dollars of goods by

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province plans
to bid adieu to financially troubled state-owned enterprises
within three years.
</P>
<P>
Of its 520 large- and medium-size state enterprises, 92 have
been losing money for three consecutive years. These companies
have assets of 32 billion yuan and employ 330,000 people,
according to the provincial economic and trade commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission will use mergers and bankruptcies to force
failing companies out of the market while investing funds in those
with growth potential.
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to focus on 60 such enterprises in 1997,
which might result in layoffs of 60,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the liability rate of its
state-owned enterprises will be reduced by 10 percent, said the
commission.

<P>
MACAO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Macao and neighboring Zhuhai city,
south China's Guangdong Province, will share the investment half
to half of the planned bridge to link the two places, and the
construction is expected to begin in March, a report said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Macao Daily News quoted Zhou Benhui, deputy mayor of
Zhuhai, as saying that the project has passed technical appraisal
of the Chinese side and is under administrative procedure for
approval.

He said the bridge will cost a total investment of 400 million
yuan (about 50 million U.S. dollars). Macao and Zhuhai side will
each be responsible for half the investment.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will start construction according to a blueprint
jointly designed, and a joint coordination office will be
established.
</P>
<P>
The planned bridge runs 1,100 meters, with six lanes for
vehicles. It will link the Hengqin Island of Zhuhai and Taipa
Island of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that construction of the bridge is expected to begin
in the coming March. It will be completed and put into operation
before the handover of power in Macao in December 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Mayor Gets Party Endorsement for Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Liberal Party
will endorse Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim as its standard-bearer in
the country's May 1998 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Raul Daza, president of the Liberal Party, told local
television Sky Cable Thursday that the party, one of the country's
oldest political parties, will soon announce its endorsement of
Lim.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to put an end to the coalition between the
Liberal Party and the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union of
Christian Democrats) led by President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Lim, a member of the People's Reform Party (PRP), had been
expected to be expelled from the party after declaring his
decision to run for the next presidency in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, PRP chief, who herself is set
to join the presidential race, had threatened to expel Lim if he
wanted to press on his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Joseph Estrada, presidential candidate for the
United Opposition, expressed his disappointment for the Liberal
Party's support of Lim, saying the party is a "valuable addition"
to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said the breakaway of the Liberal
Party will not tilt the balance between the administration Lakas
party and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Daza said the Liberal Party is considering unite with the
so-called "Third Force" which was proposed by Lim and another
presidential aspirant former defense secretary Renato de Villa.
</P>
<P>
Local TV reports said both Lim and the ruling party's candidate
Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives, are
wooing Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as running mate.
</P>
<P>
But Arroyo, another proclaimed presidential contender, has so
far failed to confirm whether she will slide down to run for vice
president.

<HEADLINE> Use of Tibetan Language Spreading in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- In present-day Tibet, more than
ten thousand newspapers are being sent every day to people in
cities, counties, farming and stock-breeding areas in their own
language.
</P>
<P>
Tibet currently has 60 kinds of newspapers and periodicals,
half of them Tibetan-language publications. More and more Tibetan
people obtain their information mainly through broadcasting and TV
programs in their own language.
</P>
<P>
Local governments throughout the Tibet Autonomous Region are
encouraging the use of the native language for 2.4 million
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese constitution stipulates that: "Any ethnic
nationality in China has the liberty of using and developing its
own language." A consistent policy of China has been to encourage
the use of the Tibetan language in Tibet, an autonomous region
where more than 94 percent of the population are Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
With a history of 1,300 years, Tibet has a highly developed
language as far as its grammar and expressions are concerned. It
is also a language that has played an important role in the long
history and culture of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
On the streets of Tibet, signs of government organizations,
factories, schools and restaurants are all printed in both Tibetan
and Chinese. Most of the advertising and shops use standardized
Tibetan and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Service trades such as banks and post offices also use Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
Government documents are written in Tibetan, and papers on
important conferences have two versions. Speakers at conferences
give talks in Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
People also have the right to file lawsuits in their own
language and legislative documents are written in Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
The wide application of software with standard coding in
Tibetan enables the ethnic minority language to gain access to the
Internet, which helps spread the language in the information age.
</P>
<P>
During their six years in primary school, students in Tibet
spend 1,598 hours in learning the local language. They start
learning Chinese in the third grade.
</P>
<P>
In secondary schools as well as colleges, Tibetan is a required
course. The law ensures that students from ethnic minority groups
learn to read and write their own languages as well as
Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Long-Expected Snow Brings Excitement to Changchun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Descending snow created a real
winter for residents in northeast China's Changchun City, who have
complained of the long absence of its once regular visitor.
</P>
<P>
Many people on New Year holiday went outdoors to welcome the
first heavy snow this winter, which began to drop early this
morning. Some were busy taking photos and others had snowball
fights amid screams and laughter.
</P>
<P>
"I've waited for the snow for a long time," said Zhang
Fengzhou, who was frolicking with family members. "To our
Changchun people, a winter without heavy snow is not a real
winter."
</P>
<P>
Changchun, capital of Jilin Province, is a tourist resort with
freezing but picturesque snowy scenes, ice sculptures and
cold-weather sports.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the excitement, the snow brought an unexpected rush
of customers to many businesses. A photo lab near downtown
People's Avenue was packed with people eager to have their film
developed.
</P>
<P>
A student from Changchun Science and Technology University said
he had been looking forward to snow since he left his hometown in
south China.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to see a real snow in the north. Now I don't feel
disappointed anymore," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Levies Extra Fee on Tobacco Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's municipality
of Chongqing pioneered a campaign to charge extra fees on tobacco
products to fund health education and disease control.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco manufacturers and sellers in Chongqing must pay 0.1
percent of their total sales in extra fees for health care,
according to a regulation published Thursday by the municipal
government.
</P>
<P>
About five million yuan (600,000 U.S. dollars) in fees will be
collected annually.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is believed to be the first local government taking
such an action. Liaoning and Hubei provinces along with Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region and Shanghai Municipality made the
similar decisions in 1997, but the decisions have not been carried
out yet.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Province planned to levy a 4 percent fee on the sales of
local tobacco products, according to sources from the Ministry of
Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
"It can on one hand curb the increase of sales of tobacco. On
the other hand, it can fund smoking-control campaigns and solve
financial problems in health-care work," said Cai Renhua, director
of the MOH's Health Policy and Law Department.
</P>
<P>
China's tobacco industry produced 1.7 trillion cigarettes in
1996. The country's 320 million smokers puffed away on 4.8 billion
cigarettes per day, or 240 million packs.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry has been a major source for China's
revenue since 1987. It turned out 83 billion yuan (10 billion
dollars) in revenue in 1996, five times that of 1986, according to
a report from the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
A 1993 study showed that if an additional fee of 0.1 yuan was
added to each pack of cigarettes, the state would collect eight
billion yuan (nearly one billion U.S. dollars) -- the figure set
for the national health budget for that year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Sergai Dubinin, president of the
Central Bank of Russian Federation, announced that the Russian
inflation in 1997 dropped to 12 percent from 22 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Interfax News Agency Friday, he admitted
that the implementation of 1997 domestic budget was not
satisfactory because of financial difficulties which almost
provoked a currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the decline of inflation had shown that
Russian financial policies were fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Looking into Russian financial situation in 1998, Dubinin
stressed that it would be an arduous task for Russia to further
reduce the inflation to 5 or 6 percent because each percentage
point of decline would require great efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the
Electoral Affairs Commission of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), Friday urged local eligible people,
who have not signed up yet as electors for the upcoming
legislative elections, to get registered as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference on the voter registration, Woo
said: "With two more weeks to go before the registration deadline
closes on January 16, more than a million eligible people have yet
to sign up as electors for the first Legislative Council election
of the SAR."
</P>
<P>
He urged eligible permanent residents not to forgo their
rights, warning: "If you do not register before January 16, you
will not be able to choose a legislative council member to
represent you."
</P>
<P>
Among 6.3 million Hong Kong citizens, a total of over 2.5
million people are eligible to take part in the elections
scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
In early December, a total of 30,000 voter registration
ambassadors knocked on every door all over the SAR to help
residents sign up as electors for the elections.
</P>
<P>
These voter registration ambassadors, who are teen-age
students, have visited nearly two million households during the
voter registration week from December 6 to 12.
</P>
<P>
"The door-to-door visits have been an excellent lesson on civic
education for the young students," Woo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also said that although the door-to-door visits have been
successfully concluded, the Home Affairs Department of the SAR
government has no let-up in their efforts to register as many
people as possible.
</P>
<P>
A targeted approach is now under way with visits to young
people at tertiary institutes and youth centers, while large
public organizations and charitable bodies are actively involved
in getting their employees to register.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Department has also set up counters
at MTR stations and bus termini to help people sign up.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's coming annual
Chinese New Year's parade is being expanded this year to include a
colorful fiesta aimed at raising the annual celebrations to
world-class status and cementing Hong Kong's position as the
"Events Capital of Asia", organizers said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The parade will begin on January 28 with around 15 specially
designed and commissioned floats and more than 30 local and
international performing groups along a 1.3 kilometer route in
Tsimshatsui, Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
After the parade, the floats will be lit up immediately at the
Urban Council's Centenary Garden in Kowloon, where they will form
the centerpiece of the two-day Fiesta, on January 28 and 29, the
first two days of the lunar Chinese Year of Tiger, which is open
to the public free of charge, to usher in the Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta features such activities as a display of brightly
illuminated floats, stalls and booths for arts and crafts,
traditional snacks, games, food and beverage, as well as live
entertainment performance.
</P>
<P>
The event will introduce the new Mascot Tiger of the Hong Kong
Tourist Association (HKTA) and a mixture of international parade
expertise and the famous Foshan traditional lantern craftsmanship,
as well as the best and most impressive lineup here ever of local
and international performers.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the parade and fiesta featuring a mix of "East Meets
West" elements, the HKTA stressed its commitment to using the
annual event to enhance Hong Kong's position as the world's
capital of Chinese New Year celebrations as well as the "Events
Capital of Asia".
</P>
<P>
Safety has been made a priority, with design and production of
all floats to be centralized and carried out by the event manager
to ensure better quality in design and finishing and that the
safety guideline issued by the government be fully observed.
</P>
<P>
An accident during last year's parade killed one tourist and
injured a few others on a Tsimshatsui pavement.

<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Responding to an appeal by the
Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) Central Committee, young
volunteers in major Chinese cities gave up their holiday rest
today to offer their help in transport stations, commercial areas,
community quarters and tourism sites.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, groups of
young people presented performances at homes for the elderly and
removed illegal posters. Nearly 1,000 students from several
colleges in the city went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and cleaned
up the steps, picked up garbage and served as tour guides.
</P>
<P>
"The (voluntary) activity enhances our responsibility for
serving the society so that more people can be influenced by the
civilized actions of the volunteers in the course of forming new
social tendencies," said Zhang Yan, a student.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqing City, southwest China, more than 50 young
volunteers in red caps went to a trolley bus station early in the
morning to help the elderly in boarding or descending from
buses. At the wharves, 40 Communist Youth League members offered
assistance to vessel passengers.
</P>
<P>
In Nanning, capital city of south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, more than 30,000 young volunteers set out
early in the morning to clean up streets and parks. Many others
got an early start to repair domestic electric appliances,
bicycles, or did chores at nursing homes for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Organized by local committees of the Communist Youth League in
Wuhan City, young volunteers went to residential communities and
scenic spots to give artistic performances, consult on various
topics, and help the elderly and handicapped.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Enjoys Box Office Totals Increase in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Hollywood experienced an
increase of about eight percent in its box office totals in 1997
over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Hollywood said Thursday U.S. movie-goers spent 6.2
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, another record year, as compared
with 5.8 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the industry attribute the jump to products like
"Men in Black" and "The Lost World: Jurassic Park," each grossing
more than 200 million U.S. dollars in North American theaters.
</P>
<P>
The most successful studio in Hollywood was Sony Pictures with
five of its releases "Men in Black," "Air Force One," "My Best
Friends' Wedding" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" on the top
box office totals list.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the growing demand for films and
televisions shows will add 16,000 job to Los Angels in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We had the thing that every studio dreams of: a film that
satisfied all age groups," said Lucy Fisher, vice-chairperson of
Sony's Columbia Tristar Motion Picture Group.
</P>
<P>
"Entertainment has some of the best prospects (for
employment). It is our shining star," said Jack Kyser, chief
economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Help PNG Rehabilitate Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia will donate almost
500 ton of plants and seeds to Papua New Guinea (PNG) as part of a
one million Australian dollar (650,000 US dollar) program to help
the country rehabilitate crops after last year's devastating
drought and frosts.
</P>
<P>
The decision to provide fast-growing crops to PNG villagers
came as AusAid, Australia's official overseas agency, and the
Australian Defense Force prepare for the start of a third cycle of
emergency food deliveries on Saturday to isolated areas of the
Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
The new agricultural rehabilitation program would assist the
long-term recovery of PNG food crops, Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 695,000 people in PNG have entered 1998 at risk of
starvation because of severe drought in the country, Care
Australia, a leading aid agency, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"By beginning to replant village food gardens the project aims
to reduce the dependency on emergency food relief supplies by
helping villagers develop a more secure, sustainable food supply,"
Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the rehabilitation project, Australia will ship plant and
seeds of rapid growing food crops.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, Australia has airlifted more than 1.2
million kg food to isolated areas of PNG facing serious food
shortages due to widespread crop failures caused by drought and
killer frosts last year.

<P>
SINGAPORE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined on the
Singapore market on the first day of trading in 1998 on Friday, as
the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) fell by 11.64
points to close at 1518.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the lower share prices in thin trading came
because most fund managers were still sidelined due to the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume was thin at 68.2 million units, valued at
111.82 million Singapore dollars (66.17 million US dollars).
Declines overwhelmed advances by 206 to 94, while 309 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
MBf Capital was the most actively traded stock as it registered
a turnover of 5.79 million shares. It was followed by Singapore
Telecom which had 2.87 million shares traded. Wing Tai was next
with 2.52 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1.9 dollars to finish at 36.1 Singapore
dollars. Jurong Shipyard increased by 30 cents to end at 8.3
Singapore dollars, while Asia Pacific picked up by 18 cents to
close at 4.3 Singapore dollars.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Crime cost Australians between
18 and 20 billion Australian dollars (13.5 billion US dollars)
last year, federal Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest Australian Institute of Criminology estimates found
crime cost every man, woman and child nearly 1,000 Australian
dollars (660 US dollars), or more than four percent of gross
domestic product, Vanstone said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3 billion Australian dollars (1.98 billion US
dollars) was spent on police and law enforcement alone, with
another 3 billion going to fight fraud and forgery.
</P>
<P>
Drug offenses cost 2 billion Australian dollars (1.32 billion
US dollars) and shoplifting somewhere between 1 and 2 billion
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Crime prevention plays a critical role," she said, adding that
the government was spending 13 million Australian dollars (8.58
million US dollars) on a national campaign against violence and
crime, while the recently announced Tough on Drugs strategy was
also an important anti-crime initiative.
</P>
<P>
"As part of this effort, the government will provide three
federal police strike teams, and more money for informants and
witness protection," Vanstone said.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Employs 80 percent of Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 176,000 redundant
workers in north China's Hebei Province were reemployed in the
first 11 months of 1997, accounting for 80 percent of laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
The province still faces a re-employment problem of more than one
million surplus urban workers between now and the end of the
century, according to a survey by the Provincial Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, Hebei has promulgated favorable policies
for laid-off workers, and has raised some 400 million yuan (50
million U.S. dollars) to help them find jobs.
</P>
<P>
"We have set quotas to employers in job fairs to encourage them
to employ qualified laid-off workers," said one local official,
adding that many businesses have helped each other in settling the
job problem of redundant workers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province has spent 310 million yuan
during the last two years in training redundant workers and
helping the growth of job placement agencies.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has more than 152 job placement agencies
and has trained more than 180,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has also encouraged laid-off workers to set up
their own businesses. The province has 130-plus centers with
favorable policies for businessmen who were originally surplus
workers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Send Home Almost Half Registered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is expected to
send a million or almost half the number of registered foreign
workers in the country to their respective countries this year
following the move by certain sectors to reduce their workforce
due to the economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The foreign workers would be sent home soon after their
retrenchment, Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali
said Friday after presenting the Immigration Department's activity
and work program here.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that foreign workers still employed would be
distributed among the industries in strategic sectors like
plantations and export-oriented manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
He said "This is in line with the government's policy of
reducing foreign workers besides ensuring that they are not
depriving the locals of jobs like in the hospitality industry."
</P>
<P>
Foreign workers in Malaysia are mostly from Indonesia,
Bangladesh, the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The deputy home minister also said that the Immigration
Department would continue raiding workplaces to ensure that
employers were not harboring illegal foreign workers, an offense
under Section 48A of the Immigration Act (Amendment) 1997, under
which, he said, errant employers would have to pay the full cost
of deportation of illegal immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
According to Tajol Rosli, the number of illegal foreign workers
in Malaysia was estimated at 800,000 and most of them were
Indonesians.

<HEADLINE> Singapore-Malaysia Second Link Opens to Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

SINGAPORE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The 1.9-km Second Link from
Tuas, western Singapore, to Gelang Patah in Johor, Malaysia,
opened to traffic on Friday, after almost four years of
construction work by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The project is a fast new way for Singaporeans to reach the
North-South Highway in Malaysia and will help ease the jam on the
Causeway, the first link between Woodlands, Singapore, and Johor
Baru, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Singapore television report described the Second Link as
"another milestone in Malaysia-Singapore relations" and said that
it will be a toll-free ride for motorists on the new link for one
month from Friday.
</P>
<P>
The television quoted a senior Malaysian government official as
saying that the toll-free passage will stay on until the official
announcement of the rates to be charged.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Ministry of Communications announced recently that it
would not be levying tolls for the first few weeks, and it will be
matching the Malaysian toll rates once they are finalized.

<HEADLINE> Second Malaysia-Singapore Crossing Link Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The second
Malaysia-Singapore crossing linking Tanjung Kupang in Malaysia's
Johor and Singapore's Tuas opens Friday, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said after
observing the first day of operations in Tanjung Kupang that the
opening of the Malaysia-Singapore second crossing is a big start
for 1998 in terms of promoting ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the crossing linking Tuas in Singapore and
Tanjung Kupang in Johor would greatly benefit relations between
Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying "We hope that this second crossing will
further enhance friendship, trade and tourism in the southern
region between Malaysia and Singapore."
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said the second link was also expected to ease the
congestion at the present Causeway, the first link opened in June
1924 between Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
For a start, only oil tankers heading for Singapore are
required to use the second crossing.
</P>
<P>
The Second Crossing is linked to a 44-kilometer new expressway
leading to Malaysia's North-South Expressway. The new expressway
will allow motorists to by-pass Johor Baharu and head directly to
Singapore or to travel north.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will have a capacity of 200,000 vehicles a day,
which is four times the load on the Causeway and the Second
Crossing is expected to reduce by 30 percent traffic congestion on
the Causeway.
</P>
<P>
Motorists will be able to use the Second Crossing for free for
one month and the toll rates will be announced at the earliest on
January 7, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Singapore signed the agreement on the construction
of the second crossing in Kuala Lumpur in March 1994 and the
topping-up ceremony was performed by Malaysian Works Minister
S.Samy Vellu and Singapore's National Development Minister Lim Hng
Kiang in July, last year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore built 0.3 kilometers of the two-kilometer link at a
cost of 600 million Singapore dollars while Malaysia built the
rest, including a six-lane highway to its North-South Highway at a
cost of 1.2 billion ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The bridge components and connecting expressway were privatized
and wholly financed by the developer and concessionaire.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Hasn't Chosen Vice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Lakas-NUCD party has
not yet chosen any vice presidential candidate contrary to some
reports that senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo will be House Speaker
Jose de Venecia's running mate in the May elections, Executive
Secretary Ruben Torres said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo yet. I don't know
why the newspapers are saying these things. There are negotiations
going on not only with Arroyo but (also with others), even Gloria
is denying what they are talking," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling party is also negotiating with other people
such as opposition senator Ernesto Herrera as possible running
mate of de Venecia. Herrera has expressed willingness to join the
ruling party if he is chosen the standard bearer for the vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said last week that Lakas was postponing
the selection of its vice presidential candidate because of the
entry of "outsiders" into the derby.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter really for the President and the House
Speaker to balance everything, including geographical distribution
of candidates, sectoral distribution of candidates, and also the
vice president should be able to get votes for the president, and
the president should be able to make his vice president win in the
next elections," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
Lakas has its own three vice presidentiables. They are Interior
and Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers, Justice Secretary
Teofisto Guingona and Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani.
</P>
<P>
Torres said the vice presidential candidate slot is "still open
until probably next week," making it clear that members of the
ruling party will accept the decision of the President as to who
will finally be chosen as the partner of de Venecia.

NEW DELHI, January 2 (Xinhua)-- The Indian government Friday
announced a medium term export strategy for achieving annual
exports of 90 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
An official press release said here that the strategy would
focus on improving competitiveness by enhancing production base
for exports in tune with trends in world trade, focusing on
quality and technology upgradation.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that availability of infrastructural facilities is
crucial for increasing exports, the strategy would, to begin with,
remove bottlenecks responsible for delay at ports, shortage of air
cargo capacities and road congestion.
</P>
<P>
Sectorally, the twin objective is to widen exports of existing
products particularly by tapping new markets and diversifying the
exports basket in line with the trends in world exports.
</P>
<P>
The items covered sectorally include gems and jewelry,
electronic hardware and computer software, textiles, chemicals and
allied products, engineering goods, agricultural products,
leather, seafood, sports goods, ores and minerals and plantation
crops.
</P>
<P>
The directional strategy focuses on widening trade with all
countries including emerging markets with special emphasis on
market promotion through information dissemination and sponsoring
of business delegation and trade fairs.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Expresses regret on EU's Decision to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong Trade Department
spokesman expressed regret here on Friday over a decision to
exclude Hong Kong from the European Union (EU) Generalized System
of Preferences (GSP) Scheme.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Council of the EU to graduate
certain beneficiary economies including Hong Kong from the EU GSP
Scheme with effect from May 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the decision, the spokesman said: "our trade has
benefited from the generalized tariff preferences under the GSP.
The decision of the EU to exclude Hong Kong from the GSP Scheme is
therefore regrettable."
</P>
<P>
"However," he said: "the impact on our trade will not be
serious partly because the range of Hong Kong products eligible
for EU's GSP preferences is already limited."
</P>
<P>
"Also, the tariff differentials between the most-favored-nation
rates and the GSP rates have been reduced, following the Uruguay
Round negotiations," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's actual benefit from GSP tariff preferences dropped
from 10 percent to 1.7 percent of the EU's total imports from Hong
Kong from 1991 to 1996, and accounted for 0.5 percent of Hong
Kong's total exports to the world in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that a more important point is to ensure
that the graduation is based on objective criteria, and
beneficiaries of similar level of economic development are
graduated at the same pace.
</P>
<P>
"We noted that under the present EU decision, Hong Kong will be
graduated vis-a-vis comparable beneficiaries," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
GSP is a donor scheme whereby importing countries accord
preferential tariff treatment to developing economies to encourage
them to increase and diversify their exports.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been a beneficiary of the EU's GSP Scheme since
its inception in 1971.
</P>
<P>
At present, Hong Kong products which are still eligible for
EU's GSP preferences are limited to certain electrical machinery
and equipment, mechanical appliances, plastic articles and
footwear.

<HEADLINE> Khartoum, Cairo Agree on Tackling Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudan and Egypt have agreed on
tackling all their differences to pave way for normalization of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement printed in today's independent Khartoum daily
"Al Gomhouria", Mustafa Osman Ismail, Minister of State at the
Sudanese Foreign Ministry, said that the security organs of the two
countries are intensifying their efforts to close the security
file, preparatory to removing all outstanding obstacles.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the security file is the most complicated
of all. Egypt is accusing Sudan of giving shelter to active
elements of the Islamic Group of Egypt, and of having been
involved in the attempted assassination of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Ababa on 26
June 1995, and is demanding that the Sudanese government hand over
the files of those elements.
</P>
<P>
Osman revealed that contacts were under way at present between
Cairo and Khartoum to deal with other points of difference
relating to trade, economic and political aspects in the best
interest of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He added that after having dealt with these issues, the joint
ministerial committee would be invited to convene in either
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Minister further stated that the recent resumption
of river navigation between the two countries was the beginning of
full normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Osman anticipated that Sudanese President Omar Bashir would be
visiting Cairo shortly, and that this visit would be followed by
intensive meetings between officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese official expressed hope that Egypt would play a
strategic role in averting the dangers which threatened the
security of the Sudan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 2 (Xinhua) -- For the fourth time China has
been successful in diverting water from the upper and middle
reaches of the Yellow River to the lower reaches that had been
without water for most of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River's lower reaches have often run dry in recent
years because of the growing demand for water by cities in the
upper and middle reaches.
</P>
<P>
About 70 million cubic meters of water has been channeled into
the city of Dongying and the Shengli Oil Fields at the Yellow
River's outlet in east China's Shandong Province, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Water flow resumed Nov. 21 at the Lijin Hydrometric Station,
last on the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong Province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> California Outpaces National Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 1 (Xinhua) -- California's population
swelled 1.3 percent in the 12 months ending last July 1,
outpacing the national growth rate of 0.93 percent, statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Census Bureau said Wednesday that California saw 410,000
more new residents between mid-1996 and mid-1997, by far the
largest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed California's influx of residents to a
booming and balanced economy that marked the first half of this
decade.
</P>
<P>
While immigration remained a huge factor in the population
growth, the real change was that fewer residents fled
California for other states, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Great Los Angeles area experienced the nation's biggest
population gain between 1990 and 1996, adding 964,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles cited the high growth
rate of population as an indicator of the vibrant economy in the
metropolitan, adding that the city is the place where people want
to live, work and play.

<HEADLINE> China To Adopt New Policies for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to adopt some new
favorable policies for overseas investors in an effort to boost
the influx of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
The state is working on a trial basis to open up more channels
to use foreign capital, especially to encourage BOT
(build-operate-transfer) and fund-raising projects, as well as
projects that issue stock overseas, according to the state
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to open its insurance and commercial retail
business wider to foreign investors, and to work out new policies
to guide overseas capital into mining and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businesses or private investors that spend on BOT
projects in 1998 will continue to enjoy favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors can open projects in the central and western
parts of China that are forbidden in the rest of the country by
industrial policies, according to the Office of Special Economic
Zones under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In addition, overseas investors will be encouraged to cooperate
in building and operating shipping berths, or to solely fund
special sea lanes leading to docks. Joint ventures in ocean
shipping also will be encouraged with foreign investors entitled
to solely funded shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has approved 300,000 overseas-backed
businesses involving approximately 200 billion U.S. dollars of
investment. And overseas investment makes up more than 20 percent
of the country's total expenditures in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Also available for overseas investment are new agricultural
techniques, development of land resources, water conservation,
energy, communications, major raw materials, machinery and
electronics.

BAGHDAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has strongly condemned the
U.S.-Turkish-Israeli manoeuvres due to take place in the east
Mediterranean opposite Arab coasts from 5 to 9 January.
</P>
<P>
In a statement today to the Iraqi News Agency INA), Mohamed Saeed
Shhaf, Iraq's foreign minister, said that Iraq considers these
manoeuvres as a provocative act.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister said that the move is directed at
the Arab nation as well as an indication of the U.S.-Israeli
designs to create effective regional mechanisms with the object of
engaging some of the neighboring countries in regional
arrangements that will gradually turn them against the interests
of their own peoples and take hostile attitudes against the vital
rights and interests of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
He added that "we believe that all Arab states are called upon
not only to refrain from participation in these manoeuvres, but
also to take a unified stance in expressing their strong concern
and dismay towards such manoeuvres."
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Iraqi foreign minister called upon the Turkish
government to withdraw and refrain from participating in the

ATHENS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Friday rejected an
alleged challenge made by Greek warships to Turkish cargo vessels
in the Aegean Sea, saying that the Greek ships had been conducting
a routine patrol in order to stop illegal immigrants from entering
the country.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish report said that two Greek warships tried to carry out
checks on Turkish merchant ships in the international waters in the
Aegea early on Thursday, flashing lights at them and asking them to
identify their ports of origin and destination.
</P>

But the fact was that a Greek gunboat had been carrying out a
routine patrol there after being informed that a ship was planning
to land 2,000 illegal immigrants on the Greek shores in the
region, the Greek National Defense Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Greece has been flooded by hundreds of illegal
immigrants ferried across from the Turkish shores.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Asks US Envoy to Delay Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government has asked
United States peace envoy Dennis Ross to delay his scheduled
visit here due to the current budgetary crisis, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ross was originally scheduled to arrive here next Monday on a
mission to prepare for the pending visits to Washington by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Israeli government made the request for delaying
Ross's visit after learning that Ross planned to visit the region
despite the crisis triggered by the budget debate. Israeli and
U.S. officials have been in touch on Ross' visit, and Washington
is expected to accept the Israeli demand since the current crisis
will bind Netanyahu's arms to deal with issues other than the
budget.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government is facing a real crisis of survival
after Foreign Minister David Levy announced Thursday that he
planned to resign if his Gesher Party's budgetary demands are not
met. Due to Levy's threat, Netanyahu decided Thursday night to
postpone the budget vote in the Knesset (Parliament) till Monday.
</P>
<P>
The coalition will be on the verge of collapse if Gesher rebels
are against it, leaving it with only the minimal 61 seats needed
to keep going. The coalition is currently hold a 66 seat majority
in the 120-member Knesset, but at least three hardliners within
Netanyahu's own Likud Party have also threatened to vote against
the government.
</P>
<P>
The delay in budget vote will enable Netanyahu to buy time to
persuade Levy and other rebels within the coalition to refrain
from voting against the government in Monday vote.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was quoted by the radio as saying today that he would
keep the promises he has made in the past to Levy in a bid to
prevent Levy's departure. He said Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman
has been trying to find extra fund to back up the promises to
Gesher, which is pushing for more money to assist the country's
poor, unemployed and young families.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu hopes to get the budget passed first before dealing
the long delayed issue of carrying out further troop redeployment
in the West Bank. The United States is pressuring Netanyahu to
come out with a redeployment plan by January 15.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu fails to get the budget passed in the Knesset,
hardliners within his government will use the redeployment issue
as a bargaining chip for getting more financial gains.

<HEADLINE> US, UN Try to Resume Bicommunal Contacts in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has expressed the
hope that the bicommunal contacts between Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides will resume shortly.
</P>
<P>
In a statement here today, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Judith
Baroody said that "without those kinds of people-to-people
contacts, the Cyprus problem cannot be solved."
</P>
<P>
Baroody was commenting on the Turkish Cypriot suspension of
all bicommunal activities, starting from last Saturday, in
reprisal for the European Union's decision to begin membership
talks with the Cyprus government in March 1998, a move that
angered Turkey and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Baroody pointed out that Turkish Cypriot restrictions on
these kinds of activities are "incompatible with democracy and a
free society".
</P>
<P>
She added, "we expect, therefore, that the Turkish Cypriot
authorities' review of bicommunal activities be prompt, and that
these activities, which are of such value to Greek Cypriots
and Turkish Cypriots and the future of Cyprus, will resume
shortly and without restrictions."
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, the United Nations are also
making efforts to persuade the Turkish Cypriots to resume
bicommunal contacts.
</P>
<P>
Waldemar Rokoswewski, the spokesman for the U.N. Peace-keeping
Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), was quoted as saying that "we
believe that Turkish Cypriot authorities should not isolate their
Turkish Cypriot community from either Greek Cypriots or the
outside world."
</P>
<P>
He said there is a generation of people on both sides
of the divide, who do not know each other.
</P>
<P>
That is why, he said, UNFICYP has traditionally supported,
sponsored and arranged virtually hundreds of bicommunal
activities, both in the buffer zone as well as on both sides
of the divide.
</P>
<P>
This East Mediterranean island has remained divided since
Ankara sent troops and took over the northern third in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island in a bizonal, bicommunal
federation, but so far little tangible progress has been
achieved.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have developed the
first computer keyboard for the convenient input of Chinese
characters.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen-based Huarentong Computer Development
Corp. announced that it took 10 years to develop the
Chinese-language keyboard.
</P>
<P>
A scientist working with the company said anyone able to write
Chinese characters can easily input the characters according to
the strokes and writing orders of the Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The patented keyboard preserves the original distribution of
keys and functions of the English-language keyboards. The keyboard
has five areas for the five major types of strokes of Chinese
characters.
</P>
<P>
The screens can display a Chinese character by inputting the
strokes of a character's writing order of its first and second
strokes.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than several hundred methods have been applied in
inputting Chinese characters with English-language keyboards.

Haikou, January 2 (Xinhua) -- In 1997 the crime rate in China's

</P>
<P>
According to provincial public security authorities, the ratio

The situation was achieved largely due to the establishment of

Launched in 1996, the security emergency hot line has helped
police crack down on crimes and handle traffic accidents.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Slams West for Anti-Iran Propaganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei today slammed the western anti-Iran "arrogant front"
for their propaganda against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayer aggregation on the campus of
Tehran University, Khamenei said that the "arrogant front" headed
by the United States wanted to achieve its evil objectives
through the anti-Iran propaganda.
</P>
<P>
The West has been trying to overstate internal differences in
Iran in a bid to weaken the Islamic system and to reach its aims
in Iran, Tehran radio quoted the leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei noted that the western front also tried to encourage
the inclination of Iranian individuals, groups and factions to
the west, the United States in particular.
</P>
<P>
The west is wrong in this regard, he said, because "their
mistake is to compare Iran with other countries".
</P>
<P>
The "arrogant front" is doomed to fail in its anti-Iranian
efforts, Khamenei sated, while calling on the Iranian nation to
maintain its unity and solidarity against the propaganda of the
west against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here noted that Khamenei's remarks
indicated a pessimistic future for a possible rapprochement
between Iran and the United States despite the signal of Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami for a dialogue with the American
people.
</P>
<P>
After Khatami announced his willingness to have a dialogue
with the American people last month, many Iranian officials rule
out possible rapprochement between Tehran and Washington, saying
that there would be no dialogue with the U.S. if it does not
change its policies towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
Khatami will deliver a speech to the American people through
the American television CNN next week, "telling the American
people about the crimes the U.S. Administration committed in Iran
during the past 50 years," according to some Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Research Institute Established For Seed Breeding in Outer Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China Aerospace Corp. has
established the first space seed research institute here to
further promote the drive for feeding its 12 billion people.
</P>
<P>
The institute, named "Agricultural Application of Space
Technology Research Institute" under the China Aerospace Corp.,
will conduct research into seed breeding technology in outer space.
</P>
<P>
The technology -- developed in China, Russia, and the United
States in the 1990s -- uses the effects of gravity and air vacuums
to alter chemical bonds, free radicals and DNA chromosomal
structures.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 Chinese scientists have selected more than 300 types
of seeds from about 50 crops and micro-organisms to send into
outer space.
</P>
<P>
Tests in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and other
places have shown that rice and wheat output can be increased
8-to-10 percent and vegetable output by 50-to-120 percent using
these techniques.
</P>
<P>
Now in Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, "space-treated
pepper seeds" were planted on more than 300 hectares.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, China has sent eight batches of crop
seeds into space. The space treatment has been extended to insects
and traditional Chinese herbs.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Chinese scientists for the first time conducted space
seed breeding for the herb scutellaria baicalensis, the root of
the large-flowered skullcap.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts said they are expecting to increase crop output
through the breeding of space-treated seeds.

<HEADLINE> Second Malaysia-Singapore Crossing Link Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The second
Malaysia-Singapore crossing linking Tanjung Kupang in Malaysia's
Johor and Singapore's Tuas opens Friday, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said after
observing the first day of operations in Tanjung Kupang that the
opening of the Malaysia-Singapore second crossing is a big start
for 1998 in terms of promoting ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the crossing linking Tuas in Singapore and
Tanjung Kupang in Johor would greatly benefit relations between
Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying "We hope that this second crossing will
further enhance friendship, trade and tourism in the southern
region between Malaysia and Singapore."
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said the second link was also expected to ease the
congestion at the present Causeway, the first link opened in June
1924 between Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
For a start, only oil tankers heading for Singapore are
required to use the second crossing.
</P>
<P>
The Second Crossing is linked to a 44-kilometer new expressway
leading to Malaysia's North-South Expressway. The new expressway
will allow motorists to by-pass Johor Baharu and head directly to
Singapore or to travel north.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will have a capacity of 200,000 vehicles a day,
which is four times the load on the Causeway and the Second
Crossing is expected to reduce by 30 percent traffic congestion on
the Causeway.
</P>
<P>
Motorists will be able to use the Second Crossing for free for
one month and the toll rates will be announced at the earliest on
January 7, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Singapore signed the agreement on the construction
of the second crossing in Kuala Lumpur in March 1994 and the
topping-up ceremony was performed by Malaysian Works Minister
S.Samy Vellu and Singapore's National Development Minister Lim Hng
Kiang in July, last year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore built 0.3 kilometers of the two-kilometer link at a
cost of 600 million Singapore dollars while Malaysia built the
rest, including a six-lane highway to its North-South Highway at a
cost of 1.2 billion ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The bridge components and connecting expressway were privatized
and wholly financed by the developer and concessionaire.

<HEADLINE> France Relaunches Debate Over Amsterdam Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- France has relaunched the debate
over the Amsterdam treaty on building a tighter European Union
(EU), after the Constitutional Council said on Wednesday that the
ratification of the treaty needs a constitutional amendment
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The widened version of the Maastricht treaty, adopted by the 15
EU member countries in Amsterdam in June, has been questioned by
many French political groups from the left to the right, because
it covers some sensitive issues like immigration, opening of
frontier and provision of asylum to foreign refugees.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview Friday, Charles Pasqua, the former
interior minister from the Gaullist Rally for the Republic, said
that a national referendum should be held to decide whether the
Amsterdam treaty will be accepted by France or not, because it
concerns the sovereignty of the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the French people and nobody else to decide the
possible abandoning or the transfers of sovereignty. It is the
people that should be consulted," he said.
</P>
<P>
To amend the constitution, President Jacques Chirac can either
call for a joint congress of the two chambers of parliament in
Versaille to vote, or ask for a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that Chirac, an ardent supporter of greater
European integration, is more likely to call for a joint congress
of the deputies of the National Assembly and the Senate, as both
chambers have a majority of deputies who support Amsterdam treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, former President Francois Mitterrand had subjected the
French nation to a referendum on September 20, 1992, to decide
whether France should amend its constitution to sign the
Maastricht treaty. A weak majority of 51 percent voted for the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Most European countries have decided to adopt the Amsterdam
treaty through their parliaments, but some like Denmark prefer the
means of referendum.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's 1998 Budget to Favor Oil Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's 1998 budget, to be
released before or on Saturday, will place the oil sector in a
"better perspective than previous budgets", minister of state for
petroleum resources Alhaji Umaru Dembo has said.
</P>
<P>
Certain provisions in the budget have been made to take care
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its
refineries for overall improvement of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Although the provisions "may not be too adequate for now, they
will certainly be a departure from the trends recorded in
previous years".
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks during what was called a
familiarization visit to the Kaduna refinery in the north of the
country on Wednesday, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is one of the leading oil producers in the world,
turning out about 2.2 million barrels of oil per day, including
condensates.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry accounts for about 95 percent of the
country's total export earnings and about 80 percent of the
federal government revenues.
</P>
<P>
However, progress in the industry is being stalled by
inadequate funding, among other problems, particularly in the
downstream sector.
</P>
<P>
The four refineries of the country, with a total capacity of
445,000 barrels per day, were forced to shut down last year due
to lack of proper maintenance because of fund shortage.
</P>
<P>
For the Kaduna refinery alone, it has become a common
knowledge that the turn-around maintenance work ought to have
been done in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The country now has to import fuel to meet domestic demand
before the maintenance work is expected to end in the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
With the budget yet to be presented by the head of state
general Sani Abacha, the minister hinted relevant provisions
would be favorable to the maintenance work of the refineries.
</P>
<P>
That will ensure the steady and uninterrupted supply of
petroleum products, he said, adding that adequate funding in the
oil industry is expected to put the country in a position to
export refined petroleum products.

<P>
PARIS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Six mirage 2000 D modern combat
aircraft of the French air force will join an international
military exercise to be held from January 12 to February 6 in the
United States, Agence France-Presse (AFP) Friday quoted military
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
These combat aircraft, which are based in Meurthe-et-Moselle in
eastern France, will leave for the Nellis air force base in Nevada
on Saturday for the "Red Flag" exercise to draw all modern combat
aircraft from around the world.
</P>
<P>
A French air force officer described the "Red Flag" as the
"most realistic" air exercise in the world, as its programs
include testing materials, quality of equipments and combat
tactics in "an entirely reconstituted combat environment."
</P>
<P>
The Mirage 2000 D will test its capability of shooting ground
targets in the daytime as well as in the night-time.
</P>
<P>
The F-15 and F-16 fighters of the U.S. Air Force, the Tornado
fighters of the British Royal Air Force, and the F-16 fighters of
the Singapore air force will also join the exercise.

<HEADLINE> Coup Plotters Want to Extend Transition, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian head of state general
Sani Abacha has said that the objective of the foiled December
21, 1997 coup plot is to extend the military regime's transition
to civil rule program scheduled to end October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the coup attempt was to derail the
transition program and extend the period. I believe that this is
not in our overall interest as a nation, neither is it in our
overall interest as a people," the head of state said, quoted by
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The alleged coup plotters include Abacha's deputy, chief of
general staff Lt.-gen. Oladipo Diya and 11 others, who are
currently being interrogated under arrest.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified number of people have also been detained in
connection with the botched coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
"If the coup had succeeded, Nigeria would have gone back to
square one in the area of our image and democratic process as
well as scare investors," Abacha told a delegation headed by the
Emir of Fika Alhaji Abali Ibn Mohammed from the northern Yobe
state Thursday in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of peace as a pre-requisite for
sustainable development and survival of democracy and assured the
delegation that the transition program was on course and would
not be derailed by the coup plot.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Supports Uganda in Fighting Against Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations provides
with 200 million Ugandan Shillings (some 200,000 U.S. Dollars) to
Uganda to fight cholera, The New Vision said today.
</P>
<P>
Thelma Awori, the UN Development Program's regional boss in
Africa, announced about 50 million shillings (some 500,000 U.S.
Dollars) will be used to check the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Cholera, an epidemic aggravated by poverty, should be checked
urgently, the UNDP boss said.
</P>
<P>
Her organization will review the emergency request from
Ugandan Health Ministry on the matter.
</P>
<P>
She visited treatment centers in Banda and Mulago in Kampala
city, accompanied by Health Minister Crispus Kiyonga.
</P>
<P>
Crispus Kiyonga, Ugandan Health Minister, appealed for help in
fighting against cholera on December 30, saying that his
country's problem in preventing cholera spread is lack of enough
fund and classified specialists. The treatment of a cholera
patient costs 40,000 to 50,000 shillings (some 40-50 U.S.
Dollars) per day, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 Ugandans have died since the outbreak of the
epidemic three weeks ago. The epidemic situation in the country
is still worsening.
</P>
<P>
"The organism that spreads cholera, Cholera Vibrio, dies
faster under the sun," said Charles Mugero, a specialist in
cholera task force.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Satisfied With Foreign Trade in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is satisfied with its
achievements in the external trade and commercial activities in
1997, said a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Compared with that of the previous year, the volume of export
increased by over 20 percent. Many key foreign currency earners
considerably raised their export volumes of rice, crude oil,
rubber latex, tea, shoes and seafood, said Deputy Prime Minister
Nguyen Manh Cam in an interview published Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cam, who is in charge of the government's external economic
relations, added that Vietnam has also managed to strictly control
imports and reduce the trade deficit by 37.5 percent down to 2.5
billion U.S. dollars, as compared with the four billion dollars of
trade deficit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although direct foreign investment dropped last year, Vietnam
witnessed the highest usage rate of pledged foreign investment in
projects estimated at about 3 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the deputy prime minister also said that the country
is facing some difficulties in the field of foreign trade and
other commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Although Vietnam's economic development maintained a high
growth rate, it has been facing many difficulties, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam in fact has to settle many outstanding problems while
at the same time cope with newly arising difficulties when
entering new stages of development," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNIP to Purge Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The United National Independence
Party (UNIP) led by former president Kenneth Kaunda will purge
dissident members creating divisions in the party, vice president
senior chief Inyambo Yeta said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia quoted him as charging that some leaders are
only interested in monetary gain and are busy creating divisions
instead of consolidating the party.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion UNIP Lusaka province chairman Peter
Lishika said that even some central committee members are
divisionist and campaigning to have some senior leaders removed.
</P>
<P>
Inyambo said unless discipline is maintained in the party the
situation may deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, the party will be tough with the leadership
at all levels.
</P>
<P>
To curb expenditure, salaries and allowances will be reduced,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is greatly dismayed with the level of indiscipline
that has characterized the party, especially in Lusaka province.
</P>
<P>
He castigated leaders for suspending party officials
disregarding the constitution and regulations forcing him to
instruct secretary general Sebastian Zulu to reverse some
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
He told UNIP central committee members to desist from being
arrogant and implored them to tour provinces and not talk down to
members but listen to them.
</P>
<P>
Inyambo said Kaunda has expressed unhappniess with house
arrest describing it as a mere transition from one prison to
another.
</P>
<P>
"Dr Kaunda has asked that we continue the struggle for his
absolute release through the international community." he said.
</P>
<P>
Inyambo said that UNIP will not attend the inter-party talks
until Kaunda is released unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested in connection with the October 28 abortive
coup and released from prison to house arrest on Wednesday
following representations from Tanzanian former president Julius
Nyerere and Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Sustained reforms have helped
East European economies recover from its post-Cold War decline,
but ensuing problems are preventing them from achieving a stable
growth.
</P>
<P>
Reforms have been increasingly painful for the economies in
transition but not efficacious enough to restore them to their
pre-1989 level.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank report predicted the economic growth in East
Europe to be 3 percent in 1997, slightly up from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Poland, a front-runner in the transition to market-oriented
economy, expected its gross domestic product to grow by 6 percent
last year. Despite international sanctions, Yugoslavia's gross
domestic product was expected to grow by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's GDP growth rate was estimated at 3 percent. It has
been ambitious in its reform program. By the end of 1997, only
five enterprises in the country remained state-owned. Half of its
exports are now produced by foreign-owned ventures.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic's GDP was predicted to grow by 1.8 percent
last year and the government decided to quicken the restructuring
of enterprises in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Privatization would move ahead -- but not without a price.
</P>
<P>
The opening of their economies to global competition after
years of planned economy has been painful, with soaring trade
deficits, growing unemployment and an economic growth far below
the average of the of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
East European economies are also troubled by budget deficit,
tax collection problems, soaring inflation and lack of social
security network for the poor.
</P>
<P>
With those problems, the economic growth in the region remained
unstable and fragile. The growth rate of the Czech economy slowed
down last year following a strong rebound since 1994. The
Hungarian economy also experienced ups and downs in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
The economy in Romania and Bulgaria did not fare well and
Albania's economy was on the verge of collapse following social
turmoil early last year. Bosnia has yet to rebuild its economy
after four years of devastating war.
</P>
<P>
In East Europe, 10 countries voiced their interest in joining
the European Union, but their per capita GDP was only 32 percent
of that of EU member nations. EU decided in July that it would
start membership talks with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovania and Estonia. Observers believe the five East European
nations will have to need conduct more economic restructuring
before they could join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that deeper reforms are needed for coping with the
problems of the economies in transition.
</P>
<P>
They observe that the East European economies still have a long
way to go before they could step into a period of stable and
sustained growth.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Set to Be Re-Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi is set to win the country's second multi-party
elections whose ballot counting is expected to be concluded
today.
</P>
<P>
So far Moi has garnered more than two million votes and got
the simple majority of 25 percent of the vote in six provinces,
according to the latest local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's law, the candidate who wins the highest total
and collects at least 25 percent of the votes in at least five of
Kenya's eight provinces can be qualified as a president.
</P>
<P>
Electoral Commission (EC) Public Relations Officer Mahamed
Koor told Xinhua the EC could not give the official results
unless vote counting is finished in all constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Only the capital city of Nairobi and Central Province, which
is the power-base of Kibaki, continued to elude Moi.
</P>
<P>
Based on initial results from 170 out of 210 constituencies,
Moi headed the poll with 2.013 million votes, followed by
Democratic Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki with over 1. 65 million
votes, said the latest Kenya Television Network's report.
</P>
<P>
However, Moi's expected win has caused mixed reactions from
opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki and National Development Party's leader Odinga
announced Thursday they would not accept Moi as a winner while a
leading opposition lobby group, the National Convention Executive
Council (NCEC), said the poll "must be declared null and void."
</P>
<P>
However, they failed to reveal their further plans, if they
had any, in case of a Moi victory.
</P>
<P>
The government warned later that the police would "deal
swiftly and firmly" with anyone who tried to disturb the peace.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union and
main opposition parties claimed the elections had been rigged,
saying the poor organization of the polling by the EC offered
advantages to their rivals.
</P>
<P>
Transport difficulties caused by bad weather, mixed ballot
papers, missing electors names from registers, lack of ballot
papers and other technical problems caused delays, chaos and
tension nationwide in Monday's poll and forced one-day extension
of the voting.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the U.S. administration said despite
"bureaucratic flaws" in the polling process, "the Kenyan people
through their actions have demonstrated a powerful commitment to
democracy."
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the level of peaceful, popular
participation in the election" in Kenya, U.S. State Department
Deputy Spokesman James Foley was quoted by reports reaching here
as saying.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9,031,141 registered Kenyan voters were expected to
to elect one president, 210 parliamentary members and 2,955 local
councillors for the next five years starting from 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are 883 candidates from 23 parties running for the
parliamentary seats while 8,446 for civic positions in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Zambia Democratic
Congress (ZDC) demanded Thursday release of its leader Dean
Mung'omba one day after former President Kenneth Kaunda was put
under house arrest from prison.
</P>
<P>
ZDC General Secretary Stanley Hamusonde said that "we are
disappointed that President Chiluba refused to free Mung'omba
because outsiders did not ask about his release, this is sad as
it gives an impression that Chiluba can only act when foreigners
intervene."
</P>
<P>
He said that Chiluba should be able to act on his own without
waiting for outside pressure.
</P>
<P>
Hamusonda said it is unfair for the ZDC leader to remain in
prison for two months now while Kaunda who was only seven days
behind bars was released.
</P>
<P>
Announcing Kaunda's release Wednesday from prison to house
arrest Chiluba said he decided to place Kaunda under house arrest
leaving out the others like ZDC President Mung'omba because the
outcry was on Kaunda, who was arrested last Thursday allegedly in
connection with the October 28 abortive coup, and none of the
others were mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Mung'omba was arrested on October 31 in connection with the
coup attempt.

HANOI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's coal industry mined
nearly 11 million tons of coal last year, a record output that was
13 percent over that of last year, local press reported Friday.

<P>
By selling nearly 7 million ton of coal at home and another

million U.S. dollars to the state budget, up by 15 percent from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Based on consumption forecasts for 1998, the Vietnam coal
corporation has asked its subsidiaries to excavate 86 kilometers
of tunnels leading to coal mines to expand production.

<P>
The corporation has also mapped out measures to expand its
foothold in domestic market and a plan to intensify environmental

<P>
CANBERRA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar limped
into New Year trading pressured by falling gold prices, only just
managing to cling to the 65 US cents level.
</P>
<P>
But traders are bearish on the outlook for the local currency,
predicting it will slide below the figure when the market returns
to full strength next week.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished the week at 65.06 US cents, down
from 65.24 locally on Wednesday, New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
John Reedyk, head of foreign exchange sales with ANZ bank,
expects the Australian dollar to re-test 64.60 US cents next
week.
</P>
<P>
The currency was last seen at that level on December 16, when
it plunged to a four-year low.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Colonial State Bank Chief Economist Craig James
said the effects of weaker Asian economies and more competitive
Asian exports would gradually result in a weaker Australian trade
position over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended the week at 85.19 yen, from 84.76
here on Wednesday and at 1.1722 marks, from 1.1672.

<HEADLINE> New Ruble To Ease the "Paper Chase" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A new ruble, worth 1,000 times
more than the old, began circulating in Russia on Thursday, the
first day of 1998.
</P>
<P>
With the new ruble came the reappearance of the kopeck. The old
kopeck, the smallest coin in the Russian currency, was taken out
of circulation six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The newly-issued ruble includes five kinds of paper currency of
5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 rubles notes, and three kinds of coin
rubles. There are four kopeck coins.
</P>
<P>
At the present, the rate of the new ruble is six against one
U.S. dollar. The old ruble was 6000 to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Though the new ruble is circulating, the old money is also
being allowed to continue circulating in 1998. Banks will accept
old notes for exchange for another four years.
</P>
<P>
It was expected about 90 percent of the old notes would
disappear from circulation after the first month this year, and
the new bills would fully replace the old by the middle of this
year.

<P>
HELSINKI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said in their New
Year's messages Thursday that Finland would continue to make
efforts for the stability and development in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year's message, President Ahtisaari said his country
has got more opportunities of international cooperation in various
fields since the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In the military field, Northern Europe is moving towards
cooperation and arms reduction. Ahtisaari said there was good news
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had announced cutting down
Russia's armed forces in the regions near Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Last March Finland became the host country of the U.S.-Russian
summit. The Helsinki summit decided to continue dismarment, deepen
cooperation and give rights to all the countries to solve their
own security and political issues, the Finnish president said.
</P>
<P>
Finland and Russia have developed a more natural
relationship. The Finnish government's initiative for the EU's
development towards Northern Europe has gained unreserved supports

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
the country's population reached 202.534,145 on the new year's
day.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Thursday by the National Family Planning
Board judged the current population figure an impressive
achievement because experts had predicted 280 million citizens by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The nation reached the 200 million population mark on February
4 last year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia launched its family planning program in 1969. The
average number of children in a family has dropped from six 30
years ago to 2.6 now.
</P>
<P>
The population growth rate in the country dropped below 1.6
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the world,
according to United Nations projections, after China, India and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Population Haryono Suyono said earlier the
government would soon conduct a nationwide census on family
welfare to identify Indonesian families living below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
He said the census, which is expected to cover 42 million
families, will run for three months beginning in January.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Take G-77 Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is for the first time
to assume the chairmanship of the Group of 77, the negotiating
forum of developing countries at the United Nations, officials at
the Foreign Ministry confirmed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's turn to head the group will begin with a ceremony
handing over the post from the Tanzanian foreign minister to
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas at the UN headquarters in
New York on January 12, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony is expected to be attended by UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan, the executive administrator of the UN development
Program and other heads of UN agencies, they added.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Indonesia to the UN
Makarim Wibisono said earlier that as chairman of the 133-member
group, Indonesia will have a special chance to offer alternative
approaches to developing countries as they prepare for the next
millennium, fraught as it will be with challenges and
opportunities in areas of multilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In electing Indonesia to chair the group, G-77 members recalled
the country's skippering of the Nonaligned Movement, steering that
group's strategy away from confrontation to partnership with
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"The G-77 chairmanship gives Indonesia a chance to review the
Caracas Program of Action (CPA), upon which the G-77 was founded,
to determine whether or not it remains valid," Makarim said.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Maker Pays Big Sum for Smoking-Related Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A United States' tobacco
company has paid 1.5 million U.S. dollars to the family of a Los
Angeles psychologist who died of lung cancer linked to cigarettes
he smoked in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Milton Horowitz sued the Lorillard Tobacco Company after a rare
form of asbestos-related lung cancer was diagnosed in 1994. He
said he became sick because the Kent cigarettes he smoked during
the 1950s contained asbestos filters.
</P>
<P>
A San Francisco jury in 1995 awarded Horowitz, then 70, and his
family 1.3 million dollars in compensatory damages and 700,000
dollars in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
The company appealed the verdict but both a state appeals court
and the California Supreme Court upheld the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Horowitz's children took over the lawsuit after their father
died in 1996. Earlier this week, two years after the jury verdict,
the company paid the compensatory portion of the award, which with
interest and trial cost came to 1.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to be the first Americans to collect a
smoking-related judgment from a cigarette company. Opponents
against tobacco industry hailed it as an important milestone in
their fight.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Suffer Record Cases of Dengue, Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of cases of
mosquito-borne diseases, particularly dengue fever and malaria,
hit a record high in Singapore in 1997, showing that Singaporeans
have not been spared the resurgence of dengue in the region, the
Straits Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics from the Environment Ministry, the Straits
Times said that there were 4,300 dengue fever cases last year and
one person died of it. In 1996, there were 3,128 cases and three
people died.
</P>
<P>
Dengue is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, which breeds in
clean and stagnant water, such as rain water that collects in
discarded containers in gardens and homes.
</P>
<P>
As there is no vaccine against dengue, the ministry's focus is
on controlling the Aedes mosquito population. In order to help
stem the rise in dengue fever cases, the fine for breeding
mosquitoes was doubled in October last year to 100 Singapore
dollars (about 59 U.S. dollars) for first-time offenders, while
repeat offenders are fined 200 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year also saw an increase in the number of malaria cases
to 421 from 364 in 1996. About 90 percent, or 386 cases, of them
were imported. Some were brought in by Singaporeans who had
traveled overseas but most were from foreigners working here, on
tour here, or who came here to seek medical treatment, the Straits
Times report said.

COLOMBO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's unemployment rate
dropped to 10 percent in 1997 from 13.7 percent in 1995, officials
in the Industrial Development Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly due to the implementation of more than 600
large scale projects and 2,446 small and medium-sized projects
during the period, which provided employment opportunities to
933,000 people, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,241 factories expanded their production capacity
during the three years, taking in more employees.
</P>
<P>
These officials said that capital investments on machines and
equipment increased by 35 percent during 1996 and 1997, which
helped improve the country's industrial performance.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector contributed 35 percent to the country's
economic growth last year, which was around 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Economy Up 13.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth in the Tibet
Autonomous Region is estimated at 13.4 percent for 1997, far
outpacing the national average of 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
This would be the fifth consecutive year that Tibet has
registered double-digit economic growth, which would give the
remote region a stronger mandate to improve people's living
standards and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's total gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated at
7.35 billion yuan for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attributed the rapid GDP growth to a dramatic
surge of investment in basic industries and infrastructure, a
direct result of central government support, more efforts for
reform and opening up, and aid from the inland provinces and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 Tibet pumped 400 million yuan into agriculture and, as
a result, achieved major gains in its grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income of Tibetan herdsmen and farmers should rise
to 1,040 yuan in 1997 from 975 yuan the previous year. And 120,000
residents should rise from poverty, lowering the number of
poverty-stricken people in the region to 330,000. China's poverty
line now stands at 550 yuan in terms of annual per capita income.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tibet also accelerated the pace of economic reforms
and industrial restructuring, which, in part, contributed to the
region's rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local officials said, key construction projects
proceeded smoothly last year, with investment rising to 3.67
billion yuan from 2.38 billion yuan in 1996. So far, 60 out of the
62 state-funded key projects have been completed and put into
operation.

<HEADLINE> Treatment of Hemophilia B Developed by Chinese Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A new way of treating
hemophilia B has been developed by doctors at a Shanghai hospital.
</P>
<P>
The new technique to treat the blood disease with gene transfer
was the result of long-term cooperation between Shanghai-based
Fudan University and the Changhai Hospital attached to the No. 2
Medical University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Examinations of two patients who received the gene-transfer
therapy six years ago, have shown that their health is quite good
with no side effects or complicating diseases.
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia B is a hereditary disease caused by blood that is
short of Factor IX plasma thromboplastin component
(PTC). Spontaneous bleeding and a weakened ability to form new
blood cells are symptoms of the disease. Most patients rely on
blood transfusions or blood products to complement blood-forming
factors. Patients are often threatened by viral infection.
</P>
<P>
Using the gene-transfer technique, doctors inject cells taken
from the patient and cultivated outside the patient's body with
blood-forming genes into the blood of patients.
</P>
<P>
Four boys, aged 4 to 15, have received such treatment since
1991, and their blood-forming function is now effective.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Well Drillers Praised in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The General Manager of
Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority, Tadesse Kebede, has
praised as the "best quality" of the well drilling project
constructed by China National Complete Plant Import and Export
Group.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a farewell reception he gave yesterday evening
here for the Chinese team who just completed the 27 well drilling
project before the eve of new year, Tadesse said he was "very,
very happy for the completion of the project."
</P>
<P>
Tadesse described the well-drilling project as a friendship
between the peoples of Ethiopia and China and hoped the
cooperation between them will be continued in the future.
</P>
<P>
Tadesse said that the well drilling project is a very
important project for the authority and it will play an important
role in alleviating the water shortage of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to Tadesse, Addis Ababa is a city short of water and
the current water supply is only 60 percent of its needs while
the shortage is 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the water shortage of the city, the authority is
carrying out an emergency groundwater development project
following the completion of the wells.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, laying water pipes for 11
wells is expected to be completed at the end of 1998 while the
second phase of the project for the remaining 14 wells will
invite bidders at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The 25 wells project will supply 25-30 percent water needs of
the city, raising the water supply rate of the city from
currently 60 percent to 85-90 percent.
</P>

Outside the city, another 27 wells located at Akati, 15 kms
south of Addis Ababa, were completed a week ago after two years
hard work by Chinese constructors.
</P>
<P>
Project Manager Li Lei told Xinhua that the average yield of
the 120-to-150m-deep wells in the capital city, is 7,200 cubic
meter per day per well.
</P>
<P>
The 13-men Chinese team is appreciated by the project owner
and other related departments because they complete the project
on time under the conditions of insufficient technical
information and outmoded equipment, especially the complicated
geological conditions of the well site.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Against Child Labor in Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has warned miners of employing child labor, the Guardian said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium which closed here Thursday, the
Minister for Community Development, Women and Children Affairs,
Mary Nagu, said the government will "take stern measures" against
those who employ children in mining.
</P>
<P>
"The government wants to alert you to stop employing children.
Instead, you are advised to let them proceed with their studies,"
Nagu was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at the symposium which was organized by
Tanzania Women Miners' Association. It was attended by
representatives from Kigoma, Morogoro, Mbeya, Shinyanga, Tanga
and Mara regions.
</P>
<P>
But the minister gave no details on the punishment of those
miners who employ children as cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
Although child labor has been widely criticized in Tanzania, a
number of small-scale miners prefer to employ children. Teenage
boys who are flexible in exploiting coal out of smaller pits have
been described as "snake boys," who are more efficient than
adults in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
According to a United Nations Development Program report
released last month, only 15 percent of primary school leavers
joined schools in 1996, a very low rate compared with other
sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged women miners to form a broad network
with other miners in other countries to form a broad network so
as to boost the the development of minerals.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Optimistic About Dealing With Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines Friday expressed optimism that the country will be
able to cope with the continuous devaluation of the peso against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson said the situation is
still within manageable levels, especially with the government's
imposition of some belt-tightening and other economic measures
that would arrest the further plummeting of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the government had taken significant steps to
reform the local financial system to "dismantle regulations that
tend to hamper growth and to create a more investor-friendly
investment atmosphere", he said.
</P>
<P>
These reforms include interest rate liberalization,
rationalization of the reserve requirement, establishment of new
banks and branches, financial restructuring of the Central Bank
and the entry of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
He added that these measures had affected the behavior of a
number of key economic indicators such as interest rates, savings
and growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the International Monetary Fund has also
agreed to grant a new loan of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars to help
sustain the Philippines' financial market.
</P>
<P>
The peso has fallen by 52 percent from 26.2 pesos a dollar to
the current level of 40.116 pesos per dollar since July last year,
causing interest rates to soar and damping the growth of local
industries.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Province Taking Advantage of Local Strengths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest
China is striving to take full advantage of its rich natural
resources and tourism as well as its strong scientific research
capabilities to fuel an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the province should seek more funds,
technologies and markets to make economic gains.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that in the last two years the province
has approved about 600 overseas-funded projects and used 1.5
billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1997, the province's average annual
growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) reached 10.9 percent,
1.4 percent higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi has abundant natural resources. Ninety-two types of
minerals have been discovered, with deposits of 28 minerals
ranking first to third among all provinces.
</P>
<P>
The province also owns a world-grade, large fine-coal field and
gas production center.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 13 dynasties established their capital cities in
the province. A long history has brought rich tourism potential
for the province.
</P>
<P>
The province's scientific research capability ranks third in
the country, involving nearly 2,000 research institutions.
</P>
<P>
In spite of rich resources, the economic gap is still widening
between Shaanxi and the coastal areas of the country. And the
province's economic status in the country has dropped relative to
others, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The exports only accounted for 12 percent of the province's GDP
during 1978-1995 period. And the overseas investment used by
Shaanxi amounted to 4.5 percent of its total fixed assets. The two
indexes are both in the lower half of the national average and
only equal to one-fourth that of some coastal provinces.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is expected to become a leading province in the field
of economy, industry and tourism by making full use of abundant
mineral resources, technologies and splendid culture, according to
the economic strategy formulated by the local government.
</P>
<P>
To establish economic and technological cooperation with the
outside world, the province took part in all kinds of trade fairs
in Hong Kong, Italy and Japan in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The province invested 240 million yuan to build a 20-kilometer
Xi'an-Lingtong expressway and six years later transferred its
right of use to Hong Kong for 20 years, at a price of 300 million
yuan. The province has thus recovered funds to invest in other
projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province transferred 51 percent of shares of
the largest thermal power plant in the northwest, with an
installed capacity of 1.3 million kilowatts, to a Hong Kong
company, collecting 2.75 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
These measures have not only brought funds and advanced
expertise, but also helped the province realize the importance of
a market economy, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Help PNG Rehabilitate Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia will donate almost
500 ton of plants and seeds to Papua New Guinea (PNG) as part of a
one million Australian dollar (650,000 US dollar) program to help
the country rehabilitate crops after last year's devastating
drought and frosts.
</P>
<P>
The decision to provide fast-growing crops to PNG villagers
came as AusAid, Australia's official overseas agency, and the
Australian Defense Force prepare for the start of a third cycle of
emergency food deliveries on Saturday to isolated areas of the
Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
The new agricultural rehabilitation program would assist the
long-term recovery of PNG food crops, Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 695,000 people in PNG have entered 1998 at risk of
starvation because of severe drought in the country, Care
Australia, a leading aid agency, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"By beginning to replant village food gardens the project aims
to reduce the dependency on emergency food relief supplies by
helping villagers develop a more secure, sustainable food supply,"
Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the rehabilitation project, Australia will ship plant and
seeds of rapid growing food crops.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, Australia has airlifted more than 1.2
million kg food to isolated areas of PNG facing serious food
shortages due to widespread crop failures caused by drought and
killer frosts last year.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Subway to Proceed: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will not
shelve the multi-billion-baht Bangkok underground train project
but will press on with it, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister's Office Minister Somboon Rahong said Thursday
the government is seeking financial support from Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund for the 20-km project.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not suspend the project. It will proceed
on schedule... The system should start service in the year 2002,"
Somboon was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the National Economic and Social Development
Board, the country's economic planning agency, suggested that the
project be shelved to save money.
</P>
<P>
Somboon said delaying the mass transit project will do more
harm than good. Losses through traffic congestion, wasted fuel and
pollution are tremendous, adding that the state would face much
higher construction costs of the project if it was to be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed that he is asking the Japanese fund to
lend 80 percent of the project's civil work construction cost (70
billion baht, or 1.5 billion US dollars at current exchange rate),
instead of an earlier agreed 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Tourist Arrivals Up Less Than 1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourist arrivals in
Thailand grew less than 1 percent in 1997, far below the 7 percent
increase forecast earlier in the year, the Bangkok Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the tourism industry was due to the economic
crisis in several Asian countries and the haze that covered
Southeast Asia in October and November, the newspaper quoted Seree
Wangpaichitr, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT),
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Seree added that the cheap baht did not attract foreigners to
Thailand as much as the TAT had projected.
</P>
<P>
He said tourists buying package tours to Thailand did not
benefit at all, as tour operators never reduced their prices, some
hotels quoted their room rates in US dollars, and overseas tour
companies and their local partners pocketed huge exchange-rate
profits instead of passing the savings along to consumers.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the low arrival growth in 1997, the TAT has
reduced its foreign tourist arrival target for the two-year
"Amazing Thailand" (1998 and 1999) tourism campaign, from 17
million arrivals down to 16 million, with 7.66 million arrivals
expected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two-year tourism revenue target has also been cut from 600
billion baht to 582 billion baht (or 13 billion US dollars to
12.65 billion dollars at current exchange rate).
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry officials believe that 1998 will be another
tough year for the sector.

BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China's athletes had a harvest
year in 1997 when they smashed 29 world records and won 92 world
champions.
</P>
<P>
These world records were rewritten by 29 people and two teams,
some of them improved more than once.
</P>
<P>
The new marks include four in swimming, 24 in weightlifting and
one in short-track speed skating.
</P>
<P>
These brought the total of the world records smashed or

China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The number of the world champions was increased to 1123.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Dealing With Urban Sewage Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is expediting an
urban sewage treatment project in a bid to improve the quality of
the city's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Initiated in the mid-1980s, the first phase was completed in
the early 1990s on the upper reaches of the Huangpu River and the
north bank of the Suzhou River, two major drinking water sources
for Shanghai city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 million yuan (96 million U.S. dollars) has been
spent shifting the city's major water intakes to the middle
reaches of the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
An additional 2.5 billion yuan (301 million U.S. dollars) has
been spent to block industrial and residential wastewater from
flowing into the Suzhou River, and to erect a 40-kilometer-long
underwater pipeline with a daily sewage transporting capacity of
1.4 million cubic meters. An area of 70 square kilometers and a
population of more than one million have benefited from the sewage
treatment project.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the focus has shifted to building reservoirs
and water treatment plants. The Chenhang Reservoir on the Yangtze
River now supplies 400,000 cubic meters a day to the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1997, the city government embarked on the
project's second phase. At this stage, 4.8 billion yuan (578
million U.S. dollars) is being spent to extend a pipe 50
kilometers into the depths of the mouth of Yangtze River to
transport urban sewage.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled for completion by 1999, when the pipe
will have a daily capacity of 1.7 million cubic meters and benefit
an area of 270 square kilometers and 3.56 million Shanghai
residents.
</P>
<P>
Work on clearing a layer of mud in the Suzhou River is also
under way at an estimated cost of 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion
U.S. dollars).

others were injured, the Presidential Secretariat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner, High Court Judge A. Rajah Nihal Fernando, has
been empowered to investigate the manner of the prison
administration, the conduct of prison officers and the
circumstances which led to the riot on December 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He has also been asked to find out those directly or indirectly
 responsible for the incident and those responsible for causing
injuries and deaths to inmates in the prison,43 kilometers south
of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commissioner will make recommendations
necessary to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, the
secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Two Tamils and one Muslim were killed and 17 others injured
when a major clash between the Tamil and Sinhala inmates erupted
in the prison last month.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Tamil inmates staged a four-day fast in
protest and asked to be transferred to other prisons.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Develops a Longer-Legged Jumbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Boeing is going to offer a
new version of the 747-400 jumbo jet that can fly farther than
conventional models.
</P>
<P>
The company abandoned a larger, long-range 747 project last
year.
</P>
<P>
The new model, sought by the Australian airline, Qantas, could
fly several hundred miles farther than the 8,000-mile range of the
present four engine jumbo, depending on whether one or two
additional fuel tanks were added. It would counter the planned
long-range Airbus A3XX that would seat up to 600 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Qantas has asked Boeing to build three of the jumbo jets, and
Boeing's board of directors has given its commercial airplane
group the go-ahead to offer the new version.
</P>
<P>
If enough other carriers also order, the model could be
delivered in late 2000, Boeing officials said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from additional fuel tanks, the new model needs
strengthening around the center of the fuselage, the wings, flaps
and landing gear. The airplane's seating capacity of about 420
passengers would not be increased by the additions, but the
improvements could open the way to adding 50 to 60 seats.
</P>
<P>
The company is also offering stretched and long-range versions
of its 777-200 twinjet that seats nearly 400. Target customers are
airlines that want long-range capability without moving up to the
larger and more expensive 747.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Boeing dropped the projected 747-500/600X because of
lack of orders.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, US Scientists to Hold Seminar on Most Frontier Subjects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Young Chinese and American
scientists will discuss the latest developments in frontier
sciences for the first time at a seminar this year.
</P>
<P>
Forty young Chinese scientists will attend a seminar on
frontier sciences to be held in California of the United States in
August.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. seminar will offer seven fields for
discussion: geology, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics,
social sciences and astronomy. The organizing committees of China
and the United States will make a final decision next month on the
specific contents to be discussed at the August seminar.
</P>
<P>
By informing each other of the latest scientific developments,
Chinese and American scientists are expected to enlighten each
other and share ideas to break down barriers they face at work,
and to open new research areas.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. seminar is the offshoot of a national seminar on
frontier sciences that has been going on since 1989 in the United
States. Three or four U.S. scientists will be selected to make
reports in non-professional language on their latest discoveries
and the growth of research fields at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Bai Chunli, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), was very much impressed by the US seminar when he attended
the ninth one held in November of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bai believes that it is a good challenge for Chinese scientists
to participate in such academic exchanges in terms of knowledge,
language, communications and organizing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The CAS, China's top natural science research body, is working
on member selection for the seminar. Candidates do not have to be
CAS members, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
Bai said he hopes that the most competitive scientists will
pass the examination and attend the seminar on behalf of Chinese
scientists.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Suppress Drugs Among Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Narcotics Suppression
Bureau proposes a major operational plans revamp in a bid to
distract youths and students from drug sources.
</P>
<P>
Bureau Commissioner pol. lt.-gen. Noppadol Somboonsap was
quoted Friday by local press as saying that the proposal is
supported by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai who wishes to see
serious action to suppress drugs among youths and in schools.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai last week expressed concern at a seminar over a
report that the number of drug addicts has increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
Under this proposal, Legislation is required to empower
authorities to enter educational institutions to administer drug
tests and urge addicted students to undergo a rehabilitation
program.
</P>
<P>
A joint committee comprising the bureau, the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration and the interior and education
ministries will be set up this month to draft a new
drug-suppression policy.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation centers will be established to stop the spread
of drugs into schools, Noppadol said.

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Flows off U.S. Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. balloonist Steve Fossett
smoothly flew off U.S. territory Thursday in his third attempt to
circle the globe by non-stop ballooning.
</P>
<P>
By 5:30 p.m EST (22:30 GMT), Fossett was about 110 kilometers
southeast of Bermuda, traveling at about 128 kilometers per hour
at an altitude of 6,640 meters. He was expected to reach Europe by
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
What he was concerned on Thursday was about the safety of his
competitor Kevin Uliassi, who took off a few hours after Fossett
Wednesday night but was forced to abort his attempt.
</P>
<P>
Fossett took off from Busch Stadium in St. Louis and Uliassi
from a quarry near Rockford, Illinois. Three hours after takeoff,
a burst helium container forced Uliassi to abort and land, unhurt,
in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, 53, was trying to become the first person to
successfully pilot a balloon around the globe.
</P>
<P>
The last time was in January 1997, also after a Busch Stadium
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
Although he failed to cross the Pacific Ocean because of
shortage of fuel in the last try, he set a record by traveling
16,000 kilometers in six days without stop.
</P>
<P>
This time he is carrying 50 percent more fuel and his balloon
is 28 percent larger at 9,800 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
He will burn an ethane and propane fuel mixture to heat air
surrounding the helium encapsulated in the balloon and thus
control his altitude.
</P>
<P>
Fossett has oxygen mask and a separate heating system for the
unpressurized capsule to survive in the thin air and the upper
altitude temperatures that drop as low as as minus 45.4 Celsius.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Acts to Protect Local Manufacturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has ordered the country's top economic managers to draw up a
rescue plan for local manufacturers to avert possible massive
layoffs and conserve precious foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the order following a proposal from the Federation
of Philippine Industries (EPI) to impose additional taxes on
foreign goods that are also produced locally, local press reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Ramos, EPI President Raul Concepcion
listed five whammies the country is facing, namely, depressed
consumer demand as people tighten their belt, contraction of
credit, tightening of money supply, cheap imports from countries
undergoing massive retrenchment, and continued operation of
duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion said the temporary additional tax is "necessary to
partially offset the huge projected fiscal deficit this year", and
that it will be a bleak year this year for the local manufacturers
who are suffering higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Based on the private sector projections, manufacturers will
have to dramatically cut down their production this year due to
lower consumer demand and increase in raw material imports.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said Concepcion's proposal
would be taken up in a special cabinet cluster meeting involving
monetary, fiscal and economic officials, together with the central
bank and business leaders shortly after New Year's day.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the peso has devaluated by some 52
percent to the current level of 40 pesos per U.S. dollar, causing
the interest rates to soar between 20 percent and 30 percent. The
Asian Development Bank and other multinational institutions have
urged the country to lower the interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Maradona, Napoli Go "Positively" in Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The talk between Diego
Maradona and Italian Serie A club Napoli about the Argentine star
to be Napoli's president and coach have been "positive", according
to a Buenos Aires TV channel here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Manager Guillermo Coppola just returned from Italy after
negotiating on behalf of Maradona and said the club has proposed a
deal to bring the 1986 World Cup hero back to the club where he
used to play from 1984 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
Napoli, which won its only two Serie A titles with Maradona as
the captain in 1987 and 1990 but later sued him, has fallen to
last place in the Italian first division having lost eight of its
last nine.
</P>
<P>
"This problem is going to be settled in the first days of
January. It all depends on whether Napoli's president Corrado
Ferlaino is willing to give away his club shares," Coppola said.
</P>
<P>
Coppola did not elaborate on Maradona's proposal to the Italian
club.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Maradona had said that his appointment as
president and coach of Napoli "is almost 60 percent a fact".

<P>
BRASILIA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil might lose 2.5 million
jobs in 1998 because of the slowing of economic growth, a report
warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report from the Center of Labor Union Studies and Labor
Economy of Brazil says a serious situation will occur if the
government does not take effective measures against the problem.
</P>
<P>
The report said only 2.6 million new jobs have been created in
the country since 1985. Last year, 1.6 million people lost their
jobs, when the economy grew 2.9 percent. If the gross domestic
product grows 1.4 to 2 percent in 1998, more jobs will be lost.
</P>
<P>
The average unemployment rate in Brazil in November was 5.35
percent, the highest figure in any November since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimated
that the unemployment rate will rise to seven or eight percent
this year.

<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were killed
and more than 500 injured as the Philippines welcomed the new year
with firecracker explosion, gun shooting and violence, local
newspaper Manila Bulletin reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an official report as saying that five of
the fatalities were hit by stray bullets, three died of
firecracker burns while nine others were killed in stabbing and
shooting incidents.
</P>
<P>
Many of those injured needed to have their hands or fingers
amputated while some suffered eye injuries, the report said,

</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica said the injured were being

She added that the number of victims declined compared with
that of last year thanks to the Health Department's drives
launched against firecracker use and indiscriminate gun shooting.

<P>
Sixteen people died and 640 were wounded in New Year's revelry
last year while 33 killed and 834 were injured during 1995's New

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Per Capita Income Down to 9,400 U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's per capita income
dropped to 9,400 U.S. dollars in 1997 from the previous year's
10,548 dollars, said the Ministry of Economy and Finance Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the first of its kind since 1980 when each South
Korean suffered a slide of 50 dollars due to an oil shock around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the decrease to the failure of the
government's economic policies and the 40 percent devaluation of
South Korean won against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
They said the nation's per capita income will further fall this
year in the aftermath of serious financial crisis caused by the
failure of conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions
last November.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy, the analysts added, could grind to halt
without speedy assistance from international financial
organizations and industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korea has so far received only 9 billion of the
agreed rescue loans totaling 57 billion dollars from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) while its won continues to
depreciate.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed with the IMF last December, South
Korea has to completely open its financial market, shut down
ailing commercial banks, and cut its budget while it has to face
massive layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea, whose foreign exchange reserve
reportedly stands at about 9 billion dollars, has to pay back
about 25 billion dollars in foreign debts before next February.

Ski patrol got to the scene soon and provided first aid as he

</P>
<P>
Kennedy was the second of the 11 children born to the former
senator and his wife, Ethel, to die under tragic circumstances. His
brother David died in Florida in 1984 of a drug overdose.
</P>
<P>
Once viewed as the next political star in the Kennedy family,
Michael suffered a fall from grace last Spring when he was accused
of having had an affair with his family's baby-sitter.
</P>
<P>
But investigations were abandoned after the woman, now a
college student, and her family refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Michael Kennedy marks another blow to the
Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
When Michael was 5, his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was
assassinated in Dallas in November 1963. Five years later, his
father Robert F. Kennedy was gunned down in Los Angeles in his
presidential race.
