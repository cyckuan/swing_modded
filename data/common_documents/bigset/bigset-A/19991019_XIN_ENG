<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Promoting Tehran-Ankara Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Monday called for further promoting and consolidating
Tehran-Ankara ties on the basis of common interests.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the appeal while meeting with visiting Turkish
special envoy Korma Haktanir who submitted a written message from
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Expanding relations with regional countries such as Turkey is
among the principles of Iran's foreign policy, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted Khatami as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the light of the good will of the two
countries' officials and through dialogue, exchange of ideas and
providing suitable mechanisms, Iran and Turkey can prevent the
occurrence of trivial problems in bilateral ties, especially in
security fields.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Turkey's military raids on some Iranian border
areas in July, he expressed hope that the Turkish side would make
up for the incident and adopt precautionary measures to prevent
the recurrence of such incident in the future.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that five people were killed and 10 others injured
in the air raid by Turkish warplanes in July.
</P>
<P>
However, Ankara claimed that Turkish Kurdish rebels have bases
on Iranian soil to fight against the Turkish government, a charge
repeatedly denied by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Khatami assured that under no circumstance Iran would permit
any damage or harm to be inflicted on Turkey from his country.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming his Turkish counterpart to visit Iran, Khatami
said that exchange of visits would help strengthen bilateral ties
and would open brighter horizons before the two nations.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Turkish envoy called for increasing the
volume of bilateral trade, citing establishment of a trade council
and joint chamber of commerce as among new measures which can
help boost cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Haktanir, who arrived here on Sunday for a three-day visit,
also held talks on Monday with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and Deputy Foreign Minister for Asian and Pacific Affairs
Mohsen Aminzadeh.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Cairo for Talks on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived in Cairo Monday evening for
talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the latest developments in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at the Cairo
International Airport, Arafat said he will brief Mubarak on the
hurdles set by the Israeli side to the implementation of the
revised Wye accord signed on September 5 in Egypt's Red Sea resort
of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
He said he was here to seek Mubarak's advice on the peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Setback emerged in the implementation of the peace deal after
Israel postponed twice in two weeks the opening of a safe passage
linking the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage that will enable the Palestinians move
relatively freely between the two separate Palestinian self-rule
areas, was regarded by the Palestinians as a mark of the
geographic and demographic unity.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 permits were distributed Monday for the Palestinians
to use the transit route, but the two sides have yet to agree on
the opening date.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here following his visit to Japan, Vietnam and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he will also brief Mubarak on the
outcome of the donor countries' conference which was held in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader is scheduled to meet with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa later in the day and hold talks with
Mubarak Tuesday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to hold consultations with
Mubarak, who, as the president of the first Arab country to sign a
peace treaty with Israel, plays an active role in mediating the
Arab-Israeli peace talks.

WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
vetoed a foreign aid bill approved by the Republican-controlled

</P>
<P>
The 12.6 billion U.S. dollars foreign aid bill was strongly

Speaking to reporters here, Clinton said the bill provides

Republican congressional leaders to join the administration in

Clinton also said he would sign another emergency spending

it should be a short-term measure.

"We have to put politics aside and seek common ground," Clinton
said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Israel to Make Peace with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting former South
African President Nelson Mandela Monday urged Israel to make
peace with Syria, saying that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad was
committed to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before meeting with Israeli President
Ezer Weizman, Mandela said that after his meeting with Assad last
week, he believed that the Syrian leader "is not only committed to
peace in general, but committed to peace with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Having also visited Iran, which Israel regards as a major
potential threat, Mandela said Tehran is committed to maintaining
stability in the region and bears "no particular hatred of any
country, including Israel."
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to make peace with former enemies, citing the
peaceful transformation in South Africa. "We spoke with and made
peace with some of the people who slaughtered our people like
animals," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than three months after Prime Minister Ehud Barak took
office on a platform to revive the stalled Middle East peace
process, Israel and Syria are still at odds over how to restart
their talks frozen three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Damascus demands a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle
East war, before the talks can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
It says that former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had
made such a commitment in previous talks in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied the existence of such a commitment, saying
that talks should restart without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Barak reiterated during his meeting with Mandela Monday night
that he believed the talks could be resumed in weeks or months. He
also repeated that an agreement with Syria would require "painful
territorial compromise." He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
During a television interview on Sunday, Barak hinted, in the
clearest way ever, that he was willing to return almost all of the
Golan Heights to Syria in order to realize peace.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who has shown his impatience with Assad over his
indecision on several occasions, again voiced his frustration,
"I've signaled to President Assad more than 20 times and he
doesn't budge."
</P>
<P>
Although terming Mandela's two-day visit as private, Israel
attached great importance to it, the first by the former South
African leader. The Jewish state was blamed for cooperating with
South Africa's apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will brief Mandela on the
latest developments in the peace process on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's visit is widely seen here as a gesture of final
reconciliation with Israel, which backed the apartheid regime in
South Africa. It is also seen as a signal of support for the
policy of the current moderate government of Barak.
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old statesman had planned to visit Israel on four
previous occasions before he retired from office in June, but
postponed the trips due to snags in the peace process during the
former hard-line government of Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is due to travel to the Palestinian self-rule areas
Tuesday. He will hold talks with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat on the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tea Prices Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Tea prices at Kenya's weekly
auction in the Indian Ocean port Mombasa dropped Monday as key
players are lukewarm in buying, Africa Tea Brokers (ATB) said in a
market analysis.
</P>
<P>
The major tea trader said the prices would continue to fall in
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Best broken pekoes (BP1s) were sold at 2.62 to 2.67 U.S.
dollars per kilogram, compared with 2.65 to 2.72 U.S. dollars per
kilogram last week.
</P>
<P>
Good pekoes fannings (PF1s) stood between 2.39 and 2.54 U.S.
dollars per kilogram, as against 2.42 to 2. 58 U.S. dollars per
kilogram last week.
</P>
<P>
"There was less demand as the sale progressed, with many
withdrawals by the close," ATB said, adding that Pakistani buyers
were absent from the auction while Egyptians and British people
showed less interest.
</P>
<P>
Short rains and higher temperatures have helped boost growth in
most key tea-growing areas in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
However, buyers are reluctant to purchase because of the tea
quality declined, ATB said.

<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's critical
socio-economic challenges for the new millennium are the HIV/AIDS
pandemic and poverty, according to a report from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. assessment is contained in an outline entitled
"Zimbabwe and the United Nations", the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which has been instrumental in sourcing
external, financial and material help for Zimbabwe's campaign
against AIDS, said in the statement that the country has the
second highest HIV/AIDS rate in Africa, next to Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"Infant mortality rate has gone up and average life expectancy
is estimated to go down to 45 years by the next millennium while
over 600, 000 children will be orphaned by next year," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the impact of the pandemic will increase the national
medical cost from about 1.6 million U.S. dollars a month in 1991
to 8.1 million U.S. dollars a month in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Poverty Assessment Study Survey shows that 62 percent
of the estimated 12.5 million Zimbabweans can not meet the needs
of basic food, clothing, education, health and shelter.

LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
 Albright Monday in Freetown called on all sides in Sierra Leone
to cooperate in demobilization of the country's combatants to
secure a lasting peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the call when meeting with Sierra Leone's
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, and later with Foday Sankoh and
Koroma, two leaders of S. Leone's rebels, who had fought eight
years of civil war till the signing of a peace accord in Togo's
capital Lome this July, according to reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is on the second leg of her six-African nation
tour, said: "We and the international community will be watching
to see that the rebels make good on their promises to end the
fighting and disarm."
</P>
<P>
She also announced in Freetown a 55 million U.S. dollar aid
package in support of the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the political leaders, Albright visited a
local war victim camp where many mutilated civilians are being
treated.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Current Situation in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Notable progress in the
peace process in Tajikistan was made in second quarter of 1999
when a number of outstanding problems were finally resolved, a
U.N. report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report submitted to the United Nations General Assembly by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said those breakthroughs
followed a tense three-month period, from April to June 1999, when
relations between the Government of Tajikistan and United Tajik
Opposition stalemated over failure to reach agreement on
constitutional reform, amnesty for former combatants and
power-sharing issues, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite an overall lessening of tensions, the security
situation in the country remains volatile and armed clashes
continued to occur, said the report.
YCC062HAB230I1018QU02:4302:440845
</P>
<P>
The Government of Tajikistan has continued its successful
implementation of structural economic reforms, resulting in a
5.3 percent growth rate in 1998 and a projected rate for 1999 of
5.6 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite most economic indicators showing positive improvement,
foreign investment remains low, impeding further growth, and of
particular concern to the humanitarian community is the fact that
economic reform is so far doing little to improve living
conditions, noted the report.

DPB248NBB167I18TSQL02:4402:451207

<P>
According to the World Bank, 85 percent of all Tajiks
continue to live below the poverty line, including 5 percent who
are completely destitute and 12 percent who fall into the
category of the extremely poor, the report said.

<P>
The dramatic decline in the level of remittances following
the August 1998 crisis of the Russian economy has created
further hardship and destitution, and the loss of remittances
combined with deteriorating terms of trade for Tajikistan's
principal exports, cotton and aluminium, increases the
Government's need for external financing, added the report.

"This is a small step in the right direction and the Islamic
Republic of Iran supports it. However, we are disappointed that
the Security Council did not adopt a more comprehensive approach
to the chronic conflict in Afghanistan and fear that the Taliban
would receive the wrong signal, interpreting the primary focus
of the resolution as the only concern of the international
community in Afghanistan," Iran said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in the view that the Security Council should
have brought its full weight and influence to bear in Afghanistan
and thus send the right message to all players in Afghanistan,
including the Taliban leadership, who, evidently because of the
political and military support it receive from outside, has so
far disregarded the international call for engaging in the peace
negotiations," said Iran.

<P>
"Effective pressure on the Taliban must be exercised with a
view to inducing it to stop its military policy and recognize
that there can be no military solution to the conflict in
Afghanistan," Iran said.

The Security Council last Friday imposed sanctions on the
Taliban until they surrender Saudi-born Osama bin Laden for
trial on charges he plotted the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies

<HEADLINE> U.N. Experts Arrive in Angola for Reinforcing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations expert group
leader arrived in Angola Monday to discuss with its government on
the possibility of reinforcing the superintendent mechanism on the
implementation of the U. N. sanctions against the Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The application of the sanctions against the rebel savimbist
group will be more efficient," announced Andree Amolander, head of
a subsidiary expert group of the United Nations Committee of
Sanctions for Angola.
</P>
<P>
Amolander said that his group "has the orientation of the
committee of sanctions" for supervising the implementation of the
sanctions against Angola's rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) imposed by the U.N. since 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a series of its resolutions, the U.N. Security Council
prohibits the purchase of Angolan diamonds without legal
certificates issued by the government, orders to freeze the bank
accounts under names of UNITA leaders in other countries and
restricts the transfrontier journey of UNITA members.

S02252PAB172I18TEQL01:1701:180491
</P>
<P>
It was frequently reported that the diamond trade constitutes
UNITA's main source of revenue, which supported the rampant
battles around the southwest country between UNITA and the
government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has recently reinforced its sanctions against UNITA.
South Africa's diamond company De Beers has ordered its overseas
branches not to buy Angolan diamonds without legal certificates.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Angola, Amolander will meet with the
Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Facing Serious Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian capital city of
Tehran is facing serious air pollution as winter is approaching,
according to a report from a company monitoring air condition in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Bases measuring air pollutants Sunday night registered air
pollution in Tehran as three times higher than the standard
level, the Company for Control of Air Condition in Tehran
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company said that due to the reduced speed of wind blow and
increased number of travels in the capital, air pollution has
intensified as compared to previous days, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The company strongly called on citizens suffering from cardiac
and respiratory diseases as well as the aged to refrain from
making unnecessary travels in the city.
</P>
<P>
It also urged private car owners to park their vehicles and
travel by public transportation facilities in order to reduce air
pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
Over 2 million cars with an average life span of 20 years
travel in the capital city every day, which are mainly
responsible for the air pollution in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that 71.2 percent of the air pollution in Tehran
is created by motor vehicles, most of which are old and not
equipped with smog-control devices.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere's Remains Flown Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 737-300 plane
carrying the remains of Tanzania's founding president Julius
Nyerere arrived at the Dar es Salaam International Airport at 9:05
a. m. local time (0605GMT) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people gathered at the airport to pay
their respect to the beloved leader, who died of leukemia in
London last Thursday at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, dressed in black and
appearing in a solemn mood, was also at the airport.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by his wife Anna Mkapa on the left side and
the late leader's widow Maria Nyerere on the right side. Maria
Nyerere, who married Nyerere in 1953, waved slightly to people on
the roadside.
</P>
<P>
The national anthem was played and a 21-gun salute was fired
when the coffin of Nyerere, covered with a national flag, was laid
on a special platform in red.
</P>
<P>
The casket, which was carried by eight guards, was then placed
onto a gun carriage. Hanging in the front part of the vehicle was
a big portrait of Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
The hearse, followed by a military car in which Mkapa was
sitting, moved slowly out of the airport and headed for Nyerere's
residence in Msasani area on the northern outskirts of Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The fleet pulled more than 10 kilometers through the town and
was greeted by millions of people.
</P>
<P>
Many of them were holding high Nyerere's portrait and shouted
dishearteningly "Baba wa Taifa" or father of the nation in
Kiswahili, while a lot of others were wearing a piece of cloth
printed with a black and white picture of the founding president.
</P>
<P>
Women wept openly. Some of them were so sad that they fell in a
faint.
</P>
<P>
"We are very sad indeed," a 45-year-old Tanzanian woman Anna
Komba said.
</P>
<P>
"We are sorrowful. He was the father to everybody. And it's
hard to believe he is dead," said Steven Njau, a 48-year-old man
with Air Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The hearse, after two and half an hours' drive, arrived at
Nyerere's residence at Msasani on the coast of the Indian Ocean
under the escort of Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
The coffin was half opened, allowing people to have a last view
of the old man's body. He was wearing a gray suit, his hair and
moustache white, his eyes closed, and his hands putting on his
abdomen.
</P>
<P>
A funeral mass was scheduled at St. Joseph's cathedral Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the body will be taken to the National Stadium,
where it will lie in state until Thursday when foreign dignitaries
are expected to pay last respects to the late leader.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere will be buried Saturday in his home village, Butiama,
some 50 minutes' drive from Lake Victoria town.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1922, Nyerere led the drive for the independence of
Tanganyika from the colonial rule of Britain in 1961 and
masterminded its union with Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He retired as Tanzanian president in 1985 after 24 years of
rule.

<HEADLINE> hke101879 -Indian, U.S. Officials Lay Ground for Clinton's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States
held official-level talks here on Monday to lay the groundwork for
the planned visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to the South
Asian country early next year.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Reidel, senior director for North-East and South Asia,
accompanied by Mat Daley, deputy assistant secretary in the State
Department, called on External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and
held separate meetings with Prime Minister's Principal Secretary
Brajesh Mishra, Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath and senior
officials in the Foreign Office here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reidel, who arrived in New Delhi earlier Monday, told the press
that he had "very good discussions" with Indian leaders and
officials.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said that the
developments in Pakistan figured prominently during the parleys
with both sides giving their perceptions of the evolving situation
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to stay in touch on the subject, added the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting with Mishra, the two sides discussed
respective positions on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
in the context of its rejection by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
Mishra said that there was no change in New Delhi's stand as
outlined by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in his address at
the United Nations General Assembly last year and later in the
Indian parliament in December.
</P>
<P>
India has maintained that it would not stand in the way of
entry into force of the CTBT but hoped that other countries would
also act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The American officials will head for Bangladesh later Monday as
part of preparations for Clinton's South Asia visit.
</P>
<P>
Washington is yet to confirm whether Clinton will go ahead with
his visit to Pakistan if it remains under military control.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is scheduled to pay a
two-day visit to New Delhi from October 26, during which he will
hold talks with his Indian counterpart and others.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was also likely to
YCC043HAB207I1018QU23:5900:021658
S22043HAB207I1018QU23:5900:021658
visit the country later to finalize details for Clinton's visit
which will take place in the backdrop of Washington urging both
India and Pakistan to resume the stalled dialogue process aimed at
reducing tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also urged New Delhi and Islamabad to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Non-proliferation
Treaty (NPT).

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: World Urges Greater Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The international
community has been long haunted by the failure of the Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) to enter into force seven years
after its signing.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States signed the START II on January 3,
1993, which provides for the elimination or the reduction of
strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 3,000 and 3,500 each by
the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ratification of the START II was delayed
indefinitely by the U.S. move to develop and deploy the Theater
Missile Defense System(TMD) and National Defense Mission System
(NMD).
S02230WNE042S18PEQL00:0100:041517
</P>
<P>
The root causes behind the most expensive and advanced missile
defense systems in the making lie in the cold war mentality,
coupled with new developments of hegemonism and power politics, which
are making the world less stable.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, the U.S.-led NATO, the only military bloc left over
from the cold war, bypassed the U.N. Security Council, which has
the primary responsibility for the maintenance of the
international security and the world peace, and bombed the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, a sovereign member of the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
With the world's most powerful and sophisticated military
machinery, NATO has turned Yugoslavia, the weak country which
experienced so much misery in this century, into a test ground for
the military alliance's "new strategic concept."
</P>
<P>
In Asia, certain individual countries are pressing rapidly
ahead in their joint TMD development program in a bid to further
TMD development program in a bid to further strengthen their
military alliance in the region, which, should, otherwise, have
died out with the end of cold war.
</P>
<P>
In North America, the vigorous and accelerated pursuit of the
missile defense program to the detriment of strategic stability
has confronted the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with grave
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, these negative developments have worsened the
international security cooperation and constituted an obstacle to
the sound development of international arms control and
disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, said, "The international arms control and
disarmament is now at a cross-road. What course to take? It
represents a pressing issue of common concern to the international
community."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the relaxation of the international situation and the
arms control process are mutually reinforcing and supportive with
each other. The old security concept based on military alliances
and arms build-up will not help resolve any problem.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the only way to promote international disarmament
process, to prevent arms race and safeguard international security
is the quick establishment of a new security concept in line with
the changed international situation. The core of such a new
security concept should be mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality
and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Veto Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is scheduled to veto a foreign aid bill approved by the
Republican-controlled Congress on Monday, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
The 12.6 billion U.S. dollars foreign aid bill was strongly
opposed by the Democrats and the administration.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that Clinton was
meeting with Cabinet officials this morning to talk budget
strategy, and also plans to invite congressional leaders to White
House for a meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart also indicated that the foreign aid bill "doesn't meet
the president's priorities."
</P>
<P>
"Wye River is certainly an important element to that, and it is
an important part of continuing to exercise U.S. leadership around
the world," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress failed to approve the request of the Clinton
administration for 500 million U.S. dollars as part of the foreign
aid bill to help implement the Wye River agreement signed between
Israel and Palestine last year.
</P>
<P>
"We can't expect nations in troubled parts of the world, like
the Middle East, to move forward with their peace process when we
won't meet the commitments we've made," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart added that the president is also considering to veto
the defense spending bill, which the administration believes is
beyond its request.

<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Monday called on Egypt
to play a role in bringing Syria back to the negotiating table
with it.
</P>
<P>
"Israel hopes that Syria will return to the peace talks with
it," said visiting Israeli Minister of Communications Binyamin Ben
Eliezer, after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt "has a vital role to play" in this respect and "is
capable of making it," Eliezer said, quoted by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syria and Israel were suspended in
early 1996 due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights
Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
After Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office in July,
leaders of both countries said they were interested in resuming
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syria says that late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had
promised to pull back troops from the whole of the Golan Heights
and that the talks be re-started on that basis. Israel disagrees.
</P>
<P>
Eliezer said he examined with Moussa the developments of the
Middle East peace process. Israel expects that Egypt will
contribute to promoting the peace march and the resumption of
multilateral talks on regional issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated calls by Israel and the United States for the
resumption of the multilateral talks, Moussa has reiterated
Egypt's opposition to the move before the re-start of the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral talks, kicked off in 1992, were designed to
tackle issues including disarmament, Palestinian refugees, water,
the environment and economic cooperation. They came to a halt in
1996 due to the hard-line policy of former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Eliezer, who arrived here earlier in the day, said his visit is
aimed at seeking ways of promoting bilateral cooperation in
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
He said he carried a list of projects in this respect and will
discuss with his Egyptian counterpart Ahmed Nazef.
</P>
<P>
However, Eliezer is unlikely to get positive response from
Egypt as the Arab world snubs Israel's call for economic
cooperation. Arab countries underline that there will be no
economic cooperation with Israel until a comprehensive and durable
peace is established in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, plays an active role in mediating the Arab-Israeli peace
talks. But it maintains lukewarm relations with Israel due to the
slow pace of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Defense Minister Not to Run for President, Vice President Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister and
Commander of the Indonesian Military (TNI) General Wiranto Monday
night said he will not run for the president and vice president
race.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current situation, I choose not to enter into
rivalry for presidency or vice presidency. However, I will take a
political position that what the people really need," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the country's national television station
TVRI, Wiranto said present political and security condition tended
to move into a dangerous instability and therefore "it is
impossible for me to do other things but concentrate on the task
of assuring the security of our nation and state."
</P>
<P>
Wiranto made the statement after meeting with military
leadership at the TNI Headquarters in East Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was chosen by incumbent President B.J. Habibie, the
presidential nomination of the Golkar Party, as the party's vice
presidential candidate for the 1999-2004 period on October 13.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Wiranto said that nobody, including the
Golkar Party that had openly mentioned his name for it, had
contacted him.
</P>
<P>
He said that rivalry among political groupings had turned
sharper marked by fiercer rhetoric of hostility which were
increasingly difficult to compromise.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is aggravated by anarchic mass mobilization that
has systematically reduced the essence of general election as a
process for strengthening representation system of democracy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of national unity, he said, TNI needs to remind
PAB149PAB174i1018QL00:3000:311640
all political, socio-cultural and religious leaders that they
should take optimal joint initiatives to prevent further violence
by a group of people that had tarnished national reputation.
</P>
<P>
"They have damaged students' moral fight for democracy and
positioned TNI as if it is against the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said a serious threat faced by the nation now was
disintegration which was marked by mass mobilization by various
parties.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)
supporters staged simultaneous protests in major cities on Java
island on Sunday and Monday, encouraging Megawati Soekarnoputri,
general chairman of the PDI-P, to continue her struggle for
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Since last week, Megawati supporters have staged daily rallies
to try to pressure the 700-member MPR, and thousands more are
flooding into the capital to join mass protests if she loses.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to maintain protests for Megawati until the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
legislative body, elects her as the next president on October 20.
</P>
<P>
Many fear unrest will erupt across the already crisis-hit
country if Habibie is elected for another term in office.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that the withdrawal of Wiranto from the
vice presidential candidate will beat the bid of Habibie to be
re-elected in the forthcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election would be held on October 20, while
the vice presidential election on October 21.
</P>
<P>
The three potential presidential candidates are Habibie,
Megawati and Abdurrahman Wahid, founder of the National Awakening
Party.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Humanitarian Development in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The first half of 1999
has seen the humanitarian condition in Afghanistan worsen, owing
to the enduring instability, conflict and natural disasters, a
U.N. report said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report submitted to the United Nations General Assembly by
the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said with no immediate
prospect of a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the country,
further fighting and population displacements were foreseen in the
latter half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The conflict continues to affect all aspects of civilian life
in many parts of the country and families lack access to adequate
services or the means to provide for themselves, and the
combatants still deny most humanitarian agencies effective access
to many areas, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The absence of United Nations international staff from
Afghanistan from August 1998 until March 1999, owing to security
concerns, limited the capacity of the aid community to provide
assistance to the people of Afghanistan and to engage in continued
dialogue with Afghan authorities on policy issues, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Four Globalstar Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia successfully launched
four Globalstar satellites into space with a Soyuz-U
carrier-rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 5:32
p.m. Moscow time (1332 GMT) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes into the flight, the booster Ikar carrying the
satellites separated from the rocket and entered the intermediate
ellipic orbit at 1441 GMT. Its apogee is 920 kilometers, perigee
240 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The satellites will be put into low circular orbit of about
1,350 kilometers from Earth with an inclination of 52 degrees,
Interfax news agency quoted the press service of the Russian
Strategic Rocket Forces as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was the second of three Globalstar autumn launches by a
Soyuz carrier rocket. The first launch was made in September.
Earlier, three Soyuz carrier rockets with the same satellites were
launched in February, March and April.
</P>
<P>
The next similar launch was scheduled for November this year.
Further more, Russia has planned to send up more Soyuz
carrier-rockets in 2001 to replenish the stock of Globalstar
communication satellites, the Interfax report said.
</P>
<P>
The international consortium Globalstar uses not only Russian
carrier rockets, but also American Delta-2 carriers. The
Globalstar has so far been shying away from using Ukrainian Zenit
carrier rockets following a crash in September 1998 in which it
lost 12 satellites.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Deploy Peace-keeping Forces in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Political Committee for the
implementation of a ceasefire agreement in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) has expressed concern about the slow pace at
which the United Nations is handling the request for the
deployment of peace- keeping forces in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in a statement released here on monday
following a meeting chaired by Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister
Stan Mudenge in Lusaka last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement states that the committee wants the U.N. to
address the situation in the DRC with the urgency and seriousness
it deserves.
</P>
<P>
It noted that similar situations in other regions receive more
prompt and appropriate response from the U.N., the statement
reads.
</P>
<P>
The committee also called upon the Congolese parties with the
assistance of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU) to expedite
consultations on the issue of appointing a neutral facilitator for
the inter-Congolese political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee has commended the parties in the DRC
for continuing to respect the ceasefire agreement signed in Lusaka
in August in spite of the delays in deploying peace monitors and
observers.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee also paid tribute to Zambia, South
Africa, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe for coming forward with
contributions to the Joint Military Commission (JMC).
</P>
<P>
They appealed to other countries and organizations to similarly
support the peace process in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Representatives at Friday's meeting were drawn from Zambia,
Namibia, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, the Congolese Rally for Democracy and
the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Closer to Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops moved
closer to Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic of Chechnya,
on Monday as warplanes continued bombing rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
The federal troops have taken control of all strategic heights
and all roads to Grozny, the Itar-Tass news agency reported in a
dispatch from North Ossetia, another republic bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said its planes conducted 20 combat missions and
five reconnaissance flights over Chechnya in the past two days.
Coupled with artillery fire, federal forces have destroyed Chechen
militants' bases and strongholds near Bamut, Gazuni, Shali,
Chechen-Aul, Sovetskoye and Chadyri, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 guerrillas, two ammunition depots, a radio
transmitter and the road along the Argun Valley were also
destroyed, the agency said, quoting the Defense Ministry press
service.
</P>
<P>
The federal troops, in their efforts to wipe out Islamic rebels
in Chechnya, have secured control of one-third of the North
Caucasus republic in the first stage of the operation to establish
a "security zone".
</P>
<P>
Tass said some reconnaissance units have moved to as close as
5-6 kilometers to Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The federal assault on Chechnya came after armed incursions
into neighboring Daghestani republic led by Basayev and the
Jordanian-born Khattab. The two are also accused of masterminding
a series of explosions that rocked four apartment buildings that
killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.

KUWAIT CITY, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday
expressed deep concern over the situation in Pakistan following
last week's military coup that toppled the government of former
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Sanctions should be
confined to the targeted state and efforts made to ensure there
were no negative effects on third states, Syria said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly's Sixth
Committee (Legal) as it began debate on the activities marking the
end of the United Nations Decade of International Law, Syria's
delegate Ghassan Obeid said sanctions should be imposed with
caution and without favoritism or biases.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions should be imposed after in-depth study and a
determination that international peace and security was
threatened, the delegate said.
</P>
<P>
Previous sanctions had led to negative consequences on third
states with serious humanitarian dimensions and sanctions must be
imposed for a specified period and must be lifted as soon as the
targeted state had fulfilled its obligation, the delegate said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly declared 1990-1999 the
Decade of International Law with the intention of promoting
acceptance of and respect for the principles of international law,
promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes, encouraging the

<HEADLINE> Commuters Narrowly Escapes in Train Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 passengers on
board a peak-hour commuter train escaped unharmed when it crashed
into another stationary and empty train in East Sussex Monday.
</P>
<P>
A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said it was possible
one of the trains passed through a red signal. Two carriages were
derailed but both remained upright, and the passengers were forced
to walk one hundred meters to Lewes Station.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "The commuter train hit the other empty
depot train, but it is too early to say why. Early indications are
it is possible it could have gone through a red light."
</P>
<P>
"There might be one or two minor injuries. People are suffering
from shock," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened when a Connex Victoria to Hastings 5.53 pm
hit an empty Seaford to Brighton train. The BTP spokesman said
they were already investigating whether the driver drove through a
red signal.
</P>
<P>
Connex spokesman Peter Kendall said an investigation into the
crash had already got under way and its findings would be
presented to the Railways Inspectorate.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the passenger train had passed a red light, he
said, "I do not think that is something anyone could say at this
stage."
</P>
<P>
The signal involved was not one of the infamous 22 highlighted
by the Paddington rail disaster happened on October 5, in which
more than 30 people were killed.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Respect for Right to Punish Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China Monday called for
respect for the choice by every country of taking necessary
measures to punish crimes for the protection of lives and
maintenance of social stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese delegate Diao Mingsheng made the point at a United
Nations session on crime prevention and criminal justice, which is
an item of the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Diao said China respects the choice of some countries to
abolish the death penalty, and at the same time hopes that these
countries will respect the choice of China and other countries to
take severe punitive measures to combat crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Due to differences in social systems, economic development
levels and historical and cultural backgrounds, it is only natural
for countries to be various on the issue of the death penalty,"
said Diao.
</P>
<P>
The question should not be an obstacle to international
cooperation in the fight against crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Diao hoped that the U.N. will put more resources into crime
fighting and help developing countries with more technical knowhow
for the reduction of the threat of transnational organized crimes.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Botswana
Democratic Party (BDP) is sure of victory in the country's general
elections after taking 30 of the 40 contested seats, with five
seats still undeclared, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the ruling party's 13 former cabinet members have
been re- elected to parliament. The constituencies of two others
have not been declared yet.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana National Front (BNF), which is led by veteran
politician Kenneth Koma, won five seats and retained its hold on
two of the major cities. All other opposition parties had no
showing.
</P>
<P>
The lesson for the opposition parties was that without unity,
they had little chance against the BDP, which has ruled the
country since independence in 1966, Koma said.
</P>
<P>
The combined opposition vote was at 36.3 percent against the
BDP's 63.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the poll finished at 54 percent for the BDP and 37
percent for the BNF.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has a population of 1.5 million and only 467,000 of
the 800,000 eligible voters registered for the elections.

<P>
As of the end of the first half of 1999, the two markets'
occupancy costs were respetively 126.85 and 105.90 U.S. dollars
per square foot, according to a Cushman &AMP; Wakefield Inc. survey of
global occupancy costs, which consist of base rent, property taxes
and operating expenses. Both have been aided by a growing British
economy, low interest rates, availability of skilled labor, high
quality transportation and increased business confidence, the
firm's report said.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo, which had the highest occupancy costs in the world for
many years until last year, ranked third, with 95.63 dollars.
Ranging between sixties and mid-forties, the rest of the cities on
top 15 are Mumbai, Hong Kong, New Delhi, Buenos Aires, Paris,
Moscow, Frankfurt, Warsaw, Boston, New York-Midtown Manhattan, San
Francisco and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the United States, with only three
cities on top 15, is "a real value versus its international
competitors." What keeps the U.S. less expensive despite a long
period of economic growth and low inflation, the report said, is
less restrictive zoning and the availability of buildable sites.
</P>
<P>
Asian markets, which traditionally had the highest occupancy
costs, have stagnated under the weight of the continent-wide
recession, the report said. Rents in most Asian markets have
dropped 50 percent over the last two years. Although economists
are predicting GDP growth this year for all Asian countries, the
report said, real estate markets will be slow to recover.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Moscow experienced a notable decline in
occupancy rates during the past year, and its position as a world
business capital has been diminished by the economic and political
upheaval in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield is the only real estate services firm that
performs primary research and data driven analysis on a national
and international basis.

<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The London market fought off
another wipeout Monday on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the
Black Monday market crash.
</P>
<P>
After sliding 109 points at one stage, the FTSE 100 Index
clawed back some lost ground to close down a modest 38.1 points at
5,869.2.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed that the FTSE had been undermined from
the outset by the Dow's 2.6 percent fall Friday, which took the
U.S. benchmark's decline over the week to nearly 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Volumes were low and total turnover in London reached a paltry
699 million shares, the second lowest so far this year, showing
there was no sign of panic.
</P>
<P>
"We are not out of the woods and it's right to be worried about
Wall Street," said Credit Suisse First Boston UK equity strategist
Paul O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
"But the good news is that once we get the likely U.S. rate
rise in November, bond prices will be steady and that will help
equities regain some composure in the final part of the year," he
added.

Frankfurt's Xetra Dax was off 0.72 percent at 5,146.70 on the

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. federal appeals
court judges Monday appointed career prosecutor Robert Ray as
independent counsel to replace Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
Ray, shortly after taking the oath as independent counsel,
appeared on the federal courthouse and vowed to finish the
five-year, 40 million dollar investigation of President Bill
Clinton and the first lady in a "prompt, responsible and
cost-effective manner."
</P>
<P>
The new special prosecutor thanked Starr for his personal
sacrifice and said his office would carry on the investigation
with the same professionalism.
</P>
<P>
Starr, whose investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal
prompted the impeachment of President Clinton but lost much public
support, is returning to private law practice.
</P>
<P>
Ray must decide whether to bring additional prosecutions and
must write a final report on the wide-ranging investigation that
has delved into fraudulent land deals in Arkansas and alleged
presidential perjury and obstruction in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The contents of a final report, which will deal in part with
the Arkansas land deal, could cause political problems for Mrs.
Clinton if she decides to run for the U.S. senate from New York.

NAIROBI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government is
prepared to receive 1,500 Eritrean nationals repatriated by
Ethiopia, the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in a press release
reached here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry made the remarks in response to a claim by
Ethiopia last Saturday that the arrangement for repatriation of
the Eritreans could be materialized due to "the Eritrean
government's refusal to accept its citizens."
</P>
<P>
"As in the past the Eritrean government welcomes the deportees.
Indeed it has already received more than 63,000 ethnic Eritreans
deported so far, a figure that represents more than 50 percent of
the Eritreans that were residing in Ethiopia," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Eritrean government has duly informed the ICRC
(International Committee of the Red Cross) that the deportees must
be given passage through safe and secure routes, especially at
this time of increased Ethiopian military activity.

<HEADLINE> Irish Nurses to Stage First-Ever Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's 28,000 nurses are
scheduled to stage their first-ever national strike Tuesday
morning, a Reuters report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the nurses' representatives as saying that
national strike action was inevitable after three hours of talks
with Health Minister Brian Cowen failed to find a framework for
negotiating a new wages and working conditions agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The government were not oblivious to our difficulties but it
wasn't possible to find a formula to begin discussing and agreeing
a satisfactory resolution," the report quoted Liam Doran, chairman
of the four-union Nursing Alliance, as saying to a television
program.
</P>
<P>
But Doran said both sides had agreed to adjourn the talks to
consult their respective partners. He said unions were committed
to finding a way towards further discussions.
</P>
<P>
The strike action across Ireland is expected to start at 0700
GMT. Hospitals have been gearing up all week to cope with the
disruption.
</P>
<P>
Nurses will continue to maintain emergency cover for casualty
departments and critical operations but other services, chiefly
management, will be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Doran said he did not believe there was a way of averting the
strike action before Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Irish nurses have campaigned for better pay and conditions
since 1996, arguing there are fundamental problems with pay scales
that are crucial to the future of the profession.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month nurses' unions voted overwhelmingly to
strike after rejecting a Labor Court offer which would have raised
salaries by between 8 and 37 percent depending on rank and
experience.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
has narrowed the gap with George W. Bush in a head-to-head matchup
of presidential front-runners, a poll shows.
</P>
<P>
Gore trailed Bush, the governor of Texas, 44 percent to 51
percent in a poll of registered voters by the Pew Research Center
for the People &AMP; the Press. Gore was 11 points to 15 points behind
Bush in several recent Pew polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice president still must convince people he has
the leadership skills and personal qualities for the job,
according to the poll published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows that Gore benefits from increased support from
women. Fifty percent of women would vote for Gore today compared
to 40 percent in September, while 45 percent of women in this poll
said they back Bush. Support for Gore remains unchanged among men
at 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bush was in firm command among Republican candidates with 63
percent of the support of people expected to vote in primaries of
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
Gore led former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley 60 percent to
31 percent among those likely to vote in Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
While the results of the poll of 1,032 adults, which was taken
on October 7-11, were mixed for Gore, it was the first good poll
news for him since his decision in late September to shake up his
campaign staff and move his campaign headquarters to Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Congress-Approved Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
vetoed a foreign aid bill approved by the Republican-controlled
Congress Monday, saying the bill is not adequate for the U.S. to
retain its leading role in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 12.6 billion U.S. dollar foreign aid bill was strongly
opposed by the Democrats and the administration, who believe that
it will shortchange the foreign policy interests of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Clinton said the bill provides
inadequate support for the foreign affairs. He called on
Republican congressional leaders to join the administration in
seeking a solution to the budget impasse.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he would sign another emergency spending
measure to keep the government running beyond Thursday, but that
it should be a short-term measure.
</P>
<P>
"We have to put politics aside and seek common ground," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clinton lashed out at the Republicans as "reckless
partisanship" after the Senate rejected a global nuclear test ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Associated Press, Clinton's national
security advisor Sandy Berger said Monday that the two stunning
setbacks by Congress will not deter Clinton from asserting U.S.
"leadership" in the world with ambitious foreign policy goals in
the last year of his term.
</P>
<P>
Berger denounced Congress as miserly for cutting nearly 2
billion U.S. dollars from the foreign aid bill and for killing the
global test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
The struggle between Clinton and Congress "is about whether
America meets its obligations to the world, whether we see our
stake in the world or turn our backs on the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's about whether the United States is going to follow the
vision of the last 50 years in taking the lead in shaping the
world or whether we follow a vision in which we are going to build
a wall," Berger said.

Monday with the Dow Jones industrial average rising in a volatile

</P>
<P>
The Dow closed up 96.57 at 10,116.28. The blue chip index fell
630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, last week in its worst performance
in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 6.72 at 1,254.13 but the technology heavy Nasdaq index
fell 42.68 at 2,689.15.
</P>
<P>
Most of the factors that drove the Dow lower last week have not
been resolved but the index was pushed higher by the news of
strong corporate profit growth. J.P. Morgan, the Dow component,
rose steeply after it announced its nearly tripled earnings in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was up as mush as 108 points and down as 43 points from
last Friday's close as investors was still awaiting the latest
indications of whether inflation is increasing and the Federal
Reserve will get reasons to raise interest rates for the third
time this year to battle the inflation, but the index ended in the
positive territory.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.45 at 579.62. But the American Stock

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on

<HEADLINE> Debt-to-Equity Swaps: A "Win-Win" Choice for Banks, Firms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- With the China Huarong Asset
Management Company (AMC) opening for business today, China's
ambitious "debt-to-equity" program is now in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Huarong, along with Cinda, Orient and Great Wall, three other
AMCs set up earlier, is entitled to receive and deal with the bad
debts of the four state-owned commercial banks: the Construction
Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China,
and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
After taking over these banks' non-performing loans, the AMCs
will convert part of them into shares in the loan-taking state-
owned enterprises (SOEs), earn dividends, and take part in
decision-making at the firms.
</P>
<P>
Considering that most of the bad debts of the four state-owned
commercial banks are loans to SOEs, mostly large and medium-sized
ones, economists note that this practice will lead to a "win-win"
situation for banks and SOEs, as it both helps banks avoid
financial risks and helps SOEs solve the problem of a heavy debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the state sector of the national economy
determines the significance of SOE reform. Among the urban
employed population, 60 percent are in SOEs, and 55 percent of
state financial revenues comes from SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Hailed as one of the "trump cards" of SOE reform, economists
expects the successful operation by the AMCs and the State
Development Bank to help the country fulfill its three-year target
of bringing the SOEs out difficulty, which was announced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
These AMCs have a registered capital of 10 billion yuan each
from the Ministry of Finance and enjoy tax immunity and other
preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges International Efforts Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia called for international
support for its efforts against the terrorists active in its
breakaway republic of Chechnya and the North Caucasus region as a
whole at a ministerial meeting opened Tuesday here on combating
transnational organized crime.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting, which is expected to adopt a joint
statement on combating terrorism, Russia's acting Prosecutor
General Vladimir Ustinov pointed out that many international
criminals are now active in Chechnya under the cover of various
ideologies including Islam, and urged help to strip them of
financial support in order to halt their activities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the terrorists in Chechnya have received about 30
million U.S. dollars from foreign sponsors to buy arms and drugs.
Specifically, he said the Chechen militants are aided by groups in
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Algeria, Tajikistan and the Baltic
countries, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the international communities to plan joint
anti-terrorist efforts to curb international crime, Ustinov
stressed at the meeting attended by law enforcement officials from
Russia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the
United State as well as representatives from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Russia has launched an offensive against Islamic militants in
Chechnya following two waves of armed incursions into Daghestan
led by Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab. Basayev and
Khattab, a Jordanian national known only by his last name, have
been accused of masterminding several terrorist attacks in Moscow
and other Russian cities that killed about 300 people.
</P>
<P>
Besides terrorism, money laundering was also a major topic at
the ministerial meeting. There have been widespread media reports
in the West of alleged money laundering by Russian mobsters and
even government officials.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has dismissed the reports as attempts to defame Russia
and stop Western investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, addressing the meeting,
said Russia "is interested more than others to see that dirty
money is not laundered in banks and financial institutions of
other countries."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to cover our part of the road in this struggle,
but we are against over-politicizing the subject or speculations,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia would improve its legislation on the prevention
of money laundering and sign the convention of the Council of
Europe on combating corruption.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 0.4 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department
reported Tuesday that inflation at the consumer level rose 0.4
percent in September, the biggest increase in five months, owing
to the higher prices for gasoline, cigarettes and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Last month's sharp increase in the Consumer Price Index, the
government's most closely watched inflation gauge, followed a 0.3
percent rise in August, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 2.8 percent, sharply higher than the tiny 1.6 percent
increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The faster pace of inflation will mean a bigger cost of living
increase for the 44.2 million Americans getting Social Security
checks, who will see their benefits rise by 2.4 percent starting
in January, nearly doubling the 1.3 percent increase they received
this year.
</P>
<P>
Growing worries about inflation have set off alarm bells on
Wall Street with investors concerned that the Federal Reserve will
be forced to raise interest rates again at their next meeting on
Nov. 16
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan contributed to the
investor unease last week by warning that banks and other lenders
need to make sure they are prepared for the possibility of a "
bursting bubble" of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
September's gain in prices at the retail level was the biggest
increase since a 0.7 percent spurt in April.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration in inflation this year has come from energy
costs, which through September have been increasing at an annual
rate of 16.1 percent, compared to a decline of 8.8 percent for all
of 1998, a year in which the Asian currency crisis cut sharply
into global demand for crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that energy prices jumped by 2.7 percent in
September, the third straight month of sharp increases. Gasoline
prices climbed 2.6 percent last month while home heating oil shot
up 6.2 percent, the biggest increase in three years.
</P>
<P>
But food costs rose a modest 0.2 percent for the third straight
month as a big drop in fruit prices helped offset sharp increases
in the cost of vegetables and beef.
</P>
<P>
Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up 0.
3 percent, leaving the so-called core rate of inflation rising at
a much more moderate 1.9 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The core CPI increase of 0.3 percent would have been an even
smaller 0.2 percent in September had it not been for a sharp spurt
in tobacco costs, which were up 6.5 percent. That was the largest
monthly rise since an 18.5 percent spurt in tobacco costs last
December.
</P>
<P>
Clothing costs, which had dropped for four straight months,
were also up in September, increasing by 1.2 percent, as retailers
raised prices for fall and winter clothing lines.

<HEADLINE> 90-Year-Old Scientist Receives Floral Baskets From State Leaders on Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Fei Xiaotong, a well-known
Chinese political activist and sociologist who turns 90 today,
received floral baskets from General Secretary Jiang Zemin of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a member of the CPC Central Committee Political
Bureau Standing Committee, presented the birthday gifts to Fei on
behalf of Jiang and the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, vice chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, also presented a floral basket to Fei on
behalf of the NPC Standing Committee and its chairman Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shisun, chairman of the China Democratic League (CDL),
presented a floral basket to the 90-year-old on behalf of the CDL
Central Committee. Fei is a former chairman and now honorary
chairman of the non-communist party.
</P>
<P>
The senior scientist is widely known as a great expert in rural
development as he has spent much of his life traveling across the
country to investigate and monitor the changes in the life of the
rural population. He has published a series of works on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
In 1935, Fei graduated from Qinghua University and went to
study in Britain. In 1938, he returned with a doctorate and began
to teach at Qinghua and Southwest Union University. He joined the
CDL in 1944.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Fei worked
as deputy director of the State Council Expert Bureau, vice
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, and vice chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Debt-to-Equity Swaps: A "Win-Win" Choice for Banks, Firms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The AMCs are authorized to engage in a variety of business
activities including debt-to-equity conversion, issuing bonds, and
short-term stock holding. They can also sell the debt or equities
of the target enterprises to overseas investors with the approval
of authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
On September 2, the Beijing Cement Plant transferred part of
its equity stake to the loaner, the Cinda Asset Management Company,
thus becoming the first to benefit from this new policy.
</P>
<P>
The plant, formerly a money-losing one, is now expected to turn
its loss into profit this year and earn 20 million yuan in net
profit next year after the debt-to-equity swap reduced its asset-
liability ratio from more than 80 percent to the current 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
While easing SOEs' debt burden, this practice provides an
opportunity for SOEs to restructure their assets and improve
performance, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
An high-ranking official from Cinda said that the AMC is now
helping some of these firms to establish a modern enterprise
system.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China's Liaoning Province, where state firms are
most densely distributed, 27 firms applied for this procedure.
</P>
<P>
"If this swap is successfully carried out, the province will
earn 3.7 billion yuan in profit the first year of debt-to-equity
conversion," predicted one provincial official.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the experiment, the State Economic and Trade
Commission has recommended the first group of some 100 firms to
the AMCs for assessment and is carrying out research on other
applicants.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest More in Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China announced here today that
more resources will be used for environmental protection and
pollution control and that environmental protection will be
integrated into China's overall social and economic development
plans.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration, said specific and feasible environmental
protection targets and measures will be made in a bid to reverse
the country's serious environmental situation.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, China invested 72.2 billion yuan (about 8.7
billion U.S. dollars) in environmental protection and pollution
control, Xie said. This represented an increase of 43 percent from
the previous year, he told an international meeting on China's
environment and development.
</P>
<P>
For this year, environmental protection accounts for a large
percentage of the nation's budget and the incremental national
debt, and Chinese businesses and financial institutions have
injected large sums of money into environmental protection, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) has been
used for projects to control air pollution and beautify the city
in the past two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 46 measures adopted by Beijing to fight air pollution
are those aimed at reducing motor vehicle emissions and the
compulsory introduction of clean fuel.
</P>
<P>
Headway has also been made in pollution control and
environmental protection in other places thanks to the measures
taken by localities and the central government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xie, vice-chairman of the China Council for International
Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED), told a CCICED
meeting today of the tough measures China has taken to fight
pollution and promote sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
These measures include phasing out backward production lines
and equipment, and closing down enterprises causing waste of
resources and serious pollution, in China's ongoing strategic
economic restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
The council, which comprises 25 high-level Chinese
environmental protection-related officials and economists and 29
overseas environmental protection experts or officials, was set up
in 1992 by the Chinese government as an advisory body for its
national environmental protection and sustainable development
decision-making.

</P>
<P>
The educational departments and institutions in the interior
areas will exert more efforts in cementing ties with their
counterparts in the future Macao Special Administrative Region,
according to Liu Jianfeng with China's Ministry of Education who

and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The interior areas and the Macao SAR will strengthen
cooperation in curriculum management, student recruitment and the
sending of outstanding teachers to Macao, said the official during
his on-going visit in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that in recent years the universities and colleges in
the interior areas have recruited a lot of students from Macao to
meet the need for talented people in Macao. Such work will be done
better after Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Institutions of higher learning in the interior areas have
achieved rapid development in recent years and started many new
specialties. Some of the specialties are of great significance to
Macao's future development, Liu Jianfeng said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Education and local educational
departments have worked out policies which make things more
convenient for Macao students to seek better schooling in the
interior areas, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> EU, IOC To Meet On World Anti-doping Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
International Olympic Committee (IOC) will hold discussions on
setting up a world anti-doping body, European Commission said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said it has decided to authorize Mrs. Viviane
Reding, the Commissioner for Education and Culture, to open
discussions with the IOC on this matter. However, the Commission
said it favors the idea of the creation of such an agency "but
feel that important questions to be settled regarding its status
and its rules of operation".
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the Commission would like the agency to be
managed jointly by public authorities and sports organizations,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has just written to EU Commission President Romano
Prodi to formally invite the EU executive to set up a world agency
to combat doping in sport. According to the Commission, the IOC's
desire is to have the agency set up by this November, in the form
of a Foundation governed by Swiss law, with the funding costs
being borne initially by the Swiss-headquartered IOC.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a world anti-doping agency constitutes an
initial response at world level to the proliferation of doping
scandals which have rocked the sporting world over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
The agency will need to establish common procedures and
criteria in order to eliminate the wide differences that exist
with regard to banned substances, testing methods and penalties,
which are at present defined by a multitude of different players,
such as the IOC, sports federations and public authorities, the
European Commission said.

The circular said that those who failed to arrive at negotiated
settlement by the due date would face swift and strong action for

<HEADLINE> HKTDC Signs Up Strategic Partnership with AIR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) announced today that it signed up with
Asian Information Resources Ltd. (AIR) as a strategic partner to
provide China-related information to the TDC Trade Portal.
</P>
<P>
The partnership signals a major development in the build-up of
the council's new Portal site, said Anna Lai, TDC's deputy
executive director at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for launch in early 2000, the TDC Trade Portal is the
council's new initiative to provide more value-added information
services to the business community, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
It helps enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong companies, in
particular, small and medium-sized enterprises in the
international business arena, Lai said, adding that more business
opportunities will be captured and e-commerce becomes their daily
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"The TDC Trade Portal will be the virtual business information
hub on Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland in the Internet," Lai
said. "It is also the entry point for international businesses
that want to do business with both economies."
</P>
<P>
By joining forces with AIR, the China-related content of the
Trade Portal will be stronger, Lai said, adding that it will
complement the trade and business intelligence currently available
at the TDC website.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, AIR will provide a highly focused
coverage on trade and commerce of the mainland to the TDC Trade
Portal. The content covers four major areas, including laws of
China promulgated by the National People's Congress, and national
laws and regulations of China that related to trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Also included are trade and commerce-related regional
regulations and rues of Guangdong Province, and daily news updates
focusing on trade and commerce of the mainland and Hong Kong
during business days. Up to 50 articles per day will be prepared.
</P>
<P>
According to Lai, information on changes in processing trade
laws and regulatory changes as a result of China's prospective
World Trade Organization membership, for instance, will be
conductive to operations of Hong Kong firms.

experienced five major floods since 1990, and suffered 900 billion
yuan (108 billion U.S. dollars ) in economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Floods along the nation's Yangtze, Nenjiang, Songhua and other
rivers last year claimed more than 3,600 lives and caused some 264
billion yuan of direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Zhang acknowledged that, along with the flooding problem, the
country is also being confronted by water shortages and pollution,
which in turn call for integrated measures.
</P>
<P>
Of China's 600-odd cities, some 400 are far from adequately
supplied with water, and more than 90 percent of the urban waters
has been polluted, according to Ministry of Water Resources
statistics.
</P>
<P>
"While carrying out anti-flood programs, the protection and
reasonable use of water resources should be given the same
priority," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Venezuela to Strengthen Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Venezuela
have agreed to revive their joint commission, dormant since 1990,
to further strengthen bilateral links and cooperation, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the meeting of the Malaysian and
Venezuelan delegations jointly chaired by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and visiting Venezuela President Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias,
he told reporters at a briefing on the meeting in Putrjaya near
here.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that relations must be on a more pragmatic
footing so that all programs can be implemented effectively, the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission had previously met only once in 1990 at
which both countries signed several agreements including one on
trade.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Mahathir's views at the meeting focused mostly
on the need to strengthen links among the nations of the South so
that their voice would be heard by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Chavez Frias met privately before the delegation
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuela president arrived here Monday night for a
three-day state visit to Malaysia, aimed at what the Malaysian
Foreign Ministry said enhancing bilateral relations and exchanging

<HEADLINE> Solution to N. Ireland Impasse "Within Grasp": UK Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Peter Mandelson, Britain's newly
appointed Northern Ireland secretary, said Tuesday that a
potential resolution to Northern Ireland's political impasse is
still "within grasp."
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during his first official visit to Dublin,
Ireland's capital, to meet with Irish Foreign Minister David
Andrews and update the Irish government on the state of talks
chaired by U.S. mediator George Mitchell in London to review the
Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is trying to break an impasse over guerrilla
disarmament, which has stalled the implementation of the agreement
and prevented the set-up of a coalition government in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said that he hoped the review, launched by Mitchell
at the request of the Irish and British governments to try to
build trust between the feuding parties, would enable all sides to
offer "clarity and certainty."
</P>
<P>
"That's what we're looking for and that will require a bit of
give and take from everyone. Like David (Andrews), I remain
hopeful. The possibility of implementing it (the Good Friday
agreement) in full remains within our grasp," he was quoted as
saying by a Reuters report from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson insisted that there be no alternative to the Good
Friday peace agreement and said he was hopeful the review would
make progress this week.
</P>
<P>
The Dublin visit marks Mandelson's first talks with Irish
government ministers since he succeeded Mo Mowlam as Northern
Ireland secretary.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Hostages Released in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The three Portuguese nationals
abducted by local Iranian bandits as hostages were released on
Tuesday morning, a spokesman from the Iranian Interior Ministry
announced.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Tehran radio, Spokesman of the Interior Ministry
Bahaeddin Sheikholeslam said the kidnappers set free the
Portuguese hostages after they found that the Iranian government
was determined not to make concession.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian security forces are still chasing
the kidnappers who fled the scene after releasing hostages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a security
official as saying that Ricardo Andrei, 46, Jorge Duarte, 40
and Juan Mendes Pinto, 43 are now on their way to Zahedan,
Iran's southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
The three hostages were part of a seven-member television
crew from Portugal. They were abducted by members of drug
trafficking rings in southeastern Iran on their way from Bam,
the central Kerman province to Zahedan on September 27.
</P>
<P>
Four other hostages including three women were immediately
released by the abductors and they are staying at a hotel
in Zahedan to wait for their friends.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the abductors had set the release of a
drug trafficker called Manouchehr Maroui as the precondition
for the release of the Portuguese hostages.
</P>
<P>
After the kidnapping, Iranian security authorities formed a
special team to rescue the hostages, but refused to make any
concession with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian security forces claimed last week that they had
found the hideout of the kidnapers, warning to use force to crack
down them.

<HEADLINE> Central China to Hold Aviation World Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China will hold the 99'World
Grand Prix of Aviation in Zhangjiajie in central China's Hunan
Province from December 8 to 12, said officials of the organizing
committee today.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen pilots from nine countries including the US, Germany,
France and Russia are expected to attend the contest.
</P>
<P>
There will also be aerocade performances by France's Space
Knights, the Sky Box of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic,
said officials.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee will also choose six outstanding
pilots to try flying through the Tianmen Cave (the Gate to Heaven),
which will be the first time a flight through a natural cave is
attempted.
</P>
<P>
The cave, the major Zhangjiajie scenic spot, is about 1,261
meters above sea level, 27 meters high, 279 meters long, and only
28 meters across at its narrowest part.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jizhong, chairman of the Sports Aviation Association of
China, said that December is the best season for this grand event
because of excellent visibility and a favorable climate.
</P>
<P>
Liu Liancheng, vice-head of the organizing committee, said that
this will be the second time the International Aeronautical
Federation will hold such a tournament, following the one in eight
Chinese cities last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiajie, located in the northwestern part of the province,
is one of China's most famous scenic spots, and was placed in the
United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization
World Heritage list in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Extend Losses on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Share prices extended losses
on Singapore Stock Market Tuesday despite Wall Street's overnight
gains as fears over a possible U.S. interest hike continued to
weigh on the market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) eased 10.24 points to
end at 1,983.21 in subdued dealings.
</P>
<P>
The turnover totaled 176.82 million units valued at 434.76
million Singapore dollars (about 259.99 million U.S. dollars).
There were 109 rises against 170 falls with 172 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
SIA DBScw00 topped the actives chart of the day going up 40
cents to close at 10.10 Singapore dollars. It was followed by GE
Life, NatElect, SIA, UOB and UOB F, all of which edged up 30 cents
to finish at 18.20, 6.45, 16.30, 12.90 and 13.00 Singapore dollars
respectively. PacCent, SIA 200 and Seaview picked up 20 cents each
and they ended at 9.65, 16.20 and 11.00 Singapore dollars
separately.
</P>

cents to close at 1.99 Singapore dollars. TIBS w00 lost 96.5 cents
to finish at 0.735 Singapore dollars. Creative 50 shed 90 cents to
end at 17.60 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market rose in early dealings encouraged by
the overnight advance on Wall Street but later losses eroded early
gains which failed to sustain the upward momentum.
</P>
<P>
They said the market adopted a wait-and-see attitude ahead of
the scheduled release of U.S. inflation data later Tuesday and
investors turned cautious over U.S. interest rate worries.

<HEADLINE> China Wages Full War on Bad Assets of Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China's fourth and last asset
management company (AMC) was unveiled here today, marking the
formal kick-off of the government's strategy to deal with the
massive bad assets of its banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Like the three other AMCs before it, the China Huarong Asset
Management Company officially launched today has a registered
capital of 10 billion yuan from the Ministry of Finance and enjoys
tax immunity and other preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
The four AMCs, established in half year, are government arms to
handle the bad assets of China's four major state-owned commercial
banks, namely, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the
Agriculture Bank of China, the Construction Bank of China, and the
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures show that by the end of September,
lending by Chinese banks totaled 9,000 billion yuan, and Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, said non-performing loans account for about 10 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
The AMCs are authorized to revitalize the bad assets through
restructuring, debt-to-equity swaps and liquidation, among other
means. They could also sell the creditor's rights and stock rights
of the target enterprises to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
As the four said banks serve as the backbone of China's banking
sector, experts say that offsetting their bad assets would lay a
solid foundation for the stability of the entire banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xu, a senior official of the central bank, said the total
assets of China's state-owned commercial banks have been
increasing quickly in the past two decades with the country's
rapid economic growth, but their reserve fund has been dropping
relatively.
</P>
<P>
The strip-off of the bad assets from them would strengthen
their paying capacity remarkably, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kathie Krumm, chief of the Economics Unit of the World Bank's
representative office in Beijing, said China would be able to
control the potential risks of its banking sector if the
government's strategy to settle non-performing bank loans could be
effectively implemented.
</P>
<P>
Yan Haiwang, a central bank deputy governor, expressed his
confidence at the AMCs, saying that they would play a major role
in controlling the financial risks and promoting the reform of
China's state-owned enterprises.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's Schindler
company, the largest supplier of escalators and the second largest
supplier of elevators in the world, today established the
Schindler Asia Pacific Research &AMP; Development Center and the China
Training Center in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third such centers, the other two being in
Switzerland and the US.
</P>
<P>
"China has been one of the largest market for such products
both in Asia and in the world. We do so for we are quite positive
about China's future," said Juergen Jinggren, in charge of the
company's business in the Asian-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two centers, both in the Pudong New Area of
Shanghai, will focus on developing new products, expanding its
business in Asia, and providing technicians in China, Japan and
Southeast Asia with training programs in the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
The company has now opened firms in over 100 countries, with
annual sales valued at 4.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the first company of its kind to set up joint ventures in
the Chinese mainland, it has invested a total of 2 billion yuan (
about 240 million U.S. dollars) in establishing 19 firms and over
80 agencies in major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai,
and Suzhou since 1980.

<HEADLINE> Three Japanese Nonlife Insurers to Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Three Japanese property and
casualty insurance firms Tuesday announced that they will set up a
holding company on an equal footing by April 2002 to integrate
their operations, creating Japan's largest nonlife insurance group.
</P>
<P>
The three insurers, Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co.,
Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance Co., and Koa Fire and Marine
Insurance Co., made the announcement at a joint press conference
after their boards of directors approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
The merger, which is aimed at improving the companies'
operational efficiency and competitiveness, will result in a
nonlife insurance group with assets totaling some 6 trillion yen (
about 56.8 billion U.S. dollars), surpassing the current leader
Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
Takeo Inokuchi, president of Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance,
predicted a reduction in the combined workforce of the three
companies by 3,000 within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of March, the three companies' combined workforce
was 18,715.
</P>
<P>
The companies' number of outlets will also be halved from 800
within the same five-year period, Inokuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Inokuchi noted that strong competitors, such as British life
insurer Direct Line Insurance PLC, are entering the Japanese
market.
</P>
<P>
"Our new partnership will help us withstand the formidable
foreign competition," Inokuchi said, adding that the group will
also become more competitive in Southeast Asian markets vis-a-vis
European and U.S. competitors.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Says No to Diplomatic Relations with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday
reiterated its policy of not establishing diplomatic relations
with Israel as long as the Palestinian issue and overall peace in
West Asia are not settled.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have to hide any relationship and change our
position. Our position remains the same and the people should not
doubt our position. We do not change our position by merely
talking," Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar told reporters after
meeting with German Minister of State of the Federal Foreign
Office, Ludger Volmer here, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said his unofficial meeting with the Israeli Foreign
Minister at the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month was
viewed by Palestine as a move which could help further and benefit
the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the view was expressed by Palestinian Local
Government Minister Saeb Erilat, the main Palestinian peace
negotiator with Israel, who accompanied President Yasser Arafat on
a short visit to Malaysia two days ago.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral talks between Arafat and Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Syed Hamid said Arafat repeated his commitment to the
on-going West Asia peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat informed Mahathir of the many matters still hampering
the peace process but he also believed that Palestine, together
with the lands promised, will be an independent country in the
end," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was the first ASEAN country to recognize Palestine and
to establish diplomatic relations with it.

<HEADLINE> Levy Hopeful Congress Will Approve Aid to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said Tuesday he believes the U.S. Congress will approve
1.9 billion U.S. dollars in aid package promised to Israel, the
Palestinians and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the dispute between President Bill Clinton and
the Congress over the aid package is "a test of strength"
in the election year, expressing his confidence that it will
ultimately be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the remarks after Clinton had vetoed a foreign aid
worth 12.6 billion U.S. dollars Monday because it did not include
the 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in aid he promised to Israel, the
Palestinians and Jordan while overseeing the signing of the Wye
agreement last October.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, Israel will receive 1.2 billion for
compensation for its troop redeployment in the West Bank. The
Palestinian National Authority will receive 400 million
U.S. dollars in economic assistance, and Jordan 300 million.
</P>
<P>
Washington froze the package after former Israeli prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu halted the Wye agreement, on which
he signed, but promised to reopen it after Ehud Barak ousted
Netanyahu in the May election with a pledge to revive the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak said last week that it will be difficult to move forward
the peace process without the promised aid.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh flew to
Washington earlier this week to persuade congressional leaders to
approve the aid.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Clinton will meet Republican leaders of
the Congress later Tuesday to seek a solution to the budget
impasse.

BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- MetLife (Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company) of the United States, said today that it will
establish a 100,000 U.S. dollar scholarship fund in China's
Central Finance and Economic University (CFEU).
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed between MetLife and CFEU, the
fund is to founded to encourage outstanding teachers and top-
performing students at CFEU's Insurance, Finance and Accounting
Departments.
</P>
<P>
The two parties will explore opportunities to build a CFEU-
affiliated MetLife College of Insurance to help train insurance
teachers and professionals.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to help improve and promote CFEU's
insurance, finance and accounting education and to provide
training to Chinese insurance professionals.
</P>
<P>
MetLife Senior Vice President Vincent Reusing said that they
believe insurance education is a key factor in boosting China's
insurance industry, adding that MetLife is ready to help China
establish its private insurance system by sharing its experience
with Chinese regulators and insurers through various cooperation
and exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
MetLife opened its representative office in Beijing in January
1995 and its Shanghai office in July 1996. Over the past four
years in China, it has invested over 100 million U.S. dollars
directly and indirectly in 26 Chinese companies.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Children Comparatively Unhealthy: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- One in three Filipinos are
anemic, one of ten mothers are afflicted with night blindness, and
malnutrition among under-five-year-old children are on the rise,
according to an official survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Nutrition Survey made by the country's Food and
Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) also showed that iodine
deficiency disorder has become a public health concern.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in 1998 and covering all the 78 provinces
of the Philippines, said anemia is still a major nutritional
problem, with a prevalence rate of 31 percent, affecting mainly
infants aged six months to less than a year.
</P>
<P>
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the major cause and the most
prevalent of the dietary deficiency causes of nutritional anemia,
the FNRI said.
</P>
<P>
IDA is a disorder characterized by reduced ability of the blood
to carry oxygen from the lungs to the brain, muscles and other
organs, consequently reducing the body's capacity to work and
learn.
</P>
<P>
FNRI said one of the greatest dangers posed by IDA is the
diminished ability to fight infection, which predisposed expectant
mothers to death from possible spontaneous abortion.
</P>
<P>
Night blindness, caused by Vitamin A deficiency and
characterized by good vision at day time but poor at dusk and at
night, affected 10 percent of mothers and care-givers of children
under five years old.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that nine percent of pre-scholars, or an
estimated 705,000, are underweight.
</P>
<P>
The survey is undertaken every five years to build a database
for health-related decision-making by the government.

<HEADLINE> SW Province to Turn 150,000 Hectares of Farmland Into Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Acting Governor Zhang Zhongwei
announced here today that Sichuan Province plans to turn 150,000
hectares of farmland into forests in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
This is a new step taken by this southwestern province in
response to the central government's efforts to curb severe soil
erosion. Last year, the province initiated a program to protect
local primitive forests.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, which covers half of the Yangtze River Basin, has the
second-largest amount of forests among all provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Since the province began to forbid lumbering in the forests,
crop-cultivation on hillsides with a slope of 25 degrees has been
proved to the number one factor causing land erosion.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 60 percent of the mud in river
waters in China comes from hillside farming, which has forced the
government to take action against soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> SSC Invites Taiwan Seismological Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Seismological Society of
China (SSC) sent a message on October 15 to Taiwan seismologists
inviting them to the mainland to work together on issues of
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the massive earth quake that jolted Taiwan on
September 21, seismologists on the mainland contacted officials
and experts at Taiwan seismological organization expressing their
sympathy and wish to help with on-the-spot relief work.
</P>
<P>
Some experts in Taiwan also said that they would like to
welcome experts from the mainland and help with procedures for
them going to Taiwan. But for various reasons, they haven't made
the trip yet.
</P>
<P>
An official with the SSC said, "Although 20 days have passed
since the disastrous quake, seismological experts on the mainland
are still concerned about the issue and would like to provide any
possible help."
</P>
<P>
The emergency relief work has now been tentatively completed,
and the work of reconstruction is now on the agenda, he added.
</P>
<P>
The message sent on October 15 said, "The massive earthquake
that hit Taiwan September 21 has been a concern of mainland
compatriots over the pass days. Now the quake-stricken areas are
facing the problem of reconstruction. Having undergone several
devastating earthquakes including the Tangshan quake of 1976, we
have accumulated reconstruction experiences, and our
reconstruction and related scientific research are notable.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to work together with Taiwan fellow experts to
reconstruct the quake-stricken areas. And we are ready to invite
them to the mainland to carry out cooperative research."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Drops to 31-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Annual growth in the
headline consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 1.9 percent in
September, the lowest level in 31 years, Statistics South Africa
(SSA) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year CPI growth rate was 3.2 percent in August and
4.9 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
"The latest figure is the lowest in 31 years. It is close to
the 1.7 percent recorded in September 1968," SSA head Mark Orkin
said.
</P>
<P>
"The 1.9 percent figure reflects the increase in the cost of a
typical mix of consumer goods and services compared with 12 months
ago. It means that prices overall are still rising, but more
slowly than in preceding months," he added.
</P>
<P>
The main contributors to the 1.9-percent annual inflation rate
included price increases in transport, food, household operations
and medical care. These were partly offset by the large decrease
in mortgage interest rates over the 12-month period.
</P>
<P>
The average interest rates on home loans have dropped from 23.7
percent to 16.5 percent in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
SSA said the core inflation rate, which excludes mortgage rates
and some other distorting elements, stood at 7.9 percent in
September unchanged from August, despite upward pressure from
rising international crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation rates are used by the central bank when it makes
monetary policies.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Yang di-Pertuan
Agong (Supreme Head of State) Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah
said Tuesday night Malaysia would share its experience and
expertise in various development fields with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Kuala Lumpur and Caracas are relatively
new but within a short period, they have flourished considerably,
the King said at a banquet in honor of visiting Venezuelan
President Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias here.
</P>
<P>
He said these relations developed in several areas, including
exchange of visits, economic and technical cooperation as well as
cooperation on various regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 Venezuelan officials have taken advantage of some
of the courses offered under the Malaysian Technical Cooperation
Program.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Salahuddin commended Venezuela for its strong commitment
to G-15 and cooperation among the countries of the South, saying
that as the world moved into the next millennium, it was
important that efforts be made by developing countries to enhance
cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Malaysia looks forward to working closely with
Venezuela in achieving this noble objective, he said.
</P>
<P>
The King believed that the visit by the Venezuelan president
would contribute towards the further strengthening of the ties
between the governments and peoples of the two countries.

Sultan Salahuddin said Malaysia and Venezuela today could be
justifiably proud that they were both independent, sovereign and
democratic countries, committed to the single-minded pursuit of
improving the well-being of their respective citizens.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Venezuela established diplomatic missions in each
other's capital in 1991.

<P>
Second, it is imperative to combine theory with practice. "We
should learn not only from books, but also from practices," the
Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Reform, opening up and modernization represent a huge classroom,
where the working masses are the masters. "Learning from practice
means, first of all, learning from the masses," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, "it is also important to be good at summing up
and upgrading the masses' new experiences so as to constantly
improve our performances."
</P>
<P>
Third, continuous efforts should be made to transform one's
subjective world while transforming the objective world, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
In transforming the subjective world, it is vital to firmly
build up a correct outlook on life, the world and values, as well
as a firm conviction in devotion to the causes of the Party and
the people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader pointed out that one of the major reasons
some officials fall victim to power, money and women is because
they were lax in transforming their subjective world.
</P>
<P>
The party should cultivate a spirit of hard struggle and
entreprenuership and resolutely oppose a vulgar philosophy of life
and indifferent attitudes, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
All Party members, especially leading officials, should always
maintain an exuberant fighting will of forging ahead, a highly
responsible work attitude, and serve the people with heart and
soul.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, it is imperative to uphold the integrity of learning
both general and special knowledge, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China's reform, opening up and modernization drive represent a
grand and complex systematic project in which all efforts must be
co-ordinated and complement each other. Having too many things to
take care of at the same time can lead only to failure.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Calls for Improvement of Study (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has called for the further improvement of study among all members
of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and
chairman of the Central Military Commission, also urged uplifting
study to a new level.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made the call in his address to senior CPC
officials attending a financial training course at the CPC Central
Committee's Party School on January 11, 1999. Excerpts of the
address were released today by the Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely important to strengthen study and build up a
better style," Jiang noted, citing the following five aspects that
command emphasis.
</P>
<P>
First, studies should be centered around the practical issues
of the country. "They should not be scholastic, but rather they
should have an object in view, with study for the sake of
application," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts need to be put into studying the practical issues of
China's reform, opening up and modernization drive, with the focus
on the application of Marxism, and on new issues and developments,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He raised some issues that should be deliberated thoroughly,
including how to speed up the establishment of a modern corporate
system in state-owned enterprises, technical renovation, the
stable operation of the country's finance, and the management of
international cooperation for national security.
</P>
<P>
All these have a direct bearing on the fulfillment of China's
cross-century development objectives. "I hope that all Party
members will use their brains, seek right answers from practices,
and push forward our country's reform, opening up and
modernization drive," he said.

MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia will strengthen bilateral
cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina and play a more active
role in the reconstruction of the former Yugoslav republic, said
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We attach great and special importance to the settlement of
the Bosnia problem. Of late, there have been many contacts, which
covered all the outstanding problems, especially those linked with
Bosnia and Herzegovina," Ivanov said at a meeting with his Bosnia
and Herzegovina counterpart, Jadranko Prlic, who arrived here for
a working visit on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prlic, describing his visit to Russia as "a chance to promote
cooperation between the two countries," said on Monday that his
talks with Ivanov would deal with issues of bilateral relations,
Russia's role in the rehabilitation of Bosnia and with the
situation in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and in Southeast
Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russia offered Bosnia a credit of 100 million U.S.
dollars, which was regarded as repayment of part of Moscow's debt
to former Yugoslavia.

Such a task means that without basic knowledge in various
fields, officials, especially leading ones, can not expect to have
a good grasp of matters of overall importance, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, it is vital to draw upon the useful knowledge and
experiences of other countries while the major efforts are devoted
to the study of China's own situations and characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the country must learn from all civilizations
and cultures, including the management skills developed by the
industrialized Western countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, when learning from others, the country must
separate the good from the bad, and refrain from copying them
mechanically.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader stressed that from a long perspective, it is
extremely important to cultivate a large troupe of young cadres so
as to realize the cross-century development objectives of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Young cadres can expect to grow up only when they study hard,
immerse themselves in practices, and temper themselves in hard
environments, he said.
</P>
<P>
To promote a general mood of learning throughout society, Jiang
called on officials at all levels of government, and all Party
members to spend more time and effort on study, and play a leading
role.
</P>
<P>
When the whole society is eager to learn, the Chinese nation
can expect even brighter prospects, The Chinese leader noted.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Sino-ROK, Northeastern Asian Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Economists from China, the
Republic of Korea (ROK) and Japan said today they believe there
exists enormous potential and broad prospects for economic
cooperation between China and the ROK and in northeast Asia at
large in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
They expressed this belief at a seminar held by the ROK embassy
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day gathering, participants discussed matters
concerning efforts made by China and the ROK to overcome the Asian
financial crisis, Sino-ROK economic cooperation in the new century,
Sino-ROK cooperation in industry, and economic cooperation in
northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
ROK ambassador to China Kwon Byong-hyon said on the occasion
that Sino-ROK cooperation in political, economic and cultural and
other areas has seen comprehensive development since the
establishment of diplomatic ties seven years ago, adding that
during President Kim Dae-jung's 1998 visit to China, the two
countries decided to develop a cooperative partnership oriented
toward the 21st century, which set a framework for the further
growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should work together to promote economic
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also said he believes the areas of economic
cooperation among China, the ROK and Japan are broad, and such
cooperation will serve peace, stability and development in
northeast Asia, and promote global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that sound political relations and
economic complementarity give a solid foundation for bilateral
cooperation, as both countries are restructuring their respective
economies, providing even greater opportunities for expanding
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between China and the ROK stood at 5 billion U.S.
dollars in 1992. The figure in 1997 reached 24 billion U.S.
dollars, and now China is the third-largest trading partner of the
ROK, while the ROK is China's fourth-largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly 12,000 ROK enterprises had invested eight
billion U.S. dollars in China by the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
Participants also discussed ways to promote economic
cooperation in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Development Research Center of China's State
Council, China's State Development Planning Commission, the Korea
Development Institute, and ROK universities, as well as former
Japanese ambassador to China Yoshiyasu Sato attended the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Deputy PM Says Coalition Government Works Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The nation at peace and the
good cooperation between the two ruling parties are two important
goals gained by the new Royal Government of Cambodia since it was
formed a year ago, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia is a proud nation moving to the 21th century, without
rebels, and recognized by all nations and under one government,"
Sar Kheng, deputy prime minister and co-ministers of interior,
said on the occasion of the International day for Poverty
Eradication and the release of the Cambodian Human Development
report in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that with total elimination and removal of the last
vestiges of the Khmer Rouge regime, "We are at peace now," and "We
can be able to concentrate on development and eradication of
poverty." This is the first and greatest achievement for
Cambodia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng said: "We have work well till now for the national
development in Cambodia and security of its people."
</P>
<P>
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) led by Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC
party led by Prince Ranariddh formed the new coalition government
after last year's general election in which the CPP won the
majority in parliament, but it lacked the two-thirds needed to
form a government of its own.
</P>
<P>
It was the two parties' second cooperation. Their first
coalition government following 1993 election collapsed in July,
1997 after troops loyal to Hun Sen ousted the prince as co-prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sar Kheng said though Cambodia has made good
progress since 1993, rebuilding a nation devastated by war is not
easy. He cited six development challenges confronting the
government, such as to ensure a strong and equitable economic
growth; to build more school and health clinics; to de-mine more
land for the use of the poor and to develop a coherent policy to
solve tenure security problems.
</P>
<P>
"But the most important goal of the Royal Government is to
alleviate poverty," he said, adding "Most of the government's
actions and policies have been undertaken to this end."
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Planning,
Cambodia's poverty population has been reduced from 39 percent in
1993 to 36 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China to Give More Importance to Environment: Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao
said here yesterday that the country will attach greater
importance to environmental protection and pollution control while
formulating its economic and social development plans.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier, who is also chairman of the China Council
for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (
CCICED),told a CCICED meeting that the nation faces a tough
environmental situation, saying that long-term concerted efforts
are required to reverse this situation.
</P>
<P>
Wen said China will balance environmental protection and
economic and social development by sticking to the policy of
integrating economic and social development and the environment
and eco-construction, relying on scientific and technological
achievements, and legal and necessary administrative measures to
promote environmental protection and pollution control.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also listed international exchange and
cooperation on environmental protection and development as part of
the effort required for development and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China last year invested a total of 72 billion yuan (about 9
billion U.S. dollars), or 0.91 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP), in environmental protection and pollution control,
the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
This investment represents an increase of 43 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
For this year, environmental protection accounts for a large
percentage of the national financial budget and the incremental
national debt, he added.
</P>
<P>
Headway has been made in pollution control and environmental
protection during the past two years thanks to the measures taken
by the Chinese government, he said.
</P>
<P>
These measures include putting an end to overlapping
construction, phasing out backward production processes and
equipment, and closing down enterprises causing serious pollution
in its ongoing strategic economic restructuring effort.
</P>
<P>
The council, which encompasses 25 high-level Chinese
environmental protection-related officials and economists and 29
overseas environmental protection experts or officials, was set up
in 1992 by the Chinese government as an advisory body on national
environmental protection and sustainable development decision-
making.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Hand Over East Timor Within 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here Tuesday that Indonesia would hand over East Timor
to the United Nations as soon as possible after the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) confirmed the result of the
U.N.-sponsored ballot conducted on August 30.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet had an exact time to hand over East Timor to
the U.N. But it will proceed in the near future within this year,"
Alatas told reporters at the sidelines of the MPR session.
</P>
<P>
He said the exact time for the hand-over will be discussed with
the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether East Timor would automatically become an
independent state after the hand-over, he said that it will not be
automatically.
</P>
<P>
"It is still uncertain because it will depend on the next
process," he said, saying Indonesia did not decide on East Timor's
independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MPR Commission B has agreed to a draft on
ratification of the ballot result. It is still undecided whether
the assembly will ratify the draft or not until the plenary
session confirms such a draft to be an MPR decree.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portugal colony with a population of
800,000, integrated into Indonesia in 1976, but the United Nations
never recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 autonomy ballot showed most of the East Timorese
voted for independence. But after the result was announced, a
massive clash took place between the pro-independence group and
the anti-independence group. So the United Nations decided to send
an international peace-keeping force to East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes Albright's Claims on Arrested Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday refuted the
recent claims by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
regarding the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi condemned
Albright's remarks as "baseless" and a "blatant U.S. intervention
in the internal affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the case of the accused lies within the
jurisdiction of the country's judiciary and the judiciary will
review the case with full independence, the Islamic Republic News
Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cable News Network on Sunday, Albright
once again voiced Washington's concern over the arrest of the
Iranian Jews and said that there is no reason for espionage
charges against the Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
She said that the arrest of the Iranian Jews is unacceptable
and the United States has sent messages to Iran through different
channels on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Jews were arrested in April under the accusation
of working for Israeli and U.S. intelligence services, but both
Israel and the U.S. rejected the accusation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman also slammed the recent
remarks by U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen accusing Iran of
supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The allegation is an indication of contradictory and
unconsolidated stances in the U.S. foreign policy toward Iran, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk
called for unconditional dialog between Washington and Tehran in
order to improve relations between the two arch foes, which were
severed soon after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Filipino Investors' Dual Citizenship Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
studying a proposal to grant dual citizenship for overseas
Filipino investors as a means of attracting capital into the
country.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said Tuesday this proposal
of Secretary Edgardo Espiritu of the Department of Finance (DOF)
seeks the grant of exclusive economic rights to natural-born
Filipinos who have subsequently acquired foreign citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"The intention is to entice these overseas Filipinos to
repatriate and invest their capital funds in the Philippines,"
Barican said.
</P>
<P>
According to Espiritu, the proposal will be presented to the
Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reforms headed by former
Supreme Court Chief Justice Andres Narvasa.
</P>
<P>
The finance chief said that granting Filipinos dual citizenship
would enable overseas Filipinos to "invest most freely in the
country."

<HEADLINE> Religious Leaders Slam U.S. Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A number of important religious
figures gathered here today to express strong indignation and
opposition to United States accusations of religious intolerance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department recently issued its "Annual Report
on International Religious Freedom for 1999," which irresponsibly
comments on religious affairs in many countries, including China,
and lists China as a country for "special concern" and threatens
China with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bainian, vice chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, said at today's gathering that the U.S. accusations
about China's religious situation and policy are unfounded and
unreasonable, and will certainly be refuted and protested by all
the Chinese people, including all Catholics in China.
</P>
<P>
Wan Yaobin, vice president of the Islamic Association of China,
said that the U.S. report is a complete vilification. "It ignored
the fact that all the normal religious activities of Muslims in
China are well protected, and it didn't even mention a word on the
terrorist actions of separatists.
</P>
<P>
Shi Zesheng, vice chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic
Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China (three-self:
self-administration, self-support and self-propagation), said in a
written speech that as a priest who has worked for the Church for
decades, he see clearly that the U.S. accusations are nothing but
rumors fabricated out of thin air and brazen lies.
</P>
<P>
Also attending today's gathering were Buddhist and Taoist
figures who all agreed that there is no problem of "religious
persecution" in China and this fact can never be distorted.
</P>
<P>
This is, in essence, a wanton interference in China's internal
affairs under the pretext of freedom in religious belief, and the
Chinese government and people will never accept it, they said.

<HEADLINE> China: Stricter Policies to Protect Land Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China will implement stricter
measures to protect its limited land and other natural resources
in the 21st Century, Chinese minister of land and resources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an annual meeting of the China Association for
Science and Technology, Minister Zhou Yongkang said that China
should shift the extensive use of resources to intensive use, and
find out a new way of thrifty economic growth which suits the
nation's situation.
</P>
<P>
A centralized, highly efficient and authoritative new system
should be adopted to handle the management of resources according
to law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has the third largest land area in the world, but its per
capita cultivated land is only 0.1 hectare, or 43 percent of the
world's average. China is facing sharp contradictions between
people and land, and there will be more urgent demand for farmland
when the Chinese population reaches its peak in 2030.
</P>
<P>
"China must implement the most strict policies for land
management and cultivated land protection in the long run, and
bring land use under strict control," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the abundance in mineral resources, the per capita
share in China is only 58 percent of the world's average, with a
potential shortage of petroleum, natural gas and rich iron ore,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the prospecting and mining of mineral resources
should be carried out according to law. "We are now focusing on
improving the order of the mining industry, with emphasis placed
on coal, gold, construction materials and non-ferrous metal
sectors."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is trying to upgrade traditional
industries to cut the high consumption of resources and establish
a resource-saving national economic system.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that his ministry is planning a new round of land
resources surveys to obtain data for information network and
social services.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on the nearly 4,000 experts and scholars
attending the four-day meeting to provide advice for the
protection of the country's land and resources.

<HEADLINE> Huge Amount of Aid Promised to PNA: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The donor countries have promised
to offer an aid of 500 million U.S. dollars to the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) by the end of this year, Palestinian
Finance Minister Mohammad Zohdi Nashashibi said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Gaza with Egypt's Middle East News Agency,
Nashashibi said the donors made the pledge during a two-day
meeting on the issue ending last Friday in the Japanese capital
of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries' meeting was attended by rich Western
nations, the states with political weight in the world and those
related to the Middle East peace process. It was aimed at giving
momentum to the peace process by providing the Palestinians with
economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi, member of the Palestinian delegation led by
President Yasser Arafat, said the participants approved a
three-way plan of action, which involves the PNA, donor countries
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The three parties agreed to cooperate in implementing projects
under the program of Bethlehem 2000 in the West Bank and ventures
in a number of Palestinian industrial zones, the minister told the
news agency.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Israel pledged to facilitate the movement
of goods and people between Gaza and the West Bank and that
between the two Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel, as well as
the outside world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised Wye accord signed on September 5 in Egypt,
Israel was to have opened a safe passage for the Palestinians to
travel between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and allowed the
construction of the seaport on October 1. But disagreements on
security issues have delayed the steps.
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi added that the PNA needs an estimated 2.2 billion
dollars over the coming three years to lay a foundation for
sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries have promised in principle to meet PNA's
demand but have yet to fix the share of each country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian economy grew by 4 percent last year and is
expected to retain the growth rate this year, the news agency
said, adding that the figure will rise over the coming years with
the advance of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> HK Unemployment Rate Continues to Stabilize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unemployment rate
continued to stabilize, according to the latest labor force
statistics issued today by the Hong Kong Census and Statistics
Department.
</P>
<P>
The statistics said the provisional seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate for July-September 1999 was 6.1 percent and the
provisional underemployment rate was 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Secretary for Education and
Manpower Joseph Wong said employment prospects have continued to
improve in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, it is estimated that some 65,000 jobs will be
created in the next 15 months as a result of the government's
major initiatives, infrastructure projects and other public works
program items," Wong added.
</P>
<P>
For June-August 1999, both the seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate and the underemployment rate were confirmed to be the same as
the previously released provisional figures of 6.1 percent and 2.9
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Comparing July-September 1999 with June-August 1999, increases
in the unemployment rate were observed in decoration and
maintenance, transport, wholesale trade and hotels, offsetting the
decreases seen in communications and business services.
</P>
<P>
As to the underemployment rate, increases occurred mainly in
manufacturing, decoration and maintenance, restaurants and
transport.
</P>
<P>
For June-August 1999, the size of the total labor force was 3,
468,500, of whom 3,247,900 were employed and 220,600 were
unemployed. In the same period, the number of underemployed
persons was 102,000.
</P>
<P>
For July-September 1999, the size of the total labor force was
provisionally estimated at 3,459,000, of whom 3,235,000 were
employed persons and 224,000 were unemployed persons. The
corresponding figure for underemployed persons was 109,000.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment and underemployment statistics were obtained
from a continuous General Household Survey. In the survey, the
definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment
follow closely those recommended by the International Labor
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is "seasonally adjusted." This refers to
the adjustment for seasonal variations in the proportion of first-
time job-seekers in the labor force.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Bombing Raids on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops Tuesday
continued air and artillery attacks on rebel positions in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, destroying some rebel bases and a
communications relay station, the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal forces continued to prepare weapons and
equipment for combat use and were taking measures to improve
coordination between units, the Interfax news agency quoted the
ministry's press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry believes that Chechen rebels intend to
let federal troops into Chechnya and then launch "large-scale
retribution actions" while staging subversive and terrorist acts
in the three Russian border regions of Daghestan, Stavropol and
Krasnodar.
</P>
<P>
It said 60 rebels, among them people speaking Russian, have
formed a unit to carry out terrorist acts in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, avoiding direct clashes with federal troops, have
resorted to "guerrilla tactics."
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one-
third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the
retaken areas, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax reported that on Tuesday Moscow's envoy to Chechnya,
Nikolai Koshman, and representatives of the Chechen community and
of the 1996 Chechen parliament arrived in Mozdok to set up local
governing bodies.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the massive assault on the rebels following
two waves of armed incursions into Daghestan led by Chechen
warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only
by his last name.
</P>
<P>
The two have been accused of masterminding a series of
terrorist explosions that killed about 300 people in Moscow and
two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, capital city of the rebel province, a commander
said Chechnya is ready to name the organizers of those terrorist
acts and produce material and documented evidence to international
organizations and the press, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
While urging Chechen authorities to hand over Basayev, Khattab
and other suspected terrorists, Moscow has all along rejected any
mediation from outside, saying the Chechen issue is its internal
affair.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Dismantling Illegal Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel began to dismantle 10
Jewish settlements in the West Bank Tuesday under an agreement
between Prime Minister Ehud Barak and settler leaders last week.
</P>
<P>
The first to be removed was an outpost built on a hilltop near
the settlement of Shvut Rachel north of Ramallah. Dozens of
settlers blocked the access roads to the uninhabited hilltop when
a crane was sent in.
</P>
<P>
As part of a compromise with settler leaders, Barak announced
last week to dismantle 10 of the 42 settlements erected since the
signing of the Wye interim agreement one year ago and leave the
others in place.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has denounced the compromise
deal, saying it "legitimizes the theft by force carried out by the
settlers against Palestinian rights."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians regard Jewish settlement construction in the
West Bank and Gaza illegal and demand that all the 144 settlements
built in these areas be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Radical settlers, angered by Barak's deal with settler leaders,
pledged to resist efforts to remove any of the outposts.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of settlers protested outside Barak's official
residence Sunday night in the biggest right-wing demonstration
since he took office in July.
</P>
<P>
Under the former right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu,
settlers were encouraged to grab as much land as they could in the
West Bank to prevent them from being transferred to the
Palestinians under signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jewish settlements is supposed to be discussed in
the final-status talks, which will deal with the thorniest issues
in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict like the Palestinian statehood
and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
One month after the two sides kicked off the talks by a
symbolic ceremony, Israel has yet to name its chief negotiators.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Regrets at CMAG Decision: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday regretted at
the decision of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG)
to suspend Pakistan from participating in the Councils of the
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmed said that the decision "ignores the extraordinary
circumstances which led to the enforcement of emergency in
Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"It also overlooks the fact that there is no Martial Law in the
country and there is popular public sentiment in favor of the
change," the foreign secretary said in the briefing, the first at
the Foreign Office since the military took over last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf has
already announced in his address to the nation Sunday the
framework for the multi-tier administration which will be
primarily civilian in character.
</P>
<P>
The elected president continues to hold office, the judiciary
is functioning normally under civil law. The fundamental rights of
the people are protected, said Shamshad.
</P>
<P>
"The CMAG decision also does not take into account the
categorical statement by the Chief Executive that the armed forces
have no intention of staying in charge any longer than absolutely
necessary to pave the way of true democracy to flourish in
Pakistan," said the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
According to Shamshad, the Pakistani government will receive
the ministerial delegation which CMAG has agreed to send to
Pakistan shortly to meet with the Pakistani leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said that prior to the CMAG meeting, Pakistan had suggested
to the Commonwealth Secretary General that a fact-finding mission
should first visit Pakistan to assess the public reaction and to
have a better understanding of the situation.
</P>
<P>
In taking the decision, the CMAG has, therefore, ignored many
important aspects, especially the public reaction to the change in
Pakistan, and has applied the Harare Declaration principles in
haste, Shamshad added.

<HEADLINE> Pak for Unconditional, Result-Oriented Dialogue with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will welcome
"unconditional and result-oriented dialogue" with India on solving
all outstanding problems especially the core issue of Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed Tuesday
during a press conference at the Foreign Office, the first by him
since the military took over a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, has always desired that the two south Asian
nations should sincerely work towards resolving all their
problems, especially the Jammu and Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a confidence building measure, Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf has announced an important initiative of
unilateral military de-escalation along Pakistan's border with
India.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the response from the Indian side is "not
positive."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad also quoted Musharraf as reiterating that Pakistan
will continue to provide "moral, political and diplomatic support
to the Kashmiris."
</P>
<P>
He called on India to honor the relevant U.N. resolutions and
its own commitments to the Kashmiri people.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, Shamshad said, Pakistan's policy is clear
and consistent. "We desire durable peace in Afghanistan through
negotiations and reconciliation among the Afghans," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chief Executive Musharraf has stressed the need
for a broad-based government which is representative of all
segments of the Afghan society. "Only the Afghan people are
competent to bring about such a government," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
The Tashkent Declaration which Pakistan signed during the Six
plus Two (Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus Russia and
the United States) meeting in the Uzbek capital in July this year
also emphasizes the establishment of such a government in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will continue to extend its fullest support to all
efforts aimed at promoting the Afghan peace process including
those of the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic
Conference," said Shamshad.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of terrorism, the foreign secretary said that
Pakistan remains opposed to all forms and manifestations of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We support international effort to combat terrorism. We have
always extended our full cooperation to the international
community for this purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Shamshad said that Pakistan is always
opposed to sanctions for it believes "sanctions are
counter-productive and unacceptable to the Pakistani people."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
people have expressed deep condolence over the passing of Julius
Nyerere, the former president of Tanzania and "a familiar and
great friend of the Chinese people," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Zhang Qiyue said today.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference here this afternoon, Zhang said
that Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a message of condolence to
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa the same day when Nyerere
passed away, saying that the Chinese government and people express
deep condolence and profound solicitudes to the Tanzanian
government and people and relative of Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao came to the Tanzanian embassy
in Beijing on October 18 to express his sorrow over the death of
Nyerere on behalf of the Chinese government and people, she said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, the Chinese government envoy and communication
minister, has left for Tanzania to attend the funeral in honor of
Nyerere, she added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang described Nyerere as "a distinguished leader highly
respected by the Tanzanian people, a statesman and activist with
high reputation in Africa and the whole world."
</P>
<P>
Since early 1960s, she said, senior generation of Chinese
leaders and Nyerere made concerted efforts to forge the friendship
between China and Tanzania. During the past decades, Nyerere made
"major contributions" to the growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
She said that the passing of Nyerere is not only a great loss
for the Tanzanian people, the Chinese people also lost an old
friend.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Transactions Progress in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Electronic
Payment System (MEPS) has been effective since its nationwide
implementation on March 22, 1999, according to a Bank Negara
official.
</P>
<P>
Payments totaled 8.25 million ringgit (2.171 million U.S.
dollars) through the MEPS Secured Electronic Transactions (SET)
payment gateway, Bank Negara (State Bank) Assistant Governor
Zamani Abdul Ghani said here Tuesday at the launch of
Premium-Link, the online payment and renewal services for motor
insurance.
</P>
<P>
There are already 170 merchants acquired by four participating
banks -- Maybank, Public Bank, RHB Bank and Hong Leong Bank -- in
the payment gateway and 3,500 e-wallets (digital certificates)
have been issued free to cardholders, he added.
</P>
<P>
MEPS has been entrusted to develop a payment gateway based on
SET, given that the credit card is commonly used for Internet
purchases, he said, adding that SET protocol provides a more
promising solution in terms of security as the information
pertaining to credit cards will not be transmitted over the
network and the identity of the cardholder is based on the digital
certificate.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the SET technology is new, the central bank has
allowed the use of Security Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to coexist
with SET to support the development of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
He urged the insurance industry to prepare itself for the
transition to a new business era as it enters the 21st century,
saying, "In Malaysia, only about half of the licensed insurers had
set up information with non-interactive websites on the Internet.
As it is, we still have a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank official, studies in the United
States estimated that more than 200 billion dollars' worth of
business will be transacted over the Internet by the end of next
year and there are currently more than 8,000 insurance-related
websites.
</P>
<P>
He said the Internet enables insurers to expand their marketing
potential in ways previously not possible or economically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
The central bank official said that in promoting e-commerce in
Malaysia, the government established in 1998 the National
Electronic Commerce Committee (NECC) to provide strategic
governance of e-commerce and set the direction for the development
of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
One of the objectives of the NECC is the formulation of an
Electronic Commerce Masterplan for Malaysia and this is currently
being finalized.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan anti-Taliban
troops made significant gains in a major counterattack overnight
in the northern province of Kunduz, an opposition spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesman Mohammad Habeel said forces loyal to Tajik
ethnic commander Ahmad Masood have recaptured the districts of
Dasht-i-Archi and Imam Saheb and Sher Khan Bandar township in the
province bordering Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Taliban militia have retreated back to areas from
where they started their autumn offensive against Masood a month
ago, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan opposition also claimed to have captured districts
of Hazarbagh and Khuja Ghar in Takhar province and seized a vital
supply route connecting northern Afghanistan and Tajikistan on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habeel said Taliban forces were in "disarray" and retreated
without offering much resistance during the overnight fighting,
leaving behind 40 dead fighters, 300 assorted weapons and 50
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban control 80 percent of Afghanistan and took part of
the northern provinces in its autumn offensive to squeeze the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Strengthen Agriculture Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday pledged
to strengthen its agricultural sector to avoid it from becoming a
sunset industry.
</P>
<P>
Its Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday
the country is determined to make the agricultural sector remain
relevant despite decades of rapid industrialization.
</P>
<P>
This called for strengthening the sector through research and
sound management as without continuous improvements in
productivity, Malaysia may find itself protecting the agricultural
industry to the detriment of the economy at large, he said at a
function in Port Klang, some 30 kilometers west of here, according
to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic turmoil in the last two years, which saw
the outflow of fund, the drying up of investment and the
depreciating of ringgit (local currency), distinctly reiterated
the importance of the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
"When food imports become expensive, it is very important to
ensure that we can be close to self-sufficiency in food production
to keep our import bills low," Abdullah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy prime minister, in fact, even as
Malaysia moves towards becoming an industrialized nation, more
than 3 million Malaysians remain dependent on the agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia's agriculture must strive to attain a
competitive advantage globally which will ensure that it remains a
productive sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector contributes 10 percent to the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) and Malaysia ranks among the world's
top five palm oil, rubber, pepper and cocoa producing countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Beef Up Navy by Buying New Warships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Navy will get new
warships to enable it to adequately police Nigeria's territorial
waters, Defense Minister Lt.-Gen. Theophilus Danjuma has
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The new warships to be acquired are "bigger, better and more
sophisticated" than the existing inventory, Danjuma said at the
Navy Training Command in Lagos Monday. But he did not reveal the
cost.
</P>
<P>
"Since Nigeria does not have a coast guard, it is your duty to
patrol waters in Nigeria's exclusive economic zone", the general
said.
</P>
<P>
"Reports of piracy in our territorial waters have become
rampant and this discourages importers from using our sea ports,
thus leading to great loss of revenue," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The new ships are not only going to be used in policing the
exclusive economic zone of the country, but also in diplomatic
visits to other parts of the world, the Guardian newspaper Tuesday
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The kind of offshore patrol vessels with decks for maritime
aircraft for intercepting and detaining ships that contravene the
country's laws will be given priority in the procurement, Danjuma
noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the navy's warships have long life span, but due to
poor maintenance, most of the vessels are becoming unserviceable,
he added.

which it will invest in the coming years," said Berg.
</P>
<P>
The fund, set up a few years ago as an investment for the
future when Norway's oil and gas resources eventually run out, is
invested mainly in members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, with Hong Kong and Singapore being
the only two exceptions.
</P>
<P>
"More than one billion HK dollars (130 million U.S. dollars)
was invested in the stock market here last year and I am sure that
the profits have already been healthy," she added.
</P>
<P>
Berg expressed her hope that the economic cooperation between
Norway and Hong Kong will be expanded to more areas from shipping
and exports of Norwegian fresh salmon as Hong Kong pursues the
ambition of becoming a world-class city.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is paying increasing attention to environmental
issues and to developing Hong Kong as a regional hub for
information technology, Berg said. "I will make efforts to
stimulate contacts between Norway and Hong Kong in these areas,"
she pledged.

Hong Kong, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Hong Kong
International Toys and Gifts Show and the Seventh Asian Gifts
Premium and Household Products Show opened Tuesday at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the shows are some 2,503 exhibitors from 27
countries and regions, including China's mainland and Hong Kong,
Australia, France, Italy, Japan and the United States.

Some of them placed orders with the exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
On show are toys, toy parts and accessories, gifts, consumer
electronics, Christmas decorations and a variety of household
products. The two shows are to last until October 22.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said here today
that the imminent visit by President Jiang Zemin to France will
push the overall Sino-French partnership toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of the Central Military Commission, made the
remark while meeting with visiting Chief of Staff of the French
Air Force Jean Rannou.
</P>
<P>
Fu voiced his belief that the visit by Rannou, the first senior
French Air Force officer to visit China in ten years, will further
promote bilateral army relations.
</P>
<P>
As China and France are both permanent members of the UN
Security Council and influential countries, both shoulder the
responsibility of maintaining peace and stability in the world,
said Fu, adding that friendly cooperation between the two nations
tallies with the interests of both and benefits the world.
</P>
<P>
Rannou said that his trip to China impressed him a great deal,
and said he hopes to further enhance exchanges of visit between
senior army leaders and between specific groups. The upcoming
visit by President Jiang Zemin to France will lend strong impetus
to the development of bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French guests arrived here on Sunday to begin an eight-day
official goodwill visit to China.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Translate Literacy Materials Into Dialects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
translate basic learning materials into local dialects to make
them better understood by adults and students who do not speak
Tagalog, the country's national language.
</P>
<P>
Rosario de Guzman, director of the Nonformal Education Bureau
of the Education Department, said Tuesday in a statement that the
materials will be translated into Waray, Hiligaynon, Bicol,
Maguindanao, Ilocano, Cebuano and Tausug.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine prototype learning materials (modules) for basic
literacy will be translated into these seven local dialects for
better understanding to meet the needs of the clientele, De Guzman
said.
</P>
<P>
These materials are used by the government in educating
out-of-school youths, unemployed adults and school leavers and
dropouts aged 15 and above.
</P>
<P>
The modules, developed in 1998 by nonformal education
curriculum writers, are considered as community-based because the
contents are based on the needs and problems of the target
communities, De Guzman explained.
</P>
<P>
The government, according to De Guzman, will invite language
experts from different regions to participate in the translation
of the learning modules.
</P>
<P>
De Guzman hoped that with the translation of the learning
materials into local dialects, basic quality education will become
more accessible to out-of-school-youths, illiterate adults and
school dropouts in remote areas around the country.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong stock market
fell sharply Tuesday in response to Wall Street's steep decline
last week, setting the tone for continued weakness in Hong Kong
when trading resumed after the long weekend.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stocks dropped sharply by 164.95 points, or 1.34
percent, to close at 12,134.13 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The turnover also fell to 7.482 billion HK dollars (about 959
million U.S. dollars), down 425 million HK dollars (about 54
million U.S. dollars), from 7.907 billion HK dollars (about 1.013
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sub-indices of finance, utilities, properties and commerce and
industry all went down by 1.54 percent, 2.13 percent, 1.4 percent
and 0.04 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong stocks opened down 62.56 points, or 0.51 percent,
at 12,236.52 points Tuesday.
</P>

Analysts believe that the Hang Seng Index mirrored the regional
downturn as interest fears from the United States persist. Hong
Kong blue chips are expected to face further pressure this week,
they said.
</P>

Traders said they would be watching U.S. consumer price data
for indications of interest rate movements amid fears of

BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) today received two million yuan (about 24,000 US dollars)
from the Proctor &AMP; Gamble (P &AMP; G) company of the United States to
set up a CAS-P &AMP; G Science and Education Award Fund.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to reward scientists who have done
outstanding work in scientific research and postgraduate education,
said Bai Chunli, vice president of the CAS, at the donation
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The fund will allow the CAS to provide 20 awards each year to
outstanding scientists in the fields of chemistry, physics, life
sciences, mechanical and engineering sciences, mathematics, and
computer science and technology, said Bai.
</P>
<P>
The CAS started its graduate program in 1955 and now has 104
units offering doctoral programs and 123 units with other graduate
programs. These programs cover almost all the major specialties in
the natural sciences as well as newly developed technologies.
</P>

"The CAS would never have gained such achievements in
postgraduate education without support and help from various
social circles," said Bai, "and we are exploring more
opportunities and ways to cooperate with large enterprises to
train talent."
</P>
<P>
P &AMP; G is one of the world's largest manufacturer of commodities

<HEADLINE>   Cambodia, U.N. Near Agreement on KR Tribunal: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen said Tuesday that Cambodia, the United Nations and the United
States are about to reach an agreement on a Khmer Rouge (KR)
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"I met with the U.S. ambassador Thursday and have agreed on the
four-point proposals put forward by the United States. So we will
soon reach an agreement with the U.N., especially with the U.S. on
the way to establish a Khmer Rouge tribunal," Hun Sen said at the
airport before his departure to Laos for four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"The trial will be carried out in the form of supermajority in
the court, which was put forward by the United States recently,"
Hun Sen said, adding, "Prince Ranariddh also expressed his welcome
to the proposal."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen rejected a U.N. proposal for a joint tribunal dominated
by U.N.-appointed judges and prosecutors, saying it would violate
Cambodia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The United States recently attempted to bridge the gap,
suggesting that Cambodia retain a majority of judges if it would
accept a plan requiring "supermajority" decisions -- meaning that
a majority of votes would be required for any verdict.
</P>
<P>
"So the trial of the Khmer Rouge is no longer a problem to all
of us including the U.N.," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the prime minister stressed that "what should
we do now is to speed up the drafting of the laws to try the
former Khmer Rouge leaders for their crimes committed during
1975-1979."

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Hold Talks on Mideast Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and visiting Chairman of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Yasser Arafat on Tuesday held talks in Alexandria on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in the Mediterranean port city, 220 kilometers
northwest of Cairo, earlier in the day from the Egyptian capital,
and went straight into the meeting, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to discuss the progress in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and implementation of the revised
Wye accord signed on September 5 in Egypt's Red Sea resort of
Sharm al-Sheikh, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, arrived in Cairo Monday
evening following visits to Japan, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia. He
said upon his arrival that he was to seek Mubarak's advice on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Setbacks emerged in the implementation of the peace deal after
Israel postponed twice in two weeks the opening of a safe passage
linking the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage that will enable the Palestinians move
relatively freely between the two separate Palestinian self-rule
areas, was regarded by the Palestinians as a mark of geographic
and demographic unity.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 permits were distributed Monday for the Palestinians
to use the transit route, but the two sides have yet to agree on
the opening date.
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Arafat discussed with Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa in Cairo the hurdles in the peace process and ways of
advancing the process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also briefed Moussa on the outcome of a meeting on
international aid for the PNA in Tokyo, Japan, which Arafat took
part in. The donor countries have reportedly promised to extend a
total aid of 500 million U.S. dollars to the PNA by the end of
this year.

exhibition on China opened here Tuesday to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, co-organized by the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia
and the University of Malaya, put on display more than 200
photographs comprising two parts -- A Glorious Journey of New
China, and History and Development of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The images on display reflect China of many dimensions: a China
that is modern after 50 years' achievements and yet proud of its
tradition and history; a China that is a major producer of
technology but also a proponent of traditional arts, culture and
sports; a China that is both agricultural and industrial; and a
China that is forward looking and a major player in international
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
It also shows the history and development of Macao which will
return to China next month.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony attended by some 200 people including
diplomats, business community elites, Vice Chancellor of the
University of Malaya Abdullah Sanusi Ahmad said the exhibition is
"definitely a positive step toward an elevation of understanding
regarding China and the role that she can play in bringing
together peoples of the world."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Guan Dengming also spoke on the
occasion, hoping that the exhibition will deepen the understanding
and exchange between the two peoples.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian NGO Helps Angola in Clearing Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, October 19 (xinhua) -- A Norwegian Non-government
Organization (NGO) has helped clear away landmines from five
million square meters of Angolan territory, according to the
representative of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Havard Hoksnes, head of a mission of the Norwegian People's Aid
(NPA), said in Luanda that his organization had defused 58,000
mines and explosive devices since 1995, which cost the NGO five to
six million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hoksnes said that in 1999, NPA has received a great support,
three million dollars, from donators of the organization,
essentially from northern European countries Denmark and Norway.
</P>
<P>
On the perspective of the work, Hoksnes said that his
organization will continue its hard work, but it depends on the
political-military situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he manifested his optimism on the financing, for a
major part of donators will continue to support the program on
mine clearance in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that almost all the field work in mine
clearance in the provinces of Kwanza-norte, Malanje and Uige are
conducted by 650 Angolan team members. In southern Angola, the NGO
has its branches in the provinces of Benguela, Huila, Cunene and
Namibe.
</P>
<P>
In Huila, NPA has delivered to local government a piece of
cultivatable field clear of landmines, with an area of 35,476
square meters, 28 kilometers to Lubango, the capital city of the
Huila Province.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Bank Urges to Curb Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe
has urged the government to adopt sustainable policies to control
the inflation, which has reached an all-time-high of 69.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government should implement radical and
innovative steps to meet its economic targets and achieve the
target inflationary rate of 30 percent before the end of the year,
the bank said in a bulletin released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is probably facing one of the greatest economic
challenges in its history," the commercial bank pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"With an economy weighed down by high inflation, high interest
rates, low growth and a growing balance of payment deficit, it is
apparent that measures must be taken urgently to restore and
stabilize economic fundamentals," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been primarily caused by high money supply growth
 emanating from domestic credit expansion, depreciation of the
Zimbabwean dollar, wage increases and increases in administered
prices, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank warned that reliance on the balance of payments
support funds would not offer a sustainable solution towards the
reduction in inflation to the envisaged single-digit levels.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the government has to follow a strict
stabilization program in order to meet the requirements of donor
funding organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the bank said maintaining donor confidence by
satisfying the majority of the IMF targets would bolster the
country's chances of recovery and lay the base for sustained
economic growth in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
It welcomed the recent steps that were taken by the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe, central bank of the country, to curb inflation
through tight monetary policies.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Tough Tasks Ahead for Pak Military-Led Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- In a dramatic change in
Pakistan's political scenario last week, the 31-month-old civilian
government collapsed all of a sudden and a military-led interim
setup has been formed to steer this trouble-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Nawaz Sharif, which came to power in
February 1997 with a tough mandate, was the fifth to have been
toppled in this politically turbulent country during the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government, ousted in a military coup last Tuesday
led by Chief of the Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf, has been
accused by the army of leaving behind an array of economic and
political problems.
</P>
<P>
As expected, Musharraf, who assumed the office of Pakistan's
chief executive last Friday, has announced the formation of a
National Security Council led by himself and comprising the three
service chiefs and experts on legal, finance, foreign and national
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that a daunting task is facing the new
military-led interim government to save the country from economic
bankruptcy and social disorder.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani people are apparently expecting much from the
army when they hail the coup leader's overthrow of the Sharif
government which they believe failed to offer them good
governance.
</P>
<P>
In his televised address to the nation Sunday, General
Musharraf, known as a modest and patriotic soldier, pledged to
build national morale, revive the economy and restore investors'
confidence, ensure law and order and exercise "swift and across
the board" accountability. "We will work louder than talk," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has not underestimated the problems when he said the
top priority of the new setup is to revive the economy. However,
it will be a hard nut for him to crack.
</P>
<P>
Owing to what Musharraf has described as bad governance,
volatile policies and "plundering and looting" of the governments
in the past decade, Pakistan today is practically insolvent and
more than ever dependent on international financial institutions
like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign debt has accumulated to as high as 33
billion U.S. dollars while its foreign currency reserves hover at
a level as low as 1 billion dollars which is only enough to afford
import bills of several weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to relieve the pains of the debt-ridden economy, the
deposed Sharif government had been asking the G-7 countries for
rescheduling its external debts and for more loans to keep it
afloat.
</P>
<P>
Media reports show that western donors and international
financial institutions now seem even more hesitant about lending
money to Pakistan under the present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Economists here are of the view that Pakistan will have to rely
more on itself and revolutionary steps are badly needed to
generate more revenue and put the economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has put the revival of economy, recovery of defaulted
loans and swift and across-the-board accountability top on his
agenda, a move which has been widely welcomed.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, the State Bank of Pakistan has announced the
freeze of those accounts of former Prime Minister Sharif, other
senior politicians in the toppled government and a number of
parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has ordered the loan defaulters and those who have
had their loans rescheduled or condoned to pay up in four weeks.
Otherwise, stern legal actions will be taken against them.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the army chief is determined to win the
hearts of the people through a swift, transparent and all-round
anti-corruption and anti-default campaign.
</P>
<P>
However, experts from the banking sector believe that it is a
herculean task for the military-led government to recover all
those loans.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that it would be a great relief to the
deteriorating economy even if half of the non-performing loans,
estimated to be more than 4 billion dollars, could be recovered.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that many of the loan defaulters, generally
politically influential, are out of the country and their assets
have been moved abroad.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, the new government is facing increasing
pressure from western countries, especially the United States,
that a representative government should be restored as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has made it clear that "the armed forces have no
intention to stay in charge any longer than absolutely necessary
to pave the way for democracy to flourish in Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
However, it may take no less than a couple of years to achieve
those objectives identified by the chief executive, which will
depend on the sincerity and determination of the new government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the Pakistani Army, which has been
playing a pivotal role in domestic politics since Pakistan's
inception in 1947, is always seen as "a reliable pillar" of this
South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
If the army can manage to bring a welcome change to the country
through eliminating corruption and activating the economy in a
short period of time, it will be in a better position to overcome
other difficulties and will be well prepared to hand over the
power to an elected civilian government.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Inject $130,000 in Congo Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government will soon
provide the first payment of five million Zimbabwean dollars
(130,000 U.S. dollars) in support for the implementation of the
cease-fire accord in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The financial contribution, together with an earlier pledge
from Belgium of three million Zimbabwean dollars (79,000 U.S.
dollars), would be considered in support of Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba's peace efforts in the DRC, the Belgian Embassy
in Harare said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a show of intention of the new Belgian Foreign Affairs
Minister Louis Michel to make Africa, and particularly the support
to the Lusaka peace process, a cornerstone of the Belgium's new
foreign policy," the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Committee is in charge of the implementation
of the cease-fire accord reached by parties concerned in Zambian
capital Lusaka in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The committee would investigate cease-fire violations and help
foster a spirit of trust and transparency in the implementation of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean troops, together with those from Angola and Namibia,
have been in the DRC since August last year assisting the
government of President Laurent Kabila to repel rebels allegedly
backed by Uganda and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Pak New Setup to Be Mainly Civilian: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the new setup
of Pakistan to be formed after last week's military coup will be
civilians, an army spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During a press briefing in Rawalpindi, Rashid Qureshi, director
general of the Inter Service Public Relations, said more
consultations are under way on the duration of the interim setup.
</P>
<P>
The army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, who has assumed the
office of Pakistan's chief executive, has announced the formation
of a six-member National Security Council (NSC) to steer the
country and a cabinet of ministers will be formed in a couple of
days to work under the guidance of the NSC.
</P>
<P>
The NSC comprises the navy chief, the air force chief and an
expert each of legal, financial, foreign and national affairs,
according to General Musharraf's speech to the nation on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman said the inquiries against deposed Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif have been started but no case has been filed
against him so far.
</P>
<P>
The inquiries are focusing on an alleged conspiracy to arrest
the army chief when his plane was refused landing at the Karachi
international airport last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The questions are being asked as to why the plane was not
allowed to land in Karachi, its due destination, who issued the
order to divert the plane and who implemented it, according to
Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the commercial plane which General
Mushrraf and other passengers were on board landed at the Karachi
International Airport with fuel enough for only seven minutes of
flying.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf dashed to Islamabad after landing in Karachi
and then announced the dismissal of the Nawaz Sharif government.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi said Sharif is well and is being well-treated. However,
he failed to mention his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said most of the former government ministers and
parliament leaders have been released but he didn't tell the
number.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon another issue, Qureshi said that "a large
portion" of Pakistan's troops has been withdrawn from the
international borders with India and that the whole process will
be completed in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf has declared unilateral military
de-escalation by ordering Pakistan's armed forces to withdraw from
the Pak-Indian border to the position in the recent past.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Accelerates After Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China's National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) said today that the Chinese economy has stopped
slowing down and will see a seven percent growth this year before
going further for a higher growth rate next year.
</P>
<P>
NBS figures show that China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew
seven percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, and the
growth rate was only 0.1 percent lower than in the second. In
contrast, the growth rate plummeted 1.2 percentage points from 8.3
percent in the first quarter to 7.1 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
The GDP amounted to 5,680 billion yuan for the first nine
months of the year, an increase of 7.4 percent year on year,
according to Qiu Xiaohua, NBS deputy director.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said, however, "the shrinking investment growth and
persistent decline of retail prices reflected not only the current
problem of inadequate demand within the market, but also the need
to resolve deep rooted contradictions as well."
</P>
<P>
Fixed assets investment for the first three quarters increased
8.1 percent year on year to 1,176.4 billion yuan, but the figure
for the third quarter alone showed a zero growth rate on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
Qiu attributed the growth decline for the third quarter to the
sharp investment increase recorded in the same period last year
when the government began to boost investment in infrastructure
with the sum of 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The NBS deputy director was confident that investment growth
will bounce back in the forth quarter and provide enough impetus
for the economy to grow at seven percent as expected officially
for the year.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the first nine months of the year, the retail
price index (RPI) and consumer price index (CPI) dropped by three
percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, prices began to show signs of improving in July.
Retail prices grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in both August
and September. Total retail sales for the nine-month period jumped
6.3 percent to 2,214.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The price rebound was coupled by a straight monthly CPI
increase of one percent and two percent in August and September
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Qiu predicted that the decline of retail prices over the past
two years will soon end. However, he refused to elaborate on the
exact time.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said that large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises (
SOEs) have greatly improved their performance so far this year.
Although lose-incurring SOEs still accounted for 51.6 percent of
all SOEs in the country in the January-August period, their total
profits increased by 2.3 times the figure one year earlier. Total
losses of the SOEs were also 16.1 percent less than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to him, more than 7,900 SOEs were closed down, merged
or turned to private or collective ownership from January to
August, when 1,226 large and medium-sized SOEs turned their losses
into profits.

publish them.

<P>
Ma'ariv:

Officials with the California Department of Forestry (CDF) said
that the Shasta County fire, which forced the weekend evacuation
of some 2,000 people from four towns north of Redding, was 80
percent contained Monday and was expected to be fully under
control by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although higher-than-average temperatures and low humidity were
expected for the next few days, decreasing winds have aided
firefighters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which consumed almost 26,000 acres and destroyed as
many as 100 homes, was sparked early Saturday, probably by embers
from a campfire, officials said. Damage was estimated at about 6
million dollars, although that could rise.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in northern California, wildfires continued to burn --
fueled by extremely dry vegetation and abetted by difficult
terrain that made firefighting difficult.
</P>
<P>
In Yolo County, northwest of Sacramento, a quick-growing fire
consumed more than 42,000 acres near the vacation resort area of
Lake Berryessa. Sunday night, that fire was only about 5 percent
contained, although officials said they hoped to have better
control of it by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Trinity County, a fire that began two months ago burned 111,
000 acres. Along California's central coast, meanwhile, two fires
in the Los Padres National Forest continued to burn after
scorching more than 85,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said smoke from the wildfires drifted across northern
California, making for hazy skies as far south as San Francisco,
about 200 miles away.
</P>
<P>
October is traditionally a dangerous month for fire in northern
California, where winds, lightning and dry conditions can combine
to create dangerous conflagrations. This week was the eighth
anniversary of the devastating Oakland Hills fire of 1991 that
killed 25 people, destroyed 3,000 homes and caused 1.5 billion
dollars in damage.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Revised Upward for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research (MIER) has revised its estimate of the country's
real gross domestic product (GDP) upward to 3.6 percent from its
earlier projection of 1.8 percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
The private think-tank has revised its forecast of the
Malaysian economy from 4.3 percent to 4.5 percent on expectation
of further improvement in the private sector, low interest rates,
a rise in confidence and steady export performance.
</P>
<P>
The revision was made in view of improving economic indicators,
especially the external sector, the think-tank said in its
Malaysian Economic Outlook for 1999-2000 (third quarter 1999
update).
</P>
<P>
MIER estimated that the GDP would register a growth of 5.8
percent in the second half of 1999 against a 1.4-percent growth
for the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
MIER said it expected private consumption to grow at a moderate
rate of 2.7 percent, public consumption at 8.4 percent and the
inflation rate to be low at 2.8 percent for the second half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
MIER projected inflationary pressure to remain subdued with the
continued presence of excess capacity and cautious consumer stance
in the wake of recovering from a recession.
</P>
<P>
Export contributions to GDP would continue to be significant in
1999 with a share of around 14.4 percent, said the institute.
</P>
<P>
Real export of goods and services is projected to expand by
11.5 percent, mainly on account of better demand for electronic
products, and the revival in domestic demand and higher export
activities would push real imports to grow by 12 percent, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The think-tank projected that in the balance of payment
accounts, the merchandise balance would reach 72.3 billion ringgit
(19.026 billion U.S. dollars), higher than the 69.3 billion
ringgit (18.236 billion dollars) in 1998. Meanwhile, the services
balance was predicted to register a deficit of 26.9 billion
ringgit (7.078 billion dollars) on higher import-related
activities. Thus the current account balance would be lifted to
38.3 billion ringgit (10.078 billion dollars) from the 36.1
billion ringgit (9.5 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the year 2000 outlook, MIER forecast the private consumption
 to grow by 7.9 percent, public consumption by 7.4 percent and
inflation to rise moderately to 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the year 2000, the current account was projected at a
surplus of 22.5 billion ringgit (5.921 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Seoul Proposes Establishment of Inter-Korean Economic Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung Tuesday proposed the establishment of inter-Korean economic
confederation to seek people's development and welfare on the
Korean peninsula
</P>
<P>
Such confederation will promote South-North economic
cooperation, Kim said in his state address to the National
Assembly or parliament read by Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
"Inter-Korean economic cooperation can flourish based on the
principle of separating politics from economy," said President Kim.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his government will further endeavor to
restore inter-Korean governmental talks, especially high-level
meetings, so as to solve mutually concerned issues.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean head of state also said it is necessary to
revise the South Korean National Security Law which has already
failed to reflect reality between Seoul and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is designed to further substantiate inter-Korean
ties by supporting more economic exchange and cooperation and
expanding humanitarian assistance to Pyongyang which could later
lead to improvement in governmental relationship, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
They said increasing South Korean businesses with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea will help build mutual
confidence and enable Pyongyang to be more dependent on Seoul,
eventually making governmental talks inevitable.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kuwait in War Against Drugs, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has launched an
unprecedented war against drugs and prostitution since late
August, when the government began crackdowns on these "social
degradation."
</P>
<P>
In a number of nation-wide operations in late August, security
staff from the Interior Ministry's Criminal Investigation
Department (CID) arrested over 100 women of various nationalities
for alleged involvement in "immoral activities."
</P>
<P>
The prostitutes were caught at private bachelor apartments in
residential areas near Kuwait City, where they usually "kill time
and have fun," according to government sources, quoted by local
media.
</P>
<P>
Those who were found being involved in prostitution were or
will be deported from Kuwait, an Islamic state that bans alcohol,
some concerts and nightclubs that are popular in other parts of
the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CID forces, in their latest intensive operations
earlier October, raided 50 houses around the country as part of
the swoop on drug traffickers, dealers and addicts.
</P>
<P>
Thirty kilograms of hashish, over four kilograms of heroin, a
bulk of opium and pills were reportedly seized during the raids.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Social Affairs Abdul Al-Wazzan inaugurated last
week a 10-day charitable activity aimed at "combating narcotics
and drawing public awareness of their fatal consequences."
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Mohamed Khalid Al-Sabah said last week the
campaign against drugs will continue until the problem is uprooted.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, like other oil-rich Gulf Arab countries, is regarded
as a lucrative market for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Interior Ministry statistics showed that around 900
drug-related cases were convicted in the past two years, much
higher than in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by a British specialists' team at
Kuwait's Psychological Disease Hospital, there may be 50,000 drug
addicts in Kuwait, a country with a population of 2.2 million, and
the situation is likely to get worse.
</P>
<P>
A local anti-drug committee warned that youth are most
frequently targeted, because they are "less aware of the risks of
drug addiction."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Start Legal Proceedings to Retrieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is to
start legal proceedings to retrieve the over two billion U.S.
dollars stashed in Swiss banks by late Head of State General Sani
Abacha and his family, Vice - President Atiku Abubakar said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such proceedings would be concluded within the deadline of
three months given by the Swiss government, the New Nigerian
newspaper Tuesday quoted Atiku as saying.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president called on Nigeria's National Assembly
(parliament) to step up its approving process on an
anti-corruption law submitted by President Olusegun Obasanjo this
June so that the government can have solid legal basis in
conducting certain investigations
</P>
<P>
He assured that all money recovered by government would be put
into a federation account for sharing between federal, state, and
local governments.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the present regime is able to share more
money than before because of its anti-corruption crusade, which
enables it to block people from looting more government treasure.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Switzerland froze the bank accounts held by
Abacha and his family on a temporary basis for the Nigerian
government to convince legally that the money was looted from the
state assets.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria government is also working closely with Britain and
the United Sates in locating other loots in European and North
American countries, Atiku added.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Mines and
Metals Eshaq Jahangiri said here on Tuesday that Iran is
determined to seek foreign investments to boost the country's
mining and metal sector.
</P>
<P>
Jahangiri told the First Seminar on International Investments
in Mining and Metal Sector that his ministry will offer over 100
mining and industrial projects and 15 exploration projects to
foreign and domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
He said the total investments for the projects will exceed 10
billion U.S. dollars, adding that among the mining and industrial
projects, 25 are related to steel, 12 to copper, 13 to aluminum, 7
to lead and zinc, 9 to ferroalloy and 40 to mining and chemical
industries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he believes that the development of mining
and metal sector will help the country boost non-oil exports and
reduce dependence on oil incomes.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Mines and Metals for Economic and
International Affairs Mohammad Javad Assemipour said last week
that contracts for four projects will be signed at the seminar
and six unfinished projects will also be presented to domestic
and international investors.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 50 foreign and 100 domestic companies are
participating the two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the country's law, international companies
can invest up to 100 percent of the projects' value, Assemipour
said, but it is expected that most international companies will
enter into joint venture with domestic firms with shares standing
at 30-50 percent of total investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines-based
International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) said Tuesday that it
has appointed a leading Chinese scientist to head its rice
research efforts.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, the IRRI said Dr. Ren Wang, a former vice
president of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS),
will officially become the IRRI's new deputy director general for
research in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Cantrell, director general of the IRRI, said the
appointment will strengthen ties between the IRRI and China and
provide the institute's research efforts with an important boost
at the start of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Formal links between the IRRI and China were first established
in 1982 with the CAAS as the lead agency. The relationship was
strengthened in November 1997 when the China-IRRI Liaison Office
was formally set up in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ren Wang was appointed vice president of the CAAS in
November 1994, where he was responsible for strategic planning,
priority setting and development of major agricultural research
programs.
</P>
<P>
The IRRI, with its headquarters in the Philippines and offices
in 11 other countries, is the world's leading international rice
research and training center aimed at increasing rice production
worldwide while preserving natural resources.

<HEADLINE> China Sends Envoy to Nyerere's Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy from the
Chinese government arrived here Tuesday morning, the first foreign
delegation to attend the state funeral for late Tanzanian founding
president Julius Nyerere Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Dar es Salaam International Airport,
Chinese Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong told reporters
that all the Chinese people shared the grief of Nyerere's death
with their Tanzanian brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
"Nyerere is an old friend of China and he had kept a very deep
friendship with the Chinese leaders of three generations," Huang
told a senior official from the Tanzanian Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Cyprian Majengo, Director of the Asia and Australia
 Department, Huang said the Chinese government believes that the
Sino- Tanzanian friendship will be further developed under the
leadership of President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
Majengo appreciated China's participation of the funeral,
saying that the first arrival of any foreign delegations showed a
long-standing friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that as one of the founders of the Tanzanian-Chinese
friendly relations, the late Father of the Nation Nyerere had paid
great attention to their smooth development.
</P>
<P>
"He also paid great attention to learning from China in all
fields of construction," Majengo said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry has announced that so far 40
countries have confirmed to attend the state funeral ceremony due
in the National Stadium Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All the foreign dignitaries, including 18 heads of state, will
pay their last respects to the remains of Nyerere on Thursday
morning before it is flown to his home town Butiama, a small
village near Lake Victoria, for burial Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who struggled with leukemia in a London hospital for
three weeks, died on October 14 at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
His remains were flown to Dar es Salaam by a Tanzanian plane
Monday and hundreds of thousands of Tanzanians gathered along the
procession route as his coffin passed to his residence.
</P>
<P>
Born on April 13, 1922, Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to win
an independence from British colonial rule in 1961. He also
united Tanganyika and Zanzibar as one republic in 1964 and became
its first president until he retired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who preferred to be called Mwalimu in Kiswahili or
teacher in English, has been a prominent leader on many
Pan-African issues.
</P>
<P>
He has successfully assembled the warring factions of Burundi
to start a tortuous peace process.
</P>
<P>
Since his death, condolences have poured in from every corner
of the world, highly praising his contribution to the independence
and development of Tanzania as well as the whole Africa.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Growth to Exceed 7 Percent: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China's gross domestic
product (GDP) will meet the growth target of 7 percent in 1999,
senior Chinese officials attending the Eighth East Asia Economic
Summit here said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both Wang Chunzheng, vice-minister of China's State Development
and Planning Commission, and Wang Wanbin, vice-minister of the
State Economic and Trade Commission, gave this message in a
plenary session of the meeting of the World Economic Forum, which
opened Monday and will end Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They said that in 1999 the Chinese government continued to
pursue a policy of stimulating domestic demand and exerted itself
to push forward various reforms steadily.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the national economy has maintained the momentum
of rapid growth, the economic operation has been generally healthy
and stable, and the structure adjustment has made great progress,
they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that China's GDP increased by 7.6 percent for the
first half of this year, 0.6 percentage points higher than the
same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
China's economy is estimated to grow by more than 7 percent in
the whole year, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics for the first eight months this
year, the economic returns of enterprises were much better and the
value-added volume of industry increased by 9.4 percent, Wang
Wanbin said.
</P>
<P>
The economic returns of most trades have improved obviously,
financial revenue has also expanded by a big margin, and foreign
trade grew by 7.3 percent, with import growing by 17.5 percent,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that sustained, stable and healthy economic
development has facilitated China's reforms, opening-up and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
China gives a full play to both the market mechanism and
macro-control, continuously adjusting the economy timely and
properly through economic, legal and necessary administrative
approaches, he added.
</P>
<P>
In their respective speeches delivered on the second day of the
summit, the two Chinese officials also reviewed the great progress
and substantial achievements China has made in the past 20 years
since its opening-up to the outside world in the late 1970s. They
said the annual growth rate of China's GDP hit 10.8 percent in the
period.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which brings together some 800 business, political
and intellectual leaders from the region and other parts of the
world, is organized by the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert Find New Ways to Eliminate Remains of Pesticide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A new technique to eliminate
pesticide remains by use of microbes was recently approved by
safety and health authorities. This new technique means farm
products will be protected effectively from harmful pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The poisonous remains will be degraded by enzymes and excreted
by microbes, which finally become water and carbon dioxide. When
the degradation materials are spread directly in the field or on
leaves, they can get rid of 80 percent of the remains.
</P>
<P>
This new technique was developed by Prof. Li Shunpeng at
Nanjing University of Agriculture, who has been researching and
promoting the technique for four years.
</P>
<P>
With growing consumption of pesticides in the world, more and
more pesticide remains are increasingly found in farm produce
becoming a menace to the environment and people's health.
Statistics show that the average annual dosage of pesticide
reaches an average of 0.7 kg per hectare, and that 80 percent of
pesticides remain in roots, stalks and leaves.
</P>
<P>
The technique has so far been used in some 6,700 hectares of
fields in the outskirts of Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
In a recent test held by the State Environmental Protection
Administration, experts consider the technique feasible and that
it can be used in large fields.
</P>
<P>
In furthering his research, Prof. Li will improve the
degradation process and try to eliminate all pesticide remains.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Techniques Promote Apple Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 19 (Xinhua)-- Modern planting techniques applied
extensively in the apple orchards in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province have scored great results in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jianming, an owner of one apple orchard in Baishui county
told reporters that in Shaanxi Province most farmers are using
many long pipes to convey water directly to the root of trees,
thus saving 80 percent of water.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping each apple with a small plastic bag is another way to
keep the fruit away from pollution, insect pests, plant diseases
and bad weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Xuming, another apple orchard owner, farmers
have planted special kinds of grasses around the trees to keep
water inside the earth as well as to provide organic fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "home of apples", Baishui county is an ideal place
to grow apples because of its ample sunlight and relatively wide
differences in temperature during the day and night.
</P>
<P>
Continuous efforts in promoting the use of agricultural
techniques has made Shaanxi the second largest apple planting base
in China. The province has an annual output of 3.4 million tons,
accounting for one fifths of the country's total output.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Five cities in the United
States have reached 50 percent Internet penetration among the
adult population, a U.S. local market consumer ratings firm
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Washington D.C. ranks number one with almost 60 percent of the
adult population online, followed by Francisco, Austin, Seattle
and Salt Lake City, according to a study by Scarborough Research.
</P>
<P>
The firm measured Internet usage over a one-year period both at
home and at work for these findings. More than 170,000 interviews
from adults were conducted in 64 leading U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
The ratings firm said that reaching the 50 percent threshold is
a significant milestone for the Internet as it continues to mature
into a mainstream medium.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the firm added, differences in Internet usage on a
local market level are noteworthy, indicating that technological
innovation is impacted by the interplay of local demographic,
cultural, retail and media dynamics. To understand both cause and
effect, one must telescope down to the local market -- the venue
in which consumers live, work, recreate, shop and are informed and
entertained.
</P>
<P>
The overall 64-market average Internet penetration is currently
43.7 percent. Major cities at or above the average include Los
Angeles, Boston, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia. On the low
end for Internet usage are smaller cities.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Armed Forces Urged not to Involve in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister
Admiral Ali Shamkhani on Monday called on the country's armed
forces not to involve in the political factions, which have run
into a new round of heated struggles.
</P>
<P>
Preventing the armed forces from interference in political
factions and groupings will guarantee dignity and power of the
armed forces, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as
saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud to preserve the credit and
power of the armed forces in the society and this will be
materialized through deterring the armed forces from interfering
in political affairs, " Shamkhani said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the establishment of constant security
depends on the independence of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the hard-line conservatives and the moderate
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami have spiraled up
recently after the Iranian Special Cleric Court decided to bring
Abdollah Nouri, a famous reformist and close ally of Khatami, to
trial on charges of insulting late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, former interior minister ousted by the conservative
Majlis in June last year, rejected the charges and vowed to stand
up to any challenges.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion here believed that the trial or possible
conviction against Nouri will provide the grounds for his
disqualification from the next Majlis elections slated on
February 18, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a top vote-winner in the first local council polling
last February, recently stepped down from his post as chairman of
Tehran City Council to run for the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Nouri might be elected the Majlis
speaker if the reformist moderates win the parliamentary polling.

MOGADISHU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has so far killed 45
people in Somalia's northeastern port town of Bossaso in the past
three months.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Tuesday indicate that the local
authorities in Puntland have declared an outbreak of cholera
disease in and around the main town of Bossaso.

registered in the hospital since mid-August this year.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities are complaining about insufficient
response from the international aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
Health workers said the rate of people falling for cholera is
growing since the rainy season has already begun around Bossaso
and in Mudug and Nurgal regions.
</P>
<P>
Floods from the mountains south of Bossaso have already
seriously affected both the life and sanitation of the town.
</P>
<P>
The floods from a nearby stream have reached the town early
Monday morning, hitting the marketplace and the residential places
of the town.

Hundreds of people have come out of their houses after the
floods have washed away their food and belongings in their houses
and business places, demanding help from the local government.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities are expressing concern that these rains
may worsen the humanitarian situation there.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States has urged
Turkey to revive its privatization program, reform its
agricultural subsidy system and improve its tax collection.
</P>
<P>
The English-language Daily News quoted on Tuesday the document
issued by the U.S. Embassy in Ankara as saying that the U.S. is
urging the Turkish government to swiftly carry out further reforms
that would pave the way for a stand-by agreement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that the U.S. administration's calls
for further reform are in line with the IMF's conditions for a
stand-by accord.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. apparently supports an IMF agreement but at the same
time is making it clear that Turkey must tackle some further
reforms," said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Washington expects Ankara and the IMF to reach an accord on a
stand-by loan this autumn, said the document.
</P>
<P>
An IMF delegation is scheduled to arrive in Turkey in the near
future to discuss the details of the stand-by agreement.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Should Withdraw From Congo: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A commentary of the New Vision
newspaper Tuesday urged the Ugandan government to withdraw its
troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
There should be no overwhelming obstacle to Ugandan withdrawal,
 according to the long commentary carried by the
government-sponsored newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) is supposed to pull
out of Congo in the coming months. The United Nations has started
mobilizing a peace- keeping force for the Congo," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the military people, especially the top
commanders, not to get involved in business there.
</P>
<P>
"Even if they have been trading legitimately, it still
compromises the perspective and image of the UPDF. Nothing
subjective should be allowed to get in the way of withdrawal," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops to the Congo reportedly for security reasons
soon after the civil war broke out in DRC capital Kinshasa in
early August last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Kinshasa has been accusing Uganda of invading a
sovereign country, a charge denied by Kampala from the very
beginning.
</P>
<P>
The parties concerned signed a Lusaka cease-fire agreement on
July 10 and the Joint Military Commission, which is in charge of
the implementation of the peace accord, convened here last week to
make preparations for the U. N. peace-keeping mission.

BEIRUT, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese business leader has
denied an alleged meeting between Lebanese and Israeli business
groups in Cairo last week, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Adnan Kassar, head of the Beirut Chamber of Commerce, issued
Monday a statement with other chambers of commerce in Lebanon,
vehemently denying the claims by U.S. Secretary of Commerce
William Daley that Lebanese and Israeli businessmen have held
talks in the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
He said the chamber has never received any invitation to
attend such a meeting with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"This report is completely false. Our chamber was not aware of
a planned meeting with Israeli businessmen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kassar stressed that the Lebanese delegation, led by Economy
Minister Nasser Saidi, went to Cairo for talks with Egyptian
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Lebanese delegation traveled to Cairo on
Saturday, three days behind the alleged meeting mentioned by Daley.

Kassar asserted that the chamber is committed to the political
line of the Lebanese government.

<HEADLINE> Manila Asks Employers to Follow Wage Hike Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government urged
employers Tuesday to comply with the new pay rate orders issued by
the regional wage boards, saying they already had their chance to
shape the new adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
that employers were given representation in the wage boards, three
of which have come out with their respective orders.
</P>
<P>
Last week, minimum wage earners in the Philippine capital of
Manila were given a daily pay hike of 25.5 pesos (0.64 U.S.
dollars), which will come into effect on December 29, by the
Regional Tripartite Wage and Productivity Board.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, minimum wage earners in the Cagayan Valley region
and Southern Mindanao region were also granted a pay hike ranging
from 10 to 13.5 pesos (0.25 to 0.34 dollars).
</P>
<P>
For his part, Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma of the Department
of Labor and Employment (DOLE) dismissed reports that 80 percent
of the employers have sought exemption from wage hikes.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said his office has yet to receive any petition for
exemption as the wage adjustments would take effect at the end of
this month at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
In a separate radio interview, he added that while petitions
for exemptions would be expected, experience has shown that only a
few were granted this concession.
</P>
<P>
"During the last wage order, 1,400 filed petitions for
exemptions. But only 30 percent of the petitions were granted. The
rest were disapproved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said the DOLE had mobilized task forces to go after
employers nationwide who violate the minimum wage law.
</P>
<P>
Employers have reportedly warned that they may not be able to
grant the wage hike, saying they may have to lay off some
employees.

<HEADLINE> Motion Barring Ministers From Parliament Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A motion which is aimed at
barring ministers from being members of parliament (MPs) at the
same time has gained support in the country's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
A total of 111 MPs have registered their support for the
popular motion submitted by Onapito Ekomoloit and seconded by
former army commander Mugisha Muntu, the Monitor daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the list had 111 names, the number could be much more
than that, Ekomoloit was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The motion suggests, among other things, that once a MP is
appointed a minister, his/her constituency should replace him/her
immediately. This separation of power can help ensure
transparency, checks and balances of organs of state.
</P>
<P>
The motion has gained support because it cuts across the
political arena and it is a constitutional matter with less
politics in it, Ekomoloit said.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of the motion have said the the legislature has
been robbed of serious legislators who keep quiet immediately
after they are appointed ministers.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs, however, expressed their worries over the motion,
saying that the principle is not wrong, but may open the flood
gates to the constitutional amendment demands.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's parliament has a total of 276 members, of which 60 are
front benchers.

NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has called for peaceful coexistence among Maasai and
ethnic Somalis in Rift Valley Province in a bid to stamp out
banditry in the area.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Saitoti as saying that he
was worried about the current hostilities between the two
communities in southern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The tension was triggered off by a spate of robberies, which
local Maasais have accused alien Somali bandits of perpetrating
and local Somali traders of being involved in.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has prompted the Somali traders to flee the area
and take refuge in a mosque, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti Monday called on the two communities to remain calm and
pledged to make any effort to crack down on the bandits.
</P>
<P>
He also asked for cooperation from the communities in helping
the government to wipe out the bandits, noting that more security
personnel would be dispatched to the area.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Has No Plan to Buy Arms From Israel: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has no intention to buy
arms from Israel and will continue to rely on the United States
and other Western countries as the traditional source of weapons,
the semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's current defense budget does not include any
allocation for the purchase of weapons from Israel, and it's
premature to talk about arms purchase from the Jewish state, the
paper quoted an unnamed Jordanian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Western countries are the major source of weapons
to the kingdom and Israel is not on the agenda, at least for the
short run, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on reports from Israel that Jordan has
submitted a request to purchase light arms and ammunition from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Haaretz daily newspaper said on Monday that the
Israeli defense ministry has given the go-ahead to arms
manufacturers to deal with Jordan in terms of light arms and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
"Israelis like to anticipate things that might or might not
take place, but such things might happen in the future," said the
Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
Due to psychological, social and other reasons, Jordan will not
buy weapons from Israel for now, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994, but it
apparently will take time to eliminate decades of rivalries and
suspicion between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> 102-Year-Old New Zealander Enjoys Meal-Delivering Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Max Bishop, a 102-year-old
man living in Christchurch, the biggest city on New Zealand's
South Island, is still enjoying his meal-delivering job.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Tuesday that
Bishop enjoys the irony of delivering meals on wheels to people 20
years his junior.
</P>
<P>
Max Bishop, who has one leg, does the navigating while close
friend Ross McPherson, another old man, drives the car on their
weekly outing.
</P>
<P>
He enjoys seeing people and "getting out into the beautiful
world," NZPA said, adding he is feeling "frisky" after turning 102
and intends to go on delivering meals as long as he is able to.
</P>
<P>
The pair enjoy finding the homes for deliveries and admit
occasionally losing their way, NZPA said.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the meal is slightly late. But we always have a
laugh along the way," Bishop was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
McPherson said Bishop has "a mind like a steel trap" when it
comes to his school days in India during World War One, and his
long romance with his wife, Margaret, who died in 1991.

<HEADLINE> IT Vendors in Malaysia Urged to Outsource Locally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Energy,
Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie Tuesday urged
information technology (IT) vendors and service providers to
consider the local outsourcing market seriously because of its
high growth potential.
</P>
<P>
"In Malaysia, IT outsourcing is considered still in its infancy
as most companies are unclear on the proper mechanism to be
utilized as well as the type of business to be outsourced," the
minister said in his keynote address at the National Outsourcing
Conference organized by the Asian Strategy and Leadership
Institute (ASLI) here.
</P>
<P>
He said the segment is expected to pick up over the next few
years as more companies realize that outsourcing could assist in
maximizing efficiency, trimming costs and sharpening
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Outsourcing in Malaysia is expected to be worth 500 million
ringgit (131.578 million U.S. dollars) in three years time against
25 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Outsourcing in simple term means buying services from external
providers and key services in demand include data center
management; disaster recovery; systems integration and
implementation; hardware and software maintenance; desktop
management; and applications maintenance.
</P>
<P>
However, Leo Moggie warned that while the future augured well
for the industry, it is unwise to outsource a process of service
that is undefined.

<HEADLINE> KLSE Among Top Performing Bourses in Asia: Deputy Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange (KLSE) is among the top performing bourses in Asia
since the economic crisis hit the region, Deputy Finance Minister
Wong See Wah said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE's recovery has been very encouraging with its
Composite Index recording a 174.5 percent jump from a low of 262.7
points on September 1, 1998 to 721.18 points on October 8, 1999,
he said in the Parliament here.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the KLSE's recovery was similar to that of the Seoul
bourse which recorded a 178.5 percent rise in the same period,
while as the Bangkok Stock Exchange rose 82 percent from 211
points to 385 points and the Jakarta bourse recorded a 74.3
percent rise from 325.85 points to 567.92 points.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE's market capitalization too has risen to 502.26
billion ringgit (about 132.173 billion U.S. dollars) as at October
8 of this year from 181.5 billion ringgit (about 47.763 billion
U.S. dollars) on September 1, 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wong said prospects for the KLSE to rise further are good as
new indicators point to a strengthening in market sentiment.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Intelligence Underwater Robot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China has developed an
intelligence underwater robot to replace humans in carrying out
some dangerous work in the sea.
</P>
<P>
The robot is jointly developed by the Harbin Engineering
University, the Central China Engineering University and the China
State Shipbuilding Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Trials of the robot have been completed on land and will soon
be carried out in the sea. Professor Xu Yuru of the Harbin
Engineering University said the developing process of the robot is
running quit smoothly. Xu and his fellow researchers are very
confident of its application in the early years of the next
century. Xu added that the intelligence technology of the robot is
close to that of international standards.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence underwater robot is made to accomplish risky
and difficult tasks that humans are unable to carry out or do
independently such as deep-sea exploration, sea-bed reconnaissance
and obstacle-clearer in water.
</P>
<P>
The robot depends on a visual system composed of a sound-
imaging system and glimmer camera to recognize surroundings within
several hundred meters. This visual system then sends information
to the controlled computer which will direct the robot to do
specific work.
</P>
<P>
The robot is also equipped with a bump-avoiding system which
can help the machine to change its direction anytime when it meet
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Xu concluded that "the battery-powered robot has an advanced
navigation system and optical-fiber cable communication network.
It is small but can sail a long distance and for a long time. In a
few years' time, the robot will be operational and will be greatly
improved with the development of new technology."

<HEADLINE> Effective Sino-US Inter-Parliamentary Channel Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The visit of a Chinese
congressional delegation to the United States has led to the
activation of an inter-parliamentary communication channel between
the two countries, the delegation's head said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, member of the Standing Committee and chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress (NPC), made the remark at a press conference while
summing up the delegation's five-day visit to Capitol Hill, which
ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first visit by the NPC in 10 years at the
invitation of the U.S. Congress, and the face-to-face dialogue was
fruitful," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives recently set up a U.S.-
Chinese Inter-Parliamentary Exchange Group composed of seven
Democrats and eight Republicans, which held four rounds of
discussions with the Chinese delegation, covering bilateral
relations, trade, regional security and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said the U.S. side has accepted an invitation by the NPC
to visit China next year.
</P>
<P>
A lack of communication often results in misunderstanding,
while a regular exchange between top legislative bodies can play a
good role in enhancing mutual understanding and expanding
cooperation, Zeng noted.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Posts Over 7 Mln Dollars at Gems Emporium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 7.009 million U.S.
dollars worth of locally-produced gems, jade, pearls and jewelry
were sold through competitive bidding or tender at the 8th
Mid-Year Myanmar Gems Emporium which ended here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The week-long state-sponsored emporium, which began on last
Tuesday, attracted more than 500 gems merchants of 112 companies
from 11 countries and regions, mostly from China's Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's mid-year gems emporiums have been held every year
since 1992 for sales promotion as a supplement to the annual
emporiums held since 1964.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has earned 272
million dollars from the last 36 annual and seven mid-year gems
emporiums.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire in
the world, is striving to create a systematic gem market in line
with its market-oriented economic system introduced in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
While permitting the local private sector to mine and process
gems in the country, the government has also set up joint ventures
with companies from Thailand, Malaysia and Israel for gems
extraction and processing.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, Myanmar's gems emporiums were
highlighted by the sale of gems and jewelry produced by the
Myanmar VES Ltd., a joint venture between the state-run Myanmar
Gems Enterprise and the VES Group Co. of Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Urban Unemployment Hits Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's urban areas have
registered the highest unemployment rates in the last four years,
the latest issue of local newspaper Vietnam Investment Review
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, Invalids
and Social Affairs (MoLISA), unemployment rates in urban areas
jumped by an average 16 percent each year between 1996 and 1999,
adding roughly 74,000 people to the unemployment list annually.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that Hanoi recorded the highest unemployment
rate of more than 10 percent, followed by Quang Ninh with 9.3
percent, Ho Chi Minh City with 7.04 percent and Dong Nai with 5.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The total number of unemployed people in urban areas increased
to nearly 615,000 in 1999 from 511,000 in 1998, 427,000 in 1997
and 394,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The figures show unemployment rates in 1999 have increased
20.2 percent against 1998 and are the highest levels so far," said
an official from MoLISA, adding that the unemployment rates for
young people aged from 15 to 24 were much higher than that for
older people.
</P>
<P>
"The decrease in foreign investment inflows, a lack of markets
for domestic products and an increase in smuggling are among the
main reasons for this problem," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's workforce, which includes men from 15 to 60 years old
and women from 15 to 55 years old, grew from 35.8 million people
in 1996 to 36.3 million in 1997 and 37.4 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the national census put the country's
population at 76.4 million.

<HEADLINE> CA Cooperates With IBM to Market E-business Solutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Computer Associate
International Inc. on Monday announced a joint effort with the
International Business Machines Corp. to market mission-critical e-
business solutions for companies for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
"This latest collaboration with IBM bolsters our ability to
deliver the proven architectures and solutions our clients need to
conduct business-critical electronic commerce," said CA Chairman
and CEO Charles Wang. "By aligning our 'go-to-market' delivery
models, we will be able to work closely with our mutual channel
partners to bring the most advanced e-business solutions to the
rapidly growing small and middle marketplace."
</P>
<P>
This is the latest major cooperation between CA and IBM in
information technologies for more than 20 years. As the world
leader in mission-critical business computing, CA provides
software, support and integration services in more than 100
countries while IBM, the world's largest information technology
company, creates and manufactures computer systems, software,
networking systems, storage devices and microelectronics.
</P>
<P>
The announcement maximizes the impact of clients' investments
in their e-business resources by aligning the respective pricing
models for CA software licensed in conjunction with IBM's
Multiprice e-business servers in efforts to help small and medium-
sized enterprises add new workloads and reduce the cost of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
In their collaboration, CA and IBM also established a new
distribution plan designed to provide immediate benefits for
mutual clients of the two companies. They intend to align their
respective distribution and licensing approaches that will allow
them to create custom packages, containing interchangeable and
interoperable components, and each company will certify and pre-
test the packaged components before on-site implementation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Organ to Reconsider Olympics Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Disappointing play by
Indonesian shuttlers in the Danish Open in Denmark last week has
caused some worry at the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI),
the Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The PBSI official in charge of athlete development Christian
Hadinata said that due to the poor results in Denmark, the
association would have difficulty setting its targets for the
Olympics in Sydney next year.
</P>
<P>
"We expected them to reach the finals and improve their world
rankings. We'll have difficulty predicting their future
performances due to their inconsistent play in tournaments. Their
up-and-down form is really shocking. Although we have some time,
it's difficult to set a target with their inconsistent form," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The women's doubles team of Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban
were the only Indonesians to reach the semi-finals of the four-
star tournament.
</P>
<P>
Christian focused on the poor form of Indonesia Open champion
Lidya Djaelawidjaja, who crashed out in the first round in Denmark
to qualifier Sun Jian of China.
</P>
<P>
"We expected her to gain more self-confidence by winning the
Indonesia Open. Lidya has speed and good technical skills which
can trouble her opponents. I'm not sure if her poor form was
caused by a lack of confidence or something else," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, Indonesia failed to send one of its
shuttlers to the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"On paper, one of our men's singles should have reached the
semi-finals or even the final. (Third seeded Taufik) Hidayat
cannot lose to Hoyer-Larsen, who is about twice as old as him. And
(seventh seeded Marlev) Mainaky could not show that his victory
over Gade Christensen in the Indonesia Open was not a fluke," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the men's doubles, only newcomers Ade Lukas and Santoso
Sugiharjo showed good form by eliminating sixth seeded Zhang Wei
and Zhang Jun of China.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, their veteran teammates were disappointing.
Flandy and Eng Hian, top seeded, should not have lost to unseeded
Martin Lundgaard and Lars Paaske, while second seeded Antonius and
Denny Kantono must not lose to Jim Laugesen and Michael Sogaard.
</P>
<P>
"The top and second seeded teams losing in the semi-finals to
less powerful doubles teams is pathetic. They did not show their
world-class technical skills. But I'm somewhat happy because Lukas
and Santoso managed to reach the quarters. It showed that they
have the potential to replace the veteran players in the future,"
Christian said.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Provide Assistance to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank said
Tuesday in a news release that it will work closely with the
United Nations and the World Bank in the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the commitment was made by ADB
President Tadao Chino in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and to World Bank President James Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
This followed a donors' meeting on development assistance to
East Timor that took place on September 29 at the World Bank in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Chino said in the letter that the ADB will focus its assistance
on rehabilitation and development, rather than relief.
</P>
<P>
According to Chino, the ADB is interested in supporting
governance and public sector management, building capacity for
delivery of essential services such as health, education, power
and water, and the development of community and local government.
</P>
<P>
However, Chino said that full-fledged ADB assistance to East
Timor will only be possible when East Timor's membership in the
bank can be arranged. In the interim, the ADB is examining a
suitable funding arrangement for assistance.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Curtail Acid Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up efforts to
cut down on air pollution and reduce hazardous acid rain, "China
Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
If the prevention measures are effective, some one million tons
of sulphur dioxide discharge could be eliminated this year and air
quality in many cities would greatly improve, an official with the
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) told China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 23 million tons of sulphur dioxide a year
are discharged into the atmosphere, causing acid rain which would
reduce agriculture yields and harms forests and buildings in 40
percent of the nation's territory.
</P>
<P>
"Coal accounts for about 75 percent of China's energy
production, and it is the main cause of sulphur dioxide emissions,
" the official was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
SEPA has urged local governments of cities with serious sulphur
dioxide pollution to map out pollution control programmes and
renovate industrial sectors before the end of the year. More than
80 percent of the major industrial enterprises must come up to
State standards on sulphur dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be enforced to reduce use of high-sulphur coal
and replace it with clean energy, such as natural gas and
electricity, and SEPA welcomes overseas expertise and technology,
sources with the SEPA said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"SEPA is to host an international seminar on sulphur dioxide
pollution treatment technologies in December in Beijing, which
will provide recommendations to the government for formulating
environmental policies," the paper quoted the official as saying.

Keane will start the Champions League showdown with Marseille

OK.

<P>
"I would have liked to have played the whole game, but with
only having played an hour of football in the last eight weeks
half an hour was probably enough.
</P>

"I've been a bit more patient this time. I've had an extra week
's rest and it does seem a lot better.
</P>
<P>
"Generally I've just been resting it, but I've also been
working in the gym, doing a little bit of bike work and rowing. It
feels fine and hopefully that will be the end of it. I'm back and

The disqualification meant that the McLaren-Mercedes team's
defending world champion Mika Hakkinen was declared winner, giving
him and McLaren an unassailable lead in the two standings with
only the Japanese GP left to run on October 31.
</P>
<P>
As FIA, the international federation for motor racing, said the
appeal would be heard in Paris on Friday, Ferrari Chairman Luca
Cordero di Montezemolo, his aides and lawyers sat down in the mid-
morning for a meeting that was still continuing in the late
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The disqualification was decided by the race stewards because
the lower part of the lateral aerodynamic bulge in the Ferraris'
body-work was half an inch larger than allowed by the regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, Ferrari's team manager,
Jean Todt, said Monday that the appeal would revolve round two
claims, that the violation was involuntary and would in any case
have no influence on the cars' performance.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to compile a clear and precise dossier," said Todt.
The submission will presumably refer to the fact that Ferrari used
the same body-work at the European GP at the Nuerburgring a
fortnight ago, but nothing was said.
</P>
<P>
In that race, Ferrari's main driver Eddie Irvine came in
seventh, some seconds behind Hakkinen in fifth place. In last
Sunday's race, also thanks to returning ace Michael Schumacher's
successful blocking tactics, Irvine was at times as much as 20
seconds ahead and, in the qualification runs, Schumacher came out
a second ahead of Irvine.
</P>
<P>
In Turin, Gianni Agnelli, the honorary chairman of Fiat, which
owns Ferrari, commented: "More than 100 million saw who won, how
they won and the quality of the victory. If there are problems of
a different kind, I have nothing to say about it."
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters in Florence, Fiat Chairman Paolo Fresco,
Agnelli's successor as the Fiat group's top executive, said he saw
no reason to talk about a conspiracy against the flame-red cars.
</P>
<P>
"It's too big a word," he said, "But we have to understand why
a car that raised no objections when it lost at the Nuerburgring,
suddenly has doubt cast on it when it wins."
</P>
<P>
Irvine, who traveled from the circuit at Sepang to Macao, said
he was more incredulous than angry at being disqualified and
described the incriminated additional bulge on the car as an "
oversight".
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe they will deny me points and leadership of the
championship over something like this," added Irvine.

<HEADLINE> Courier Beats Di Pasquale to Advance to Second Round </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- American former world number one
Jim Courier, seeking his first title in 18 months, beat France's
Arnaud Di Pasquale 2-6, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5 on Monday in the first
round of the Lyon Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Courier will face Australia's Mark Philippoussis in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches, American Chris Woodruf
disappointed the French crowd by dispatching Arnaud Clement 6-4, 6-
2.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic needed three sets to get past
Gianluca Pozzi of Italy, a 15-year veteran of the men's circuit
and the oldest player in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Croatian overcame the 34-year-old Italian 4-6,
6-3, 6-4 to advance to a second-round match with Argentina's
Mariano Zabaleta.
</P>
<P>
American qualifier Richey Reneberg easily marched through to
the second round when Germany's Jens Knippschild pulled out
because of lower back pains after losing the opening set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
While 1995 champion Wayne Ferreira posted a tidy 6-4, 6-3
victory over French qualifier Jerome Hanquez, any hopes 1997
champion Fabrice Santoro had of regaining his title were dashed
when back problems caused his humbling 6-1, 6-1 defeat at the
hands of Germany's Rainer Schuttler in front of his home crowd.

<HEADLINE> Britain Warns Pakistan of Further Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Monday warned Pakistan's military rulers that they could face
further action if they do not get democracy restored in that south
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made shortly after Pakistan had been suspended
from Commonwealth meetings in London, as punishment for the
military takeover last week.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the end of the story," Cook told BBC Radio 4.
</P>
<P>
Asked if that meant sanctions against Pakistan, the foreign
secretary only commented that the Pakistani economy was dependent
on outside cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the suspension was a bit to get democracy
restored, "not to threaten the Pakistani people."
</P>
<P>
At the emergency meeting held in London Monday, the
Commonwealth's foreign ministers said they "unanimously condemned
the unconstitutional overthrow of the democratically elected
government of Pakistan" and decided that Pakistan's military
regime should be suspended "forthwith" from the councils of the
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
That decision was the first formal step towards suspending
Pakistan from the 54-nation association, which under Commonwealth
rules could only be done by the heads of government summit in
South Africa next month.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called on the military regime in Islamabad to set
"without delay" a timeframe for the restoration of a
democratically elected government in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth is scheduled to send a four-member mission to
meet the military leaders in Pakistan to press for the return of
civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will report back in time for November's summit
to decide whether or not to suspend Pakistan's actual membership.

<HEADLINE> U.S. South Commando Head Arrives in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- General Charles E.
Wilhelm, chief of U.S. Southern Command Unit, arrived here Monday
for a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Th U.S. general is to learn of advances to a modernizing
project of the Colombian Air Force (FAC).
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm also will meet Colombian Defense Minister Luis Fernando
Ramirez and some FAC heads, U.S. diplomatic sources in Colombia
said.
</P>
<P>
The same source added the general will also have a meeting with
head of the Armed Forces General Fernando Tapias and FAC General
Hector Fabio Velasco.
</P>
<P>
The presence of General Wilhelm in Colombia is the second so
far this year. Political analysts believe the American official's
visit is related to the carrying out of operation "Millennium."
</P>
<P>
Operation "Millennium" took place last week in several
Colombian, Ecuadorian and Mexican municipalities, having as a
result the detention of 30 alleged drug traffickers, among them
two heads of drug cartels in the first country.
