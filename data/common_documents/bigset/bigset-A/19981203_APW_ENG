Neighbors beg Papua New Guinea on Bougainville government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Pacific neighbors Australia and New
Zealand jointly appealed to Papua New Guinea on Thursday to quickly
set up a reconciliation government on the secessionist island of
Bougainville.
	   Papua New Guinea's Parliament adjourned Wednesday without
passing the legislation needed to set up the proposed all-party
government, agreed upon as part of cease-fire arrangements after a
secessionist conflict lasting some 10 years on Bougainville.
	   Parliament is not due to reconvene in Papua New Guinea until
next July 13.
	   Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and his New
Zealand counterpart Don McKinnon made the appeal together in
Canberra, after regular talks between the two governments.
	   The Papua New Guinea opposition blamed that country's Prime
Minister Bill Skate for the failure, saying he had adjourned
Parliament early to avoid a no-confidence motion that would have
brought down his government.
	   Papua New Guinea opposition leader Bernard Narakobi said Skate
had put the entire country's political and social stability at
risk.
	   Both Downer and McKinnon urged the Papua New Guinea Parliament
to reconvene, however briefly, to pass the legislation needed to
set up the reconciliation government.
	   McKinnon said the women of Bougainville, in particular, are
anxious for peace and stability to be restored on the island, the
site of what was once the world's biggest copper mine.
	   ``The important thing is to get things back to normal,''
McKinnon said.
	   He said children on the island had not attended school for 10
years, because of the secessionist conflict.
	   Bougainville became part of Papua New Guinea when that country
gained independence from its colonial ruler, Australia, in 1975.
	   But racial and financial differences quickly led to the
secessionist conflict.
	   Despite its riches, Bougainville is one of the least developed
places on earth, and the schools and hospitals it had all ceased to
operate during the war.
	   New Zealand helped to broker the cease-fire that brought the
fighting to at least a temporary end.
	   Australia is supporting it logistically with peace monitoring
troops and other resources, costing some 4 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.5 million) a month.
	   The interim reconciliation government was to have been made up
of a mix of elected and appointed representatives from all factions
involved in the conflict on Bougainville, which ended with the
signing of the peace accord early this year.
	   An interim government will continue to rule the island until the
reconciliation government is established.

 &UR; Human Rights Watch report says U.S. 'out of step' &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID BRISCOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Clinton administration has ``large blind
spots'' with regard to human rights, ignoring abuses in many
countries and being ``severely out of step with most of the rest of
the world'' on major issues, Human Rights Watch said Thursday.
	   The largest U.S.-based human rights organization, which monitors
conditions everywhere with offices in 10 countries, also praised
Kofi Annan for showing ``a greater commitment to human rights than
any other U.N. secretary-general.''
	   But it had harsh words in its annual report for several
governments and accused both the United States and the European
Union of failures and inconsistencies.
	   The organization's 1999 report analyzes human rights in 68
countries and says that nearly all governments now realize they can
no longer dismiss abuses as a purely domestic matter.
	   ``Today, human rights are well established as the legitimate
concern of all humanity,'' said the report, released a week before
the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   The group cited a growing willingness by countries to raise
concerns with each other over matters that previously might have
been dismissed as internal.
	   The outcry by leaders of Indonesia and the Philippines against
the detention of Malaysian official Anwar Ibrahim and the possible
extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from
Britain to Spain are cited as examples.
	   ``Pinochet's arrest makes a very nice 50th-anniversary
present,'' said Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch executive
director.
	   The report harshly rebukes several governments for outright
abuses and reserves some of its toughest criticism for the U.S.
government for its reluctance to join key international treaties on
landmines and the setting up of an International Court of Justice
and for lack of leadership in trying to end a variety of abuses.
	   By refusing to sanction the court, which needs only one more
ratifying government to be set up, ``Washington revealed itself
once more to be severely out of step with most of the rest of the
world,'' the report said.
	   Fearing U.S. soldiers could face politically motivated charges,
the United States has refused to sign without the option of vetoing
the prosecution of any American citizen.
	   ``The Clinton administration's efforts to promote human rights
around the world were subject to large blind spots,'' the report
said. ``Major parts of Africa, the Middle East and the former
Soviet Union never made it to the administration's human rights
agenda.''
	   State Department officials did not immediately return phone
calls seeking comment on the report. But in the past, the White
House has defended its leadership in human rights, citing its
sanctions, its annual report of abuses and frequent statements
critical of repressive regimes.
	   While praising the European Union for conditioning aid and trade
preferences on respect for human rights, the report said the EU
applied its policies inconsistently and is slow in responding to
crises because of its practice of requiring a consensus before
taking action.
	   But the report does not focus solely on the role of outsiders in
stopping abuses.
	   In Africa, it finds backsliding by several governments just a
year after the continent appeared to be heading toward
unprecedented progress.
	   ``African leadership repeatedly stumbled in finding solutions to
the continent's grave political and human rights problems of
1998,'' the report said.
	   In the Middle East, it says civil strife in Algeria, trouble
over weapons inspections and suffering from sanctions in Iraq, and
moribund Israeli-Palestinian negotiations generated ``largely
negative human rights consequences.''
	   In former Soviet states, the report cites near chaos and
economic collapse in Russia, a deterioration of human rights in
several other former Soviet States and growing religious
persecution in the region.
	   In Latin America, Human Rights Watch says impunity for powerful
criminals, a ``yawning gap between rich and poor'' and corrupt and
ineffective police and judiciaries left many nations ``victims to
seemingly uncontrollable crime.''
	   In Asia, the report cites the economic crisis as the key factor
in denial of human rights in East Asia, while South Asia's human
rights landscape remained ``depressingly familiar,'' with abuses
linked to armed conflict, violence against women and failure to
protect refugees.
	   While focusing largely on abuses, the report also cited some
positive developments since the 1948 declaration in which world
governments vowed to protect human rights.
	   It said concern now extends beyond the victims of political
repression to include human rights protection for women, children,
refugees, civilians in wartime, gays, and ethnic and religious
minorities.
	   In praising Annan and the United Nations, it noted an October
decision to bar the use of children under 18 in U.N. peacekeeping
forces and the inclusion of human rights in the programs of several
U.N. agencies.
	   It credited U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees Mary Robinson for
shifting the agency's focus from distribution of relief goods to
its more critical role of protecting refugees from abuse.

 &UR; Human Rights Watch report cites abuses worldwide &QL; 
 &UR; With Human Rights &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The annual Human Rights Watch report released
Thursday cites abuses in countries around the world, covering the
year through November. Some of its conclusions on individual
countries:
	   AFGHANISTAN _ Afghanistan remained ``one of the world's most
intractable human rights disasters,'' with fighting between the
dominant Taliban and opposition forces. The ultraconservative
Islamic Taliban conducted many public executions and established a
pattern of repression of women on religious grounds.
	   ANGOLA _ Human rights abuses were widespread on the part of the
government and the armed opposition. Both restricted citizens'
movement, arbitrarily abducted or detained civilians, censored
information and conscripted children.
	   ARGENTINA _ Police brutality continued to be the major human
rights concern, followed by threats and attacks on independent
journalists and the government's unwillingness to provide justice
for abuses committed under the military dictatorship that ended in
1983.
	   CHINA _ Despite some ``encouraging developments'' with greater
freedom to debate allowed among intellectuals on political and
economic reform, China maintained generally strict controls on
expression, association and assembly, with political and religious
dissidents facing arrest and detention. Repression continued in
Tibet.
	   CUBA _ Pope John Paul II's visit in January sparked hope the
government would ease repressive tactics. But violations continued
throughout the year, with the government stepping up the
prosecution and harassment of dissidents and refusing to grant
amnesty to remaining political prisoners, marking ``a disheartening
return to heavy-handed repression.''
	   IRAQ _ The government engaged in a broad array of violations,
including mass arrests, torture, summary executions and forced
relocations. In the Kurdistan region, both armed Kurdish political
parties and the Iraqi military were responsible for abuses. Despite
oil sales for humanitarian purposes, s public health crisis
continued.
	   MEXICO _ Although President Ernest Zedillo acknowledged human
rights violations, his government failed to respond to individual
cases of abuse, to strengthen human rights safeguards or to promote
the rule of law.
	   MYANMAR _ More than 1,000 people were imprisoned during the year
in the standoff between opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the
military rulers in a country that continued to be ``one of the
world's pariah states.''
	   NIGERIA _ The new government of General Abdulsalami Abubakar
offers new hope for democracy, but decrees allowing detention
without trial, suspension of constitutional guarantees of human
rights and prohibitions against the courts from reviewing executive
acts remained in force.
	   RUSSIA _ Political freedoms established at the end of the Cold
War were under increasing attack during the year, both on the
federal and regional level. Russia's provinces continued to
``develop into fiefdoms that engage in civil and political rights
violations with impunity from Moscow.''
	   SAUDI ARABIA _ The government continued to violate a broad array
of civil and political rights, allowing no criticism of the
monarchy, no political parties, arbitrary arrests and
institutionalized discrimination against women.
	   UNITED STATES _ The country that has long regarded itself ``a
beacon of human rights'' had incidents of police abuse,
mistreatment of prisoners, unjust rejection of asylum seekers,
reliance on the death penalty when other countries are rejecting
it, and racial inequality.
	   YUGOSLAVIA _ The government of President Slobodan Milosevic
continued its ``blatant disregard for human rights in 1998,''
carrying out breaches of human rights in Kosovo province,
suppressing independent media and the autonomy of Serbia's
universities and failing to cooperate with the prosecution of
accused war criminals from the conflict in Bosnia.

Indonesian president meets House leaders on election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie and key Cabinet
ministers met Thursday with legislative leaders in Parliament to
discuss plans for general elections next year.
	   Habibie, who took office from former President Suharto after
riots and protests in May, has allowed political parties to form
and has promised to hold parliamentary elections in June.
	   But many student protesters who have staged near-daily rallies
for weeks want Habibie to step down, saying he is stalling on
democratic reforms and is a stooge of his authoritarian
predecessor.
	   Habibie arrived Thursday morning at Parliament with Attorney
General Andi Mohamad Ghalib as well as 10 ministers, including
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and military chief Gen. Wiranto, the
defense minister.
	   Students have demanded that Wiranto be held accountable for the
Nov. 13 shooting deaths of nine students by riot officers during a
controversial government assembly on political reforms.
	   Protesters also want Suharto to be investigated for corruption
and sent to trial before the general election is held.
	   Some government officials have said that the election will be
held on June 7, followed by the election of a new president by the
nation's highest legislative body.
	   Critics say the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly is
full of holdovers from the Suharto era and does not have the
credibility to choose a new leader for the nation of 202 million
people.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades as
well as rising religious tension. Earlier this week, Christian mobs
burned mosques in a provincial capital in retaliation for attacks
by Muslim rioters on churches in the capital, Jakarta.

Wronged Pakistanis still in custody; Thais accused of beatings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pakistan attacked the Thai police as
brutal and incompetent Thursday, saying four Pakistanis wrongly
arrested as terrorists planning to attack the Asian Games were
severely beaten in a bid to coerce confessions.
	   Though senior police officers verbally retracted the allegations
Wednesday, the four remained in custody because the Immigration
Police branch _ which arrested the men and charged them with
possessing gear to make bombs _ had not formally dropped the
charges yet.
	   Pakistan's Embassy accused the police _ who are on high alert to
foil possible terrorist attacks during Asia's premier sporting
event _ of systematically labeling Pakistanis terrorists. The games
open Sunday.
	   The men were arrested by the Immigration Police at a rented
house on Bangkok's outskirts. But subsequent tests by experts of
what arresting officers reported as ``bomb-making equipment''
showed it was junk.
	   Under police procedure, the men were turned over by the
Immigration Police to a local police station and interrogated.
Station commander Col. Songvudh Thawankitdamrong said one had
already apparently been beaten before arriving.
	   Songvudh said that since the Immigration Police had made the
arrest and filed charges, they would also need to drop the case.
One man would probably still face charges for overstaying his visa.
	   ``It's just a technicality now,'' Songvudh said. ``All senior
officials involved in the investigations have pretty much agreed
that there is not enough evidence to make the charges stick. The
issue will be dealt with accordingly. It's a matter of national
interest.''
	   Songvudh denied that officers at his station tried to coerce
confessions, saying it did not happen under his supervision.
	   ``They don't look like the terrorist type,'' Songvudh said.
	   Two are dishwashers and one exports low-end garments.
	   The case embarrassed the Immigration Police. Chief Chidchai
Wannasathit was cited in The Nation newspaper Thursday as saying
that his men would be investigated to find why a reporter had been
invited to join the arrest.
	   The embassy suggested that the Thai police reach first for
Pakistanis when they fear terrorism, noting that several Pakistani
citizens were arrested on similar grounds in June. The charges were
never substantiated and the police apologized.
	   ``It is most likely that the present case is also being blown
out of proportion for reasons best known to the police,'' the
embassy said.
	   Embassy officials tried to contact senior police officers
Wednesday and were unable to find any who could speak English and
substantiate or elaborate on the charges, the statement said. A
diplomat eventually went to the station and visited the detainees.
	   ``The police were hesitant to allow access to one of the four
persons because he had been severely beaten,'' the statement said.
``The police also tried to get `confessional statements' signed by
the accused persons under duress.''
	   Songvudh said the embassy officials arrived at a hectic moment
and should have brought a Thai-speaker with them. The station did
not have a good English-speaker.
	   Security awareness has been heightened with the looming opening
of the 13th Asian Games bringing together 6,000 athletes from 41
nations. Thailand has deployed 16,000 officers for security and
traffic control.
	   Nervousness has been increased by a publicly unexplained
security exercise which closed the U.S. Embassy for a day late last
month. The United States linked the closure to recent terrorism
warnings.

Report: Three mosques burned in Indonesian town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An assailant set fire to three mosques
in a provincial Indonesian town, raising fears of an outburst of
religious violence, the official Antara news agency reported
Thursday.
	   Troops patrolled the town of Ngabang on Borneo island and crowds
gathered in front of mosques and churches to protect them from any
attacks.
	   Security forces said they arrested a mentally ill man in
connection with the burning of the mosques on Wednesday, but
community leaders speculated agitators were trying to sow chaos.
	   Ngabang is 810 kilometers (500 miles) north of Jakarta, the
Indonesian capital.
	   Earlier this week, Christian rioters in the city of Kupang,
southeast of Jakarta, burned and ransacked 15 mosques in
retaliation for the burning of churches in Jakarta last month.
	   Kupang was the latest site of religious violence in the world's
most populous Muslim nation.
	   The riots there on Monday raised fears that attacks on places of
worship will escalate in Indonesia, which has already endured
sporadic outbreaks of unrest because of economic and political
turmoil.
	   The violence in Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara
province, disrupted commerce as many traders shut their shops for
fear of widespread looting. But the city was quiet Thursday and
hundreds of troops remained on alert in the streets.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   But social tensions, fueled by widespread unemployment, have
intensified in Indonesia amid the worst economic crisis in decades.

Bomb scare evacuates tax office; Darwin Parliament also cleared
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Northern Territory Parliament house evacuated,
26th letter bomb turns up in Queensland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Police evacuated a downtown building
housing a tax office Thursday and rushed in bomb experts after a
suspicious package was found, a day after 25 letter bombs were
discovered by the post office in the capital, Canberra.
	   The building on Collins Street houses a government office, but
police later determined that the suspicious package was not a bomb.
	   In Darwin, the Northern Territory Parliament House was evacuated
Thursday after the discovery of an unattended package matching the
description of the letter bombs posted to government employees.
	   A police spokeswoman refused to give details, saying police
believed it was only a bomb hoax.
	   On Wednesday, a nationwide alert was issued after 21 letter
bombs were found at the Canberra mail sorting center after one
exploded, slightly injuring two postal workers.
	   The previous day a letter bomb had been delivered to a private
Sydney address but it was defused by the police bomb squad when the
person became suspicious.
	   Another two parcel bombs were delivered to homes in Sydney and
Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   And Thursday, another letter bomb was delivered to the home of a
public servant in Queensland, bringing the total found so far to
26. No one was hurt in the latest incident.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   One was reportedly sent to the Sydney home of federal privacy
commissioner Moira Scollay and another to the Melbourne home of
former federal sex discrimination commissioner Sue Walpole.
	   The federal human rights commission has contacted all past and
present staff believed endangered by a mail bomber targeting tax
office and commission workers, it said Thursday.
	   All mail was now being screened and staff had been warned to
check their home mail carefully before opening it, Human Rights and
Equal Opportunity Commission executive director Diana Temby said.
	   Police announced they were looking for 43-year-old Colin George
Dunstan of Canberra, whom they said was suspected of mailing at
least 25 letter bombs, Australia's biggest terrorist campaign.
	   Dunstan's neighbors said he was a former Australian Taxation
Office employee who had been out of work for several years.
	   He was believed to be driving a blue 1985 Toyota Corona sedan
with Canberra license plates.
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a storage box
that would hold five computer discs.
	   They are designed to explode when opened, although the device
that exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it was
thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

Murray scored midway through the third period to lift the Edmonton
Oilers over Phoenix, ending the Coyotes' 14-game unbeaten streak.
	   It was also the first time in 18 games that Phoenix allowed more
than two goals. The record of 19 straight games is held by the

	   The Coyotes, 12-0-2 in their previous 14, last allowed more than
two goals in a 4-1 loss in their season opener Oct. 11 against the
Ottawa Senators. The Coyotes' 14-2-2 start had been their fastest
in franchise history.

Wronged Pakistanis still in custody; Thais accused of beatings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Also moved on sports wires as BC-Sports-Asian Games-Terrorism &QL; 
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pakistan attacked the Thai police as
brutal and incompetent Thursday, saying four Pakistanis wrongly
arrested as terrorists planning to attack the Asian Games were
severely beaten in a bid to coerce confessions.
	   Though senior police officers verbally retracted the allegations
Wednesday, the four remained in custody because the Immigration
Police branch _ which arrested the men and charged them with
possessing gear to make bombs _ had not formally dropped the
charges yet.
	   Pakistan's Embassy accused the police _ who are on high alert to
foil possible terrorist attacks during Asia's premier sporting
event _ of systematically labeling Pakistanis terrorists. The games
open Sunday.
	   The men were arrested by the Immigration Police at a rented
house on Bangkok's outskirts. But subsequent tests by experts of
what arresting officers reported as ``bomb-making equipment''
showed it was junk.
	   Under police procedure, the men were turned over by the
Immigration Police to a local police station and interrogated.
Station commander Col. Songvudh Thawankitdamrong said one had
already apparently been beaten before arriving.
	   Songvudh said that since the Immigration Police had made the
arrest and filed charges, they would also need to drop the case.
One man would probably still face charges for overstaying his visa.
	   ``It's just a technicality now,'' Songvudh said. ``All senior
officials involved in the investigations have pretty much agreed
that there is not enough evidence to make the charges stick. The
issue will be dealt with accordingly. It's a matter of national
interest.''
	   Songvudh denied that officers at his station tried to coerce
confessions, saying it did not happen under his supervision.
	   ``They don't look like the terrorist type,'' Songvudh said.
	   Two are dishwashers and one exports low-end garments.
	   The case embarrassed the Immigration Police. Chief Chidchai
Wannasathit was cited in The Nation newspaper Thursday as saying
that his men would be investigated to find why a reporter had been
invited to join the arrest.
	   The embassy suggested that the Thai police reach first for
Pakistanis when they fear terrorism, noting that several Pakistani
citizens were arrested on similar grounds in June. The charges were
never substantiated and the police apologized.
	   ``It is most likely that the present case is also being blown
out of proportion for reasons best known to the police,'' the
embassy said.
	   Embassy officials tried to contact senior police officers
Wednesday and were unable to find any who could speak English and
substantiate or elaborate on the charges, the statement said. A
diplomat eventually went to the station and visited the detainees.
	   ``The police were hesitant to allow access to one of the four
persons because he had been severely beaten,'' the statement said.
``The police also tried to get `confessional statements' signed by
the accused persons under duress.''
	   Songvudh said the embassy officials arrived at a hectic moment
and should have brought a Thai-speaker with them. The station did
not have a good English-speaker.
	   Security awareness has been heightened with the looming opening
of the 13th Asian Games bringing together 6,000 athletes from 41
nations. Thailand has deployed 16,000 officers for security and
traffic control.
	   Nervousness has been increased by a publicly unexplained
security exercise which closed the U.S. Embassy for a day late last
month. The United States linked the closure to recent terrorism
warnings.

Australia to lend to IMF Brazil fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will lend up to 500 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 315 million) to an International
Monetary Fund rescue package for Brazil, Treasurer Peter Costello
announced Thursday.
	   Although Australia has contributed billions of dollars to IMF
rescue packages for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, this is
the first time money has been lent to help a country outside the
local region.
	   Costello said the loan was an interim measure under the IMF's
New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), which he chairs, and the funds
should be repaid early in the new year.
	   ``They are being provided at an above-market interest rate,''
Costello said in a statement.
	   ``Australia will bear no credit risk, but will carry some
exchange risk.''
	   Costello said the loan, which would be repayable by the IMF and
would bear interest, would have no impact on the budget because it
would be secured by the IMF and repaid.
	   The treasurer defended Australia's assistance for a country far
removed from its local region.
	   ``The focus of Australia's bilateral balance of payments support
has been in its own region,'' Costello said.
	   ``However, our membership of the NAB represents a global
obligation and the Brazilian program is crucial for efforts to
control the current international financial crisis, which began in
Asia but has since spread more widely.
	   ``Stability in Brazil is important for stability elsewhere in
Latin America and for stability in the international financial
system.''
	   The NAB came into effect just two weeks ago, bringing together
25 developed nations into a more streamlined operation for
assisting with IMF financial rescue packages.
	   The Brazil package is the first time the NAB has been activated.

Former chauffeur says Anwar intimidated him
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Using intimidation and
surveillance, jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim blocked a former
employee from cooperating with a police probe into his sex life, a
witness told a court Thursday.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar, a former driver for Anwar's wife, said he was
frequently called by the then-deputy prime minister and ordered to
hinder police investigations into allegations contained in a book.
	   The probe into accusations in ``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim
Cannot Become Prime Minister'' became the basis for the 10 charges
of corruption and illegal sex for which Anwar is being tried.
	   It alleges that the 51-year-old heir apparent to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad had wild sexual flings while in office.
	   Before the book was published Azizan had written to authorities
alleging that he was repeatedly sodomized by Anwar. He said he was
forced to retract those allegations under duress, but now stood by
them.
	   Allegations by Azizan and Ummi Hafilda Ali, the sister of
Anwar's former private secretary are among the most serious
revealed during the monthlong trial. Ummi alleges that Anwar had an
affair with her brother's wife.
	   ``Ummi Hafilda and I felt very scared because we were tailed by
people we didn't know,'' Azizan told the trial court Thursday.
	   He said he received phone calls from Anwar questioning him on
how he could have been involved in writing the sworn statement
containing the allegations.
	   The prosecution is trying to prove that Anwar misused his powers
to coerce retractions from Azizan and Ummi.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar Sept. 2, saying he had personally
determined Anwar was morally unfit for office. Anwar's sacking led
to his demands for political reforms and dozens of massive
anti-government protests in the Southeast Asian capital.
	   On Wednesday, Azizan shocked the court by saying he was once
Anwar's ``homosexual slave.''
	   ``In the name of Allah ... I have become a victim of homosexual
acts by Anwar Ibrahim, who now holds the position of deputy prime
minister,'' Azizan said.
	   ``This heinous act was committed several times in 1992 against
my will. It regularly took place in luxury hotels ... without the
knowledge of the public and his wife.''
	   Acrimony in court between the defense and prosecution deepened
Thursday as more evidence was piled against Anwar.
	   The prosecutors accused defense lawyers of stealing court
documents from them and even lodged a police report. The police
acted quickly by sending officers armed with a search warrant to
the office of one of the defense attorney's Wednesday.
	   ``You should make a strong statement asking the prosecution not
to harass the defense council,'' Haji Sulaiman, a leading defense
lawyer told Judge Augustine Paul.
	   ``We are being accused of theft My Lord,'' he said.

Judge grants protective order for two allies of Dominique Moceanu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ A judge has granted a temporary restraining order
protecting two friends of Olympic gold medal gymnast Dominique
Moceanu from harassment by her parents.
	   Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu were ordered to stay away from Brian
and Marcy Huggins, not to threaten the couple or to hire private
investigators to watch them.
	   Miss Moceanu, 17, had earlier obtained a protective order
against her father, whom she accused of stalking her and
threatening to harm her friends.
	   Huggins, 32, provided construction equipment to build the
Moceanu's Houston gym in 1996 and helped Miss Moceanu get away from
her parents' home on Oct. 17.
	   ``It's a shame things have gotten this far out of control with
people being threatened and people being stalked,'' Huggins said
Tuesday.
	   In a court affidavit, Huggins said he believes he has ``been
under constant surveillance by people who I believe were hired by
Dumitru Moceanu.''
	   The Hugginses are intervening in Miss Moceanu's case. Their
request for a permanent restraining order will be heard along with
her request Dec. 9.
	   ``I am terrified of my father,'' the gymnast said in a court
affidavit. ``I believe that all of my father's actions are intended
to result in physical harm, bodily injury or assault to me or my
friends.''
	   In the affidavit, Miss Moceanu states that a Houston police
sergeant informed her several weeks ago that her father was being
investigated for attempting to hire someone to kill her coach and
Huggins.
	   An attorney for Dumitru Moceanu has confirmed Houston police had
investigated her client but said he was not arrested and no charges
were filed. The Associated Press was unable to reach Moceanu on
Wednesday.

Indonesia plans elections on June 7 and presidential poll Aug. 29
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with election dates. One name correct for Suharto and
Harmoko &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - The Indonesian government will hold
general elections on June 7 and elect a new president at the end of
August next year, a legislative leader said Thursday.
	   The announcement of the election dates came amid widespread
suspicion among student protesters that President B.J. Habibie
would delay the elections and stall other democratic reforms.
	   Yet many students were unlikely to be satisfied with the
election timetable. They have demanded the immediate resignation of
Habibie, who took office from former President Suharto in May after
riots and protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Protesters say Habibie, who has urged students to halt their
near-daily street rallies, is a stooge of his former mentor.
	   House Speaker Harmoko announced the election timetable after
meeting with Habibie and key Cabinet ministers in Parliament. The
nation's highest legislative body will elect a new president on
Aug. 29, he said.
	   However, the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly is
beset by controversy. It is full of holdovers from the Suharto era
and critics say it does not have the credibility to choose a new
leader for the nation of 202 million people.
	   The assembly, which consists of all 500 members of Parliament as
well as presidential appointees, met last month to plan the
election and approve other political reforms.
	   ``The president will consistently and effectively implement the
decrees of the recent (assembly) meeting,'' Harmoko said.
	   Students who want swifter democratic change protested the
meeting of the assembly, and fought battles with security forces in
the streets surrounding Parliament. Nine students were fatally
shot.
	   Students want military chief Gen. Wiranto, who as defense
minister attended the meeting Thursday morning in Parliament, to be
held accountable for the Nov. 13 shootings.
	   Protesters also want Suharto to be investigated for corruption
and sent to trial before the general election is held.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades as
well as rising religious tension. Earlier this week, Christian mobs
burned mosques in a provincial capital in retaliation for attacks
by Muslim rioters on churches in the capital, Jakarta.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese economy shrank for the fourth straight
quarter, continuing to wallow dangerously in the nation's deepest
recession in decades, the government said Thursday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ declined by 0.7 percent from
July through September from the previous quarter, the Economic

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Neighbors watched helplessly as a
pre-dawn fire raged Thursday through an aging orphanage in a Manila
squatter area, killing at least 28 people, mostly children.
	   Young children shouted for help from the second-floor windows,
which were covered with metal grills to protect against intruders.
Neighbors were unable to open the padlocked main gate.
	   The dozens of children at the Catholic-run Bahay Kalinga
orphanage had been looking forward to a Christmas party the next
day. Instead, at least 23 children died and Christmas decorations
were scattered, along with toys and children's clothes, among the
buildings' debris.
	   ``I'm afraid my playmates were burned,'' said Brian De Mesa, 5,
who survived along with his twin brother. ``I saw their burned
bodies. I don't want to go back.''
	   About 70 people were inside the orphanage and children's home
when the fire broke out at about 2 a.m., officials said.
	   Rescuers gingerly lifted the bodies of small infants wrapped in
blankets from the remains of the buildings, which included a
two-story main structure and two cottages, all built between 1913
and 1927.
	   Thirteen dead children were found huddled together in one room.
In another, a dead adult was found clinging to two children, all
charred beyond recognition.
	   Staff members said the fire spread so quickly that they did not
have time to rescue many children.
	   ``I was sleeping on the ground floor when I was woken up,'' said
Carina Bellosillo, a teacher. ``Already, the ceiling was on fire
and the stairs going up to the second floor were burning. I wanted
to go upstairs to save the babies, but my companions pulled me
back.''
	   The ceiling soon collapsed, and many of the children's bodies
were found on the ground.
	   Some children of working parents also stayed at the orphanage in
the slum area in Manila's Paco district, and parents and relatives
wept as they waited for word of their children.
	   ``He was my only joy,'' said Anabel Sambriano, 21, whose
9-month-old boy died in the blaze. ``I want my baby.''
	   President Joseph Estrada visited the gutted buildings Thursday
afternoon and pledged to help the orphanage recover.
	   ``I will raise funds personally. I will do everything I can to
rebuild this place,'' he said.
	   Fire officials said about 70 percent of the orphanage was
already burning when they arrived shortly after 2 a.m.
	   ``We couldn't even go near because of the intense heat,'' said
Major Pablito Cordeta, operations chief of the Manila Fire
Department. ``A few seconds after we arrived, part of the roof
collapsed.''
	   Investigators said faulty electrical wiring may have triggered
the fire.
	   ``Most probably the electrical system was also old,'' said Capt.
Pennimore Jaudian, chief arson unit investigator.

TOKYO: Agency said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The agency said the economy contracted at an annual rate of 2.6
percent.
	   Japan has been battered by Asia's financial meltdown, which has
slashed exports, long the mainstay of its economic growth.
	   The economy shrank by 0.8 percent for the April-June period,
compared to the previous quarter. That marked the third straight
quarter of decline and the worst record since the government began
releasing GDP data in 1955.
	   Earlier this year, the government revised its initial estimate
of 1.9 percent growth for this fiscal year ending March 31. It now
says the economy will contract by 1.8 percent.

	   But Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya reiterated
Thursday that what happens may actually be worse than that
prediction.
	   The economy shrank by 0.7 percent for the last fiscal year
ending in March 1998 _ its first annual drop since 1974.
	   If the trend continues, the economy will shrink for the second
consecutive year _ something the Japanese economy has never done
since the end of World War II.
	   Determined to prevent the recession from dragging on further,
Japan last month announced a stimulus package including public
works spending and income tax cuts. It is unclear when the effects
of such measures will begin to be felt.
	   The government has also passed a package of bills to bailout
Japan's many troubled banks. The banks were left with massive loans
gone sour leftover from the excessive lending and speculation of
the 1980s.

Mexico City lawmaker surprised by gang number report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico City residents have long known their
city was awash in gangs, but a local legislator has finally tried
to quantify the problem.
	   Some 704 gangs with 18,067 members operate in Mexico's capital,
estimates Soto Camacho, vice president of the city legislature's
Public Safety Commission. He did not cite sources for his figures,
local media said Wednesday.
	   With names like ``The Travoltas,'' ``The Cats'' and ``Los
Jardineros'' _ or ``The Gardeners'' _ one-tenth of the gangs
operate out of high schools and universities preying on fellow
students.
	   Camacho said the school gangs sometimes go beyond their
trademark vandalism and bus hijackings to commit extortion, auto
theft and even murder.

	   The ensuing credit crunch has sent unemployment and bankruptcies
shooting to record highs lately. Consumer spending has been
plummeting.
	   In recent weeks, various Japanese government officials have made
comments about some signs of an economic recovery.
	   On Wednesday, the World Bank in Washington, D.C. said that if
the Japanese economy does not turn around soon, the world economy
faces a substantial risk of plunging into recession next year,
rather than undergoing sluggish growth.

Philippine tycoon moves to avert arrest on tax evasion charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Businessman Lucio Tan, one of the
Philippines' richest men, asked a court Thursday not to issue an
arrest warrant against him in connection with nine tax evasion
charges filed by the Department of Justice.
	   The charges accuse Tan, his Fortune Tobacco Corp., and nine
dummy companies of defrauding the government of 25.6 billion pesos
(dlrs 656 million) in taxes between 1990 and 1992. If convicted,
Tan could face two years in jail on each of the charges, as well as
being required to repay the taxes.
	   Tan also has interests in brewing and banking, and is chairman
and chief stockholder of ailing Philippine Airlines.
	   In a motion filed with the Marikina trial court, Tan's lawyer,
former Justice Minister Estelito Mendoza, said the charges are not
based on evidence, but are only allegations.
	   The Department of Justice filed the charges Tuesday, saying it
has enough evidence to convict Tan.
	   Mendoza claimed that the tax evasion charges were filed without
the approval of the head of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, a
requirement under the country's tax law.
	   The BIR had already charged Tan with tax evasion in 1993. But
that case did not proceed because Tan, in a series of appeals that
reached the Supreme Court, managed to get the charges suspended
pending an investigation by the justice department. The Supreme
Court said the tax bureau violated Tan's right to due process when
the case was filed without a preliminary investigation.
	   Tan has denied the allegations, and claimed the tax cases were
brought against him for not supporting former President Fidel
Ramos' candidacy in 1992. In this year's election, however, Tan
reportedly contributed heavily to the campaign of President Joseph
Estrada.
	   The Bureau of Internal Revenue has since changed its view of the
case. Revenue chief Beethoven Rualo was quoted by a local newspaper
last week as saying that the case against Tan would not succeed
because the evidence ``will not stand up to the scrutiny of the
court.''
	   Rualo, who took office after Estrada assumed the presidency on
June 30, reversed his predecessor's position that there was
voluminous evidence supporting the government's charges against
Tan.

Japanese stock prices finish lower, dollar falls against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished sharply lower
Thursday amid uncertainties about the outlook for U.S. stocks. The
U.S. dollar dropped against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 289.54 points,
or 1.93 percent, closing the day's trading at 14,697.08 points. On
Wednesday, the index closed up 151.21 points, or 1.02 percent.
	   In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar bought 119.46 yen, down
2.42 yen from late in Tokyo Wednesday and also below its late New
York level of 119.93 yen overnight.
	   Unfounded rumors that a U.S. hedge fund was selling dollars to
cover emerging market losses and a drop in Standard and Poor's 500
futures auguring another decline on Wall Street sent the dollar to
its lowest level in almost two weeks, traders said.
	   ``The biggest reason for the dollar's fall is the drop on the S
and P,'' said Yuhiko Kaji, vice president of foreign exchange at
Sakura Bank.
	   Also hurting the dollar's value was a rumor that a U.S. hedge
fund was selling the greenback to make up for losses in Brazil,
traders said.
	   The dollar was relatively stable as institutional investors
bought the U.S. currency for new investments in dollar-denominated
assets earlier in the session, traders said.
	   Many traders said, however, that the dollar could face more
selling pressure given uncertainly over the outlook for U.S.
financial markets.
	   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 69 points to
9,064.54 on concerns about the deteriorating corporate earnings
outlook because of weak demand from Asia.
	   On the Tokyo stock market, share prices moved lower following an
overnight drop in U.S. stocks and the dollar's overnight retreat
against the yen.
	   Investors also turned bearish amid uncertainty about the
Japanese government's upcoming economic measures, traders said.
	   ``The market lacks both buying and selling incentives and
activities are sparse,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko
Securities Co.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition Liberal Party
are currently coordinating economic policies, including what to do
about the country's unpopular consumption tax.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 18.26 points, or 1.59 percent, to 1,128.89 points.
The TOPIX rose 4.89 points, or 0.43 percent, the previous day.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
1.110 percent from Wednesday's close of 1.155 percent, driving its
price up to 105.94 yen from the previous day's 105.53 yen.

Webber cleared of most serious charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DERRILL HOLLY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UPPER MARLBORO, Maryland (AP) _ Chris Webber vowed to work
harder to uphold his name and reputation after being cleared of
charges that could have sent the Sacramento Kings forward to jail.
	   A jury of nine women and three men on Wednesday found him guilty
of willfully disobeying a police officer, and two minor traffic
violations. The judge assessed him dlrs 560 in fines in the case.
	   The same jury acquitted the former Washington Wizards star of
charges of possession of marijuana, driving under the influence of
the drug, resisting arrest and second-degree assault.
	   ``When you face charges of any type, you definitely are tense,''
Webber said outside of the Prince George's County Courthouse,
expressing relief that the Jan. 20 incident has been resolved.
	   The outcome could have been far different. Prosecutors had
planned to seek jail time if Webber was convicted of the most
serious charges.
	   ``The jury was swayed by the fact that he is very young man and
had never been in trouble,'' Maryland State's Attorney Jack Johnson
said of the 25-year-old Webber.
	   Jurors deliberated three hours before returning the unanimous
verdicts. Earlier Wednesday, they heard closing arguments from
Webber's defense attorney, Steve Levy, who used the recurrent theme
``It never happened'' to whittle away at the prosecution's case.
	   ``I don't believe, knowing Chris Webber, that he ever intended
to assault a police officer,'' Levy said.
	   The arrest was one of several off-court matters that prompted
the Wizards to trade Webber to the Kings in May. He was accused of
sexual assault in April, but that charge was later dropped. He also
paid a dlrs 500 fine in August after marijuana was found in his
carry-on bag at an airport in Puerto Rico. That incident cost
Webber his endorsement contract with Fila. Officials with the
athletic-wear manufacturer said he violated the company's conduct
clause.
	   Webber said he is looking forward to getting back to basketball,
although he regrets he will not be returning to the Wizards.

Hair to avoid Sri Lanka games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Controversial Australian cricket
umpire Darrell Hair has decided to stand down from matches
involving Sri Lanka to avoid clashes over the Muttiah Muralitharan
throwing affair.
	   Hair admitted Thursday that comments he made in a book about
Muralitharan were ``inappropriate.''
	   Hair caused a furore when he no-balled the offspinner seven
times in the 1995 Boxing Day test between Australia and Sri Lanka.
An International Cricket Council inquiry later cleared
Muralitharan's action.
	   Sri Lanka's wounds were reopened recently with the release of a
book by Hair, Australia's leading umpire.
	   Hair wrote, ``I don't think he straightens his arm all the time,
just on some occasions. I could have called him 27 times or even
more but I did not want the matter to become a complete farce.''
	   That angered Sri Lankan officials who protested to the ICC.
	   Hair has decided to stand aside from games involving Sri Lanka,
which will arrive after Christmas for a three-nation series
involving Australia and England.
	   ``As an international umpire I understand the timing of my book
is inappropriate,'' Hair said Thursday.

 &UR; Defense council for Malaysia's former No. 2 leader complains of
police raid

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A court hearing a case against
former No. 2 Malaysian leader Anwar Ibrahim was rocked Thursday by
defense accusations of harassment during a police raid on one of
its attorney's offices
	   The chief counsel for the jailed ex-deputy prime minister, Raja
Aziz Addruse, told the court that police searched Pawancheek
Merican's office Wednesday, ostensibly to look for papers reported
missing by prosecutors.
	   ``I wish to register a strong protest against this kind of
measure towards the defense counsel,'' said Raja Aziz. ``It amounts
to harassment.''
	   The lawyer accused prosecutors of using heavy-handed tactics,
saying they simply could have asked Anwar's legal team for the lost
documents before going to the police.
	   With the high-profile abuse of power trial poised to enter its
fourth week, the acrimony between defense and prosecution lawyers
has grown. Earlier this week, the prosecution was furious when one
of Anwar's lawyers accused them of forcing a man to fabricate
evidence.
	   The lawyer, Zainur Zakaria, was sentenced to three months
imprisonment for contempt of court. Another lawyer, whose statement
was used by Zainur in an affidavit containing the accusations,
escaped imprisonment by apologizing on Wednesday.
	   Zainur will go to jail if he loses an appeal that is scheduled
to be heard on Friday.
	   On Thursday, Judge Augustine Paul said he could not interfere
with police investigations or stop any searches.
	   ``Do you want me to tell the police to stop their
investigations? I cannot do that,'' he said.
	   But Raja Aziz persisted, demanding the judge order the
prosecution to end the harassment. ``There must be a stop to it.''
	   The judge replied: ``I've also been investigated by the police
when they came to my office to take statements from me.''
	   It was not known in what connection or when police questioned
the judge, who is trying Malaysia's former deputy premier on four
counts of abuse of power. Anwar, 51, will be tried at a later date
for one more count of corruption and five counts of illegal sex
acts.
	   He has denied all the charges, saying they were cooked up to
demolish his political career and end the challenge he poses to
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   Prosecutors defended their actions in seeking the missing
documents.
	   ``If they (the defense) are not happy with the police, file a
civil suit against them or if they are not happy with us, then file
a police report against us,'' said Prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail.
	   He said it was mandatory to lodge a police report in the case of
missing government documents.
	   ``We never accused anybody.''

Japanese economy still lagging in recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; ADDS Dow Jones forecast in 5th graf;
EPA revising GDP figure for previous quarter in 6th-7th grafs,
byline; minor edit thruout to conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese economy shrank for the fourth straight
quarter, continuing to wallow dangerously in the nation's deepest
recession in decades, the government said Thursday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ declined by 0.7 percent in the
three months from July through September, compared to the previous
quarter, the Economic Planning Agency said.
	   The economy contracted at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, the
agency said.
	   Japan has been battered by Asia's financial meltdown, which has
slashed exports, long the mainstay of its economic growth.
	   Tokyo-based economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had
forecast on average a 0.5 percent drop in GDP for the period from
July through September from the prior quarter.
	   The economy shrank by 0.7 percent for the April-June period,
compared to the previous quarter. That marked the third straight
quarter of decline and the worst record since the government began
releasing GDP data in 1955.
	   Initially, the EPA had reported that figure as 0.8 percent but
revised it on Thursday.
	   Earlier this year, the government revised its initial estimate
of 1.9 percent growth for this fiscal year ending March 31 next
year. It now says the economy will contract by 1.8 percent.
	   Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya reiterated Thursday
that what happens may actually be worse than that prediction. But
he said the next quarter's results will likely not be as bad as
Thursday's figures.
	   The economy shrank by 0.7 percent for the last fiscal year
ending in March 1998, its first annual drop since 1974.
	   If the trend continues, the economy will shrink for the second
consecutive year _ something the Japanese economy has never done
since the end of World War II.
	   Determined to prevent the recession from dragging on further,
Japan last month announced a stimulus package including public
works spending and income tax cuts. It is unclear when the effects
of such measures will begin to be felt.
	   The government has also passed a package of bills to bailout
Japan's many troubled banks. The banks were left with massive loans
gone sour leftover from the excessive lending and speculation of
the 1980s.
	   The ensuing credit crunch has sent unemployment and bankruptcies
shooting to record highs. Consumer spending has been plummeting.
	   In recent weeks, various Japanese government officials have made
comments about some signs of an economic recovery.
	   On Wednesday, the World Bank in Washington, D.C. said that if
the Japanese economy does not turn around soon, the world economy
faces a substantial risk of plunging into recession next year,
rather than undergoing sluggish growth.

Hong Kong to relax mortgage ceiling to stimulate property sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong will increase the lending ceiling for
mortgages offered by banks early next year, a change expected to
stimulate the territory's beleaguered property and banking sectors,
the financial secretary announced Thursday.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank, will raise its 70 percent ceiling on mortgages
offered by banks to 85 percent next year, Donald Tsang said.
	   The move is expected to increase bank loans for property
transactions. It will shrink the down payment required of real
estate buyers and allow banks to earn more interest by expanding
lending without taking on additional risk.
	   Tsang said the new, higher ceiling, expected to take effect
early next year, will not apply to all mortgages, but he didn't
immediately provide further details on the selection criteria.
	   Hong Kong's property market has been in a slump since the fourth
quarter of last year as potential buyers, spooked by falling
property prices, ballooning unemployment and high interest rates
hold off on investment plans.
	   Average prices have fallen by over 50 percent, prompting the
government to suspend a land sales program in June. Analysts are
split over whether a recent slight rebound in property sales
indicates the market has begun to bottom out.
	   Real estate-linked shares traded in Hong Kong rose moderately
after the news.
	   The index tracking property shares on the Hong Kong stock
exchange, having fallen more than 3.0 percent in the morning,
closed at midday down just 0.5 percent.
	   Sun Hung Kai Commodities Ltd.'s vice president Felix Ngai said
the relaxation on mortgage lending ``will be slightly positive to
the property market.''

Estrada orders filing of charges against 20 Chinese fishermen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada ordered
Thursday the filing of charges against 20 Chinese who were found
fishing in the disputed Spratly Islands.
	   ``They violated some Philippine laws so they should be
charged,'' Estrada told reporters.
	   Estrada said he is not afraid of possible reprisals from China.
	   ``Anybody who violates the law of the country should be
charged,'' he said. ``We have jurisdiction over both foreigners and
local violators.''
	   A Philippine navy patrol arrested the 20 Chinese fishermen and
seized their six boats on Sunday near Alicia Annie reef, which is
claimed by both the Philippines and China.
	   China on Tuesday asked the Philippines to free the fishermen.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoquiang said Beijing
views the detentions as illegal and wants Manila to take measures
to avoid such arrests in the future.
	   The Philippine navy said the Chinese were arrested for illegally
fishing in Philippine waters and using sodium cyanide to catch fish
in violation of a Philippine law that bans the practice.
	   Cyanide is poured into the sea by some fishermen to stun fish so
they can be caught and sold alive to restaurants. Cyanide kills
many other fish and destroys coral reefs.
	   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the mother
ship of the six smaller boats fled during the arrest and headed for
nearby Mischief Reef, also in the Spratly Islands, where the
Chinese maintain several structures that the Philippines claims can
have military uses.
	   The arrests were the latest in a series of recent incidents
between Manila and Beijing over territories in the South China Sea.
	   The Spratlys are believed to be rich in oil, gas and minerals.
China, Vietnam and Taiwan claim all of the Spratlys, while the
Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts of the chain.
	   Many Chinese fishermen have been arrested in the past but have
been freed after serving short jail sentences.

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Dixon Ward scored his team-leading 10th
goal and Dominik Hasek continued his mastery at home with 27 saves
as the Buffalo Sabres defeated the Florida Panthers 2-1 on
Wednesday night.
	   Ward, who leads the National Hockey League in shooting
percentage, scored the game-winner at 12:01 of the second period
when he scored on a rebound of his own shot to beat Florida
goaltender Kirk McLean.
	   Hasek has started the last 39 home games for the Sabres and has
a 23-8-8 record and a 1.56 goals-against average. He also has seven
shutouts in that span.
	   Buffalo (11-5-4) is off to its best start in nine years, when
the Sabres began the season 12-4-3. The Sabres are unbeaten in
their last seven home games.
 &UR; Hurricanes 4, Canadiens 1
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Ray Sheppard and Keith Primeau
scored 5 1/2 minutes apart and the Carolina Hurricanes won their
fourth straight by defeating the slumping Montreal Canadiens.
	   Sheppard's game-winner came with 4:19 left in the second period,
while Primeau scored his team-leading 12th goal 1:09 into the third
period just seconds after Carolina goaltender Trevor Kidd had made
several key saves.
	   The Southeast Division-leading Hurricanes have now outscored
opponents 13-3 during their season-high winning streak with Kidd in
goal for three of the wins.
	   Montreal, in last place in the Northeast Division, lost its
fifth straight road game and fell to 0-9-2 when opponents score
first.
 &UR; Rangers 3, Islanders 2
	   In Uniondale, New York, Mike Richter stopped 25 shots as the New
York Rangers beat the New York Islanders for their third straight
victory.
	   Mike Knuble, Petr Nedved and Wayne Gretzky scored for the
Rangers, who snapped a three-game losing streak at Nassau Coliseum
since a 5-2 victory on Feb. 8, 1997. The Rangers have beaten the
Islanders three straight games overall.
	   The Rangers are currently on a 4-1-2 streak, and have held
opponents to one or two goals in five of those seven games.
	   Robert Reichel had both goals for the Islanders, who have lost
three straight games and six of their last eight. Tommy Salo
stopped 14 shots.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 3, Kings 1
	   In Toronto, Sergei Berezin scored twice to lead the Toronto
Maple Leafs over the Los Angeles Kings for their seventh straight
home victory.
	   Berezin, with his first goal in 12 games, deflected Sylvain
Cote's point shot with 9:52 left in the third for the game winner _
his second power-play goal of the night.
	   Dimitri Yushkevich scored another power-play goal 2:20 later to
give the Maple Leafs three goals with the man advantage for the
first time this season.
	   Curtis Joseph was solid in goal, making 27 saves. Vladimir
Tsyplakov was the only King to beat him.
 &UR; Oilers 4, Coyotes 3
	   In Edmonton, Alberta, Mikhail Shtalenkov made 45 saves and Rem
Murray scored midway through the third period to lift the Edmonton
Oilers over Phoenix, ending the Coyotes' 14-game unbeaten streak.
	   It was also the first time in 18 games that Phoenix allowed more
than two goals. The record of 19 straight games is held by the
1958-59 Montreal Canadiens.
	   The Coyotes, 12-0-2 in their previous 14, last allowed more than
two goals in a 4-1 loss in their season opener Oct. 11 against the
Ottawa Senators. The Coyotes' 14-2-2 start had been their fastest
in franchise history.
	   Dean McAmmond, Pat Falloon and Kelly Buchberger also scored for
the Oilers. Pat Stapleton, Dallas Drake and Keith Tkachuk scored
for Phoenix.
 &UR; Stars 3, Sharks 0
	   In San Jose, California, Ed Belfour stopped 26 shots for his
second straight shutout, becoming the leader among active goalies
with 42 career shutouts, as the Dallas Stars defeated the San Jose
Sharks.
	   Tony Hrkac scored twice for the Stars, who got all their goals
in the first period. Darryl Sydor scored the other goal.
	   Belfour's second shutout of the season moved him past Colorado's
Patrick Roy, who began the year with 41 shutouts but has not had
one this season. Belfour had nine shutouts for the Stars last
season, a career best.
	   The 42 shutouts tied Belfour with Charlie Gardiner, who played
from 1927-34 with Chicago, for 20th place on the NHL career list.
 &UR; Avalanche 4, Red Wings 2
	   In Denver, rookie Chris Drury broke a tie game early in the
third period and the Colorado Avalanche beat Detroit, ending the
Red Wings' winning streak at five.
	   Rene Corbet added a wraparound goal with 5:22 remaining as the
Avalanche also handed Detroit goaltender Norm Maracle his first
loss in eight career starts (6-1-1).
	   Maracle, who had won four straight in place of injured Chris
Osgood, finished with 26 saves. Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy
stopped 27 shots, surrendering both goals on Detroit power plays.

Philippine stocks plunge on inflation worries; index down 4.2
</HEADLINE>
percent

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply
Thursday because of worries over a possible surge in inflation and
its effect on interest rates, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index plunged 78.97
points, or 4.2 percent, to 1,807.03 after retreating 35.79 points
Wednesday.
	   While economists are predicting a slight improvement in November
inflation, the market was awash with speculation that the actual
figures could be worse and might even hit 11 percent, a rate the
country hasn't seen since January 1996.
	   Inflation data are to be released either Friday or Monday.
	   Interest rates have been steadily declining in recent months,
but a surge in inflation could reverse the trend.
	   The broader All Shares Index was down 19.87 points at 585.29
following Thursday's 9.70-point decline. Losers beat gainers 88 to
26, with 22 issues unchanged.
	   Hit hardest by the drop, initiated by foreign brokerage houses,
were interest rate-sensitive property stocks.
	   Economists are expecting inflation in November to slow slightly
to 10.1 percent from October's 10.2 percent.
	   But Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000, said market
speculation placed the November inflation at around 11 percent due
to spikes in food prices in the aftermath of strong typhoons in
late October.
	   Even if true, Balita said, the sudden rise in inflation should
not be cause for worry because food prices have since declined.
Nevertheless, he added, the talk provided the trigger to an
underlying pressure to sell.
	   ``More than anything else it was panic,'' said Cesar Tanquincen,
portfolio manager for IB Jimenez Securities, noting that local
brokerage houses joined the sellers' bandwagon when foreign
brokerages started selling.
	   Tanquincen said a rebound is likely Friday, especially if
inflation numbers don't confirm the market talk.
	   In currency trading, the peso advanced against the dollar,
backed by strong dollar inflows from overseas Filipino workers and
the yen's buoyant performance against the U.S. currency.
	   The dollar averaged 38.822 pesos at mid-afternoon, down from
Wednesday's average of 39.101 pesos. The dollar broke the key
support level of 39 pesos late Wednesday.
	   An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, and they sent
home at least dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange
remittances are an important contribution to the Philippine economy
and are expected to provide a boost to the peso until year's end.

Rongen returns to Washington to take United's helm
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Big-time pro soccer in the United States is
finally showing some age. When D.C. United's new coach accepted the
job, he started talking about the good old days.
	   Thomas Rongen, taking over from Bruce Arena, will lead United at
the same RFK Stadium where he played for the Washington Diplomats
of the long-defunct North American Soccer League in 1980.
	   ``The fact that we play at a stadium that holds such great
memories for me as a player is the icing on an otherwise delicious
cake,'' Rongen said Wednesday.
	   United will be Rongen's third Major League Soccer team. He was
coach of the year in 1996 after leading Tampa Bay to a 20-12
regular season record, then moved to the New England Revolution the
following year and posted records of 15-17 and 8-18 before he was
fired Aug. 22.
	   In Washington, the pressure will be greater. Arena led United to
four major titles _ the MLS Cup in 1996 and 1997, the U.S. Open Cup
in 1996 and the CONCACAF Champions Cup this year _ before being
named coach of the U.S. national team on Oct. 27.
	   ``Obviously, his are big shoes to fill,'' United general manager
Kevin Payne said. ``Ultimately, I had to trust my initial instinct
that a coach with roots in the American game would be best suited
to D.C. United.''
	   A product of the famed Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam, Rongen has
been playing and coaching in the United States for 20 years. His
pro coaching career began in 1989 with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers
of the American Soccer League.
	   Coincidentally, Rongen's first assignment with his new team will
be in Fort Lauderdale, where United plays Saturday in the second
leg of the Interamerican Cup against Brazil's Vasco da Gama. Arena
will coach the game, his last with United, with Rongen along as an
observer. Vasco da Gama won the first leg 1-0.

Guerrillas kill suspected collaborator in school classroom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Separatist rebels in disputed East Timor
shot and killed an elementary school teacher in front of a
classroom full of students, the military said Thursday.
	   The attack, which took place on Wednesday, was the latest in a
recent surge in violence in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Several months of relative calm have given way recently to
sporadic fighting between guerrillas and the Indonesian military.
	   Rebels killed the 46-year-old teacher, Fransisco Amaral, because
he was suspected of collaborating with security forces, police
said.
	   Assailants fired on him from a classroom doorway at a school in
Viqueque, 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of Dili, the capital of
East Timor, said military commander Col. Tono Suratman.
	   Indonesia and Portugal are currently engaged in a new round of
U.N.-sponsored talks over East Timor's fate. Indonesia has offered
a degree of autonomy in exchange for recognition of its
sovereignty.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor a year after invading it, but the
United Nations and Portugal do not recognize the Southeast Asian
nation's claim to the half-island territory.

Philippine tycoon moves to avert arrest on tax evasion charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Philippine president saying charges against Tan
show his administration does not practice favoritism in new
9th-10th grafs

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Businessman Lucio Tan, one of the
Philippines' richest men, asked a court Thursday not to issue an
arrest warrant against him in connection with tax evasion charges.
	   The Department of Justice has charged Tan, his Fortune Tobacco
Corp. and nine dummy companies of defrauding the government of 25.6
billion pesos (dlrs 656 million) in taxes between 1990 and 1992.
	   If convicted, Tan could face two years in jail on each of the
nine charges, as well as being required to repay the taxes.
	   Tan also has interests in brewing and banking and is chairman
and chief stockholder of ailing Philippine Airlines.
	   In a motion filed with the Marikina trial court, Tan's lawyer,
former Justice Minister Estelito Mendoza, called the charges
baseless.
	   The Department of Justice filed the charges Tuesday, saying it
has enough evidence to convict Tan.
	   Mendoza claimed that the tax evasion charges were filed without
the approval of the head of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, a
requirement under the country's tax law.
	   The BIR had already charged Tan with tax evasion in 1993. But
that case did not proceed because Tan, in a series of appeals that
reached the Supreme Court, managed to get the charges suspended
pending an investigation by the justice department. The Supreme
Court said the tax bureau violated Tan's right to due process when
the case was filed without a preliminary investigation.
	   Tan has denied the allegations, and claimed the tax cases were
brought against him for not supporting former President Fidel
Ramos' candidacy in 1992. In this year's election, however, Tan
reportedly contributed heavily to the campaign of President Joseph
Estrada.
	   Estrada said the charges show that ``nobody is above the law''
under his administration.
	   ``If there is evidence, nothing can stop the charges, so nobody
is exempted,'' Estrada said.
	   The Bureau of Internal Revenue, however, has changed its view of
the case since Estrada's election. Revenue chief Beethoven Rualo
was quoted by a local newspaper last week as saying the case
against Tan would not succeed because the evidence ``will not stand
up to the scrutiny of the court.''
	   Rualo, who took office after Estrada assumed the presidency on
June 30, reversed his predecessor's position that there was
voluminous evidence supporting the government's charges against
Tan.

Bomb scares evacuate NT Parliament, Sydney and Melbourne towers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new bomb scare clearing Sydney's Centrepoint
Tower. Changes dateline, adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A day after a letter-bomber targeted
government officials, bomb scares wreaked havoc nationwide Thursday
as major buildings in Sydney and Melbourne and the Northern
Territory Parliament were evacuated.
	   Police had a manhunt out for one suspect, a former Australian
Tax Office worker who lost his job a few years ago.
	   Police cordoned off Sydney's Centrepoint Tower, a ``space
needle'' type building which is a major tourist attraction, and
which also happens to house the main office of the Australian Tax
Office, which had been targeted by the letter-bomber.
	   Similar scares over suspicious packages found in Melbourne's ANZ
Tower and the Northern Territory Parliament Building in Darwin
turned out to be false alarms.
	   But the spreading fear showed that the letter-bomb terrorist was
able to disrupt society, halt business, suspend government and
spread panic -- all at the price of 2.30 Australian dollars in
postage for each of the 26 letter bombs found so far.
	   Police in Queensland detonated the 26th bomb found, at a home in
the normally idyllic oceanfront vacation community of the Gold
Coast.
	   Downtown Melbourne's ANZ Tower was evacuated until police
determined that a package mailed to Victorian state Small Business
and Tourism Minister Louise Asher was harmless.
	   On Wednesday, a nationwide alert was issued after 21 letter
bombs were found at the Canberra mail sorting center after one
exploded, slightly injuring two postal workers.
	   The previous day a letter bomb had been delivered to a private
Sydney address but it was defused by the police bomb squad when the
person became suspicious.
	   Another two parcel bombs were delivered to homes in Sydney and
Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   One was reportedly sent to the Sydney home of federal privacy
commissioner Moira Scollay and another to the Melbourne home of
former federal sex discrimination commissioner Sue Walpole.
	   The federal human rights commission has contacted all past and
present staff believed endangered by a mail bomber targeting tax
office and commission workers, it said Thursday.
	   All mail was now being screened and staff had been warned to
check their home mail carefully before opening it, Human Rights and
Equal Opportunity Commission executive director Diana Temby said.
	   Police announced they were looking for 43-year-old Colin George
Dunstan of Canberra, whom they said was suspected of mailing at
least 25 letter bombs, Australia's biggest terrorist campaign.
	   Dunstan's neighbors said he was a former Australian Taxation
Office employee who had been out of work for several years.
	   He was believed to be driving a blue 1985 Toyota Corona sedan
with Canberra license plates.
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a storage box
that would
	   hold five computer discs.
	   They are designed to explode when opened, although the device
that exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it was
thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

Australian defense minister visits Death Railway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICOOL BROOKE &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KANCHANABURI, Thailand (AP) _ Australia's commitments to peace
and security in Asia in the wake of the economic crisis will be
spelled out in a security review early next year, Defense Minister
John Moore said Thursday on a pilgrimage to the infamous Death
Railway.
	   ``This place is a special chapter in Australian World War II
history,'' Moore said. ``These Australians buried here symbolize
our country's past commitment to peace and security in the
Asia-Pacific.''
	   Moore viewed row upon row of gravestones in the Kanchanaburi War
Cemetery, where some of the 2,700 Australian prisoners of war who
died building a rail line for their Japanese captors are buried.
	   The railway, linking Japanese forces in Thailand and Burma, now
known as Myanmar, included the infamous Bridge on the River Kwai,
the subject of a Hollywood film depicting the disease, starvation,
torture and killings inflicted on the prisoners.
	   Moore was the highest-ranking Australian official to visit since
Prime Minister John Howard opened an Australian-funded memorial at
hand-hewn gorge known as Hellfire Pass, which had some of the
highest death rates.
	   Moore said Australia wants its neighbors to know the country is
just as committed to Asia's peace and security now as during World
War II. He is scheduled to hold security talks with Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai and others during his four-day visit.
	   Australia's commitment to Thailand and the region would be
spelled out in a new security review to be published in March 1999,
taking into account the ongoing economic crisis.
	   The review looks at Australia's commitment to its treaty allies,
including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, and the
threats to their stability which may affect Australia, Moore said.
	   The visit follows Ambassador William Fisher's recent
announcement that Australia had increased military aid and
assistance to Thailand as a result of the economic crisis.

Vandals destroy gravestones in Jewish cemetery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Vandals knocked over and shattered more
than 50 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in the Georgian capital
early Thursday, authorities said.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the act, and police said
they were investigating. It was the second such incident at a
Jewish cemetery in Tbilisi in recent years.
	   Georgia's chief rabbi, Ariel Levin, denounced the ``barbarous
act,'' which he said was carried out by someone ``with provocative
goals.''
	   However, he added, ``Nobody will be able to cast a pall over
good and fraternal relations between Georgians and Jews, which have
existed for more than 26 centuries now.''

Impeachment inquiry lurching toward a vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Clinton-Impeachment &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID ESPO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ To hear Democrats tell it, the House
impeachment panel is careening chaotically out of control as it
pokes into campaign fund-raising issues in the twilight of an
inquiry into President Bill Clinton's conduct. Republicans counter
they're doggedly doing their constitutional duty.
	   Either way, barring an evidentiary bombshell contained in secret
Justice Department memos, the House Judiciary Committee will likely
debate and vote on Republican-drafted articles of impeachment
against Clinton late next week.
	   That will set the stage for a vote in the full House, probably
the following week, in which Republicans try to muster the votes
for at least one article of impeachment. Democrats will try to
craft an alternative, a formal censure of the president, that can
command majority support.
	   Partisanship is ascendant.
	   ``Chaos is reigning'' in the Republican-led impeachment probe,
House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt charged on Tuesday, as
Republicans forced approval of subpoenas for secret Justice
Department memos relating to campaign fund-raising issues.
	   ``Partisanship, not statesmanship appears to be ruling the day
in the Judiciary proceedings,'' Gephardt added in a letter sent to
outgoing Speaker Newt Gingrich.
	   But Republicans have fumed while two previous investigations
into alleged campaign fund-raising abuses ran into implacable
opposition from the White House and Democrats, one in the House and
one in the Senate.
	   Their frustration compounded by Attorney General Janet Reno's
refusal to turn the issue over to an independent counsel, they
resolved to use their authority under an impeachment inquiry to
make one final stab at an issue they have been after for two years.
	   Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, responded tartly that Gephardt's real fear ``is not the
lack of direction, but rather the fact that we are moving in the
right direction, getting to the facts.''
	   Hyde renewed his commitment to wrapping up the issue by year's
end, but added, ``I won't look away from any substantial and
credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing by the president.''
	   Committee aides were granted access to the memos on Wednesday by
a federal judge's order, and officials said FBI Director Louis
Freeh and Charles LaBella, formerly head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force, had been served with
subpobenas demanding their testimony.
	   Gephardt's comments were part of a long-term, well-executed
Democratic plan to undermine the Republican-led impeachment inquiry
as wholly partisan, and turn the focus away from Clinton's actions.
	   Neither his letter to Gingrich nor his public comments addressed
the issue of the memos that Justice Department officials wrote Reno
recommending she appoint an independent counsel, or whether
impeachment investigators should have access to them.
	   Nor did Hyde or any other Republican defender address their own
weakness _ the perception that the voters spoke on the issue in
November, and they want Clinton to stay in office, and Congress to
move onto other matters.
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ David Espo is chief congressional correspondent
for The Associated Press.

 &UR; Appleby takes first-round lead &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with end of play Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Stuart Appleby, tuning up
for next week's Presidents Cup and still trying to overcome his
wife's death, shot a 3-under-par 69 Thursday to take the
first-round lead at the Australian Open.
	   On a day when the tough par-72 Royal Adelaide Golf Club course
lived up to its reputation, only 13 players in the 126-man field
broke par. The field will be cut to low 60s and ties after Friday's
second round, a figure that could be as high as 8-over par if
Thursday's scores are any indication.
	   One stroke back of Appleby after first-round 70s are Greg
Norman, Canadian Rick Gibson, Australians Peter Senior and Kenny
Druce and New Zealander Stephen Scahill. Appleby and Norman will
both play for the International team against the United States at
next week's Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.
	   A group of seven Australian golfers was another stroke back at
71.
	   Appleby, playing for the first time in Australia since the death
of his wife, Renay, in a London traffic accident in July, had
back-to-back birdies to start the back nine, took consecutive
bogeys on 14 and 15 then finished with a pair of birdies.
	   ``I'm generally pretty happy with the day,'' Appleby said. ``I'm
under-golfed a bit so I'm trying to get enough good shots in the
bag.''
	   Appleby said it's difficult concentrating without his wife
nearby on the golf course. Renay, a former promising golfer, was a
constant companion on the tour and caddied for Appleby when he
played the Nike circuit in the United States.
	   ``It is hard to even say it, not having her all the time is
hard,'' said Appleby. ``I suppose I have lived the nightmare for
four months and it's not easier. One minute I'm good, one minute
I'm bad.''
	   Englishman Nick Faldo was among the course casualities,
finishing with a 77 and telling organizers he'd ``just played
badly'' and was heading straight for the practice range. His round
included six bogeys and a birdie.
	   John Huston, a member of the U.S. team in the Presidents Cup,
shot 75, one better than American Fred Couples, who will also play
at Royal Melbourne next week. International team member Carlos
Franco of Paraguay shot 75, as did teammate Craig Parry of
Australia.
	   On the difficult par-4, 442-meter 15th, there were 76 bogeys and
16 double bogeys.
	   Under relatively good weather conditions _ temperatures of 18C
(65F) and a light morning breeze that became gusty in the afternoon
_ Norman, playing his first 72-hole tournament since undergoing
shoulder surgery eight months ago, was at 3-under through eight
holes after birdies on the par-5 second, the par-3 seventh and
par-4 eighth.
	   But Norman, a five-time winner of this tournament and who lost
in a playoff to England's Lee Westwood last year, took a
double-bogey seven after hitting into the high green-side rough on
the ninth to make the turn in 36, one under the card.
	   ``It was just missing a shot in the wrong place,'' Norman said
of his problems on the ninth. ``There is no intermediate rough. You
can almost be unplayable.''
	   Norman made successive birdies on 10 and 11 before bogeying the
tough par-4, 395-meter 13th, bogeyed 15 and birdied 17 before his
15-foot downhill right-to-left birdie putt on 18 was short.
	   ``I think it's going to be hard for anyone to go around this
course without hitting two or three bogeys,'' Norman said. ``I
don't care how good you are hitting the ball. The course forces you
to play defensively.''
	   Five-time British Open champion Peter Thomson was commissioned
by the Australian Golf Union to revamp Royal Adelaide for the Open.
	   Thomson, who is also captain of the International team, added
about 300 meters to the now 6,565-meter (7,178-yard) course, grew
out the rough and extended it further into the fairways and added
20 bunkers.

Austria's Gotschl early favorite for donhill title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTIN, California (AP) _ Renate Goetschl is quiet,
even for an Austrian, so she'd be the last one to claim she's been
one of the world's best ski racers for several years. She might
just be the best by the end of this season.
	   Goetschl doesn't display the bouncy personality of a Picabo
Street or the steely determination of a Katja Seizinger. Yet she
always manages to work her way up among the leaders in the downhill
and overall standings.
	   Overlooked amid the German domination of the women's tour last
season was Goetschl's second place behind Seizinger in the downhill
standings and a final placing of seventh overall.
	   With victories in the season's first two downhills last weekend
at Lake Louise, Alberta, the 23-year-old Goetschl has already taken
a strong lead in pursuit of a second downhill title.
	   With Seizinger out this season with a knee injury, the overall
title is up for grabs as well, and Goetschl, who excels in the
speed events of downhill and super-G, might just be a darkhorse
contender.
	   A lot of people forget that Goetschl came to the World Cup as a
slalom skier, winning a race in only her second start in 1993. The
Austrian federation, recognizing her talent, made her a four-event
skier, which took away from her slalom training. But she still
knows how to get through the gates, as witnessed by a gold medal in
the combined in the 1997 world championships. It will take that
kind of skiing to win an overall title.
	   ``It's really difficult to win the overall title because you
have to ski well in every discipline,'' she said. ``In giant
slalom, I'm not so good. In slalom, I'm getting better than the
last years and I'll try to make better results than I have. For the
overall, I don't think I have quite enough yet.''
	   Luc Alphand of France, a downhill-super G specialist, proved a
speed skier could win the overall by taking the title in 1997.
	   ``But you have to win a lot,'' Goetschl pointed out. ``Maybe
then it's possible. Last year, Katja Seizinger always skied well in
slalom and giant slalom, and I'm not the best.''
	   When she kicks out of the start in Friday's super-G here, she'll
find out whether the overall title is a viable target. After
winning the two downhills at Lake Louise, she led deep into the
super-G, only to miss a gate near the end of the course.
	   ``I was a little bit sorry about that, but I had a good weekend,
and I also know that I'm fast in super-G. I know I can go to the
start here without any pressure.''
	   That bobble at Lake Louise cost her 100 points, a mistake she
can't afford to repeat too often if she's to challenge for the
overall. A victory here Friday would go a long way in boosting her
chances at skiing's highest honor.
	   Despite her youth, Goetschl has finished in the top 10 of the
overall standings the last three years. She was the downhill
champion two years ago and runnerup to Seizinger last season.
	   ``Katja's not here this year but every year it changes,'' she
said. ``You don't know how the next season will be.''
	   The best thing Goetschl has going for her this year, it would
seem, is being Austrian.
	   ``We are now a really good team and it took a lot of hard work
to get here,'' she said. ``In the past, we were always looking to
the Germans and we tried to do the same as them. But I think now we
have caught them and everybody is happy about that and wants to
make it better and better.''

Finding Florida to be a microcosm of American weirdness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDAN FARRINGTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A dead man votes. A parrot is choked and dunked in
a margarita at a bar. A police chief resigns after allegations he
slept with an inmate's wife. The chief federal prosecutor resigns
amid claims that he bit a stripper.
	   Don't blame Florida. It can't help but be weird.
	   Look at the mix: immigrants from all parts of the Caribbean,
generations of Southerners, newly arrived Northerners, Indians,
nearly 3 million retirees and 47 million tourists annually.
	   Factor in extreme weather, 1,300 miles (2,100 kms) of coastline,
a huge swamp encompassing much of its inland and some unusual
wildlife.
	   ``There are so many layers,'' said Karen Cure, editorial
director of Fodors Travel Publications.
	   ``There's the new Florida, the glitzy Florida, the tourists'
Florida, the developers' Florida, the Versace Florida. Then there's
this whole Cuban/Latin Florida and there's cracker Florida and
fisherman Florida and on and on and on.''
	   As a new book points out, it's a recipe for the unexpected, a
weird side that isn't marketed to tourists, most of whom think of
Disney World, spring break and beaches when they hear ``Florida.''
	   ``I've spent some time in Southern California and Southern
California is pretty weird, but ... from one end of the state to
the other, it can't beat Florida,'' said Eliot Kleinberg, author of
the 229-page book, ``Weird Florida.'' ``I don't think you'll find
any other state in America with so much weirdness because Florida
is a microcosm of America.''
	   At the top is the lame duck governor, who calls himself a
``He-coon,'' for the wiliest raccoon in the forest. A recent state
House candidate claimed her opponent died three years ago. And
there was an alligator wrestler who got trapped in his foe's jaws
only to return to work two days later with a bandaged head.
	   Those items didn't even make it into Kleinberg's book
documenting Sunshine State strangeness. Kleinberg, a reporter for
The Palm Beach Post, opens with a challenge.
	   ``Florida is the home of more nuttiness per square mile than any
place on earth _ and we dare the world to prove us wrong,'' he
writes.
	   Kleinberg culled through decades of archives and gathered
unusual Florida news stories and lore, from a Key West man who had
a seven-year love affair with a dead woman in the 1930s to a dead
man who voted in Miami's 1997 election.
	   ``We actually had more weirdness than we could fit in the
book,'' he said.
	   After all, this is the state where the wife of former Panamanian
dictator Manuel Noriega was charged with shoplifting, and Paul
``Pee Wee Herman'' Reubens, a once popular children's television
star, was arrested in an adult movie theater.
	   One of the weirdest stories is about the Miami-Dade County
courthouse ``Voodoo Squad'' of janitors who scour court grounds
seeking sacrificed animals used in Santeria rituals. Among their
discoveries: dead chickens, beheaded doves, a dead goat, cows'
tongues wrapped in twine and lizards with their mouths tied shut.
	   Maria Hayworth, director of public relations for the tourist
agency Visit Florida, agrees Florida has a wide mix of people, but
said the state is no stranger than other places.
	   ``We allow everybody to be their own individual,'' she said.
``There are a lot of different personalities that are accepted and
allowed.''
	   Paul Miller, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's
Office and a former FBI agent in Miami-Dade County, believes the
climate is partly to blame because it attracts people from all over
the world _ including drug dealers, con artists and crooks on the
run.
	   All the weirdness is what makes Florida great, Kleinberg said.
	   ``People say, `If you love Florida so much, why are you picking
on it?''' he said. ``I'm not picking on it. I'm celebrating what an
interesting place it is.''

Israel suspends troop withdrawal after attack on Israeli soldier

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers assembled around a TV
set and watched a video of a Palestinian mob ambushing an Israeli
soldier. When the tape stopped, the decision was unanimous: Israel
is suspending its West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday's attack, in
which the trapped soldier was repeatedly struck in the head, was a
result of incitement by the Palestinian Authority against Israel.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up implementation of the
land-for-security agreement until Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
publicly dropped plans to announce a state in May and accepted
Israel's criteria for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   The Palestinians said the conditions were unacceptable and
appealed to the United States for help. U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin sided with the Palestinians, saying the Wye
River peace agreement ``should be implemented as signed.''
	   The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase peace accord.
	   In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel
is to release 250 more Palestinian prisoners.
	   David Leavy, a White House spokesman, said that despite the
crisis, the Clinton trip was still on. A White House advance team
was to arrive in the region Thursday.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation with the
Palestinians helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition.
	   In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend implementation
of the Wye agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said Thursday
they would not support an early elections bill as initially
planned.
	   The legislation was to have come before parliament Monday, but
its sponsors said they might delay the vote because they no longer
have a majority.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   In response, dozens of masked Palestinians blocked roads in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem with burning tires and threw
stones at cars. Israeli police fired rubber bullets.
	   Early Thursday, a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian
laborers from the Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they
were investigating whether the arsonists had political motives. The
fire was quickly extinguished and the laborers escaped unharmed.
	   After the attack on the Israeli soldier on Wednesday near the
West Bank town of Ramallah, Netanyahu convened his so-called
security Cabinet and played a videotape of the incident.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the
Cabinet room was very tense during the screening.
	   ``There was a unanimous decision,'' Hanegbi told Israel army
radio Thursday. ``We all said to ourselves that we had to stop this
quickly because if we do it after we give the territory, we will be
shirking our responsibility.''
	   However, the Palestinian Authority blamed Israel for the latest
crisis, saying it raised tensions by refusing to release
Palestinian prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival
of President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable,''
said chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and release 750 Palestinian prisoners by
January. In a first stage last month, it withdrew from 2 percent of
the area and set free 250 prisoners, but most were criminals, not
security prisoners, as the Palestinian Authority had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings with Washington.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Jewish settlers, who oppose the latest peace deal, said that
they would put Ramallah under siege if the army did not do so in
retaliation for the attack on the soldier. ``We don't intend to
allow Jews to be attacked without a response,'' said settler leader
Aharon Domb.

Bomb scares evacuate NT Parliament, Sydney and Melbourne towers

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new bomb scare clearing Sydney's Centrepoint
Tower; CHANGES byline and dateline
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A day after a letter-bomber targeted
government officials, bomb scares wreaked havoc nationwide Thursday
as major buildings in Sydney and Melbourne and the Northern
Territory Parliament were evacuated.
	   Police began manhunt for one suspect, a former Australian Tax
Office worker who lost his job a few years ago.
	   Police cordoned off Sydney's Centrepoint Tower, a major tourist
attraction that also houses the headquarters of the Australian Tax
Office, which had been targeted by letter bombs.
	   Similar scares over suspicious packages found in Melbourne's ANZ
Tower and the Northern Territory Parliament Building in Darwin
turned out to be false alarms.
	   But the spreading fear showed that the letter-bomb terrorist was
able to halt business, suspend government and incite panic _ all at
the price of 2.30 Australian dollars in postage for each of the 26
letter bombs found so far.
	   Police in Queensland detonated the 26th bomb found at a home in
the normally idyllic oceanfront vacation community of the Gold
Coast.
	   Downtown Melbourne's ANZ Tower was evacuated until police
determined that a package mailed to Victorian state Small Business
and Tourism Minister Louise Asher was harmless.
	   On Wednesday, a nationwide alert was issued after 21 letter
bombs were found at the Canberra mail sorting center after one
exploded, slightly injuring two postal workers.
	   The previous day a letter bomb had been delivered to a private
Sydney address but it was defused by the police bomb squad when the
person became suspicious.
	   Another two parcel bombs were delivered to homes in Sydney and
Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   One was reportedly sent to the Sydney home of federal privacy
commissioner Moira Scollay and another to the Melbourne home of
former federal sex discrimination commissioner Sue Walpole.
	   The federal human rights commission has contacted all past and
present staff believed endangered by a mail bomber targeting tax
office and commission workers, it said Thursday.
	   All mail was now being screened and staff had been warned to
check their home mail carefully before opening it, Human Rights and
Equal Opportunity Commission executive director Diana Temby said.
	   Police announced they were looking for 43-year-old Colin George
Dunstan of Canberra, whom they said was suspected of mailing at
least 25 letter bombs, which would make this Australia's biggest
terrorist campaign.
	   Dunstan's neighbors said he was a former Australian Taxation
Office employee who had been out of work for several years.
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   The devices are designed to explode when opened, although the
bomb that exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it was
thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

Police brace for Hindu rally at Muslim shrine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGALORE, India (AP) _ Hundreds of police officers on Thursday
surrounded a southern Indian shrine where Hindus and Muslims have
traditionally worshipped together in peace, fearing violence during
a rally planned by Hindu fundamentalists.
	   The fundamentalist Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu
Council, says the Muslim family that has traditionally maintained
the site should hand it over to Hindus.
	   The council known as the VHP, a sister organization to the
Bharatiya Janata Party that leads India's national governing
coalition, had threatened to take over the site by force, but later
said it planned only a rally Thursday evening. Hundreds of VHP
followers began converging on the site Wednesday.
	   Local police minister Phillipose Matthai told The Associated
Press he was in control of the situation at Chikamagalur, where
Muslims believe a Sufi holy man is buried in a cave. Hindus believe
one of their gods entered the cave in ancient times and
disappeared, but will one day re-emerge at the site 300 kilometers
(190 miles) south of the Karnataka state capital of Bangalore.
	   The tussle over the shrine comes just days before the sixth
anniversary of the day a Hindu mob tore down a mosque at Ayodhya in
northern India following a campaign spearheaded by the VHP, which
has vowed to build a Hindu temple at the site. The Ayodhya issue
helped bring the BJP to political prominence, while the mosque's
destruction prompted deadly religious rioting across India.
	   In Chikamagalur, more than 2,000 police officers were deployed
at barricades erected to control crowds. Worshippers approach the
shrine by climbing a wooded hill, then descend stone stairs to the
underground cave. A stone slab marks what is believed to be the
tomb of Sufi holy man Dada Hayath Khalandar who lived centuries
ago, while a pair of shoes said to belong to the Hindu Lord
Dattatraya sit in a case in a corner.
	   ``The shrine is a Hindu religious place according to available
government records,'' VHP leader Raghavendra Rao said Thursday.
	   ``It is not a Hindu temple, but a Muslim holy place containing
the tomb of a Sufi saint,'' countered Mohamed Sharief, editor of a
local newspaper. ``However both Hindus and Muslims should be
allowed unhindered access.''
	   Both Hindus and Muslims believe that if a childless woman comes
to the shrine to ask for a child, her prayers will be answered. It
is not uncommon for Indians of different faiths to share shrines
and even rites _ the music and dance of mystic Sufi Muslims
sometimes borrows from Hindu traditions.
	   Opposition parties in the national parliament this week
questioned BJP leaders sharply about the trouble brewing in
Chikamagalur. Federal police minister L.K Advani, chief of the
BJP's hard-line faction, said his government was working with
Karnataka officials to ensure both Hindus and Muslims could
continue to worship peacefully at the shrine.
	   The BJP has only recently made inroads in southern states like
Karnataka, which is now controlled by the leftist Janata Dal party.
In 1990, the BJP controlled the government in Uttar Pradesh, where
the Ayodhya mosque was located.

Still hurting after wife's death, patient approach pays off for
</HEADLINE>
Appleby &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ For Stuart Appleby, life _ and golf _
is not getting any easier since the death in a car crash of his
wife Renay earlier this year. But he's getting used to it.
	   ``I have lived the nightmare for four months and its not
easier,'' Appleby said Thursday after playing in his home country
of Australia for the first time since his wife's death in London in
July.
	   ``I'm getting used to going to bed by myself, or waking up and
not having
	   her around. It does not change the fact that I can do without
her _ I don't have that feeling. The fact is that it's never going
to happen.''
	   Appleby shot a 3-under-par 69 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead
in the Australian Open.
	   After being distracted during the U.S. PGA Championship, Appleby
said he was now working on rebuilding his rhythm and improving his
concentration.
	   ``Not having Renay at the PGA was really, really hard,'' he
said. ``Not having her all the time is hard.''
	   Appleby said he was still suffering from mental fatigue and was
easily frustrated.
	   ``I find myself a bit more edgy, temperamental sometimes,'' he
said. ``One minute I'm good, one minute I'm bad.
	   ``I feel like I can concentrate well at times but I'm not far
away from having trouble. It is very hard to keep the flame
constant.''
	   Admitting to being ``under-golfed,'' he said he was trying to
remain relaxed and unemotional.
	   ``I played some pretty bad shots today but I played some pretty
good ones
	   as well. I tried not to let either of them make much of a
difference.
	   ``When I hit a bad shot, I felt angry, but it did not last for
more than a
	   minute. I haven't got the energy to be angry.''
	   Appleby says he realizes there will be tough times ahead.
	   ``My goals, not just in golf, are to be patient,'' he said.
``It's a long
	   road. It's more than getting a swing change that can take a year
to fix.
	   ``What I am trying to do this week (is) just be patient and not
expect too much of myself.'' (rs/djp)

Japan's economy still stuck in recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout to ADD official comment in 5th-7th grafs,
economist comment in 13th-14th grafs; TRIMS outdated material.
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese economy shrank for the fourth straight
quarter, continuing to wallow in the nation's deepest recession in
decades, the government said Thursday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ declined by 0.7 percent in the
three months from July through September, compared to the previous
quarter, the Economic Planning Agency said.
	   The economy contracted at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, the
agency said.
	   Japan has been battered by Asia's financial meltdown, which has
slashed exports, long the mainstay of its economic growth.
	   Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya expressed hopes
that the economy may be hitting bottom and nearing ``a dawn.''
	   But he reiterated that the economy's performance during this
fiscal year, which ends next March, may turn out to be worse than
the government prediction of a 1.8 percent contraction.
	   ``These figures actually were a little better than I expected,''
he said. ``The pace of decline is slowing.''
	   Thursday's figures do not reflect the main steps the government
has taken to prevent the recession from dragging on further, which
came after September.
	   Those steps, announced last month, include public works spending
and income tax cuts. The government has also passed a package of
bills to bailout Japan's many troubled banks.
	   The banks' massive bad loans, leftover from the excessive
lending and speculation of the 1980s, have been a big obstacle to
turning around the economy.
	   The ensuing credit crunch has sent unemployment and bankruptcies
shooting to record highs. Consumer spending has been plummeting.
	   Economists were pessimistic about when the effects of the
government steps might be felt.
	   ``The government is shrugging this off as ancient history, but
there are problems still plaguing this economy,'' said Andrew
Shipley, economist at Schroders Japan in Tokyo. ``The prospect for
recovery is quite remote.''
	   The Japanese economy was so ``fossilized'' that movements in
investments and labor weren't responding to market demand, Shipley
said in a telephone interview.
	   Tokyo-based economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had
forecast on average a 0.5 percent drop in GDP for the period from
July through September from the prior quarter.
	   The economy shrank by 0.7 percent for the April-June period,
compared to the previous quarter. That marked the third straight
quarter of decline and the worst record since the government began
releasing GDP data in 1955.
	   Initially, the EPA had reported the drop as 0.8 percent but
revised it on Thursday.
	   Japan's economy shrank by 0.7 percent for the last fiscal year
ended in March 1998, its first annual drop since 1974. The Japanese
economy hasn't shrunk two years in a row since the end of World War
II.

Vandals destroy gravestones in Jewish cemetery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Vandals knocked over and shattered more
than 50 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in the Georgian capital
early Thursday, authorities said.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the act, and police said
they were investigating. It was the second such incident at a
Jewish cemetery in Tbilisi in recent years.
	   Georgia's chief rabbi, Ariel Levin, denounced the ``barbarous
act,'' which he said was carried out by someone ``with provocative
goals.''
	   However, he added, ``Nobody will be able to cast a pall over
good and fraternal relations between Georgians and Jews, which have
existed for more than 26 centuries now.''

Russia strikes dlrs 150 million arms deal with Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will sell fighter jets, combat helicopters
and other military hardware to Ethiopia for dlrs 150 million, a
news agency reported on Thursday.
	   The four Su-27 fighter jets and several Mi-24 and Mi-8 combat
helicopters have been used by the Russian military, but are being
put out of service as part of cuts in the armed forces, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting military officials.
	   Russia will also provide Ethiopia with ammunition, as well as
communications and navigation equipment, it said.
	   The fighters will fly to Ethiopia on their own, while other
hardware will be airlifted by Russian military transport planes.
All weapons will be delivered later this month, the Interfax said.
	   During Soviet times, Ethiopia was a major recipient of Russian
military hardware.

Romania's outgoing ambassador to Bulgaria may become journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's outgoing ambassador to
Bulgaria who formerly headed the country's foreign intelligence may
become a journalist, he said Thursday.
	   Ioan Talpes, 54, who headed the country's international spy
agency from 1992 to 1997 quit as head of foreign intellignce in
1997 after admitting to a long-running contact between a Swiss
contact and Romanian intelligence officers that had compromised
Swiss-Romanian relations.
	   His resignation as ambassador which will become effective Dec.
20 was not connected to the reasons for leaving his previous job,
he said. He was named ambassador to Bulgaria by President Emil
Constantinescu a year ago.
	   ``I feel being embassador is not the right thing for me,'' said
Talpes by telephone. ``I have several offers and I will probably
express myself in the media.''
	   A military historian by training, Talpes has written dozens of
books, mainly on defense and diplomatic issues.

Police seize huge shipment of cocaine mixed with Colombian rum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Police have made what they
believe is the largest cocaine seizure in South Africa's history,
confiscating between 180 and 360 kilos (396 to 792 pounds) of the
drug which was dissolved in Colombian rum.
	   The precise amount of the cocaine seized Tuesday night was not
known because police haven't extracted it yet from the 11,600
bottles of Ron (rum) de Medellin. The central Colombian city was
the home of the Medellin cartel, a notorious and bloody drug
syndicate which had its heyday in the 1980s until its leaders were
killed or imprisoned.
	   At a minimum 15 grams of cocaine per bottle, the rum would have
been lethal to any unsuspecting person drinking it.
	   Police Inspector Frik Rabe said the shipment apparently
originated in Medellin. Investigators were still tracking down
shipping documents to confirm its point of origin.
	   Informers had told police the cocaine was to be delivered to a
Nigerian drug syndicate operating in the Johannesburg area. They
tipped police to the container's arrival at a harbor in Durban, an
eastern city on the Indian Ocean, on Nov. 25.
	   Police said they followed the container as it was trucked to a
Johannesburg depot and staked it out. When police felt it was
obvious the shipment was not going to be claimed, they seized it.
	   The value of the cocaine was estimated at between dlrs 8 million
and 16 million.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers assembled around a TV
set and watched a video of a Palestinian mob ambushing an Israeli
soldier. When the tape stopped, the decision was unanimous: Israel
would suspend its West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday's attack near
the West Bank town of Ramallah, in which the trapped soldier was
pulled out of a car and repeatedly struck in the head with rocks,
was a result of incitement by the Palestinian Authority against
Israel that must be stopped.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up implementation of the
land-for-security agreement until Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
publicly dropped plans to announce a state in May and accepted
Israel's criteria for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israel
has said it will not release Palestinian prisoners sentenced for
attacks that resulted in death or injury.
	   The Palestinians said the conditions were unacceptable and
appealed to the United States for help. U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin sided with the Palestinians, saying the Wye
River peace agreement ``should be implemented as signed.''
	   The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the peace
accord.
	   In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel
is to release 250 more Palestinian prisoners.
	   David Leavy, a White House spokesman, said that despite the
crisis, the Clinton trip was still on. A White House advance team
was to arrive in the region Thursday.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation with the
Palestinians has helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition.
	   In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend implementation
of the Wye agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said Thursday
they would not support an early elections bill as initially
planned.
	   The legislation was to have come before parliament Monday, but
its sponsors said they might delay the vote because they no longer
have a majority.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   In response, dozens of masked Palestinians blocked roads in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem with burning tires and threw
stones at cars. Israeli police fired rubber bullets.
	   Early Thursday, a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian
laborers from the Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they
were investigating whether the arsonists had political motives. The
fire was quickly extinguished and the laborers escaped unharmed.
	   After the attack on the Israeli soldier on Wednesday near the
West Bank town of Ramallah, Netanyahu convened his so-called
security Cabinet and played a videotape of the incident.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the
Cabinet room was very tense during the screening.
	   ``There was a unanimous decision,'' Hanegbi told Israel army
radio Thursday. ``We all said to ourselves that we had to stop this
quickly because if we do it after we give the territory, we will be
shirking our responsibility.''
	   However, the Palestinian Authority blamed Israel for the latest
crisis, saying it raised tensions by refusing to release
Palestinian prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival
of President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable,''
said chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and release 750 Palestinian prisoners by
January. In a first stage last month, it withdrew from 2 percent of
the area and set free 250 prisoners, but most were criminals, not
those held for anti-Israeli activities, as the Palestinian
authority had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings in Washington.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Jewish settlers, who oppose the latest peace deal, said that
they would put Ramallah under siege if the army did not do so in
retaliation for the attack on the soldier. ``We don't intend to
allow Jews to be attacked without a response,'' said settler leader
Aharon Domb.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian Muslim
leadership has welcomed the arrest of a Bosnian Serb general
indicted for war-crimes and hopes NATO will soon accelerate efforts
to arrest the architects of the Bosnian War.
	   On Wednesday, NATO troops arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic on
charges of alleged involvement in massacres of Muslims that
occurred after his troops overrun the eastern enclave of Srebrenica
in summer 1995.
	   Krstic was arrested in the northern part of Bosnia in the sector
controlled by U.S. troops.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic,
said Wednesday. ``We hope they will soon switch over to
commanders,'' referring to former Bosnian Serb President Radovan
Karadzic and military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic.
	   The arrest also brought to the surface tensions between the
Muslim-led government and the French, whom the Muslims accuse of
blocking efforts to apprehend leading suspects.
	   ``This could serve as a good example for the French troops who
have not yet arrested anybody and in who's region of control the
alleged civil and military commanders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic are still living,'' he said.
	   Karadzic and Mladic are the two main suspects among those
indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands.
	   The Bosnian Muslim leadership considers France as an obstacle to
the arrest of Bosnian Serb war cimes suspects after the French
government turned town a request of the International Tribunal to
allow its officers to testify before the court, a source close to
the Muslim leadership said.
	   Allegations that a French officer at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium was passing along information to Belgrade during
the October showdown over Kosovo has added to Muslim concerns about
France's role.
	   NATO-led French troops now control the eastern part of Bosnia
considered a ``heaven for war-criminals,'' said a source close to
the Muslim leadership.
	   ``We wonder how long this is going to go on with the French
here,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
	   Wednesday's action against Krstic was the first one to result in
the arrest of a more senior person in the Bosnian Serb military
structure and the first one related to the Srebrenica massacre in
which some 8,000 people went missing.
	   For the current political atmosphere in Bosnia, it would be
important for the masterminders of crime to be arrested, Hajric
said.
	   ``It would be a message to hundreds of thousands of refugees
that they can prepare themselves to go home,'' he said. While
war-criminals remain at large, no minority returns are expected to
occur in the areas they move around.
	   On last September's nationwide elections, the Bosnian Serbs
chose Nikola Poplasen, a Bosnian Serb ultranationalist for
president of their half of Bosnia, to the frustration of
international agencies charged with the implementation of peace.
	   ``This would also be an important message to Nikola Poplasen
that would made him understand that his policy has come to an
end,'' Hajric stressed.

Japanese stocks tumble amid uncertainties about Wall Street, dollar

 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices tumbled Thursday amid
uncertainties about U.S. financial markets and Japan's economy. The
U.S. dollar fell sharply against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 289.54 points,
or 1.93 percent, closing the day's trading at 14,697.08 points. On
Wednesday, the index rose 151.21 points, or 1.02 percent.
	   The dollar bought 119.23 yen in late afternoon, down 2.65 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 119.93 yen overnight.
	   The Tokyo stock market started lower as an overnight decline on
Wall Street discouraged investors in Tokyo.
	   Also making many investors bearish was uncertainty about the
Japanese government's upcoming economic measures, traders said.
	   ``The market lacks both buying and selling incentives and
activities are sparse,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko
Securities Co.
	   After Thursday's market closed, the Economic Planning Agency
reported Japan's economy shrank for a fourth straight quarter,
confirming what many had feared: The country remains in its deepest
recession in decades.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the nation _ contracted 0.7 percent in the
July to September quarter from the previous term for an annual rate
of 2.6 percent.
	   The government announced a stimulus package last month including
public works spending at the urging of Japan's trading partners,
but economists said the effects of the steps remain unclear.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 18.26 points, or 1.59 percent, to 1,128.89 points.
The TOPIX rose 4.89 points, or 0.43 percent, the previous day.
	   Trading was moderate, with about 324 million shares changing
hands on the exchange's first section, compared with Wednesday's
turnover of 324 million shares. Declines overwhelmed advancers
1,034 to 153, with 117 issues unchanged.
	   On the foreign exchange market, rumors that a U.S. hedge fund
was selling dollars to cover emerging market losses and a drop in
Standard and Poor's 500 futures auguring another decline on Wall
Street sent the dollar to its lowest level in almost two weeks,
traders said.
	   ``The biggest reason for the dollar's fall is the drop on the S
and P,'' said Yuhiko Kaji, vice president of foreign exchange at
Sakura Bank.
	   The dollar ranged between 118.95 yen and 120.52 yen in
Thursday's trading.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
1.090 percent from Wednesday's close of 1.155 percent, driving its
price up to 106.13 yen from the previous day's 105.53 yen.

Japan's Fujitsu, Toshiba link-up to produce advanced computer chips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's largest computer electronics makers,
Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corp., announced Thursday they will join
hands to develop advanced semiconductors.
	   The two companies plan to spend more than 30 billion yen (dlrs
252 million) on the joint project, which will involve a team of
about 100 researchers, they said in a statement.
	   The move comes amid a prolonged slump in prices for computer
memory chips, which has forced many chipmakers to reassess plans to
single-handedly invest huge sums in development and production of
the latest semiconductors.
	   Fujitsu and Toshiba said they expect to benefit by sharing the
cost and risk of developing next-generation computer chips, such as
one-gigabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips.
	   A one-gigabit DRAM can store the equivalent of 100,000 pages of
newspaper text, or about four times more than the current
generation of top-line 256-megabit computer memory chips.
	   Fujitsu and Toshiba hope to make one-gigabit chips commercially
available by March 2002, at least one year earlier than industry
forecasts had estimated, said Kazunari Shirai, senior
vice-president at Fujitsu.

Owners meet, concerned about small markets

 &UR; Eds: Meeting starts at 1900 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Worried about the widening payroll disparity in
baseball, owners are planning a special meeting to listen to
commissioner Bud Selig's assessment.
	   Latest estimates have the top earning club with dlrs 170 million
in revenue this year, and the bottom team taking in only dlrs 35
million.
	   ``We have a myriad of subjects to discuss,'' Selig said
Wednesday of Thursday's scheduled meeting. ``Certainly the
disparity question is a primary one. I wanted to have a meeting
before that January meeting. That's why we're gathering.''
	   Anaheim, Arizona, Atlanta, Baltimore, the New York Mets and the
New York Yankees all have signed players to deals worth dlrs 40
million or more, with the Mets giving Mike Piazza dlrs 91 million
for seven years, the Yankees giving Bernie Williams dlrs 87.5
million for seven seasons and the Angels giving Mo Vaughn dlrs 80
million for six years.
	   Top baseball officials, speaking on the condition they not be
identified, already have concluded 15-18 of the 30 teams have been
eliminated from contention for the eight playoffs spots next season
_ simply because they can't generate enough revenue to field a
lineup to compete with the best teams.
	   Selig says he will steer clear of anything that approaches
collusion.
	   When commissioner Peter Ueberroth preached ``fiscal
responsibility'' in the mid-1980s, teams stopped signing free
agents, resulting in arbitrators finding the clubs violated the
anticollusion provision of their labor agreement. The case
eventually was settled for dlrs 280 million, and the current labor
agreement has a provision for triple damages.
	   ``I have said, and I will say it again, I know what I can do and
I'm also acutely aware of what I can't do,'' Selig said. ``Anything
that will be done will be well thought out and within what legally
we can do.''
	   Union head Donald Fehr said he didn't have collusion concerns at
this point.
	   ``It would violate not only the letter but the spirit of the
agreement if anything that happened at this meeting in any way
affected the individual nature of club decision-making with respect
to free-agent players,'' he said. '' I have been assured that it
won't, and I'm prepared to take that assurance at face value unless
or until elements suggest otherwise.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese economy shrank for the fourth straight
quarter, continuing to wallow in the nation's deepest recession in
decades, the government said Thursday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ declined by 0.7 percent in the
three months from July through September, compared to the previous
quarter, the Economic Planning Agency said.
	   The economy contracted at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, the
agency said.
	   Japan has been battered by Asia's financial meltdown, which has
slashed exports, long the mainstay of its economic growth.
	   Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya expressed hopes
that the economy may be hitting bottom and nearing ``a dawn.''
	   But he reiterated that the economy's performance during this
fiscal year, which ends next March, may turn out to be worse than
the government prediction of a 1.8 percent contraction.
	   ``These figures actually were a little better than I expected,''
he said. ``The pace of decline is slowing.''
	   Economists were more pessimistic about when the effects of the
government steps might be felt.
	   ``The government is shrugging this off as ancient history, but
there are problems still plaguing this economy,'' said Andrew
Shipley, economist at Schroders Japan in Tokyo. ``The prospect for
recovery is quite remote.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After thrice failing to auction it off
lock, stock and barrel, creditors said Thursday they were willing
to sell bankrupt Hanbo Steel Industry Co. piece by piece if
necessary.
	   ``We've decided to open our doors to all kinds of offers'' in a
new auction tentatively set for Dec. 15, said Chung Ki-hyun, a
spokesman for Korea First Bank, the failed steelmaker's chief
creditor.
	   ``Bidders can seek to buy facilities only or the entire
company,'' Chung said. ``There will be no minimum price, either.''
	   Local media, quoting unidentified sources, said U.S. Steel and
other steelmakers from China, Taiwan, India, Brazil and the
Netherlands have shown interest.
	   Three previous auctions last year failed because potential
buyers wanted to take over only certain facilities, not the whole
company including its debts.
	   As the sell-off efforts dragged on, the number of Hanbo
employees decreased from 3,100 to 1,300 and the steelmaker was
forced to shut down parts of its production lines earlier this
year.
	   Like many other big South Korean businesses, Hanbo had borrowed
heavily to finance its aggressive expansion in the early 1990s. But
sales lagged amid a prolonged economic slowdown, creating a serious
cash crunch.
	   Hanbo is the second major South Korean firm to be put up for
sale. Kia Motors Co. which collapsed last year with dlrs 1 billion
in bank loans was recently sold to South Korean carmaker Hyundai
Motor Co.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ British banking giant HSBC Holdings will freeze
salaries for more than 13,000 employees at its flagship unit, Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. in Hong Kong.
	   The decision was made recently, to ``reflect economic
conditions'' in the territory, Gareth Hewett, a company spokesman,
said Thursday. He declined to say if the bank expects the Hong Kong
economy to deteriorate further.
	   HSBC makes up about 25 percent to 30 percent of the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
	   Since the Asian financial turmoil hit Hong Kong in October 1997,
the economy has suffered rising unemployment and massive lay-offs
and freezes on salaries.
	   HSBC's other local subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank Ltd., said it
hasn't yet decided on employees' pay scales for next year, a
spokeswoman for the bank said Thursday.
	   The board usually makes decisions on salaries before late
December every year, she said.
	   Hang Seng Bank employs about 7,800 staff in Hong Kong.
	   ___
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong will increase the lending ceiling for
mortgages offered by banks early next year, a change expected to
stimulate the territory's beleaguered property and banking sectors,
the financial secretary announced Thursday.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank, will raise its 70 percent ceiling on mortgages
offered by banks to 85 percent next year, Donald Tsang said.
	   The move is expected to increase bank loans for property
transactions. It will shrink the down payment required of real
estate buyers and allow banks to earn more interest by expanding
lending without taking on additional risk.
	   Tsang said the new, higher ceiling, expected to take effect
early next year, will not apply to all mortgages, but he didn't
immediately provide further details on the selection criteria.
	   Hong Kong's property market has been in a slump since the fourth
quarter of last year as potential buyers, spooked by falling
property prices, ballooning unemployment and high interest rates
hold off on investment plans.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Bad loans of the 54 commercial banks
operating in the Philippines rose sharply in September as more
companies failed to meet their debt obligations on time.
	   Central bank Governor Gabriel Singson said Thursday the
non-performing loan ratio of the country's commercial banks hit
11.04 percent at the end of September, up from the previous month's
10.51 percent.
	   There are no comparative year-earlier figures since the central
bank only began tracking banks' non-performing loan ratios on a
monthly basis in January. In previous years, it monitored bad loan
ratios on a quarterly basis.
	   During the quarter that ended in September 1997, the
non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks was 3.96 percent.
	   Singson was not disturbed by the rise in bad loans.
	   ``We have the lowest non-performing loan ratio in the (Asian)
region, at least among those affected by the regional crisis,'' he
said.
	   He did not provide comparative figures for the other countries
in the region.

	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Porsche AG announced Thursday that it
nearly doubled net profits in its latest business year to a record
276.9 million marks (dlrs 166 million), and said sales continue to
grow strongly.
	   The luxury sports car maker's sales surged 20 percent during the
year ended Aug. 31 to 4.928 billion marks (dlrs 2.95 billion), also
a record.
	   The latest full-year net earnings were up from 139.4 million
marks (dlrs 83.5 million) in 1997.
	   Growth continued in the first four months of the new fiscal
year, with sales up a preliminary 34 percent compared to the same
period last year, Porsche said.
	   Paced by the Boxster and the 911 series, Porsche pushed up car
deliveries to 36,686, some 13 percent more than in the previous
fiscal year.
	   In North America, 26 percent more Porsches _ a total of 16,190 _
were sold than during the year before.

Clemens demands trade, Mets sign Ventura, Cubs keep Rodriguez
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As if the New York Yankees aren't already good
enough, now there's a chance the World Series champions could be
adding Roger Clemens.
	   The five-time Cy Young Award winner shook up baseball's frenzied
marketplace Wednesday, telling the Toronto Blue Jays to trade him
to a contender or closer to home.
	   ``Who wouldn't have an interest in Clemens?'' Yankees general
manager Brian Cashman said. ``I'm sure Toronto will have many
discussions with us before this is over with.''
	   Meanwhile, more big money went to free agents, with third
baseman Robin Ventura finalizing his dlrs 32 million, four-year
contract with the New York Mets and Henry Rodriguez returning to
the Chicago Cubs for an dlrs 8.9 million, two-year deal.
	   Even Carlos Hernandez struck it rich. After just one season as a
starter, the catcher worked out a dlrs 6.5 million, three-year
contract to stay with the San Diego Padres.
	   Coming up: The Mets are talking about adding another star,
negotiating to sign career steals leader Rickey Henderson.
	   Clemens' decision to leave Toronto was the biggest news. When he
signed with the Blue Jays in December 1996, team president Paul
Beeston said if Clemens didn't think Toronto would contend and
asked for a trade, the Blue Jays would deal him.
	   Beeston left the Blue Jays during the 1997 season to become
baseball's chief operating officer and Clemens went on to win
consecutive Cy Young awards, becoming the only five-time winner.
	   Toronto general manager Gord Ash said he will honor Beeston's
commitment.
	   ``This is certainly not done with any acrimony or with any anger
on either side,'' Ash said, adding the team will make every effort
to complete a deal within 10 days.
	   The Yankees, Houston Astros and Texas Rangers are considered the
top contenders to land the 36-year-old right-hander, 20-6 with a
2.65 ERA and 271 strikeouts in 234 2-3 innings last season. He went
unbeaten in his final 22 starts, winning 15 decisions after
starting 5-6.
	   Clemens is signed for 1999 at dlrs 8 million and 2000 at dlrs
8.1 million. The Blue Jays were 88-74 last season, finishing four
games behind Boston in the wild-card race and 26 games behind New
York, which went 114-48, setting an AL record for wins.
	   But Toronto has made little effort to re-sign Jose Canseco and
appears to be going with youth.
	   ``We recognize they would have a decent team,'' said Clemens'
agent, Randy Hendricks. ``The reality is, they're not prepared to
add players and contend at the highest level.''
	   Ventura, a five-time Gold Glove and potent left-handed bat, also
talked to Baltimore after the Chicago White Sox decided not to meet
his contract demands.
	   ``They were looking for a left-handed hitting third baseman, and
I kind of fit that,'' Ventura said of the Mets. ``After being on a
young team the last couple years, I was looking for a team that
could compete. It boiled down to going to the place with the best
chance of winning, and that's why I'm here.''
	   Ventura, who made dlrs 6.1 million this year, gets a dlrs 1
million signing bonus with dlrs 250,000 payable on July 1 of each
of the next four years. He gets dlrs 6.75 million next season, dlrs
7.75 million in 2000 and dlrs 8.25 million in each of the final two
years. He has a limited no-trade clause.
	   The Mets have now committed dlrs 155 million this offseason to
three players. They re-signed Mike Piazza to a dlrs 91 million,
seven-year deal, and kept pitching ace Al Leiter with a dlrs 32
million, four-year contract.
	   In their search for a leadoff hitter, the Mets are talking to
Henderson. Mets general manager Steve Phillips met with Henderson's
agents for two hours Wednesday night at Shea Stadium.
	   ``Rickey is certainly the most obvious corner outfielder that
might satisfy the leadoff position,'' Phillips said.
	   Rodriguez, acquired by the Cubs from Montreal last December for
pitcher Miguel Batista, hit .251 last season with 31 homers and 85
RBIs. After making dlrs 2.7 million last season, he gets a dlrs
200,000 signing bonus, dlrs 3.6 million next year and dlrs 4.5
million in 2000.
	   Chicago has a dlrs 5.2 million option for 2001 with a dlrs
600,000 buyout. If the option is exercised, the contract would be
worth dlrs 13.5 million over three years.
	   The Cubs also signed right-hander Scott Sanders, released by San
Diego on Nov. 17. Sanders, 29, pitched in 23 games for the NL
champions, going 3-1 with 26 strikeouts, five walks and a 4.11 ERA
in 30 2-3 innings.
	   Hernandez hit .252 with nine homers and 52 RBIs this season and
batted .325 in 14 postseason games for San Diego, including a
team-high .417 in the first-round win over Houston.
	   ``The one thing we've had that's been a problem over the last
couple of years is the ever-changing catcher when you're trying to
develop pitchers,'' Padres general manager Kevin Towers said.
``This should give us a little bit of continuity, which is
important.''
	   The Padres apparently will lose center fielder Steve Finley, who
is close to signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Finley
apparently will get a four-year deal. He had been seeking dlrs 6
million a year.
	   ``We are going to go there, it looks like,'' Finley's agent,
Tommy Tanzer, said late Wednesday night. ``It looks pretty solid.''

Creditors try again to sell bankrupt Korean steelmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After failing to find a buyer for
Hanbo Steel Industry Co., creditors said Thursday they were willing
to sell off the bankrupt steelmaker piece by piece if necessary.
	   ``We've decided to open our doors to all kinds of offers'' in a
new auction tentatively set for Dec. 15, said Chung Ki-hyun, a
spokesman for Korea First Bank, Hanbo Steel's chief creditor.
	   ``Bidders can seek to buy facilities only or the entire
company,'' Chung said. ``There will be no minimum price, either.''
	   Local media, quoting unidentified sources, said U.S. Steel and
other steelmakers from China, Taiwan, India, Brazil and the
Netherlands have shown interest.
	   Three previous auctions last year failed because potential
buyers wanted to take over only certain facilities, not the whole
company including its debts.
	   As the sell-off efforts dragged on, the number of Hanbo
employees decreased from 3,100 to 1,300 and the steelmaker was
forced to shut down parts of its production lines earlier this
year.
	   Like many other big South Korean businesses, Hanbo had borrowed
heavily to finance its aggressive expansion in the early 1990s. But
sales lagged amid a prolonged economic slowdown, creating a serious
cash crunch.
	   A prosecution investigation into Hanbo's bankruptcy uncovered a
major bribes-for-loans scandal involving politicians, bankers and
government officials.
	   About a dozen people, including Hanbo's owner, Chung Tae-soo,
were convicted of giving or taking bribes in exchange for
low-interest bank loans used to keep the company afloat.
	   Hanbo is the second major South Korean firm to be put on the
auction block. Kia Motors Co., which collapsed last year with dlrs
1 billion in bank loans, was recently sold to South Korean carmaker
Hyundai Motor Co.

Inmates escape from Tehran prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Several inmates were able to escape as they
were being taken from Tehran's notorious Evin Prison to court for
trial, the Tehran Times reported Thursday.
	   It said it had conflicting reports on the number of prisoners
who escaped. It cited a source as saying 11 inmates had managed to
get away earlier this week and another saying less than 11 had
escaped.
	   The paper gave no details as to how the inmates escaped and did
not say if they were political prisoners or common criminals.
	   Prison authorities would not comment on the report.
	   A police hunt in the vicinity of the prison failed to find the
prisoners, the paper said.
	   Evin Prison, which is wedged between steep hills and a suburban
neighborhood in northern Tehran, is believed to be Iran's largest
jail, housing hardened criminals and political prisoners.

Johnson tries for reinstatement with Athletics Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ben Johnson has filed an application for
reinstatement with Canada's track and field federation, the Toronto
Star reported Thursday.
	   Athletics Canada, the governing body, will discuss Johnson's
request at their general annual meeting in Ottawa this weekend.
Johnson was banned for life after twice testing positive for drugs
_ including at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.
	   Johnson tried to win reinstatement through the Ontario courts by
saying his lifetime ban is a restraint of trade, but lost that case
and a subsequent appeal in September.
	   ``I now feel that dialogue can take place now that the court
case is behind us,'' Athletics Canada president John Thresher told
the Star.
	   If Athletics Canada agrees to put forward Johnson's application,
it would go before the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport, which
would appoint an independent arbitrator to hear the sprinter's
case.
	   If successful in Canada, Johnson would still have to appeal to
the world governing body of track and field (IAAF) to compete
internationally.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong workers were dealt another blow
Thursday when British banking giant HSBC Holdings announced it will
freeze salaries for more than 13,000 employees in the territory at
its flagship unit, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
	   Union officials said they expect more companies to follow HSBC's
lead in freezing or cutting salaries ahead of Chinese New Year in
February, the time when most companies review and restructure
operations.
	   Unemployment is already at 5.3 percent, the highest level since
1981 when officials started collecting such data, and is expected
to climb even further.
	   Gareth Hewett, an HSBC spokesman, said the decision was made
recently to ``reflect economic conditions'' in the territory. He
declined to say if the bank expects the Hong Kong economy to
deteriorate further.
	   The bank, which makes up about 25 percent to 30 percent of the
blue-chip Hang Seng Index on the Hong Kong stock exchange, reported
that profits in the first half of this year dropped 41 percent from
a year before to 6.09 billion Hong Kong dlrs (U.S. dlrs 783
million). Officials blamed dwindling profits on more bad loans and
falling asset values in Asia.
	   Most Hong Kong Bank employees reacted to the news calmly.
	   ``We've been anticipating some changes for some time, and most
of us were glad to hear that at least our salaries won't be cut,''
said a bank manager, who would only identify herself by her
surname, Wong.
	   ``It's quite natural for the bank to follow the market trend''
in cutting costs, she said.
	   Since the Asian financial turmoil hit Hong Kong in October 1997,
Hong Kong's economy has suffered rising unemployment and massive
lay-offs and freezes on salaries.
	   The government announced last Friday that the economy slid 7
percent in the third quarter, the biggest decline since records
were kept in Hong Kong.
	   Local banks are caught in the global liquidity crunch and a
property market slump, which has seen land prices tumble 50
percent.
	   More companies are expected to fold or to announce massive
layoffs and salary cuts ahead of the Chinese New Year.
	   More than 450 people have lost their jobs so far this week as
two major companies _ Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company and
Citibank _ announced layoffs.
	   In September, Hong Kong Telecommunications, the territory's
largest employer, announced across-the-board pay cuts, which were
later rejected by union leaders. The company is still in
negotiation with union officials on cost-cutting plans.
	   HSBC's other local subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank Ltd., said it
hasn't yet decided on employees' pay scales for next year, a
spokeswoman for the bank said Thursday.
	   The board will make a decision on salaries of Hang Seng's 7,800
employees in Hong Kong by late December, she said.

Burundian rebels kill more than 20 fellow Hutus, army says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Rebels killed more than 20 fellow
Hutus who sought refugee in a camp, accusing them of collaborating
with the Tutsi-led army, a military spokesman said Thursday.
	   Rebels attacked Gihungwe, 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of
Bujumbura, early Wednesday, killing more than 20 Hutus, including
children, and wounding at least 33, local officials said.
	   It was the second attack on the camp since November. In the
first, rebels killed 26 Hutus. On Nov. 23, rebels killed 23 Hutus
who lived in the nearby village.
	   Col. Mammert Sinarinzi, army spokesman, said in all three cases
Hutu rebels took revenge on Hutu civilians they believed were
cooperating with the army, rather than backing their rebellion.
	   Hutu rebels are fighting to topple the military rule of Pierre
Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority, which accounts for 14
percent of Burundi's population of 6 million. Hutus account for 85
percent.
	   More than 200,000 people have been killed since 1993 when
violence erupted in the East African nation after Tutsi
paratroopers killed the country's first democratically elected
president, a Hutu.

Speedway president bringing Formula One to Indianapolis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Tony George is reaching deep into his
pockets to bring Formula One racing to the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway.
	   He's investing millions to create a road course to bring the
international circuit into the United States for the first time
since 1991, but he will have to wait until next year before
learning when the race will be held.
	   George and Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive of the
international circuit, announced Wednesday they reached an
agreement for a multiyear agreement that will begin with the
running of the U.S. Grand Prix in 2000.
	   ``There is a lot that remains to be done to have our facility
ready for the new millennium, and this is going to be a very
important event for us,'' George said. ``This will establish the
face of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway heading into the new
millennium.''
	   George said making a profit on the event is not a major goal.
His initial cost for the first race, including construction and
promoter's fees could top dlrs 25 million, and Ecclestone said that
Formula One will retain all television revenue from the event.
	   Major renovations will be made at the famed 2 1/2-mile
(4-kilometer) oval, and work already has begun on the first
reconfiguration at the speedway since it was built in 1909.
	   ``Today marks the realization of a personal dream of mine since
becoming president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1990. That
is to give the United States Grand Prix a permanent home that it
deserves here in Indianapolis,'' George said. ``The U.S. Grand Prix
will join the Indianapolis 500 and the Brickyard 400 to give us
three world-class events.''
	   The F-1 race will be run on a 13-turn course that, unlike other
races at the track, will include both right and left turns. The F-1
cars will race in the opposite direction than the Indy 500 and
Brickyard 400. The new course will be constructed using part of the
existing track and part of the current infield.
	   ``This isn't a huge construction project. It is an incredibly
logistically complicated project,'' said Kevin Forbes, the track's
director of engineering and construction.
	   Forbes said construction is scheduled to be completed by either
April or August of 2000 and could be ongoing during the next two
Indianapolis 500s and Brickyard 400s.
	   Thirty-six pitside garages with suites above them will be
constructed in what is now a seating area, and demolition of a
portion of the tower terrace will begin within a week. A new press
box with seating space for 400 writers, lockers and darkrooms for
photographers and 40 television broadcast booths is included in the
construction plans, along with a new media center and control
tower.
	   The race date and possible dates for testing by F-1 teams will
be determined by the circuit next year.
	   Formula One has only one event scheduled in North America on its
1999 schedule, which includes 17 events in 16 countries. The
Canadian Grand Prix is scheduled in Montreal next June 13.
	   ``It was proposed that we run two weeks after the Canadian Grand
Prix,'' George said. ``That would definitely be a challenge.''
	   The challenge comes because the Indy 500 is run in late May and
the Brickyard 400 is held in early August.
	   ``To change the facility over from the end of May to a road race
and then turn it back around for an oval race within a span of 65
days ... From a timing standpoint, in the interest of all three
events we would like to not have to work with that (time frame),''
George said. ``In the interest of all three of our events, a fall
date would work nice.''
	   No matter when the race is held, George was delighted to have an
agreement after months of talks over bringing it to his facility.
	   ``The U.S. Grand Prix will join the Indianapolis 500 and the
Brickyard 400 at the world's most famous speedway, underscoring the
words that are chiseled in stone over the entrance of this building
_ `The racing capital of the world,''' George said.
	   The facility was used only for the Indianapolis 500 from 1911 to
l993. The Brickyard 400, a NASCAR Winston Cup event, became an
annual event in 1994. This year, the International Race of
Champions made Indy part of its series.
	   Seating for the F-1 race will be over 200,000.
	   This is not the first time the track has been associated with
Formula One. From 1950-1960, Formula One points were given in the
Indianapolis 500, but few regulars competed in the event.

Hong Kong to relax mortgage ceiling to stimulate property sector
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADs thruout to ADD details, comments and CLARIFY that only
selected banks are eligible &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong will ease restrictions on bank
lending to home buyers early next year in a move aimed at reviving
the territory's beleaguered real estate and banking sectors, the
financial secretary announced Thursday.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank, will allow banks to lend up to 85 percent of the
value of the dwelling to be purchased, lifting the current ceiling
of 70 percent.
	   The change will permit home buyers to purchase properties with a
smaller down payment. Home buyers will need to put down just 15
percent of the home's value, instead of the current 30 percent
requirement, making it easier for young and low-income families to
buy homes.
	   The move is expected to boost bank lending for property
transactions, said financial secretary Donald Tsang.
	   The government-backed Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, which was
set up to buy mortgages from selected banks, will secure the extra
15 percent of the mortgages at a fee, he said.
	   That will allow banks to earn more interest by expanding lending
without taking on additional risk, Tsang said.
	   Real estate-related stocks rallied on the news. The index
tracking property shares closed up 2.5 percent, defying the
blue-chip Hang Seng Index, which slipped 9.63 points to 10,046.15.
	   Henderson Land shares closed up 2.6 percent at 38.90 Hong Kong
dollars, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 3.2 percent to end at
56.50.
	   Tsang said the new, higher ceiling, expected to take effect
early next year, will only apply to 31 banks already approved to do
business with the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation.
	   The change will also be limited to buyers who will live in the
residence.
	   Hong Kong's property market has been in a slump since the fourth
quarter of last year as potential buyers, spooked by falling
property prices, ballooning unemployment and high interest rates,
hold off on investment plans.
	   Average prices have fallen by over 50 percent, prompting the
government to suspend a land sales program in June. Analysts are
split over whether a recent slight rebound in property sales
indicates the market has begun to bottom out.
	   The analysts said Thursday the benefits of the change for
property developers would be minimal. That's because property
companies still won't be able to significantly raise prices after
the change, and many are selling new projects at such low prices
they barely make a profit.
	   ``I don't think buyers are going to start accepting higher
prices,'' said David Faulkner, an executive at Brooke
International, a property consulting firm.

Car-rich Martina takes first driving lesson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Martina Hingis, whose tennis ability
has already gained her four cars, has taken her first driving
lesson.
	   Hingis, who turned 18 last Sept. 30 and thus became eligible for
a Swiss driver's license, ventured into traffic for the first time
Wednesday.
	   ``I won't have to depend on somebody else to get around, go
shopping or just go out,'' a smiling Hingis was quoted as telling
the Lausanne daily Le Matin from behind the wheel of her red
hatchback.
	   She has already studied the rules of the road, said her
instructor Walter Frei. ``She's very serious in her attitude toward
driving.''
	   Her only problem on the first day was starting her stick-shift
car uphill, said the mass-circulation Zurich daily Blick.
	   Hingis, who has won two Porsches in tennis tournaments and has
been given two Opels by her sponsor, needs at least a month more in
training before she will be able to take the test and drive them
alone.

Heating shortages forces families to leave homes in northern
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 130 families have moved out of their
homes and into office buildings and a military base in Russia's far
northeast due to a lack of heating fuel, a news report said
Thursday.
	   Blizzards and temperatures of minus 25 Celsius (minus 13
Fahrenheit) forced the families out in Cape Schmidt, on the
northern coast of the Chukotka Peninsula, which juts out toward
Alaska, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The region has been plagued by chronic fuel shortages in recent
years, and last month the government evacuated more than 1,000
people because it was too expensive to supply them with food and
fuel during the winter.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government has been unable to provide
subsidies as the Soviet Union did, and as a result, Chukotka's
population has shrunk by half to 80,000 during this decade.
	   Meanwhile, in the Kamchatka Peninsula, which is south of
Chukotka, a local legislator began a hunger strike to protest the
federal government's failure to deliver fuel and other supplies to
the region.
	   Lawmaker Alexander Ivanov noted that Sergei Shoigu, the minister
for emergency situations, visited the region last month and agreed
to provide urgent help. But Ivanov said conditions have only been
getting worse.
	   Power supplies were cut Wednesday to apartments in the main
city, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Electricity was being supplied only
to hospitals and other places that provide essential services.

US prods China to open up aviation market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. officials trying to prod China to increase
air passenger and cargo services between the countries drew an
unexpectedly encouraging response from their Chinese counterparts
in talks that ended Thursday.
	   The U.S. team pitched increasing the number of flights, both
direct and through third countries, and ticketing agreements
between airlines, said David Marchick, deputy assistant secretary
of state for transportation.
	   ``The discussion was very comprehensive, very detailed, very
forward looking and in a very cooperative manner,'' Marchick said.
``This has been in contrast to previous discussions which were more
contentious.''
	   In three previous meetings, Marchick said Civil Aviation deputy
director Shen Yuankang gave him 20 minutes; this time the pair
talked for six hours over two days.
	   Another round of meetings is planned in Washington later this
month and, if all goes well, formal negotiations on a new air
services agreement could begin early next year, Marchick said.
	   Pushing air services is part of the Clinton administration's
trade strategy. Washington has already concluded 31 open-skies
agreements _ which Marchick likened to ``free trade of the air'' _
and an expanded air accord with Japan.
	   China is one of the countries it is now targeting.
	   Washington is seeking to increase the current weekly total of 54
passenger and cargo flights and expand code-sharing arrangements
between airlines to facilitate travel.
	   U.S. airlines Delta and American and cargo handlers United
Parcel Services and Polar want to get into China, which is now
served by Northwest and United airlines and Federal Express.
	   Air ``service with the United States and China lags far behind
the other elements of our economic relationship,'' Marchick said.
	   An outline of the presentation Marchick gave the Chinese
officials showed that China's dlrs 75 billion in trade with the
United States was 40 percent of U.S.-Japanese trade, but flights
were just one-tenth of those between the United States and Japan.
	   Marchick said business executives want to invest in places they
can travel to easily. He told the Chinese that it took him three
flights, including a five-hour layover in Tokyo, to reach Beijing
from Washington.

18 international crime rings in Canada, spy agency warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Eighteen international crime organizations are
operating in Canada, the national Security Intelligence Service
warns.
	   These organizations include various Mafia groups, Russian and
Eastern European mobs, Japanese yakuza, Asian triads, Colombian
drug cartels, Jamaican posses, and Nigerian gangs, CSIS said in a
report released Wednesday.
	   They are active in insurance fraud, environmental crime, migrant
smuggling, bank fraud and corruption, said the report which
outlined a role for CSIS in fighting crime.
	   The gangs, which often use a legitimate business as a front,
never hesitate to use violence or murder.
	   Using a United Nations formula, the report estimates that in
1995 international crime-related losses to the domestic economy
would have been about U.S. dlrs 9.2 billion.
	   The CSIS is not a police agency. It is primarily a spy-catching
and counterterrorism service.

Miyamoto takes four-stroke first round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INAGI, Japan (AP) _ Japan's young pro Katsumasa Miyamoto sank an
eagle en route to a six-under-par 64 and took a four-stroke
first-round lead in the 100 million yen (dlrs 833,000) Golf Nippon
Series JT Cup, a tournament for the year's top golfers in Japan.
	   The 26-year-old Miyamoto, seeking his second career victory this
year, sank a 17-meter (56-foot) putt eagle on the 541-yard, par-5
sixth hole.
	   Miyamoto also had six birdies and two bogeys on the 6,960-yard,
par-70 Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club course in the outskirts of Tokyo.
	   Four strokes off Miyamoto at 68s were two Japanese _ Masashi
``Jumbo'' Ozaki and Nobuhito Sato.
	   Jumbo Ozaki is the eldest of three Ozaki brothers and leads the
Japan PGA money ranking list with two tournaments left this season.
	   Ozaki has earned 166.63 million yen (dlrs 1.4 million) with
three victories so far this season. Brandt Jobe of the United
States stood second with 95.17 million yen (dlrs 793,000).
	   Frankie Minoza of the Philippines shot a 69 and tied fourth
place with Toshimitsu Izawa of Japan.
	   Teeing off in the cold cloudy weather were an elite field of 26
made up of this year's tournament winners, the defending champion
and the top 20 on the Japan PGA money earning list.
	   The temperature on the course was a chill 4 Celsius degrees (39
F).
	   Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama shot a 74 and tied 22th
place with his fellow Japanese Keiichiro Fukabnori and Todd
Hamilton of the United States.
	   The winner will collect 30 million yen (dlrs 250,000).

Car-rich Martina takes first driving lesson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Martina Hingis, whose tennis ability
has already earned her four cars, has taken her first driving
lesson.
	   Hingis, who turned 18 on Sept. 30 and thus became eligible for a
Swiss driver's license, ventured into traffic for the first time
Wednesday.
	   ``I won't have to depend on somebody else to get around, go
shopping or just go out,'' a smiling Hingis was quoted as telling
the Lausanne daily Le Matin from behind the wheel of her red
hatchback.
	   She has already studied the rules of the road, said her
instructor Walter Frei. ``She's very serious in her attitude toward
driving.''
	   Her only problem on the first day was starting her stick-shift
car uphill, said the mass-circulation Zurich daily Blick.
	   Hingis, who has won two Porsches in tennis tournaments and has
been given two Opels by her sponsor, needs at least a month more in
training before she will be able to take the test and drive her
cars herself.

Baseball team investigating reports of sign stealing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for PMs. UPDATES with Japanese media reporting Oh may
be punished if team behind scandal.
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Former Japanese star slugger Sadaharu Oh could face
a lifetime ban from baseball if an investigation finds that the
team that he manages was orchestrating a reported sign-stealing
scam.
	   Oh, who holds Japan's career record of 868 home runs, has not
been directly implicated in the embarrassing allegations against
his Daiei Hawks that have riveted this baseball-crazy country.
	   And the three players accused in the scam have denied
wrongdoing.
	   ``I can't believe it,'' Oh said. ``I'd like to believe my
players.''
	   According to the charges, which first surfaced Wednesday, a team
employee sitting in front of a TV monitor watched footage from one
of four cameras around Fukuoka Dome, Daiei's home stadium, that
clearly showed the catcher of the other team.
	   The employee deciphered the catcher's signs and used a
walkie-talkie to tell what pitch was coming to a youngster in the
stands, who had been specially hired for the job, Japanese media
reports said.
	   The youngster then relayed that information to the batter, using
his megaphone.
	   A megaphone held before his face meant the pitcher was about to
throw a fastball. A megaphone held out toward the right was a curve
or a slider, and to the left a forkball, the reports say.
	   Daiei _ which tied for third this season in the six-club Pacific
League _ is carrying out an investigation and has promised to
present its findings to the league office within a week.
	   Speculation grew that Oh may have to resign to take
responsibility for the cheating, which allegedly began last year
and continued into the latest season ending in October.
	   In Japan, people in leadership positions often have to step down
when a scandal happens, even if they are not directly involved.
	   Blatant spying is against Japanese professional baseball rules.
	   Although the Pacific League does not clearly state the penalties
for violations, some Japanese media reports said Thursday that Oh
could be hit with a lifetime ban if the investigation finds that
the team was behind the scandal.
	   The rival Central League has the punishment in writing,
including a possible lifetime ban.
	   Trying to figure out an opposing team's strategy by deciphering
managers' and players' signs is common, especially in Japanese
baseball, which, unlike the U.S. major leagues, tends to rely more
on strategy than physical prowess.

European defense identity on agenda at Anglo-French summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French and British leaders were beginning a two-day
summit meeting Thursday evening that seeks to give Europe more
military muscle and resolve to counterbalance U.S. power.
	   The European Union, sensitive to criticism that it reacts too
slowly and in disjointed fashion to crises such as Kosovo, is
seeking to forge a new defense identity.
	   France is pushing for an independent European defense, starting
with a European pillar within NATO. But Britain insists NATO must
remain the cornerstone of defense and security.
	   ``At stake is the European Union's ability to have the political
and strategic leadership necessary to conduct military operations,
including with NATO,'' said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   ``So it must have a framework to help it make decisions, and the
capacity for action.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were to attend the talks,
beginning Thursday evening and lasting until noon on Friday, in the
Britanny port town of Saint Malo.
	   Topics to be discussed include EU tax levels, small business,
and cooperation in Africa, where both countries have former
colonies.
	   But defense and security were expected to dominate.
	   The two countries, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security Council
members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of the
European Union.
	   But both now recognize the need for Europe to cope militarily
when the United States does not get involved in crises.
	   Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish
the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to
merge it into the European Union.
	   The summit comes on the heels of a Franco-German summit earlier
this week in Potsdam.
	   Blair is being accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott, Chancellor Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and
Defense Secretary George Robertson.
	   France will be represented by Chirac, Jospin, Defense Minister
Alain Richard and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Officials met in Paris Wednesday for three hours to discuss the
defense question.
	   French officials say the summit, unprecedented in terms of the
number of officials attending, is the result of a change in British
policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor Party took over from the
Conservative Party in May 1997.
	   On Thursday, the newspaper Ouest-France published a special
supplement on the summit in both French and English and headlined:
``Welcome to Saint-Malo.''

Indonesia releases election timetable, drops Suharto probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with riot police blocking student marchers. One name
correct for Suharto and Harmoko.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia on Thursday announced an
election timetable for next year, a move that failed to appease
1,000 student protesters who marched down Jakarta's main road to
demand a trial of former President Suharto.
	   Rows of riot police and several light tanks blocked the students
from reaching the palace of President B.J. Habibie, who has pledged
democratic reforms but is deeply unpopular among students, who say
he is a stooge of his predecessor.
	   The government dropped plans to set up an independent panel to
investigate Suharto, the target of students who want him to be
tried on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Parliamentary elections will be held on June 7, and the top
legislative body that is empowered to elect a new president will
convene Aug. 29, House Speaker Harmoko said.
	   The announcement of the election dates came amid widespread
suspicion among critics that Habibie would delay the elections and
stall other political reforms.
	   Some students welcomed the timetable, but others who want an
immediate transitional government rejected it. Many have demanded
the ouster of Habibie, who took office from Suharto in May after
riots and protests against Suharto's 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   ``Is there any guarantee that the election under President
Habibie will be fair?'' said student activist Irwan Sukatmawijaya.
``We don't trust the honesty of Habibie since he is just a shadow
of Suharto.''
	   Habibie, meanwhile, abandoned plans for an independent
corruption inquiry of Suharto. The government had trouble finding
public figures who were willing to join the panel, which was viewed
as a cosmetic gesture by critics.
	   Instead, Habibie again ordered Attorney General Andi Mohamad
Ghalib to investigate Suharto. A previous inquiry by Ghalib turned
up no evidence of wrongdoing, and opponents labeled it a whitewash.
	   ``The president has instructed the attorney general to
immediately investigate and question former President Suharto,''
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said. In recent months, Ghalib has
met Suharto twice to discuss corruption allegations.
	   In one of several protests Thursday, about 200 students said the
government was unwilling to conduct a serious probe of Suharto's
wealth.
	   ``So far, what the government has said is just lip service,''
protester Ricky Andarsa said.
	   Harmoko announced the expected June date for parliamentary
elections after a meeting with Habibie and key Cabinet ministers at
Parliament.
	   The nation's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative
Assembly, will then meet to elect a new president. There is no
direct presidential poll.
	   ``It will be up to (the assembly delegates) to set the date of
the presidential election,'' Tanjung said.
	   However, the 1,000-member assembly is packed with holdovers from
the Suharto era, including military appointees, and critics say it
does not have the credibility to choose a new leader for the nation
of 202 million people.
	   The assembly, which consists of all 500 members of Parliament as
well as delegates chosen by the president, met last month to plan
the election and approve other political reforms.
	   ``The president will consistently and effectively implement the
decrees of the recent (assembly) meeting,'' Harmoko said.
	   Habibie is expected to run for president, but his ruling Golkar
party has lost credibility because of its role as an instrument of
Suharto's rule for decades.
	   Students who want swifter democratic change protested the
assembly meeting and fought battles with security forces in the
streets surrounding Parliament. Nine students have been fatally
shot.
	   Students want military chief Gen. Wiranto, who as defense
minister attended the meeting Thursday morning at Parliament, to be
held accountable for the Nov. 13 shootings.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades as
well as rising religious tension. Earlier this week, Christian mobs
burned mosques in a provincial capital in retaliation for attacks
by Muslim rioters on churches in the capital, Jakarta.

Japan's first Olympic gold medalist Mikio Oda dies at 93
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to sports wires

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mikio Oda, Japan's first Olympic gold medalist and
a contributor to the nation's track and field development, has died
of a ruptured artery, his family said Thursday. He was 93.
	   Oda, who died Wednesday, won the gold in the triple jump at the
1928 Amsterdam Olympics with a leap of 15.21 meters, boosting
Japanese interest in the world's most prestigious international
event. Three years later, he set a world record by improving his
Olympic record to 15.58 meters.
	   Oda, a native of Hiroshima, had previously set a national record
at the age of 17.
	   Known for his self-discipline and commitment in training, Oda
forced himself to work so hard he once fell asleep over dinner
while holding chopsticks, the national newspaper Asahi wrote
Thursday in its front-page obituary.
	   Oda later became a sports writer for the Asahi before becoming a
professor in the athletics department at Waseda University, his
alma mater.
	   Oda also served as a member of the Japanese Olympic Committee
and an honorary president of the Japan Amateur Athletic Federation.
	   He is survived by his two sons.

Blair pushes forward deal on next steps in Belfast accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: PMs; NEW throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Late-night negotiations led by
Prime Minister Tony Blair have narrowed the gap between Protestant
and Catholic leaders over how to make Northern Ireland's peace
accord work, both sides said Thursday.
	   Blair made no comment as he left Stormont Parliamentary Building
in east Belfast about 1 a.m. after overseeing seven hours of
discussions.
	   But senior negotiators from the major British Protestant party,
the Ulster Unionists, and the major Irish Catholic party, the
Social Democratic and Labor Party or SDLP, confirmed that a deal
was close thanks to Blair's intervention. They resumed their
haggling early Thursday but weren't sure whether a formal
announcement was still hours or days away.
	   Both sides said the Ulster Unionists agreed to create 10
departments in the new multi-party administration for Northern
Ireland envisaged in April's peace accord. The British government,
which has ruled Northern Ireland directly since 1972 and is
supposed to hand over some local powers in early 1999 under terms
of the accord, operates six departments in its Northern Ireland
Office.
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble had hoped to restrict the
new administration, to be called the Executive, to six posts as
well. This would have created only one prospective position each
for the extremes of Northern Irish opinion, both hostile to
Trimble: the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party on the Catholic side and
the Democratic Unionist Party on the Protestant side.
	   Seamus Mallon of the SDLP, the would-be deputy leader of the
Executive, said Blair had ``provided the focal point'' in reaching
agreement on all 10 departments, which include areas of special
concern to Catholics.
	   Reflecting their levels of electoral support, the Ulster
Unionists and SDLP would hold three Executive posts each, not
counting Trimble and Mallon, who were appointed in July to oversee
the cabinet-style administration. Sinn Fein and the Democratic
Unionists would be entitled to two posts each.
	   To encourage this concession, the Catholic side softened its
demand for the new Northern Ireland administration to coordinate
economic development with the Irish government. However, Mallons
said the north's Catholics still expected to forge common economic
cause with the predominantly Catholic south.
	   April's accord called for the new Northern Ireland government to
form at least six joint policy-making committees with the Irish
Republic, which won independence from Britain in 1922.
	   Both the SDLP and Sinn Fein consider cross-border cooperation a
key way to promote the eventual unification of Ireland.
	   But actually forming the Executive will remain an elusive goal.
Trimble is refusing to accept that Sinn Fein can participate in
government if its allies in the Irish Republican Army won't start
disarming. The IRA insists it won't do this.

Customs workers continue strike as government ponders action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With fuel supplies running critically low,
the government and striking customs workers were on a collision
course Thursday after union leaders ignored a court order to return
to work.
	   The walkout, which began Monday, has severely cut the flow of
gasoline and heating oil _ which mostly arrives in Greece via
non-European Union nations. Goods shipped from EU partners are not
affected by the strike.
	   Many gas stations have run dry and heating oil is growing scarce
_ a particular problem in chilly northern Greece.
	   A judge declared the strike illegal Wednesday, but the workers
refused to obey. Union leaders sought legal loopholes to bypass the
ruling.
	   Labor Minister Miltiades Papaioannou warned that the
``government will take those steps necessary for the public good.''
Papaioannou didn't specify the possible measures, but one option
would be declaring a national emergency and forcing the workers
back to their posts.
	   The Socialist government is determined not to back pedal on
proposed reforms aimed at qualify Greece for the EU single currency
group by 2001.
	   The customs workers were protesting plans to consolidate their
pension fund with other agencies. But they considered changing
their demands as part of maneuvering to circumvent the judge's
order.
	   Other labor groups have launched a barrage of strikes that have
disrupted life around the country.
	   On Thursday, railway workers continued a work stoppages.
Teachers also stayed off the job as part of rallies against
proposed education reforms, including adding competency tests for
teacher candidates.
	   The main labor unions also plan a nationwide general strike Dec.

Russian prime minister calls for more detailed economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government needs to come up with a more
detailed economic recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday, just a day after the International Monetary Fund
chief left without promising Moscow any new loans.
	   Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis program, but
the measures have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor
have they found favor with the IMF or other international lenders
who have frozen loans to Russia.
	   Primakov acknowledged the need to spell out the government's
intentions more clearly and called on the Cabinet to approve a more
detailed document.
	   ``Without such a concrete action plan, containing concrete tasks
and time frames, the government's steps will look merely like
intentions,'' Primakov said.
	   IMF chief Michel Camdessus left Russia on Wednesday after
meeting with Primakov and other top officials. He praised
Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis, but
said an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on loans to Russia.
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package this
summer, but only about dlrs 5 billion was disbursed before Russia's
economic crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen.
	   The IMF has indicated that Russia's draft budget for next year
appears overly optimistic, and it also does not like moves to
increase the government's role in the economy.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed out at the
IMF for refusing to release loans.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as
speaker for the State Duma, parliament's lower house. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay off its
debts and then refuse to take any more loans.
	   ``It's high time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he
told reporters.
	   In other developments, inflation was up 5.7 percent in November,
compared to 4.5 percent in October, the State Statistics Committee
said.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September
in the immediate aftermath of the crisis.
	   However, inflation is up about 70 percent compared to last
December, Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko said Wednesday.
The government is aiming to limit inflation to 30 percent next
year, but that will require help from the IMF and other lenders.
	   Without foreign help, the government will almost certainly
resort to printing more money, which could ignite hyperinflation.
	   Also, Russia's hard currency reserves dropped by dlrs 200
million in the last week of November and stood at dlrs 12.8 billion
on Nov. 27, the Central Bank said Thursday.
	   It didn't give a reason, though the government spent some of its
reserves to service foreign debts during this period.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As if the New York Yankees aren't already good
enough, now there's a chance the World Series champions could be
adding Roger Clemens.
	   The five-time Cy Young Award winner shook up baseball's frenzied
marketplace Wednesday, telling the Toronto Blue Jays to trade him
to a contender or closer to home.
	   ``Who wouldn't have an interest in Clemens?'' Yankees general
manager Brian Cashman said. ``I'm sure Toronto will have many
discussions with us before this is over with.''
	   Meanwhile, more big money went to free agents, with third
baseman Robin Ventura finalizing his dlrs 32 million, four-year
contract with the New York Mets and Henry Rodriguez returning to
the Chicago Cubs for an dlrs 8.9 million, two-year deal.
	   Even Carlos Hernandez struck it rich. After just one season as a
starter, the catcher worked out a dlrs 6.5 million, three-year
contract to stay with the San Diego Padres.
	   Also Wednesday, Kevin Brown, the top free agent pitcher left,
met with the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mets are talking about adding
another star, negotiating to sign career steals leader Rickey
Henderson.

Hindu activists vandalize theater showing controversial movie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Hindu activists went on a rampage
Thursday in a movie theater screening a film with lesbian scenes
and themes challenging Indian family traditions.
	   About a half dozen men and women smashed glass display cases
with movie posters outside the theater, windows and the snack bar
in the lobby of the Regal Theater and trashed the restaurant next
door in New Delhi's colonial-era Connaught Circus business
district.
	   No one was injured, and the vandals were blocked from entering
the hall where the film was showing, which was filled for the
afternoon performance.
	   Reporters were given advance warning of the attack on the
theater by activists of the Shiv Sena, a Hindu fundamentalist
political party allied with the governing Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   J.B. Goel, president of Shiv Sena's New Delhi chapter, said
scenes in the film ``Fire'' of women making love were
``objectionable and not in keeping with Indian culture.''
	   ``Fire'' tells the story of women in unhappy marriages to two
brothers living in New Delhi in what is called a joint family _ the
brothers, both their wives and their mother under one roof. The
sisters-in-law, seeking comfort from each other, develop a lesbian
relationship.
	   The film tackles issues rarely addressed in India, including the
unhappiness of women in tradition-minded families who are expected
to suppress their desires while serving their men and their elders.
Homosexuality also is rarely discussed in India.
	   Regal's manager, Ravi Sharma, said the movie would continue to
be shown at the theater.
	   ``If they continue to show the film, we will take action,'' Goel
said, refusing to elaborate.
	   India's massive film industry churns out hundreds of films every
year, but most are song-and-dance romances or thrillers that
reinforce traditional themes rather than question them.
	   On Wednesday, more than 100 Shiv Sena activists stormed two
theaters in Bombay, India's film capital, and prevented the
screening of the film.
	   ``Fire,'' filmed in both English and Hindi, has won several
international awards. Film critics were amazed when the Indian
censorship board allowed the movie to be screened almost uncut and
did not snip the scenes of the two women kissing.
	   The movie has been showing for several weeks across India,
sparking little comment until this week. Goel said he had only
recently learned of the movie.

 &UR; Muslims cheer the arrest of a Bosnian Serb general; Serbs downgrade
relations with NATO troops
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bosnian Serb reaction; changes byline
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ While drawing praise from
the Muslim leadership, the arrest of a Bosnian Serb general
indicted for war crimes has united Serb moderates and radicals in
condemnation.
	   On Wednesday, NATO troops arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic on
charges of alleged involvement in massacres of Muslims that
occurred after his troops overran the eastern enclave of Srebrenica
in summer 1995.
	   Krstic was arrested in the northern part of Bosnia, in the
sector controlled by U.S. troops.
	   Reacting to the arrest, parliament meeting in the city of Banja
Luka in the Serb half of Bosnia late Wednesday passed a resolution
saying the government would ``reduce to a minimum'' relations with
the Bosnia's NATO-led peace force.
	   The resolution, which mentioned no specifics, said relations
would be downgraded until the peace force stops what Bosnian Serbs
allege are violations of its mandate, including the arrest of
Krstic.
	   Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen said the arrest caused
``revolt and alarm'' among Bosnian Serbs. It suggests that ``every
Serb is a potential war criminal if he in any way too part in the
past war,'' said Poplasen.
	   Moderates normally at odds with Poplasen also condemned the
arrest, on an indictment from the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Zivko
Radisic, the Serb member of Bosnia's three-person presidency, said
it ``can jeopardize the overall process of democratization and ruin
efforts to rebuild trust and tolerance.''
	   Bosnia's Muslims praised Krstic's detention.

Virenque and Herve took EPO 100 times a year, says former masseur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French cyclists Richard Virenque and Pascal Herve,
who both flatly deny claims they took banned drugs, have been
accused by a former masseur of using EPO about 100 times a year.
	   Willy Voet, in an interview published Thursday in the newspaper
France-Soir, said Virenque and Herve, both members of the disgraced
Festina team, regularly took EPO, or erythropoietin, and other
drugs.
	   ``They consumed more than anybody. On average they received
between 90 and 100 (EPO) injections per year,'' Voet was quoted as
saying.
	   Voet also said Virenque would take a cocktail including heroin,
cocaine and amphetamines, although he said the star cyclist was
``very prudent'' regarding consumption.
	   Voet said Virenque also took growth hormones to prepare for the
Tour de France, which he said was the cyclists's top priority.
	   Medical tests suggest cyclists on the Festina team, expelled
from the Tour de France this summer, took banned drugs, judicial
sources said Tuesday citing a judge's report.
	   In addition to the presence of EPO, a banned drug Festina
officials had already admitted using, the report included
revelations that amphetamines were found in the tests of four
cyclists.
	   The four named were Laurent Brochard, the 1997 world road racing
champion; Christophe Moreau; Didier Rous; and Herve.
	   Virenque said the figures vindicate his claim that he didn't
take banned substances.
	   According to judicial sources who saw the report, the results
showed Virenque had a hematocrit level of 49.3 percent. The
hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells in a
blood sample _ one sign of doping, since the substances increase
red blood cells.
	   But Virenque's level is just within the limit of 50 percent set
by the International Cycling Union, the sport's governing body.
	   Herve had a level of 52.6.
	   Virenque and Herve both deny they knowingly took any banned
substances.
	   Three Festina officials have been put under formal
investigation, one step short of being formally charged: Voet; team
doctor Eric Ryckaert; and sporting director Bruno Roussel.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Police were pursuing two armed men who
took two bank employees hostage during a robbery in Lower Saxony
state Thursday and were fleeing with the hostages south toward
Frankfurt.
	   The men, described as heavily armed, threatened to shoot the
hostages if they see any police vehicles along the road, and
demanded that a police helicopter trailing them be pulled back,
police said.
	   Armed with automatic pistols, the men burst into the bank in the
Lower Saxony town of Bad Pyrmont shortly after it opened.
	   It was not immediately clear how much, if any, money they took.
	   Police said they were in contact with the men, but there was no
word on their intended destination or further demands.

Police patrol, Hindu fundamentalists pray
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rally starting peacefully. RECASTS throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGALORE, India (AP) _ Hundreds of police officers patrolled a
southern Indian shrine where Hindus and Muslims have traditionally
worshipped together in peace, fearing violence as Hindu
fundamentalists held a rally.
	   United News of India reported that a rally organized by the
Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, started with prayers
and was fairly peaceful, except for stone-throwing by a few young
men that was quickly quelled. The news agency said thousands of
people took part in the rally.
	   The council known as the VHP says the Muslim family that has
traditionally maintained the site should hand it over to Hindus.
The VHP, a sister organization of the Bharatiya Janata Party that
leads India's national governing coalition, had threatened to take
over the site by force, but later said it only planned to hold a
rally Thursday evening.
	   Local police minister Phillipose Matthai told The Associated
Press he was in control of the situation at Chikamagalur, where
Muslims believe a Sufi holy man is buried in a cave. Hindus believe
one of their gods entered the cave in ancient times and
disappeared, but will one day re-emerge at the site 300 kilometers
(190 miles) south of the Karnataka state capital of Bangalore.
	   The tussle over the shrine comes just days before the sixth
anniversary of the day a Hindu mob tore down a mosque at Ayodhya in
northern India following a campaign spearheaded by the VHP, which
has vowed to build a Hindu temple at the site. The Ayodhya issue
helped bring the BJP to political prominence, while the mosque's
destruction prompted deadly religious rioting across India.
	   In Chikamagalur, more than 2,000 police officers were deployed
at barricades erected to control crowds. Worshippers approach the
shrine by climbing a wooded hill, then descend stone stairs to the
underground cave. A stone slab marks what is believed to be the
tomb of Sufi holy man Dada Hayath Khalandar who lived centuries
ago, while a pair of shoes said to belong to the Hindu Lord
Dattatraya sits in a case in a corner.
	   ``The shrine is a Hindu religious place according to available
government records,'' VHP leader Raghavendra Rao said Thursday.
	   ``It is not a Hindu temple, but a Muslim holy place containing
the tomb of a Sufi saint,'' countered Mohamed Sharief, editor of a
local newspaper. ``However both Hindus and Muslims should be
allowed unhindered access.''
	   Both Hindus and Muslims believe that if a childless woman comes
to the shrine to ask for a child, her prayers will be answered. It
is not uncommon for Indians of different faiths to share shrines
and even rites _ the music and dance of mystic Sufi Muslims
sometimes borrows from Hindu traditions.
	   Opposition parties in the national parliament this week
questioned BJP leaders sharply about the trouble brewing in
Chikamagalur. Federal police minister L.K Advani, chief of the
BJP's hard-line faction, said the government was working with
Karnataka officials to ensure both Hindus and Muslims could
continue to worship peacefully at the shrine.
	   The BJP has only recently made inroads in southern states like
Karnataka, which is now controlled by the leftist Janata Dal party.
In 1990, the BJP controlled the government in Uttar Pradesh, where
the Ayodhya mosque was located.

Officials: Abacha family member, ministers stole dlrs 2 billion in
</HEADLINE>
debt deal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Two former cabinet ministers and a family
member of ex-dictator Gen. Sani Abacha defrauded Nigeria of about
dlrs 2 billion by buying and reselling debt payments on a
Russian-built steel plant, Nigerian officials said.
	   The fraud allegation is just the latest in a string of similar
accusations linked to Abacha, who was estimated to be worth from
dlrs 3 billion to dlrs 6 billion when he suddenly died in early
June.
	   Mohammed Haruna, the chief press secretary to head of state Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, said Tuesday that the Abacha family member
and the ministers _ none of whom were named _ committed the fraud
through debt payments owed to Russia for the unfinished Ajaokuta
steel plant in northern Nigeria.
	   The plant, which is said to have cost a total of about dlrs 5
billion, was begun in the early 80s and has yet to be finished. It
has been a regular target of criticism for its waste, mismanagement
and government corruption.
	   The company purchased about dlrs 2.5 billion in debt owed to
Russia by Nigeria at a heavy discount _ paying about dlrs 500,000.
The company then resold the debt to Nigeria at its face value,
pocketing the remaining dlrs 2 billion, Haruna said.
	   ``It is a matter of days that this money will be recovered,'' he
said, declining to go into further details.
	   Buying and reselling debt at a discount is common in the world
of international finance.
	   The announcement of the alleged steel plant fraud comes just a
few weeks after officials announced that Abacha's family had repaid
the government more than dlrs 750 million in illegally amassed
state funds.
	   During his five-year military dictatorship, Abacha diverted
hundreds of millions of dollars in government funds to his personal
accounts.
	   The government has put pressure on Abacha family members to
return the money, confiscating the passports of Abacha's wife and
some of his children, and keeping some family members under
surveillance
	   Others in Abacha's government also allegedly siphoned money from
the state to amass personal fortunes. Nigeria's former national
security adviser Ismail Gwarzo allegedly channeled about dlrs 1.3
billion worth of foreign reserves into private accounts.
	   Abacha was replaced by Abubakar, who has vowed to clean up
Nigeria's rampant corruption and hand power over to an elected
civilian government.

Bosnia rail workers halt strike as government promises back pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Rail workers in Muslim-Croat
controlled Bosnia halted a one-day strike Thursday after the
government promised to pay unpaid wages.
	   The Muslim-Croat Federation government said workers will be paid
in the next few days. Complaints that the government was four
months in arrears with wages sparked the one day strike Wednesday,
which delayed some commuter lines.
	   The strike was also meant to protest the failure of the
government and international authorities to link railway service
across Bosnia and to other countries.
	   The postwar unification of the Bosnian railroad is required
under the 1995 peace agreement. But Bosnian Serbs insist on a
separate railroad company for their half of the country.
	   The 3 1/2 year war ended in 1995 with a peace agreement that
divided the country between the Bosnian Serbs and a federation of
Muslims and Croats.

Israel suspends troop withdrawal after attack on Israeli soldier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat, Netanyahu quotes &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Attacks
 &UR; AP Photos JRL101-116
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers assembled around a TV
set and watched a video of a Palestinian mob ambushing an Israeli
soldier. When the tape stopped, the decision was unanimous: Israel
would suspend its West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the attack,
in which the trapped soldier was pulled out of a car and repeatedly
struck in the head with rocks, was a direct result of incitement by
the Palestinian Authority against Israel.
	   ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli citizens being lynched,
or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that received incitement
from Palestinian officials,'' Netanyahu said in explaining his
decision to hold up the land-for-security agreement.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation once
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce
a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Israel has said it will not free those involved in attacks that
resulted in death or injury. The Palestinians demand that Israel
free prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The Palestinians appealed to the United States for help and
Arafat said Thursday that Netanyahu is ``violating completely'' the
Wye agreement.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin sided with the
Palestinians, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the peace
accord. David Leavy, a White House spokesman said the Clinton trip
was still on.
	   In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel
is to release 250 more Palestinian prisoners.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation with the
Palestinians has helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition.
	   In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend implementation
of the Wye agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said they
would not support an early elections bill as initially planned.
	   The legislation was to have come before parliament Monday, but
its sponsors said they might delay the vote because they no longer
have a majority.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   In response, dozens of masked Palestinians blocked Jerusalem
roads with burning tires and threw stones at cars. Israeli police
fired rubber bullets.
	   Early Thursday, a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian
laborers from the Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they
were investigating whether the arsonists had political motives. The
laborers escaped unharmed.
	   After the attack on the Israeli soldier on Wednesday near the
West Bank town of Ramallah, Netanyahu convened his so-called
security Cabinet and played a videotape of the incident.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the
Cabinet room was tense during the screening and that those present
decided unanimously afterward to hold up the accord.
	   However, the Palestinian Authority blamed Israel for the latest
crisis, saying it had raised tensions by refusing to release
Palestinian prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The two sides also argued over whether the attack on the soldier
was orchestrated or spontaneous.
	   The incident began when about 150 Palestinian university
students, many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march
in Ramallah to press for prisoner releases.
	   The group then marched to the outskirts of town to throw stones
at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier was riding in.
	   Netanyahu said the incident was ``organized, orchestrated,
planned in advance and fomented by the Palestinian Authority.''
	   However, Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank,
said the incident was triggered by growing anger over Israel's
handling of the prisoner issue.
	   ``In clashes, rocks are thrown,'' Barghouti said. ``This car
stopped with the soldier and they took his weapon. It was later
returned. They did not use it to kill.''
	   Netanyahu said Thursday that the Palestinian Authority had
raised false expectations concerning the prisoners. ``They have to
stop promising them things Israel never promised,'' he said. ``We
would never, ever release terrorist murderers, ever.''
	   Arafat brought up the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings in Washington, and Palestinian negotiators said the U.S.
president promised to do his utmost to resolve the issue.

Two Egyptian women, a Jordanian man hanged for murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Two Egyptian maids and a Jordanian man
convicted of murder were hanged at dawn Thursday, a police official
said.
	   Abeer Ibrahim, 24, her 22-year-old sister, Rasha, and Mahmoud
Mashaqba were hanged in their cells at Swaqa Prison, 120 kilometers
(70 miles) southeast of the Jordanian capital, Amman, said the
police official. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Ibrahim sisters had been convicted of murdering their
employer, Fakhria Kurdy, earlier this year. The Egyptian maids tied
Mrs. Kurdy's hands and feet, strangled her to death with a rope and
then stole her money. The official gave no further details.
	   Mashaqba had been convicted of stabbing his neighbor, Mohammad
Zayyoud, with a dagger during a quarrel last year in a parking lot
in the city of Zarqa, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northeast of Amman.
	   Thursday's hanging brings to 10 the total number of people
hanged in Jordan this year _ mostly for serious crimes such as rape
and premeditated murder.

Health Ministry approves use of Viagra in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government has approved the
importation of the anti-impotence pill Viagra, a weekly newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Al-Zawra said the Health Ministry has no objection to the pill
coming in, likely through private pharmacies and hospitals.
	   ``The blue pill is in demand by many Iraqis,'' the weekly quoted
an unnamed ministry official as saying. He suggested prescriptions
would be required.
	   The official said the government would not bring Viagra in
because it is not ``a badly needed humanitarian item.''
	   Most of Iraq's food and medicine is imported under the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell
limited quantities of oil to buy necessities for its 22 million
people.
	   The sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, limit oil sales, ban air travel and bar most international
financial transactions.

Malaysia seeks new World Bank loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has asked the World Bank
for loans totaling dlrs 3 billion this year to revive its sagging
economy, a top finance ministry official said Thursday.
	   An application for a dlrs 2 billion loan was submitted in July
in addition to earlier requests for loans of dlrs 300 million and
dlrs 700 million, Bernama news agency quoted Junior Finance
Minister Mustapa Mohamed as saying.
	   It was the first time that Malaysia has disclosed it made the
July application.
	   Mustapa said the dlrs 300 million loan was given in June, but
the World Bank would need more time to process the other two loan
applications.
	   Malaysia is also trying to borrow money from Singapore and Japan
to shore up its recession-hit economy.
	   ``We haven't borrowed from the World Bank for quite some time
now,'' Mustapa was quoted as saying. The last time Malaysia went to
the bank was in 1994 for a dlrs 70 million loan.
	   Malaysia had no need to borrow because its economy was growing
at more than 8 percent annually. But since the Asian financial
crisis last year, the economy began to sputter, collapsing into
recession this year.
	   The new loans were mostly for low-cost housing, agriculture,
infrastructure, transportation and education.
	   Mustapa said the World Bank sent six missions to Malaysia last
month to assess the loan requirements and make recommendations to
its board of directors.
	   Malaysia is also looking for alternatives to international
capital markets and the International Monetary Fund to finance its
recapitalization needs. It is unlikely to be able to raise money by
selling bonds overseas because of progressive downgrades.
	   On Thursday, Moody's Investors Services announced that its
outlook for Malaysia and five of the country's banks was negative,
perhaps setting the stage for a further downgrade of Malaysian
bonds.
	   Authorities estimate the country will need 62 billion ringgit
(dlrs 16.31 billion) to fix its ailing banking system and revive
the economy, which shrank 8.6 percent in the third quarter of 1998.

Russian parliament inches its way toward decision on START II
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Senior Russian lawmakers voiced hopes Thursday
that parliament would soon ratify the START II arms reduction
treaty with the United States.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, agreed to finish its
work by next Tuesday on a measure that outlines Russia's nuclear
weapons program, said Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov. The bill will
then be sent to President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``It will spell out Russia's military doctrine and guidelines
for developing new weapons that would ensure Russia's security,''
Seleznyov told reporters.
	   Some Duma members in the past have talked about setting
conditions for ratification _ a move that might require the U.S.
Senate to review the treaty again. However, Seleznyov didn't
mention any proposals that would make ratification conditional on
additional actions by the United States.
	   Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Duma's foreign affairs
committee, said he expected the president to return the bill to the
Duma without any major alterations. That could set the stage for
approval of the START II treaty.
	   Yeltsin previously submitted the START II treaty to the Duma for
ratification.
	   But Russian lawmakers wanted to outline priorities for
developing the country's nuclear arsenal before approving the
treaty.
	   START II, which the two countries signed in 1993, would halve
Russian and American nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led
opposition in the Russian parliament has balked, claiming that
dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's security and be
too expensive.
	   The Russian government and military leaders have strongly pushed
for ratification, saying that Russia will have to soon decommission
its aging missiles anyway.
	   There's been some progress in recent weeks, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov has made a renewed push to convince lawmakers to
ratify the document.

Taipei mayoral candidates square off over China, ethnicity
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taipei mayoral challenger Ma Ying-jeou
said Thursday he offers voters a stark choice: ethnic
reconciliation and security, or social schism and the potential for
a rockier relationship with mainland China.
	   Ma hopes to retake the capital for the ruling Nationalists and
is running a tight race against incumbent Chen Shui-bian in a
contest that has become the focal point for Saturday's elections.
	   Speaking to foreign and Taiwanese journalists, Ma tore into
Chen, accusing him of sowing division by reopening old ethnic
wounds. Ma branded himself himself a ``New Taiwanese,'' a label to
encompass natives as well as those who immigrated from the mainland
after the 1949 civil war.
	   ``My election would symbolize the new spirit of integration. I
want to accelerate integration, not divide,'' Ma said.
	   If Chen's opposition Democratic Progressive Party makes further
gains, the island could find itself steering onto a dangerous
course of confrontation with Beijing, Ma warned.
	   If Chen can fend off Ma's challenge, it would raise the prospect
of a strong DPP challenger for the presidency in 16 months, when
President Lee Teng-hui is set to retire.
	   A DPP government could bring to a head the issue of Taiwan's
precarious relationship with prickly neighbor China, as the party
has advocated formal independence from the mainland.
	   Amid threats of Chinese military attack, Chen has avoided
talking about independence, though he stresses his willingness to
stand up to Chinese intimidation.
	   Ma's conciliatory stance and charismatic personality have placed
him in a statistical dead heat with Chen, according to the latest
polls. Voters will also choose a new Legislature, a mayor for
Taiwan's second largest city, Kaohsiung, and city councils for
Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   Observers have said there is little difference in the positions
taken by the candidates _ but the outcome of the race could
influence Taiwanese politics when voters choose their next
president.
	   Knocking Chen out of office could put the Nationalists on course
to retain the presidency and thwart the DPP's hopes of building on
huge gains made in last year's local elections.
	   Chen has campaigned on his record as Taipei's first opposition
mayor and played up the Nationalists' reputation for corruption.
	   Ma, whose youthful looks have earned him the nickname ``Sonny
Boy Ma,'' counters he wants to clean things up. He adds that Taipei
needs more investment in infrastructure and public safety to
compete as a world-class city.
	   He casts himself as a reformer from within, someone who held key
policymaking posts within the Nationalist government at a time when
Chen was leading street protests demanding more democracy.
	   The national identity question has loomed over the election,
both in the campaign rhetoric and in the minds of many voters.
	   ``I'm against Taiwan independence because it's dangerous. Ma is
smart and clean. He's my hero,'' said Charlene Wang, a 29-year old
accountant attending a Ma rally at a downtown park.
	   Ma's good looks don't hurt him either, Wang added.
	   Both Chen and Ma are lawyers and graduates of Taiwan's best
university but differ greatly in their public images. Chen styles
himself the country boy made good, while Ma exudes the
sophistication of the Wall Street legal consultant he once was.
	   Ma has sought to transform himself for the podium, studying the
earthy Taiwanese dialect and revving up his low-key style to
compete with Chen, who learned his fiery oratory as an outspoken
city councilor and legislator.
	   Ma, who moved to Taiwan when he was just a year old, told a news
conference he resents questions raised by Chen's camp over his
loyalty to the island.
	   Chen, who like most of the island's residents traces his roots
here for generations, has called Ma a pawn of a secret conspiracy
to betray Taiwan to China.
	   Ma insisted Thursday he would fight the Chinese if necessary,
adding that he jogs every day to keep fit.

Key prosecution witness admits meeting Mahathir
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with prosecution witness saying he met with prime
minister, other details
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Search
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A key prosecution witness
testifying against jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim admitted
Thursday to meeting Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad 10 days before
the Malaysian leader sacked his deputy.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar, a former driver of Anwar's wife, has testified
that Anwar repeatedly sodomized him.
	   Allegations by Azizan and Ummi Hafilda Ali, the sister of
Anwar's former private secretary, are among the most damning
revealed during the month-long trial. Ummi alleges that while Anwar
was deputy prime minister, he had an affair with her brother's
wife.
	   When defense attorney Christopher Fernando asked Azizan how many
times he had met Mahathir, he replied: ``Just once.''
	   Azizan did not give any details of the Aug. 24 meeting with
Mahathir.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove Anwar abused his powers by
forcing police to obtain retractions from Azizan and Ummi and cover
up his sexual trysts.
	   The defense, however, insists there was a high-level conspiracy
involving senior Cabinet ministers to destroy Anwar politically.
	   Anwar is charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal sex
acts, charges he vehemently denies.
	   When Fernando asked why it took Azizan five years, until 1997,
to make the allegations against Anwar, he said: ``Because Ummi made
me realize that the things Anwar was doing to me were vile.''
	   He said he did not remember the time and dates of the acts of
sodomy in 1992. Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim
nation.
	   Azizan also told the court he was frequently called by the
then-deputy prime minister and ordered to hinder police
investigations into allegations contained in a book.
	   He alleged that Anwar used intimidation and surveillance to
block him from cooperating with the police probe.
	   The probe into accusations in ``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim
Cannot Become Prime Minister'' became the basis for the charges for
which Anwar is being tried.
	   It alleges that the 51-year-old heir apparent to Mahathir had
sexual flings while in office.
	   Before the book was published, Azizan had written to authorities
alleging that he was repeatedly sodomized by Anwar. He said he was
forced to retract those allegations under duress but now stood by
them.
	   ``Ummi Hafilda and I felt very scared because we were tailed by
people we didn't know,'' Azizan told the trial court Thursday.
	   He said he received phone calls from Anwar questioning him on
how he could have been involved in writing the sworn statement
containing the allegations.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar Sept. 2, saying he had personally
determined Anwar was morally unfit for office. Anwar's sacking led
to his demands for political reforms and dozens of massive
anti-government protests in the Southeast Asian capital.
	   On Wednesday, Azizan shocked the court by saying he was once
Anwar's ``homosexual slave.''
	   ``This heinous act was committed several times in 1992 against
my will. It regularly took place in luxury hotels ... without the
knowledge of the public and his wife,'' he said.
	   Acrimony in court between the defense and prosecution deepened
Thursday as more evidence was piled against Anwar.
	   The prosecutors accused defense lawyers of stealing court
documents from them and even lodged a police report. The police
acted quickly by sending officers armed with a search warrant to
one of the defense attorney's office on Wednesday.
	   ``You should make a strong statement asking the prosecution not
to harass the defense counsel,'' Haji Sulaiman, a leading defense
lawyer told Judge Augustine Paul.
	   ``We are being accused of theft, my Lord,'' he said.

Kosovo monitors gear up for risky duty in troubled province
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - An international mission of unarmed
observers is racing to build up strength in Yugoslavia's troubled
Kosovo province, fully aware of the risks its volunteers face, the
head of the mission said Thursday.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
sending 2,000 monitors to the Kosovo province in the hope that a
large international presence will curb attacks on mainly ethnic
Albanians.
	   William Walker, head of the Kosovo Verification Mission, was in
the Norwegian capital to brief a meeting of OSCE foreign ministers
on the force, which is the biggest effort ever undertaken by the
OSCE.
	   Walker said about 500 observers were already in place, and that
125 more would be completing a training course every four or five
days.
	   ``It is a very big effort and we are well underway,'' Walker
told reporters. He said that for the first time the number of
international monitors exceeded the size of a diplomatic observer
corps already in place.
	   Under the terms of an Oct. 12 U.S.-brokered deal, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow as many as 2,000
unarmed monitors into Kosovo. They are charged with keeping track
of the status of Milosevic's promises, including a military
withdrawal and working toward a political settlement.
	   Hundreds were killed and as many as 300,000 people fled their
homes in a mainly Yugoslav Serb crackdown on the 90-percent ethnic
Albanian province. Walker said virtually all of those who fled now
have some kind of housing, even though many could not move back to
their damaged homes.
	   ``My impression is that tensions have diminished,'' said Walker,
who is based with the monitor corps in the Kosovo capital of
Pristina. He said local residents seem reassured by the
international presence.
	   But he said dangers remain for the international volunteers,
including anti-personnel mines that dot the countryside and the
danger of firefights erupting between ethnic Albania rebels and
Yugoslav forces.
	   ``Getting caught in a firefight between two groups that have
weapons and like to fire at each other would be a very bad
situation,'' he said. ``That worst-case scenario is pretty
frightening.''
	   Walker said he hoped for a political solution before spring
thaws make it easier for military units to move, increasing the
risk of battles. NATO is prepared to come to the assistance of
monitors.
	   The monitor mission now has 1,588 applicants from 34 countries,
and 492 have been accepted. Another roughly 300 will be transferred
from the diplomatic observer mission to the monitor force. Italy
has so far offered the largest number of volunteers, 203, followed
by Germany with 187, Britain with 158 and the United States with
143.
	   Walker said volunteers, most with experience from peacekeeping
or other similar missions, were being trained in what to look for,
as well as how to get by under often primitive and dangerous
conditions.
	   He said wanted the monitors spread out through the small
provinces as quickly as possible, which would leave many of the
volunteers living in villages without even basic amenities.
	   ``A lot of monitors will be living in very primitive conditions,
and we hope they are prepared for that,'' he said. But he said a
wide network would also give the OSCE a very good overview of what
is happening in Kosovo.
	   OSCE officials said the force should reach full strength by
mid-January.
	   Walker rejected criticism that the force was build up too
slowly, saying that in fact the progress had been fast, considering
such practical difficulties as finding housing.

up his sexual trysts.
	   The defense, however, insists there was a high-level conspiracy
involving senior Cabinet ministers to destroy Anwar politically.
	   Anwar is charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal sex
acts, charges he vehemently denies.
	   When Fernando asked why it took Azizan five years, until 1997,
to make the allegations against Anwar, he said: ``Because Ummi made
me realize that the things Anwar was doing to me were vile.''
	   He said he did not remember the time and dates of the acts of
sodomy in 1992. Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim
nation.
	   Azizan also told the court he was frequently called by the
then-deputy prime minister and ordered to hinder police
investigations into allegations contained in a book.
	   He alleged that Anwar used intimidation and surveillance to
block him from cooperating with the police probe.
	   The probe into accusations in ``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim
Cannot Become Prime Minister'' became the basis for the charges for
which Anwar is being tried.
	   It alleges that the 51-year-old heir apparent to Mahathir had
sexual flings while in office.
	   Before the book was published, Azizan had written to authorities
alleging that he was repeatedly sodomized by Anwar. He said he was
forced to retract those allegations under duress but now stood by
them.
	   ``Ummi Hafilda and I felt very scared because we were tailed by
people we didn't know,'' Azizan told the court Thursday.
	   He said he received phone calls from Anwar questioning him on
how he could have been involved in writing the sworn statement
containing the allegations.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar Sept. 2, saying he had personally
determined Anwar was morally unfit for office. Anwar's sacking led
to his demands for political reforms and dozens of massive
anti-government protests in the Southeast Asian capital.
	   On Wednesday, Azizan shocked the court by saying he was once
Anwar's ``homosexual slave.''
	   ``This heinous act was committed several times in 1992 against
my will. It regularly took place in luxury hotels ... without the
knowledge of the public and his wife,'' he said.
	   Acrimony in court between the defense and prosecution deepened
Thursday as more evidence was piled against Anwar.
	   Defense lawyers accused the prosecutors of lodging a police
report against them saying they had stolen the prosecution's court
documents.
	   The police acted quickly by sending officers armed with a search
warrant to one of the defense attorney's office on Wednesday.
	   ``You should make a strong statement asking the prosecution not
to harass the defense counsel,'' Haji Sulaiman Abdullah, a leading
defense lawyer told Judge Augustine Paul.
	   ``We are being accused of theft My Lord,'' he said.

Appeals court overturns conviction of university professor in

secessionist slaying &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ An appeals court has overturned the
conviction of a university professor sentenced to 22 years in
prison for the slaying of the leader of a German-speaking
separatist movement in northern Italy.
	   The court ruled on Wednesday that Peter Paul Rainer's confession
was coerced.
	   He was convicted of the Feb. 15, 1997, shooting to death
Christian Waldner, one of the founders of Freihetliche or Freedom
Movement.
	   Rainer was a member of Freihetliche, one of several groups
seeking autonomy for the predominantly German-speaking regions of
northern Italy that were annexed from Austria at the end of World
War I.
	   Rainer, an Italian citizen who taught history at the University
of Innsbruck in Austria, said initially that he shot Waldner
because Waldner threatened to reveal that he'd never finished high
school and had used a falsified diploma to enter college.
	   Rainer later retracted the confession.
	   Although the appeals court overturned his murder conviction, it
upheld his six-month prison sentence for illegal possession of a
firearm.
	   Rainer has been in jail since he was arrested shortly after the
slaying. He was convicted by a trial court in the northern city of
Bolzano in August, 1997.

Romanian holy man persecuted by communists dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Orthodox Monks have one name

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Cleopa, the charismatic Romanian monk
persecuted by communists and admired by pilgrims, has died in his
secluded wilderness monastery, a church official announced
Thursday. He was 87.
	   Cleopa, who hid in forests from communists and was known for
comforting words for common people, succumbed to age-related
illnesses Wednesday in the Sihastria monastery deep in the forest
of northern Romania, said the Romanian Orthodox Church in Iasi.
	   Hounded by the Securitate communist secret police, who feared
his popular appeal, Cleopa fled to the forest in 1953 building an
underground den where he lived in hiding for almost a decade.
	   Every month, a woodcutter brought him a sack of potatoes. Cleopa
said he ate one potato a day _ all he needed to survive.
	   In an interview with the Associated Press in October, Cleopa
talked about his 60 years of work as a spiritual father or
``duhovnic'' in the Romanian Orthodox Church.
	   ``The spiritual father is the soul of the monastery and of the
village. He should be the light of the world by his life and
sermons,'' he said.
	   Born into a family of peasants in a village in northern Romania,
	   Cleopa became a monk at 25. After he entered the monastery he
worked as a shepherd for 12 years, gaining a good knowledge of the
countryside which helped him when he took refuge in the forest.
	   He was best known for his understanding of ordinary peoples'
problems and his healing words which tens of thousands sought both
under communism and in the years of hardship that followed the
toppling of communist rule in 1989.
	   ``He knew the needs and soul of the Romanian people,'' said Dan
Ciachir, a Christian Orthodox expert. ``He didn't have a very
elevated language, but he knew how to comfort people.''
	   Cleopa will be buried Saturday at the Sihastria monastery, 320
kilometers (200 miles) north of Bucharest where he had lived for 30
years. Thousands of people are expected to attend the funeral.
	   Romanian Orthodox monks are buried sitting in a chair, which is
lowered directly into the ground.

Road reopened outside U.S. Embassy in Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A thoroughfare outside the U.S. Embassy
in Kampala, closed after terrorists attacked American embassies in
neighboring Tanzania and Kenya, reopened Thursday, a spokesman
said.
	   U.S. officials closed four-lane Parliament Avenue in the
aftermath of the bombings that killed 224 people on Aug. 7, fearing
other embassies could be targeted.
	   Embassy spokesman Virgil Bodeen said Parliament Avenue reopened
to one lane of traffic Thursday. ``The merchants along the road
must be quite relieved,'' Bodeen said, adding the closure hut their
businesses.
	   Concrete barriers were being laid to block off much of the road
near the embassy, and parking, which previously was allowed on both
sides of Parliament Avenue, was now prohibited near the embassy, he
said.
	   Concrete blocks also were being placed on roads around other
U.S. facilities, including the U.S. Agency for International
Development and the Peace Corps, Bodeen said.
	   Eventually, the embassy will be moved to a safer location, but
not for several years, he said. The land has been purchased, but
construction plans have not been drafted, Bodeen said.
	   The U.S. mission has been in the location since its
establishment in 1962, but it was closed during civil war from 1972
to 1979.

Philippine stocks plunge on inflation worries; index down 4.2
</HEADLINE>
percent
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing nearly 1 percent higher

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply
Thursday because of worries over a possible surge in inflation and
its impact on interest rates, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, hit a new six-month high against the
dollar, lifted by a large influx of U.S. currency sent from
overseas Filipino workers, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index plunged 78.97
points, or 4.2 percent, to 1,807.03 after retreating 35.79 points
Wednesday.
	   While economists are predicting a slight improvement in November
inflation, the market was awash with speculation that the actual
figures could be worse and might even hit 11 percent, a rate the
country hasn't seen since January 1996.
	   Inflation data are to be released either Friday or Monday.
	   Interest rates have been steadily declining in recent months,
but a surge in inflation could reverse the trend.
	   The broader All Shares Index was down 19.87 points at 585.29
following Thursday's 9.70-point decline. Losers beat gainers 88 to
26, with 22 issues unchanged.
	   Hit hardest by the drop, initiated by foreign brokerage houses,
were interest rate-sensitive property stocks.
	   Economists are expecting inflation in November to slow slightly
to 10.1 percent from October's 10.2 percent.
	   But Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000, said market
speculation placed the November inflation at closer to 11 percent
due to spikes in food prices in the aftermath of strong typhoons in
late October.
	   Even if true, Balita said, the sudden rise in inflation should
not be cause for worry because food prices have since declined.
Nevertheless, he added, the talk provided the trigger to an
underlying pressure to sell.
	   ``More than anything else it was panic,'' said Cesar Tanquincen,
portfolio manager for IB Jimenez Securities, noting that local
brokerage houses joined the sellers' bandwagon when foreign
brokerages started selling.
	   Tanquincen said a rebound is likely Friday, especially if
inflation numbers don't confirm market rumors.
	   In currency trading, the yen's buoyant performance against the
U.S. dollar also helped lift the peso.
	   The peso hit an intraday high of 38.700 pesos per dollar, its
highest level since reaching 38.626 pesos on May 27.
	   For the day, the dollar averaged 38.759 pesos, down nearly 1
percent from Wednesday's 39.101 pesos. It traded in a thin range
between 38.700 pesos and 38.870 pesos.
	   An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, sending home at
least dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances
provide an important contribution to the Philippine economy and are
expected to help support the peso over the rest of the year.
	   The central bank wasn't active in the spot market. It held its
overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.375 percent and 15.375
percent, respectively.

Brian Kidd poised to take Blackburn manager's job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ After nine years as Alex Ferguson's
assistant at Manchester United, Brian Kidd looks set to become
manager of his own Premier League club.
	   United agreed Thursday to let Kidd talk with last-place
Blackburn Rovers about filling their managerial vacancy.
	   United want to keep Kidd but admit it's now likely he will go.
	   ``He wants to progress his career and he wants to have the
chance of being a No. 1,'' chief executive Martin Edwards said.
``He wants that opportunity to speak to them and so reluctantly we
have agreed to that. We have accepted the fact that he may want to
leave.''
	   Only last week Edwards claimed the only way Kidd would leave
United would be ``over my dead body.''
	   ``We would be very disappointed if he does decide to go because
he has been a great No. 2 and he would be a big loss to us,''
Edwards said.
	   Blackburn has been without a manager since Roy Hodgson was fired
last month after a 2-0 defeat to Southampton.
	   Rovers' dismal season continued Wednesday night with a 1-0 loss
to Leicester in the quarterfinals of the League Cup.
	   Blackburn, which won the Premier League title in 1995, is now
bottom of the table with only two victories in 15 games.
	   Kidd has been associated with Manchester United throughout his
career. As a 19-year-old, he scored a goal in the club's European
Cup victory over Benfica in 1968.

Hong Kong property shares rally, easing market's losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares fell slightly Thursday, with a strong
rebound by property stocks staving off a heftier drop.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index slipped 9.63 points, or 0.1
percent, to close at 10,046.15.
	   A smaller index tracking Hong Kong real estate companies dropped
as much as 3 percent in early trading but then bounced back to show
a gain of 2.5 percent.
	   On Wednesday, the Hang Seng had risen 0.8 percent after plunging
7.5 percent in the previous three sessions.
	   The sharp turnaround by property companies late Thursday was
triggered by news that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority _ the
territory's de facto central bank _ will raise the ceiling on
mortgage lending to 85 percent of the purchase price from 70
percent.
	   That prompted some investors who had sold off real estate stocks
to buy them back, said Andrew To, sales director at Tai Fook
Securities Co.
	   Market turnover rose as investors cashed in on early gains,
hitting 5.61 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 719 million),
compared with Wednesday's 4.54 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
582 million).
	   Property giants led the gainers, with Henderson Land rising 1.10
to close at 38.90 and Sun Hung Kai Properties rising 1.75 to close
at 56.50.
	   Hang Seng Bank was up 1.00 to close at 66.25.
	   Market heavyweight HSBC Holdings led the losers, falling 2.50 to
close at 186.50. Hong Kong Electric also fell 0.65 to close at
25.00, while China Telecom fell 0.60 to close at 25.00.
	   Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific remained unchanged at
7.65, while conglomerate Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 0.60 to close at
35.30.

Philippine Airlines says it will go it alone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Thursday it
will attempt to rebuild alone after Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airlines pulled out of talks on acquiring a stake in the ailing
Philippine flag carrier.
	   PAL had hoped for an infusion of capital from another airline to
keep it afloat and help it resume payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in
debt.
	   Manolo Aquino, PAL's executive vice president, said the airline
has prepared a ``stand alone'' rehabilitation plan it will submit
next Monday to Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   ``It does not provide for a foreign-airline partner but if there
is one in the future, that will be an enhancement,'' he said in a
statement.
	   Aquino said the plan includes the retention of 22 aircraft _
down from 54 _ and the restructuring of debt.
	   Cathay Pacific announced Wednesday that it has withdrawn its bid
to pour up to dlrs 100 million into PAL because of ``certain issues
which could not be resolved.''
	   Philippine officials said Cathay Pacific and PAL disagreed over
who would manage PAL and how many of the more than 8,000 employees
would lose their jobs.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which their collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic and international flights.
	   Aquino said he welcomed a statement by President Joseph Estrada
earlier Thursday that Cathay Pacific is still willing to negotiate
with PAL.
	   ``Cathay management wrote me a letter that they are still
available for another negotiation,'' Estrada said. ``So let us not
lose hope.''
	   Estrada said he is awaiting the return from abroad of PAL
Chairman Lucio Tan to determine if the talks can resume.
	   During the PAL shutdown, Cathay flew chartered domestic flights
at the request of Estrada.
	   ``We also owe it to Cathay,'' Estrada said. ``When I asked them
to help ... they responded. This in one way or another solved the
problems of so many businesses that were affected. So I think I can
talk it over with them.''
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on its debts because of
mounting losses worsened by labor problems and Asia's currency
crisis.

Parity reigns in Serie A, with standings tight at top
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Fiorentina beats Internazionale, but is
battered by traditional patsy Piacenza. AS Roma handles Juventus
and Fiorentina, but loses to struggling Sampdoria.
	   Juventus goes four games without a victory _ including three
without a single goal _ but stays right in the thick of the Italian
League's tight title chase.
	   Parity has arrived in Serie A.
	   Seven clubs are bunched within five points of the top of the
standings, currently led by Fiorentina, enjoying its first run
alone in first place since way back in 1982.
	   With the season a third of the way done, Fiorentina (7-1-3) has
22 points, three ahead of Roma and AC Parma. Juve and AC Milan are
next with 18, while Inter and Bologna have 17.
	   Things could start to shift Saturday, when Fiorentina has a
tough test against visiting Bologna, Roma hosts Japanese star
Hidetoshi Nakata's Perugia, and Parma travels to Sampdoria at
night. The games were pushed ahead of the rest of the schedule
because Bologna, Roma and Parma play UEFA Cup games Tuesday.
	   In Sunday's action, Inter and new coach Mircea Lucescu are at
Vicenza, Juve hosts disappointing Lazio of Rome, Milan hosts
Udinese, Piacenza is home to Empoli, Bari is at Salernitana, and
Cagliari hosts Venezia.
	   ``The tight standings are exciting and give at least seven or
eight clubs hopes of winning the title,'' said Dino Zoff, Italy's
national team coach. ``While Fiorentina is among (the contenders) I
don't consider it a heavy favorite.''
	   Veteran coach Giovanni Trapattoni's club did look more like a
pretender than a contender in two of its last three outings: the
4-2 loss to Piacenza and a scoreless draw with Bari.
	   Fiorentina did put it all together in between those two games,
though, in a 3-1 win over Inter.
	   No one has shined consistently so far and the reasons are
varied. One equalizer is the slew of injuries to key players
(chiefly Juve's Alessandro Del Piero and Lazio's Christian Vieri).
Another is what's called the ``World Cup factor,'' whereby the big
teams that stock their rosters with internationals have seen those
players tire after a short offseason because of France '98.
	   ``It is a balanced, but not mediocre, league,'' Trapattoni said.
``Every Sunday can produce exciting games like ours against Inter
last week or the Rome derby. And many of the small clubs have
improved a lot, which makes everything tougher. For example, Bari
and Piacenza are the true surprises. They play great soccer and
make things hard on any team.''
	   Against Bologna, which has a league-high nine-game undefeated
streak, Trapattoni must find a way for his shaky defense to slow
the suddenly rejuvenated Giuseppe Signori. In the last year, both
Lazio and Sampdoria gave up on the former league scoring leader.
	   But Signori, 30, has a club-high five goals and heads a
versatile attack that includes Russia's Igor Kolyvanov, Sweden's
Kennet Andersson, and Brazil's Eriberto. Signori had a goal and an
assist in the first seven minutes last week as Bologna went on to
beat Juventus 3-0.
	   The game also presents an intriguing matchup between
Fiorentina's high-octane attack (league-best 22 goals, led by
Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta's 11) and Bologna's stingy
defense (nine goals allowed _ only Parma has given up fewer).

Israel suspends troop withdrawal after attack on Israeli soldier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat, Netanyahu quotes &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Attacks &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL101-116 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers assembled around a TV
set and watched a video of a Palestinian mob ambushing an Israeli
soldier. When the tape stopped, the decision was unanimous: Israel
would suspend its West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the attack
near the West Bank city of Ramallah, in which the trapped soldier
was pulled out of a car and repeatedly struck in the head with
rocks, was a direct result of incitement by the Palestinian
Authority against Israel.
	   ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli citizens being lynched,
or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that received incitement
from Palestinian officials,'' Netanyahu said in explaining his
decision to hold up the land-for-security agreement.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation of the
agreement once Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped
plans to announce a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for
the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   Israel has said it will not free those involved in attacks that
resulted in death or injury. The Palestinians demand that Israel
free prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The Palestinians appealed to the United States for help and
Arafat said Thursday that Netanyahu is ``violating completely'' the
Wye agreement.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin sided with the
Palestinians, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the peace
accord. David Leavy, a White House spokesman said the Clinton trip
was still on.
	   In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel
is to release 250 more Palestinian prisoners.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation with the
Palestinians has helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition.
	   In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend implementation
of the Wye agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said they
would not support an early elections bill as initially planned.
	   The legislation was to have come before parliament Monday, but
its sponsors said they might delay the vote because they no longer
have a majority.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   In response, dozens of masked Palestinians blocked Jerusalem
roads with burning tires and threw stones at cars. Israeli police
fired rubber bullets.
	   Early Thursday, a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian
laborers from the Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they
were investigating whether the arsonists had political motives. The
laborers escaped unharmed.
	   After the attack on the Israeli soldier on Wednesday, Netanyahu
convened his so-called security Cabinet and played a videotape of
the incident.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the
Cabinet room was tense during the screening and that those present
decided unanimously afterward to hold up implementation of the
accord.
	   However, the Palestinian Authority blamed Israel for the latest
crisis, saying it had raised tensions by refusing to release
Palestinian prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The two sides also argued over whether the attack on the soldier
was orchestrated or spontaneous.
	   The incident began when about 150 Palestinian university
students, many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march
in Ramallah to press for prisoner releases.
	   The group then marched to the outskirts of town to throw stones
at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier was riding in.
	   Netanyahu said the incident was ``organized, orchestrated,
planned in advance and fomented by the Palestinian Authority.''
	   However, Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank,
said the incident was triggered by growing anger over Israel's
handling of the prisoner issue.
	   ``In clashes, rocks are thrown,'' Barghouti said. ``This car
stopped with the soldier and they took his weapon. It was later
returned. They did not use it to kill.''
	   Netanyahu said Thursday that the Palestinian Authority had
raised false expectations concerning the prisoners. ``They have to
stop promising them things Israel never promised,'' he said. ``We
would never, ever release terrorist murderers, ever.''
	   Arafat brought up the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings in Washington, and Palestinian negotiators said the U.S.
president promised to do his utmost to resolve the issue.

Report: Prime minister wants Khmer Rouge tried in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Any trial of surviving Khmer Rouge
leaders implicated in genocide and other crimes against humanity
should take place on Cambodian soil, Prime Minister Hun Sen said in
an interview published Thursday.
	   Hun Sen said in the interview that he had told a visiting team
of U.N.-appointed legal experts last month that an international
tribunal organized by the United Nations would be ``impossible.''
	   ``It would be easier if the tribunal is set up by Cambodians in
accordance with Cambodian law with international assistance,'' Hun
Sen said in the interview, conducted Monday by the Hong Kong-based
news magazine Asiaweek.
	   The U.N. team spent a week in Cambodia to assess existing
evidence for a possible trial of top Khmer Rouge leaders held
responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people during
the Maoist guerrillas' 1975-79 rule of Cambodia.
	   Hun Sen said he had been told by the team that the International
Court of Justice at The Hague could not try people in absentia.
Doubtful that Khmer Rouge military chief Ta Mok and other surviving
rebels could be apprehended, the prime minister suggested a
Cambodian trial instead.
	   ``It is better that we hold a trial in absentia, issue a
verdict, them ask other countries for their cooperation to arrest
these people,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Supreme Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died of an apparent heart
attack in April, but a trio of important leader _ Ta Mok, Nuon Chea
and Khieu Samphan _ are still at large with a dwindling band of
armed supporters in the rugged mountains along the Thai-Cambodian
border.
	   The rebel's historically close relationship with the Thai
military and the reintegration of several top Khmer Rouge _ also
possible defendants _ into the Cambodian government are seen as a
potential stumbling blocks to a trial.
	   Ieng Sary, a deputy prime minister in the Khmer Rouge regime,
received an amnesty from the government in 1996 in exchange for
leading a mass defection of rebel fighters that crippled the
movement.
	   U.N. legal team member Sir Ninian Stephen told reporters after
meeting Hun Sen last month that the prime minister expressed no
desire to limit the scope of legal action.
	   Hun Sen told Asiaweek that it would be up to a prosecutor to
determine who would be brought to trial.

Russian prime minister calls for more detailed economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW grafs 13-15 with state savings bank releasing money from
private accounts. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government needs to come up with a more
detailed economic recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday, just a day after the International Monetary Fund
chief left without promising Moscow any new loans.
	   Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis program, but
the measures have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor
have they found favor with the IMF or other international lenders
that have frozen loans to Russia.
	   Primakov acknowledged the need to spell out the government's
intentions more clearly and called on the Cabinet to approve a more
detailed document.
	   ``Without such a concrete action plan, containing concrete tasks
and time frames, the government's steps will look merely like
intentions,'' Primakov said.
	   IMF chief Michel Camdessus left Russia on Wednesday after
meeting with Primakov and other top officials. He praised
Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis, but
said an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on loans to Russia.
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package this
summer, but only about dlrs 5 billion was disbursed before Russia's
economic crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen.
	   The IMF has indicated that Russia's draft budget for next year
appears overly optimistic, and it also does not like moves to
increase the government's role in the economy.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed out at the
IMF for refusing to release loans.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as
speaker for the State Duma, parliament's lower house. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay off its
debts and then refuse to take any more loans.
	   ``It's high time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he
told reporters.
	   In other economic developments Thursday:
	   _ Sberbank, the giant state-savings bank, has begun to service
individual accounts that were transferred to the bank from six
ailing commercial banks.
	   The government in September guaranteed the savings accounts of
all depositors who moved their money from the troubled commercial
banks into Sberbank.
	   Many individuals took the offer, though some keep their money in
commercial banks, which are still struggling to survive.
	   _ Inflation was up 5.7 percent in November, compared to 4.5
percent in October, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September
in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. However, inflation is up
about 70 percent compared to last December, Central Bank chief
Viktor Gerashchenko said Wednesday.
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves dropped by dlrs 200 million in
the last week of November and stood at dlrs 12.8 billion on Nov.
27, the Central Bank said Thursday. It didn't give a reason, though
the government spent some of its reserves to service foreign debts
during this period.

North Korea says it's on full alert for war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korean news media on Thursday
said the communist nation's military is on full alert for war with
the United States if a dispute over nuclear inspections comes to
blows.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported that
North Korean soldiers and people of all walks of life were ``on
full alert for war.''
	   North Korea typically sends out belligerent rhetoric, especially
when it enters high-stake talks with Washington.
	   The United States and North Korea are set to resume talks Friday
about inspections of an underground North Korean site suspected of
being used to produce nuclear weapons.
	   KCNA broadcasts brimmed with anti-American saber-rattling.
	   ``Our People's Army will blow up the U.S. territory as a whole''
if the United States starts a war on the divided Korean Peninsula,
Vice Defense Minister Jong Chang Ryol was quoted as saying
Thursday.
	   The general staff of the North Korean military accused
Washington on Wednesday of pushing the situation in Korea to the
``brink of war'' by demanding inspections and talks aimed at
preventing Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   ``Under the prevailing touch-and-go situation, the Korean
People's Army is now bracing itself for a fight against the U.S.
imperialist aggressors,'' KCNA quoted Jong as saying.
	   The agency also quoted various party officials, plant managers,
even museum curators as pledging a ``thousandfold revenge'' or
vowing to arm themselves with the ``spirit of human bombs and of
suicidal attack.''
	   Washington demands unconditional inspections of the North's
underground project. But North Korea asked Washington to pay dlrs
300 million for the right to inspect the site.
	   Concerns that North Korea was developing long-range missiles
capable of striking all of Japan and parts of the United States
escalated when North Korea fired a rocket on Aug. 31. Believed to
be a test of its Taepo Dong missile, the rocket flew over Japan and
landed in the Pacific Ocean.
	   The North's 1.1 million-strong military is the world's fifth
largest. It forms the backbone of the North Korean government, with
leader Kim Jong Il ruling the country as the head of the military.

Premier-designate faces tough task in building coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said
Thursday he would persist in the difficult task of convincing a key
party leader to join forces in a secular coalition.
	   Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday,
desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier
Tansu Ciller's center-right party.
	   Ecevit, a veteran leftist, already has the support of another
center-right party led by Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapsed
last week under the weight of a mafia scandal.
	   Mrs. Ciller has not said if she would back an Ecevit-led
government and her long-standing rivalry with Yilmaz makes Ecevit's
job of coalition-building difficult.
	   ``I don't give up that easily, neither do I lose hope that
easily,'' Ecevit told his parliamentary group Thursday.
	   Mrs. Ciller could lose grassroot support if she stands in the
way of a new government, political columnist Ertugrul Ozkok wrote
Thursday in daily Hurriyet. ``This could put her at odds with her
classic support base.''
	   Ecevit was expected to meet with Yilmaz on Thursday, and other
party leaders Friday.
	   Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to
keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power. Virtue is the largest
party in Parliament, but the all-powerful military is fiercely
opposed to an Islamic-led government.

Most Asian markets fall on Wall Street's overnight drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets fell Thursday on an
overnight drop on Wall Street that was prompted by a deteriorating
corporate earnings outlook in the United States.
	   In Tokyo, shares fell sharply following U.S. stocks, which also
pulled the U.S. dollar down against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 289.54 points,
or 1.93 percent, to close at 14,697.08.
	   In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar bought 119.46 yen, down
2.42 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday and also below its late New York
level of 119.93 yen overnight.
	   Rumors that a U.S. hedge fund was selling dollars to cover
emerging market losses also helped send the dollar to its lowest
level in almost two weeks.
	   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 69 points to
9,064.54 on worries that weak demand from Asia would hit earnings
at American companies.
	   In Hong Kong, shares fell slightly although a strong rebound in
property stocks staved off a heftier drop.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index dropped 9.63 points, or 0.1
percent, to close at 10,046.15.
	   A smaller index tracking Hong Kong real estate companies dropped
as much as 3 percent in early trading but then bounced back to show
a gain of 2.5 percent.
	   The turnaround by property companies was triggered by news that
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority _ the territory's de facto central
bank _ was easing restrictions on bank loans to home buyers in a
move seen as helping the territory's ailing property market.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Shares dropped despite local buying. The SET index lost
5.26 points, or 1.5 percent, to end at 337.86.
	   JAKARTA: Shares fell, with the Indonesian government's upbeat
forecast for next year's budget having little impact. The JSX
Composite Index was down 3.169 points, or 0.8 percent, at 393.795.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares dropped as investors cashed out of the
market after a series of recent gains. The Composite Index fell
4.99 points, or 0.94 percent, to finish at 521.76 points.
	   MANILA: Shares fell sharply on worries over possible inflation
and its impact on interest rates. The PSE Index plunged 78.97
points, or 4.2 percent, to 1,807.03.
	   SINGAPORE: Pessimistic traders pushed shares lower. The STI fell
40.16 points, or 2.9 percent, to close at 1,343.43.
	   SYDNEY: Shares fell as traders shrugged off a cut in local
interest rates. The All Ordinaries index was down 40.7 points, or
1.47 percent, to close at 2,720.3.
	   SEOUL: Share prices rose on expectations of progress in
corporate restructuring. The KOSPI index was up 1.76 points, or
0.40 percent, to close at 448.11.
	   TAIPEI: Shares fell on caution over mayoral and legislative
elections Saturday. The Weighted Price Index was down 17.11 points,
or 0.24 percent, to close at 7,140.11.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares fell for the third consecutive session. The
NZSE-40 was down 27.86 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at
1,903.64.

Kosovo monitors gear up for risky duty in troubled province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - An international mission of unarmed
observers is racing to build up its strength in Yugoslavia's
troubled Kosovo province, fully aware of the risks its volunteers
face, the head of the mission said Thursday.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
sending 2,000 monitors to Kosovo in the hope that a large
international presence will curb attacks on mainly ethnic
Albanians.
	   William Walker, head of the Kosovo Verification Mission, was in
the Norwegian capital to brief a meeting of OSCE foreign ministers
on the force, which is the biggest effort ever undertaken by the
OSCE.
	   Walker said about 500 observers were already in place, and that
every four or five days another 125 would be completing a training
course.
	   ``It is a very big effort and we are well underway,'' Walker
told reporters.
	   Under the terms of an Oct. 12 U.S.-brokered deal, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow as many as 2,000
unarmed international monitors into Kosovo. They are charged with
keeping track of the implementation of Milosevic's promises,
including a military withdrawal and working toward a political
settlement in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds were killed and as many as 300,000 people fled their
homes in a mainly Yugoslav Serb crackdown on the 90-percent ethnic
Albanian province. Walker said virtually all of those who fled now
have some kind of housing, even though many could not move back to
their damaged homes.
	   ``My impression is that tensions have diminished,'' said Walker,
who is based with the monitor corps in the Kosovo capital of
Pristina. He said local residents seem reassured by the
international presence.
	   But he said dangers remain for the international volunteers,
including anti-personnel mines that dot the countryside and the
danger of firefights erupting between ethnic Albanian rebels and
Yugoslav forces.
	   ``Getting caught in a firefight between two groups that have
weapons and like to fire at each other would be a very bad
situation,'' he said. ``That worst-case scenario is pretty
frightening.''
	   Walker said he hoped for a political solution before spring
thaws make it easier for military units to move, increasing the
risk of battles. NATO is prepared to come to the assistance of the
monitors if they are threatened.
	   The monitor mission now has 1,588 applicants from 34 countries,
and 492 have been accepted. Another 300 will be transferred from
the diplomatic observer mission to the monitor force. Italy has so
far offered the largest number of volunteers, 203, followed by
Germany with 187, Britain with 158 and the United States with 143.
	   OSCE officials said the force should reach full strength by
mid-January.
	   Walker rejected criticism that the force was build up too
slowly, saying that in fact the progress had been fast, considering
such practical difficulties as finding housing.

China says dissidents endangered the country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's government said Thursday that two
prominent dissidents arrested this week are suspected of
endangering national security _ the clearest sign yet Chinese
leaders plan to quash a would-be opposition party.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify what
laws were broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered the
state.
	   A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has
been in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of ``inciting
the overthrow of the government,'' the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   All three men could face up to life in prison if convicted of
the harshest measures under China's vague state security law. The
ruling Communist Party has resorted to the law to silence dissent
since it went into effect last year.
	   The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and the
accusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese
leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and
legally register the China Democracy Party in June.
	   Xu and Qin were ``suspected of involvement in activities
endangering state security'' and their ``behavior breached relevant
provisions of the criminal laws of the People's Republic of
China,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly briefing.
	   Police in Hangzhou city notified Wang's wife Wednesday that
charges have already been submitted to prosecutors, bringing him a
step closer to trial, the Information Center said.
	   Xu and Qin are influential figures in the dissident community,
having started their campaign for change 20 years ago in the
seminal Democracy Wall movement. Wang was a student leader in the
1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations. Both have served
time in prison. Xu spent 12 years in jail, much of it in solitary
confinement.
	   Since dissidents began organizing and trying to legally register
the China Democracy Party, police have harassed and briefly
detained more than two dozen members, but until now the government
had not leveled such politically charged allegations.
	   The Communist Party has never allowed another political party to
form since it took power in 1949.
	   In Washington on Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said the United States deplored the arrests and said the
dissidents' peaceful political activities were fundamental human
rights that all governments should protect.
	   U.S. officials conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and urged that Xu and Qin be released
immediately.
	   Zhu criticized the United States for condemning the arrests,
saying that ``no country, including the United States, should
interfere in China's internal affairs.''
	   China in October signed a key U.N. treaty on civil and political
rights that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of
association. It was the 17th international human rights treaty
China has signed.
	   Zhu told reporters there was ``absolutely no contradiction at
all'' between China's support for these treaties and its arrests of
the two dissidents.

Morocco submits official World Cup 2006 bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Morocco has formally notified FIFA of
its interest in hosting the 2006 World Cup finals, world soccer's
governing body confirmed Thursday.
	   The north African country, which made its move Wednesday, is the
sixth country to confirm it wants the tournament.
	   It follows Germany, England, Brazil, Egypt and Ghana.
	   Prospective candidates have until Dec. 31 to signal their intent
and until the end of July to submit their full bid documents.
FIFA's 24-member executive committee will decide in March 2000.
	   In Johannesburg last week, FIFA President Sepp Blatter declared
that FIFA had a ``responsibility'' to make sure the tournament
takes place in Africa.
	   South Africa is expected to formally signal its interest this
month. Blatter has long made it clear that he wants the finals to
be awarded to the country.
	   The case of both Germany and England has been weakened by the
fact that they are both from the same continent. The 2002 finals
are being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA has said
co-hosting would be a one-time exception.

Marches for 35-hour week, improved benefits for jobless; against
</HEADLINE>
tax cuts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Spanish workers were planning mass
demonstrations in 51 cities Thursday to demand a 35-hour week and
protest both low unemployment benefit levels and a government tax
reform.
	   The country's two main labor federations _ the General Workers
Union and the Workers' Commissions _ put aside recent differences
to call on their members to participate in marches around the
country from 7 p.m. (1800gmt) onwards.
	   In a joint statement the federations demanded a reduction of the
working week to 35 hours ``as an efficient way of creating more and
better jobs.''
	   The government has made much of recent reductions in
unemployment, but Spanish jobless figures remain far higher than
the European average, with over 19 percent of people eligible to
work out of job.
	   The protest marches were also called to demand improved benefits
for the unemployed, particularly the long-term jobless with few
chances of finding new employment.
	   In their statement the unions claimed that half of those without
a job do not currently receive economic benefits.
	   A tax reform promising rate cuts to come into effect in 1999 is
perceived by the unions as a ``present for the rich,'' and
constitutes a third reason to march ,according to their statement.
	   They reject government claims that the reform, predicted to
reduce tax revenue by 600 billion pesetas (dlrs 4.3 billion), will
benefit low income families most and promote economic growth by
encouraging people to spend, save and invest.
	   Instead the unions point out that basic tax for people in the
top tax bracket falls from 56 percent to 48 percent, the minimum
tax level only drops from 20 percent to 18 percent. They say that
economic growth would be far better served by government spending
on social projects and job creation.
	   Thursday's labor protest call was supported by left-leaning
political parties, including the main opposition Socialist party
and the United Left _ Spain's third political force United Left.
	   They mark a movement away from the relatively cordial relations
between the unions and the two-year-old conservative government of
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar that were maintained in part due to
negotiations over labor contract norms.

Attempt to warm heating pipes backfires, burns Russian building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A man tried to warm the frozen heating pipes in
his apartment complex with a fire, but the blaze quickly spread out
of control and gutted the building, leaving 40 people homeless, a
news report said Thursday.
	   The unidentified man built the fire in the basement of a
two-story wooden building in the Maldyak township in Russia's Far
East, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   But several rags caught fire and spread the blaze throughout the
building. All the residents managed to escape unharmed, the report
said.

U.S. envoy presents Serbs with new Kosovo peace plan draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The U.S. envoy for Kosovo on
Thursday presented Serb leaders with a revised draft plan for the
troubled province and said slow progress toward permanent peace was
being made
	   But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill also warned that time was at a
premium because of fears that fighting, now at a lull, could resume
with the onset of warmer weather in the spring.
	   ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' Hill said.
	   Before going into the meeting with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, Hill said the new draft reflects previous comments by
rival Serb and ethnic Albanian officials on how to achieve a
settlement for the ethnic Albanian-majority Serbian province.
	   Kosovo's Albanian leadership wants independence from Serbia but
is willing to settle for full autonomy as a first step. Serbia and
the Serbian leadership of Yugoslavia is strongly opposed to any
plan that would sideline Serbia in making decisions for Kosovo.
	   Hill did not elaborate on details, but said the new plan does
not explicitly specify whether Kosovo will become the third
Yugoslav republic or would remain a Serbian province. Republic
status for Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and
Montenegro, the present Yugoslav republics.
	   Hill told the Associated Press that he hoped the new draft would
provide an agreement which would ``shift the momentum from one of
violence to one of political settlement'' and said he planned to
meet ethnic Albanian officials Friday to present them with the new
draft.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless in the Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
that started in February. Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed with U.S. Envoy
Richard Holbrooke October 12 to end the Kosovo campaign and begin
political negotiations on the province's future.
	   Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own piece deal for Kosovo,
defying an earlier U.S. Plan and warning that anything beyond some
sort of self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war.
	   Secessionist ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian
proposal, but have indicated they would except a U.S. Plan if it
gives Kosovo the rite to become a third republic within Yugoslavia.
	   Hill said the new draft ``does not create a third republic,''
but ``addresses the internal aspects of Kosovo and leaves the door
open for further developments of Kosovo status.''
	   While Hill said that the plan was still not in its final stage,
he said he would like to have a settlement by spring because of
fears that warmer weather could bring a resumption of fighting.
	   ``Negotiations cannot be dragged on forever,'' he said. ``We
have a cease-fire which is holding but which would be very much
strengthened by a political settlement.''
	   ``Spring should be the time for plowing and not for fighting,''
he added.
	   Hill also said that the U.S. ``is looking at the ways to help
establish a local peace force and we are also beginning to look at
the process of what might be needed in Kosovo in the economic area
... so people can put down their guns and take up jobs.''

Ambassador says observer status `outdated'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cambodia's decision on whom to send to the
ASEAN summit in Hanoi this month will depend on whether it is
admitted to the group in advance, the country's ambassador to
Vietnam said Thursday.
	   Nuon Sareth called Cambodia's status as an observer at
Association of Southeast Asian Nations summits ``outdated.''
	   ASEAN's nine members have been hesitant to approve Cambodia's
application until the country has a stable government. After months
of political stalemate, Cambodia formed a new coalition government
on Monday.
	   ``Cambodian admission to ASEAN is a complicated issue because
some countries are in favor, some are not because they want more
stability in Cambodia,'' Sareth said by telephone.
	   ``The maintenance of Cambodia's observer status for too long is
outdated, and Cambodia will consider who to send to the summit,
depending on whether it is admitted or not.''
	   Vietnam reportedly has been spearheading an effort to gain
Cambodia's admission before the Dec. 15-16 summit.
	   ASEAN standing committee chairman S. Jayakumar, Singapore's
foreign minister, has effectively ruled out Cambodia's entry to the
group before the summit but said he will consult with regional
foreign ministers on the issue.

Gustafsson to play Sanguinetti in opening singles of final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Sweden's No.1 player Magnus Gustafsson was
drawn to play Italy's No.2 Davide Sanguinetti in the opening
singles of the Davis Cup final Friday.
	   In the second singles of the day Italy's top player Andrea
Gaudenzi will be pitted against Magnus Norman as Sweden's
top-ranked player, Thomas Johansson, was not included in the
quartet for the three-day indoor final on clay at Assago Forum.
	   Thursday's draw, in Milan's 16th century city council hall, also
provided Saturday's doubles between the Italian duo of Gaudenzi and
Diego Nargiso against the Swedish pair of Nicklas Kulti and Jonas
Bjorkman.
	   Gaudenzi takes on Gustaffson in a duel between Number Ones in
the reversed singles Sunday wqith Sanguinetti playing Norman.
	   It's the first time in the 99 years of tennis premier team event
that there is no one in the top 30 of the ATP lists playing singles
in the final.
	   Gustaffson is the highlight with No. 31.
	   Italy, which upset the United States in the semifinals, will be
playing its seventh final - the first since 1980 and the first ever
at home.
	   Sweden, a six-time Davis Cup titlist, will be on its 12th final
at Assago.

Chinese man going on trial in Internet subversion case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A computer entrepreneur charged with
subversion for giving away Chinese e-mail addresses to an Internet
democracy magazine is to go on trial Friday in a courtroom closed
to the public and reporters.
	   Lin Hai, 30, is accused of ``inciting the overthrow of state
power'' by giving 30,000 addresses to ``Big Reference,'' a
pro-democracy journal published by dissidents abroad.
	   His case highlights China's efforts to police the Internet with
the same intensity it has used to try to silence other forms of
political dissent.
	   Two lawyers are to appear with Lin in court, but his wife,
reporters and other spectators are barred. Most trials in Shanghai
are open, but that policy makes an exception for privacy cases and
government secrets.
	   ``Because this case involves government internal affairs, it is
not public,'' said Li Chunping, a spokesman for the Shanghai
Foreign Affairs Office.
	   Lin's wife, Xu Hong, said she would wait outside the courthouse.
She had appealed unsuccessfully for an open trial.
	   Lin, owner of a Shanghai computer software company, was detained
in March and charged the next month. His trial had been scheduled
to start last week but was postponed without explanation.
	   Xu said she has written to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji asking for their help but has received no reply.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gunpowder exploded at a defense plant in Siberia,
causing extensive damage but causing no injuries, a news report

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Two former cabinet ministers and a family
member of ex-dictator Gen. Sani Abacha defrauded Nigeria of about
dlrs 2 billion by buying and reselling debt payments on a
Russian-built steel plant, Nigerian officials said.
	   The fraud allegation is just the latest in a string of similar
accusations linked to Abacha, who was estimated to be worth from
dlrs 3 billion to dlrs 6 billion when he suddenly died in early
June.
	   Mohammed Haruna, the chief press secretary to head of state Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, said Tuesday that the Abacha family member
and the ministers _ none of whom were named _ committed the fraud
through debt payments owed to Russia for the unfinished Ajaokuta
steel plant in northern Nigeria.
	   The plant, which is said to have cost a total of about dlrs 5
billion, was begun in the early 80s and has yet to be finished. It
has been a regular target of criticism for its waste, mismanagement
and government corruption.
	   The Abacha family members and the ministers set up by an
overseas company that purchased about dlrs 2.5 billion in debt owed
to Russia by Nigeria at a heavy discount _ paying about dlrs 500
million. The company, which has not been identified, then resold
the debt to Nigeria at its face value, pocketing the remaining dlrs
2 billion, Haruna said.

Tearful ex-bank boss says he was set up in major depositors' run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The ousted boss of a bank whose troubles
sparked the biggest run on deposits in Taiwan's history emerged
from seclusion Thursday and tearfully complained he was set up.
	   ``Personally, I'm not a bad guy,'' said Tseng Chen-jen, who was
thrown out as chairman of the Taichung Business Bank on Nov. 25
amid allegations of improper lending. ``I will not evade a problem
and I will not flee.''
	   After regulators removed Tseng, panicked depositors lined up and
pulled out 40 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.2 billion) in
less than 24 hours.
	   Authorities said Tseng was appointed to his post on Oct. 31 and
within days the bank had made loans of up to 7.4 billion Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 227 million) to six shaky investment and
property companies that had suspected ties to Tseng.
	   Speaking to reporters, Tseng avoided questions about any loans
being made without proper collateral, but said he was talking to
several parties about taking an interest in his conglomerate, Kuang
Shan Group.
	   Although Tseng said he was set up, he did not provide any
details.
	   Several other directors were also removed from the bank in
Taichung, which is in central Taiwan about 120 miles (200
kilometers) south of the capital, Taipei. The government ordered
new supervisors to take control of the bank and provide emergency
cash to reassure people that their money would be safe.
	   The day after the bank run, authorities barred Tseng from
leaving Taiwan pending investigations into allegations that he
abused his position.
	   A newspaper reported Tseng had gotten into financial trouble
during a property slump several years ago, but he bailed himself
out by going to a Las Vegas casino where he won U.S. dlrs 30
million.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ An alarm that went off in the
cockpit just minutes before liftoff forced NASA to scrub Thursday's
launch of space shuttle Endeavour on the first space station
construction flight. The alarm sounded with about five minutes
remaining in the countdown. NASA counted down to the 31-second mark
and debated what might have caused the master alarm to go off.
Managers counted down several more seconds before calling off the
attempt for the day. Until practically the last minute, NASA
worried that rain and accompanying clouds would foil the launch.
But the rain drifted away in time for the targeted 3:58 a.m. (0858
GMT) liftoff _ and then the alarm went off. Endeavour's pilots
reported that the alarm sounded right around the time shuttle
hydraulic power units were turned on. But launch controllers
quickly determined that all three units were working fine.
(US-SPACE STATION)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
that an attack on a soldier near the West Bank city of Ramallah was
a direct result of incitement by the Palestinian Authority against
Israel. ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli citizens being
lynched, or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that received
incitement from Palestinian officials,'' Netanyahu said in
explaining his decision to suspend the Israeli troop withdrawal.
Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation of the agreement
once Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to
announce a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the
release of Palestinian prisoners. U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin sided with the Palestinians, saying the Wye River peace
agreement ``should be implemented as signed.''
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia announced an election
timetable for next year Thursday, but it failed to appease 1,000
student protesters who marched down Jakarta's main road to demand a
trial of former President Suharto. Rows of riot police and several
light tanks blocked the students from reaching the palace of
President B.J. Habibie, who has pledged democratic reforms but is
deeply unpopular among students, who say he is a stooge of his
predecessor. The government dropped plans to set up an independent
panel to investigate Suharto, who students want tried on charges of
corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Parliamentary elections will be held on June 7, and the top
legislative body that is empowered to elect a new president will
convene Aug. 29, House Speaker Harmoko said. (INDONESIA-ELECTION)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Neighbors watched helplessly as a
pre-dawn fire raged Thursday through an aging orphanage in a Manila
squatter area, killing at least 28 people, mostly children. Young
children shouted for help from the second-floor windows, which were
covered with metal grills to protect against intruders. Neighbors
were unable to open the padlocked main gate. The dozens of children
at the Catholic-run Bahay Kalinga orphanage had been looking
forward to a Christmas party the next day. Instead, at least 23
children died and Christmas decorations were scattered, along with
toys and children's clothes, among the buildings' debris. ``I'm
afraid my playmates were burned,'' said Brian De Mesa, 5, who
survived along with his twin brother. ``I saw their burned bodies.
I don't want to go back.'' (PHILIPPINES-ORPHANAGE FIRE)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Late-night negotiations led by
Prime Minister Tony Blair have narrowed the gap between Protestant
and Catholic leaders over how to make Northern Ireland's peace
accord work, both sides said Thursday. Blair made no comment as he
left Stormont Parliamentary Building in east Belfast at about 1
a.m. after overseeing seven hours of discussions. But senior
negotiators from the major British Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, and the major Irish Catholic party, the Social
Democratic and Labor Party or SDLP, confirmed that a deal was close
thanks to Blair's intervention. They resumed their haggling early
Thursday but weren't sure whether a formal announcement was still
hours or days away. Both sides said the Ulster Unionists agreed to
create 10 departments in the new multi-party administration for
Northern Ireland envisaged in April's peace accord. (NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Any trial of surviving Khmer Rouge
leaders implicated in genocide and other crimes against humanity
should take place on Cambodian soil, Prime Minister Hun Sen said in
an interview published Thursday. Hun Sen said in the interview that
he had told a visiting team of U.N.-appointed legal experts last
month that an international tribunal organized by the United
Nations would be ``impossible.'' ``It would be easier if the
tribunal is set up by Cambodians in accordance with Cambodian law
with international assistance,'' Hun Sen said in the interview,
conducted Monday by the Hong Kong-based news magazine Asiaweek. The
U.N. team spent a week in Cambodia to assess existing evidence for
a possible trial of top Khmer Rouge leaders held responsible for
the deaths of as many as 2 million people during the Maoist
guerrillas' 1975-79 rule of Cambodia. (CAMBODIA-GENOCIDE)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets fell Thursday on an
overnight drop on Wall Street that was prompted by a deteriorating
corporate earnings outlook in the United States. In Tokyo, shares
fell sharply following U.S. stocks, which also pulled the U.S.
dollar down against the yen. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average shed 289.54 points, or 1.93 percent, to close at 14,697.08.
In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar bought 119.46 yen, down 2.42
yen in Tokyo late Wednesday and also below its late New York level
of 119.93 yen overnight. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese economy shrank for the fourth straight
quarter, continuing to wallow in the nation's deepest recession in
decades, the government said Thursday. Japan's gross domestic
product _ the measure of all goods and services produced in the
country _ declined by 0.7 percent in the three months from July
through September, compared to the previous quarter, the Economic
Planning Agency said. The economy contracted at an annual rate of
2.6 percent, the agency said. Japan has been battered by Asia's
financial meltdown, which has slashed exports, long the mainstay of
its economic growth. Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya
expressed hopes that the economy may be hitting bottom and nearing
``a dawn.'' But he reiterated that the economy's performance during
this fiscal year, which ends next March, may turn out to be worse
than the government prediction of a 1.8 percent contraction.
(JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government needs to come up with a more
detailed economic recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday, just a day after the International Monetary Fund
chief left without promising Moscow any new loans. Primakov's
government has produced an anti-crisis program, but the measures
have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor have they found
favor with the IMF or other international lenders who have frozen
loans to Russia. Primakov acknowledged the need to spell out the
government's intentions more clearly and called on the Cabinet to
approve a more detailed document. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong workers were dealt another blow
Thursday when British banking giant HSBC Holdings announced it will
freeze salaries for more than 13,000 employees in the territory at
its flagship unit, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Union
officials said they expect more companies to follow HSBC's lead in
freezing or cutting salaries ahead of Chinese New Year in February,
the time when most companies review and restructure operations.
Unemployment is already at 5.3 percent, the highest level since
1981 when officials started collecting such data, and is expected
to climb even further. Gareth Hewett, an HSBC spokesman, said the
decision was made recently to ``reflect economic conditions'' in
the territory. He declined to say if the bank expects the Hong Kong
economy to deteriorate further. (HONG KONG-PAY FREEZE).
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Spanish workers were planning mass
demonstrations in 51 cities Thursday to demand a 35-hour week and
protest both low unemployment benefit levels and a government tax
reform. The country's two main labor federations _ the General
Workers Union and the Workers' Commissions _ put aside recent
differences to call on their members to participate in marches
around the country from 7 p.m. onwards. In a joint statement the
federations demanded a reduction of the working week to 35 hours
``as an efficient way of creating more and better jobs.''
(SPAIN-LABOR PROTESTS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's largest computer electronics makers,
Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corp., announced Thursday they will join
hands to develop advanced semiconductors. The two companies plan to
spend more than 30 billion yen (dlrs 252 million) on the joint
project, which will involve a team of about 100 researchers, they
said in a statement. The move comes amid a prolonged slump in
prices for computer memory chips, which has forced many chipmakers
to reassess plans to single-handedly invest huge sums in
development and production of the latest semiconductors.

	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Salt Lake Olympics planners are
considering switching the sites of some ice events for the 2002
Winter Games.
	   Men's ice hockey could be moved from the E Center in West Valley
City to the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, with figure skating and
short-track speed skating shifting from the Delta Center to the E
Center.
	   Figure skating and short-track speed skating might be better
suited to the E Center because of technical requirements, Salt Lake
Organizing Committee sports director Cathy Priestner Allinger said
Wednesday.
	   ``That doesn't mean we'll change it for sure,'' she said. ``Both
venues know we're revisiting the issue. We have to decide what's
best for the athletes, what's best for the sports.''
	   Delta Center and E Center officials could not be reached for
comment.
	   The decision could hinge on reviews of both venues by
International Skating Union and International Ice Hockey Federation
officials.

Report: Anwar supporters may form political party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Supporters of jailed former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim may form a political party to further
their crusade for democratic reforms, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Leaders of the political reform movement that Anwar launched
soon after he was fired on Sept. 2 are scheduled to meet with a
government official who registers new parties, the Sun newspaper
said, quoting a spokesman for the group.
	   Spokesman Abdul Malek Hussein was quoted as saying that he would
meet Anwar's wife Azizah Ismail to discuss the formation of the
party. Anwar has said she would lead the movement in his absence.
	   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad dared Anwar's
supporters to form a party to challenge him in the general election
in 2000.
	   ``(If) they want to set up a political party, it's OK, if they
dare,'' Mahathir said.
	   The Malaysian leader said authorities would approve the
formation of a new political party if it eschewed street protests
and promised not to hold demonstrations.
	   ``But if they say they want to form a political party (because
they want) to shoot and kill people and hold demonstrations every
day, we will not give the approval,'' he said.
	   Pro-reform activists have gathered repeatedly in the capital
city of Kuala Lumpur in recent weeks to hold mostly peaceful
anti-government demonstrations.
	   They have shouted slogans demanding an end to Mahathir's 17-year
rule and burned portraits of the prime minister.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar alleging that he was too immoral to rule.
Anwar is facing trial on 10 counts of abuse of office and illegal
sex.
	   He has denied all the charges against him, saying they were
politically motivated.

Estrada launches 2,000-peso notes to commemorate Philippine

centennial

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada launched
Thursday a 2,000-peso (dlrs 51) note to commemorate the centennial
of the Philippines' declaration of independence from Spain.
	   Philippine Central Bank Gov. Gabriel Singson presented one of
the notes to Estrada in a ceremony at the president's home.
	   Singson said 300,000 notes were printed and will be sold for
3,000 pesos (dlrs 77) each. The notes, which will be sold to the
public beginning Friday, are legal tender but are aimed primarily
at collectors.
	   They measure about five inches by eight inches (12.7 centimeters
by 20.3 centimeters), about three times the size of usual
Philippine bank notes.
	   The front features Estrada taking his oath as the country's 13th
president at the Barasoain church in Bulacan province. The church
is where the first Philippine constitution was signed and where the
first Philippine president, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, was proclaimed.
	   The back carries an image of former President Fidel Ramos waving
a Philippine flag during a re-enactment of the declaration of
Philippine independence in Cavite province earlier this year. The
image is a reproduction of an Associated Press photograph of the
event.
	   Gabriel said the government expects to raise 290 million pesos
(dlrs 7.4 million) from sale of the notes.

Gripped by growing pains, Dutch airport looks to the sea

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Determined to keep growing,
Amsterdam's landlocked airport wants to expand into choppy waters
by building new runways on a manmade island in the North Sea.
	   Wary pilots warn of offshore fog and tricky crosswinds.
Environmentalists fear for the future of marine life. But the
airport chief and the national airline see ``Schiphol-on-Sea'' as
the only way the airport, already one of Europe's busiest hubs, can
keep pace with soaring demand.
	   ``This issue is so important that it doesn't lend itself to
compromises,'' said Schiphol's director, Gerlach Cerfontaine.
	   An island airport would provide a uniquely Dutch answer to a
typically Dutch problem: Reclaiming land is a traditional way to
alleviate overcrowding in the Netherlands, Europe's most densely
populated nation.
	   It also would end the engine noise afflicting 15,000 households
living near the current airport on the outskirts of Amsterdam,
although residents would have to endure another 12 years of
low-flying aircraft before it would be ready.
	   The Dutch government, which owns 76 percent of the airport, is
expected to outline its view of Schiphol's future by the end of the
year.
	   Although no detailed plans have been released, Schiphol and KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines want the island in operation by 2010.
Passengers would check in at the current terminal before being
whisked to the island on high-speed trains through an undersea
tunnel.
	   The Dutch aviation industry is pressing the government to
subsidize part of the dlrs 18.6-21.3 billion it says the island
would cost. Such expansion, it says, is the only way Schiphol can
remain Europe's No. 4 airport, behind London Heathrow, Paris'
Charles De Gaulle and Frankfurt.
	   The payback, KLM and Schiphol argue, would be thousands of new
jobs and economic growth. Failure to upgrade the facility, they
caution, could cost 30,000 jobs and millions in lost business.
	   Already, U.S.-based Northwest Airlines has threatened to break
its lucrative partnership with KLM if Schiphol's wings are clipped.
	   Its point isn't lost on the government, which recently agreed to
ease noise pollution limits on Schiphol. That will allow the
airport, which expects 10 percent growth this year alone, to more
than double the number of passengers it now handles to 80 million a
year _ the equivalent of 600,000 takeoffs and landings.
	   With a fifth runway due to come into use in 2003, Schiphol could
handle all the expected traffic on its present site. But it says
aviation growth could require it to handle 900,000 takeoffs and
landings later in the next century, making the island necessary.
	   Before one of the Netherlands' greatest feats of civil
engineering can begin, Schiphol and KLM must also overcome the
powerful Dutch environmental lobby.
	   ``An island would lead to unlimited growth of the airline
sector, with all the air and noise pollution it carries, plus
damage to the marine environment,'' said Kees Kodde, aviation
policy adviser for the activist group, Environment Defense.
	   It says Schiphol can stay where it is and accommodate
international growth simply by scrapping domestic flights.
	   Airline pilots, meanwhile, say the maritime weather would create
tricky conditions for island takeoffs and landings.
	   ``Mist and low-hanging clouds _ extremely undesirable for
landing aircraft _ are particularly difficult to predict on the
North Sea,'' the Association of Dutch Pilots warned recently.
``Wind is also much more powerful over the sea than on land.''
	   Engineers say making an island isn't as difficult as it sounds
because of the shallow continental shelf that extends seven miles
from the Dutch coast.
	   Using floating dredgers, sand would be sucked up from one area
of the seabed and dumped elsewhere. Once the land mass was above
sea level, it would be surrounded by protective dikes.

Verdict expected in theft trial of U.S. rapper Coolio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Appearing bored, U.S. rapper Coolio
watched Thursday as a boutique owner demonstrated to a court how
the rap star allegedly punched her when she tried to stop him from
taking merchandise without paying.
	   The Grammy-award winning artist and six members of his band, the
40 Thievs, are accused of leaving the boutique in the Stuttgart
suburb last Nov. 20 with clothing worth 1,500 marks (dlrs 940).
Coolio is being tried on charges of being an accessory to robbery
and causing bodily injury. A verdict was expected later Thursday.
	   Coolio, 35, has denied punching the woman and said the incident
was a misunderstanding. He says he signed autographs in the
boutique, and that in exchange a clothing company had promised him
and his group free outfits.
	   A dozen German and foreign news cameras trailed the court to the
boutique Thursday, where the owner walked through the incident.
	   Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., has paid the
boutique owner 5,000 marks (dlrs 3,000) damages, and faces four
years in prison if convicted.
	   Four members of Coolio's group also were charged, but did not
show up for trial. The judge has issued warrants for their arrest.
	   The rapper won a Grammy for best rap solo in 1996 for
``Gangsta's Paradise,'' which was featured in the film ``Dangerous
Minds.'' He is scheduled to tour Germany in January.

Tory leader faces rebellion in House of Lords
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The deputy leader of Conservatives in the House of
Lords resigned Thursday in a rebellion against Tory leader William
Hague, in a dispute centering on the government's plan to abolish
hereditary peers.
	   Lord Fraser of Carmyllie said he was ``disgusted and appalled''
at Hague's decision Wednesday to dismiss Lord Cranborne as Tory
leader in the Lords.
	   Hague is determined to fight against Prime Minister Tony Blair's
plan to eliminate hereditary voting rights in the Lords, and was
apparently caught by surprise when Cranborne accepted an agreement
with the government to phase out the nobles in two stages. That
agreement was strongly backed by Conservatives in the House of
Lords including Lord Strathclyde, Cranborne's successor.
	   Given the government's large majority in the House of Commons,
Hague conceded he was bound to lose the fight. ``But that does not
mean that the Conservative Party has to withdraw its objections,''
Hague said in a radio interview Thursday.
	   ``You shouldn't fiddle about with the House of Lords or the rest
of the British constitution without knowing what you're going to
put in its place.''
	   The government had made the abolition of hereditary peers one of
its main legislative goals in the current session of Parliament,
and it was anxious to avoid a drawn-out fight with the
Conservative-dominated House of Lords to get the bill through. The
split between Hague and the Conservative peers should make the
government's task easier.
	   Blair intends to appoint a commission to recommend the future
method of selecting members. One of Blair's main complaints about
the House of Lords now is that nearly all of the 759 hereditary
peers are Conservatives, giving the party a permanent majority.
	   Reform of the Lords was one of the Labor Party's pledges before
the 1997 election. By convention, the House of Lords is obliged to
consent eventually to any legislation based on the governing
party's election manifesto.
	   	   Lord Cranborne is the heir of one of Britain's most
distinguished noble lines, the Cecil family, which has played a
prominent political role for 400 years.
	   He admitted that he had been operating ``quite outrageously''
behind Hague's back and deserved to be sacked.
	   Hague said Cranborne had been prepared to let the government
have its way without a fight.
	   ``When I asked Robert Cranborne whether a deal on this matter
would mean we had to support the legislation through the House of
Commons and the Lords, he said yes. It was a deal which, if
accepted, would mean that the Conservative party would support the
government's changes to the House of Lords lock, stock and
barrel,'' Hague said.

ADB approves loan for infrastructure projects in six Indian cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank approved
Thursday a dlrs 250 million loan to help finance several
infrastructure projects in India's Rajasthan province.
	   The Manila-based bank said up to 7 million people would benefit
from the projects.
	   The projects, covered by the Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure
Development Project, include improvements to water and sanitation
facilities, slum areas and traffic management.
	   In particular, the project will benefit the cities of Ajmer,
Bikaner, Jaipur, Kota and Udaipur.
	   Rapid population growth in cities, spurred by the arrival of
people from the countryside searching for a better life, has put a
heavy strain on urban services, the bank said.
	   It said many households in the cities receive water for only one
and half hours daily. Sewage collection is available only in
limited areas, and only half of all urban households have toilets,
it said.
	   The total cost of the projects is dlrs 362 million. The
remainder of the financing will come from the national government
of India and the local government of Rajasthan.
	   The interest rate on the ADB loan will be determined by the
Manila-based bank's variable lending rate system for U.S. dollar
loans.
	   The loan is payable in 25 years, with a five-year grace period.

Christo's wrapped trees to be uncovered early
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ Some 178 trees in a Swiss museum park
wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude will be unveiled several weeks
early, the husband-and-wife artists announced Thursday.
	   The exhibit, which transformed this quiet suburb of the city of
Basel when it opened last month, was expected to remain on show
until late January.
	   But the artists decided for aesthetic reasons to start
unwrapping the trees Dec. 14, in an operation open to the public.
	   ``With all our previous temporary works of art, the 14-day
duration of the project's exhibition had been an aesthetic
choice,'' they said in a statement.
	   Although less grandiose than previous projects such as the 1995
wrapping of Berlin's Reichstag, the trees project involves 55,000
square meters (461,000 square feet) of woven polyester fabric and
23 kilometers (14 miles) of rope.
	   ``All materials will be recycled'' when the exhibit is
dismantled, Christo and Jeanne-Claude said.
	   The display coincides with a ``Magic of Trees'' exhibition
inside the Beyeler museum featuring works of art from Picasso,
Chagall, Cezanne and Giacometti, to name but a few.
	   The museum said it ``respects the artists' decision because it
was clear from the beginning that they alone would determine how
long the `Wrapped Trees' installation would last.''
	   ``We are deeply grateful to Christo and Jeanne-Claude for giving
us this unique experience and eagerly look forward to their next
project,'' it added.
	   With up to 20,000 people expected on a typical weekend, local
authorities put in place stringent traffic regulations to ensure
that the village of Riehen was not overwhelmed.

Lithuania gives food aid to Russian region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The first batch of Lithuanian food aid was
delivered Thursday to Russia's Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad to
stave off potential shortages, a news report said.
	   Authorities in Kaliningrad _ which is sandwiched between
Lithuania and Poland _ previously declared an ``emergency
situation'' to make sure the region does not run out of food and
fuel during the winter.
	   The federal government in Moscow insists that Russia has enough
food, but a lack of money has delayed deliveries to outlying
regions. The problem is especially acute in Kaliningrad, which is
cut off from the rest of Russia.
	   Lithuania delivered 100,000 cans of condensed milk, 100,000 cans
of meat, and 40 tons of cheese to Kaliningrad on Thursday, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   In all, Lithuania plans to provide 220 tons of food worth 3.5
million litai (dlrs 875,000) to the Kaliningrad region, said the
Lithuanian consul in Kaliningrad, Jonas Voronavicius.
	   The food will be distributed among hospitals and kindergartens,
Voronavicius said, according to Interfax.
	   Russia is to receive food aid from the European Union and the
United States worth about dlrs 1 billion this winter.

Al-Tikriti begins three-day memorial rite for wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Barzan al-Tikriti, a half-brother of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, on Thursday began a three-day memorial
rite for his late wife.
	   Black mourning banners were put up on many buildings and at road
intersections from Baghdad to al-Tikriti's home village to the
north, where he received relatives and friends expressing
condolences for the death of his wife, Ahlam.
	   Journalists were barred from covering the rite.
	   Al-Tikriti, who served as Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, for a decade, had been recalled to
Iraq last summer along with about two dozen other diplomats.
	   But he delayed his departure because his wife was being treated
for breast cancer. She died in Switzerland last month.
	   Ahlam, 44, was the half-sister of Saddam's first wife, Sajida,
who is the mother of Odai and Qusai, Saddam's two powerful sons.
	   Al-Tikriti returned to Baghdad on Dec. 1 after denying rumors
that he had delayed his return because he was seeking to defect
amid disputes with Saddam.
	   He said he did not want a new government post so that he could
spend more time with his family. The couple had six children, aged
11 to 26.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The two Norwegian TV journalists flipped
the coin to see who would get to sit in the back seat of the car
and recline during the 12-hour drive across the desert to Iraq.
	   Cameraman Knut Andre Denielsen won the round which turned out to
be fatal.
	   ``I watched Danielsen and the driver fly out of the car as it
overturned in the middle of the highway in Iraq,'' Anders Saether
who survived the Wednesday accident, told The Associated Press
Thursday. Their four-wheel drive taxi ran off the road and
overturned five times.
	   The Jordanian driver, Khaled Shawkat, 30, was also hurt in the
6:30 a.m. (0430 GMT) crash which occurred 350 kilometers (210
miles) east of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
	   The two Norwegians were sent to Iraq by Norway's TV2 to produce
a feature film on the plight of Iraqis under U.N. sanctions,
imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The desert highway is one of the few ways into Iraq because of
the sanctions that also ban air travel to that country.
	   Saether, a correspondent, arrived in Jordan on Wednesday with a
British Television crew that found him on the side of the highway.
He was admitted to hospital in Amman with whiplash, bruises and a
fractured ankle.
	   Saether, 30, speaking from his hospital bed Thursday, said he
was ``pained'' for the death of ``my very dear friend.''
	   ``I am going to miss him,'' he added.
	   He kept saying he was ``lucky to have buckled up.''
	   ``Had I not done so, like the driver and Danielsen, I would have
maybe been dead,'' he said. He said he did not know what caused the
crash.
	   He said Iraqi doctors were performing autopsy on Danielsen,
whose body is expected to be sent home for burial on the weekend.
	   Danielsen, 33, was single and lived in Bergen, which is 500
kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo. He had a degree as a TV
director and was an experienced traveler.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Neighbors watched helplessly as a
pre-dawn fire raged Thursday through an orphanage in a Manila
squatter area, killing at least 28 people, mostly children. Two
other children were missing and presumed dead.
	   Young children shouted for help from the second-floor windows,
which were covered with metal grills to protect against intruders,
but neighbors were unable to open the padlocked main gate to get to
them.
	   The dozens of children at the Catholic-run Bahay Kalinga
orphanage had been looking forward to a Christmas party the next
day. Instead, the Christmas decorations were scattered, along with
toys and children's clothes, among the buildings' debris.
	   ``I'm afraid my playmates were burned,'' said Brian De Mesa, 5,
who survived along with his twin brother. ``I saw their burned
bodies. I don't want to go back.''
	   About 70 people were inside the orphanage and children's home
when the fire broke out at about 2 a.m., officials said.
	   Rescuers gingerly lifted the bodies of small infants wrapped in
blankets from the remains of the buildings, which included a
two-story main structure and two cottages, all built between 1913
and 1927.
	   Thirteen dead children were found huddled together in one room.
In another, a dead adult was found clinging to two children, all
charred beyond recognition.
	   Staff members said the fire spread so quickly that they did not
have time to rescue many children.
	   ``I was sleeping on the ground floor when I was woken up,'' said
Carina Bellosillo, a teacher. ``Already, the ceiling was on fire
and the stairs going up to the second floor were burning. I wanted
to go upstairs to save the babies, but my companions pulled me
back.''
	   The ceiling later collapsed, and many of the children's bodies
were found on the ground.
	   Some children of working parents also stayed at the orphanage in
the slum area in Manila's Paco district, and parents and relatives
wept as they waited for word of their children.
	   ``He was my only joy,'' said Anabel Sambriano, 21, whose
9-month-old boy died in the blaze. ``I heard about the fire on the
radio and rushed here, but it was too late. I want my baby.''
	   President Joseph Estrada visited the gutted buildings Thursday
afternoon and pledged to help the orphanage recover.
	   ``I will raise funds personally. I will do everything I can to
rebuild this place,'' he said.
	   Fire officials said about 70 percent of the orphanage was
already burning when they arrived shortly after 2 a.m.
	   ``We couldn't even go near because of the intense heat,'' said
Major Pablito Cordeta, operations chief of the Manila Fire
Department. ``A few seconds after we arrived, part of the roof
collapsed.''
	   Investigators said faulty electrical wiring may have triggered
the fire.
	   ``Most probably the electrical system was also old,'' said Capt.
Pennimore Jaudian, chief arson unit investigator.
	   Faulty equipment or lax enforcement of fire regulations are
responsible for many deadly fires in the Philippines.
	   In May 1998, a fire at the Lung Center of the Philippines in
Quezon City, part of metropolitan Manila, killed 25 people and
devastated the government-run hospital. Two years earlier, a fire
at the Ozone Disco in the same suburb killed 162 people.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two armed men who took two bank
employees hostage during a robbery in Lower Saxony state Thursday
freed one in a Frankfurt suburb, police said.
	   The men, armed with automatic pistols, fled to Frankfurt in a
car belonging to one of the hostages after bursting into the bank
in the Lower Saxony town of Bad Pyrmont shortly after it opened.
	   They threatened to shoot the hostages if they saw any police
vehicles along the road, and demanded that a police helicopter
trailing them be pulled back, police said.
	   It was not immediately clear how much, if any, money they took.
	   Police were talking with the men by mobile telephone for much of
the journey, but lost contact around midday. There was no word on
their intended destination or further demands.

Russian cadet shot after stealing rifle, trying to flee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A cadet from a military college in central Siberia
stole a rifle and tried to flee, but was shot to death by a sentry,
a news report said Thursday.
	   Dmitry Filyagin, a third-year cadet in the city of Novosibirsk,
walked into the college's storage area on Wednesday and seized a
rifle from the guard, a fellow cadet, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Filyagin then tried to flee, but was stopped by a sentry, who
shot after Filyagin pulled the rifle's breach block, Interfax said.
	   Military officials said the incident may have been a result of
Filyagin's family troubles, Interfax reported. It did not
elaborate.
	   A severe lack of funding and miserable living conditions in the
Russian army have driven scores of servicemen to attack their own
comrades or commit suicide.

U.S. envoy presents Serbs with new Kosovo peace plan draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. envoy for Kosovo presented
Serb leaders with a revised draft plan for the troubled province
Thursday and said slow progress toward permanent peace was being
made.
	   But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill also warned that time was at a
premium because of fears that fighting, now at a lull, could resume
with the onset of warmer weather in the spring.
	   ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' Hill said.
	   Before going into the meeting with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, Hill said the new draft reflects previous comments by
rival Serb and ethnic Albanian officials on how to achieve a
settlement for the Serbian province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   Kosovo's Albanian leadership wants independence from Serbia but
is willing to settle for full autonomy as a first step. Serbia and
the Serbian leadership of Yugoslavia is strongly opposed to any
plan that would sideline Serbia in making decisions for Kosovo.
	   Hill did not elaborate on details, but said the new plan does
not explicitly specify whether Kosovo will become the third
Yugoslav republic or would remain a Serbian province. Republic
status for Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and
Montenegro, the present Yugoslav republics.
	   Hill told The Associated Press that he hoped the new draft would
provide an agreement which would ``shift the momentum from one of
violence to one of political settlement'' and said he planned to
meet ethnic Albanian officials Friday to present them with the new
draft.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless in the Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
that started in February. Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed with U.S. Envoy
Richard Holbrooke on October 12 to end the Kosovo campaign and
begin political negotiations on the province's future.
	   Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own peace deal for Kosovo,
defying an earlier U.S. plan and warning that anything beyond some
sort of self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war.
	   Secessionist ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian
proposal, but have indicated they would except a U.S. plan if it
gives Kosovo the right to become a third republic within
Yugoslavia.
	   While Hill said that the plan was still not in its final stage,
he said he would like to have a settlement by spring because of
fears that warmer weather could bring a resumption of fighting.
	   ``Spring should be the time for plowing and not for fighting,''
he added.
	   Hill also said that the United States ``is looking at the ways
to help establish a local peace force and we are also beginning to
look at the process of what might be needed in Kosovo in the
economic area ... so people can put down their guns and take up
jobs.''

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A computer entrepreneur charged with
subversion for giving away Chinese e-mail addresses to an Internet
democracy magazine is to go on trial Friday in a courtroom closed
to the public and reporters.
	   Lin Hai, 30, is accused of ``inciting the overthrow of state
power'' by giving 30,000 addresses to ``VIP Reference,'' a
pro-democracy journal published by dissidents abroad.
	   His case highlights China's efforts to police the Internet with
the same intensity it has used to try to silence other forms of
political dissent.
	   Two lawyers are to appear with Lin in court, but his wife,
reporters and other spectators are barred. Most trials in Shanghai
are open, but that policy makes an exception for privacy cases and
government secrets.
	   ``Because this case involves government internal affairs, it is
not public,'' said Li Chunping, a spokesman for the Shanghai
Foreign Affairs Office.
	   Lin's wife, Xu Hong, said she would wait outside the courthouse.
She had appealed unsuccessfully for an open trial.
	   Lin, owner of a Shanghai computer software company, was detained
in March and charged the next month. His trial had been scheduled
to start last week but was postponed without explanation.
	   Xu said she has written to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji asking for their help but has received no reply.

South Africa struggles to compile first all-race voters list
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africans trekked in the
rain to voter registration stations Thursday but washed-out roads
and other problems hampered the nation's attempt to create its
first all-race voters list.
	   The massive registration effort is seen as a test of the
Independent Electoral Commission's ability to hold free and fair
elections next year _ only the second since the end of white rule.
	   Problems also plagued the registration for 12.7 million
potential voters in South Africa's five northern provinces last
weekend, with voters including President Nelson Mandela having been
directed to the wrong sites. Only about 28 percent of potential
voters in the north registered.
	   But the process appeared smoother Thursday as it began in the
southern half of the country. Even Marthinus van Schalkwyk, the
leader of the National Party which ruled during apartheid and
denied non-whites the vote, said as he registered in Cape Town:
``It seems as if the Independent Electoral Commission has done its
homework in this province.''
	   IEC spokesman Victor Dlamini said over 90 percent of
registration stations were open. Election officials were
determining why the remaining 800 stations had not opened.
	   State TV reported that some remained closed because civil
servants ordered to staff them didn't show up after learning they
would not be paid for the work, state TV reported. At some,
scanners used to register voters by their bar-coded ID cards were
not working properly.
	   Thousands of soldiers called up last week to assist in the
registration manned many sites. The military has also agreed to fly
staff and materials by helicopter into areas isolated by flooding,
the IEC said.
	   The 12 million potential voters in the four southern provinces
were being given three days to register.
	   In the first all-race elections in 1994, which marked the end of
apartheid and brought President Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress to power, people simply had to show up at any polling
station and produce any of several versions of an official ID card.
	   In the 1999 election, only South Africans on the voter list will
be able to vote, using only the bar-coded ID card.
	   The National Party says it will ask a court to allow any
official ID card to be used.
	   The greatest proportion of the millions of South Africans
without the bar-coded IDs are white. With the fall of apartheid,
blacks rushed to replace their restrictive apartheid-era IDs with
the new ones.
	   However, van Schalkwyk used his bar-coded ID to register at a
school in Cape Town, and urged all voters to acquire the cards,
saying: ``We do not know how the court will rule,'' the South
African Press Association reported.
	   A few days will also be set aside for registration early next
year for the whole country.
	   No election date has been set. Media reports say it will likely
be in May.

Russian prime minister calls for more detailed economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with economics minister describing a new plan in grafs
8-11. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government needs to come up with a more
detailed economic recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday, just a day after the International Monetary Fund
chief left without promising Moscow any new loans.
	   Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis program, but
the measures have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor
have they found favor with the IMF or other international lenders
that have frozen loans to Russia.
	   Primakov acknowledged the need to spell out the government's
intentions more clearly and called on the Cabinet to approve a more
detailed document.
	   ``Without such a concrete action plan, containing concrete tasks
and time frames, the government's steps will look merely like
intentions,'' Primakov said.
	   IMF chief Michel Camdessus left Russia on Wednesday after
meeting with Primakov and other top officials. He praised
Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis, but
said an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on loans to Russia.
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package this
summer, but only about dlrs 5 billion was disbursed before Russia's
economic crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen.
	   The IMF has indicated that Russia's draft budget for next year
appears overly optimistic, and it also does not like moves to
increase the government's role in the economy.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said the new plan
envisages drafting more than 80 bills and other legal acts within
the next two months to help revive the moribund economy.
	   They will detail the government's intentions to subsidize some
key industries, pay off wage and pension debts, index some incomes,
restructure the banking system and tighten currency controls, he
said.
	   Some of these measures have been criticized by the IMF, but
Shapovalyants voiced hope that it will not prove a stumbling block
to securing the loans.
	   ``Talks with Mr. Camdessus have shown that the issue (of getting
new loans) remains open,'' he said at a news conference, adding
that Russia continues to count on IMF loans as it drafts next
year's budget.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed out at the
IMF for refusing to release loans.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as
speaker for the State Duma, parliament's lower house. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay off its
debts and then refuse to take any more loans.
	   ``It's high time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he
told reporters.
	   In other economic developments Thursday:
	   _ Sberbank, the giant state-savings bank, has begun to service
individual accounts that were transferred to the bank from six
ailing commercial banks.
	   The government in September guaranteed the savings accounts of
all depositors who moved their money from the troubled commercial
banks into Sberbank.
	   Many individuals took the offer, though some keep their money in
commercial banks, which are still struggling to survive.
	   _ Inflation was up 5.7 percent in November, compared to 4.5
percent in October, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September
in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. However, inflation is up
about 70 percent compared to last December, the government said
Wednesday.
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves dropped by dlrs 200 million in
the last week of November and stood at dlrs 12.8 billion on Nov.
27, the Central Bank said Thursday.

Miyamoto takes four-stroke first round lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT category code. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INAGI, Japan (AP) _ Katsumasa Miyamoto eagled the par-5 sixth
hole as part of 6-under-par 64 and took a four-stroke first-round
lead in the 100 million yen (dlrs 833,000) Golf Nippon Series JT
Cup, a tournament for the year's top golfers in Japan.
	   The 26-year-old Miyamoto, seeking his second career victory this
year, sank a 17-meter (56-foot) putt on the 541-yard sixth hole.
	   Miyamoto also had six birdies and two bogeys on the 6,960-yard
(6,272-meter) Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club course in the outskirts of
Tokyo.
	   Four strokes behind Miyamoto were two Japanese _ Masashi
``Jumbo'' Ozaki and Nobuhito Sato.
	   Jumbo Ozaki is the eldest of three Ozaki brothers and leads the
Japan PGA money list with two tournaments left this season.
	   Ozaki has earned 166.63 million yen (dlrs 1.4 million) with
three victories so far this season. Brandt Jobe of the United
States stood second with 95.17 million yen (dlrs 793,000).
	   Frankie Minoza of the Philippines shot a 69 was tied with
Toshimitsu Izawa of Japan.
	   Teeing off in the cold cloudy weather were an elite field of 26
made up of this year's tournament winners, the defending champion
and the top 20 on the Japan PGA money earning list.
	   The temperature on the course was a chilly 4 degrees Celsius (39
Fahrenheit).
	   Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama shot a 74 and was tied with
fellow Japanese Keiichiro Fukabnori and Todd Hamilton of the United
States.
	   The winner will collect 30 million yen (dlrs 250,000).

EOHR freezes activities after government detains leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's largest human rights group announced
Thursday that it was suspending its activities because of a
government campaign that ``aims to terrorize the organization and
eliminate its role.''
	   The decision was made at a Wednesday night meeting of the
15-member board of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights.
	   The announcement came two days after Egyptian security officials
detained the group's secretary-general, Hafez Abu Saada, on grounds
he accepted a donation from the British government without Egyptian
government approval. He can be held for 15 days for investigation.
	   The statement said the board decided to ``freeze the
activities'' of the organization ``in all parts of the republic.''
	   This means the EOHR won't send investigators into the field and
will not issue any public statements on human rights cases, the
board decided. If citizens come with complaints, they will be
referred to other human rights groups, it said.
	   Also Thursday, the Land Center for Human Rights, which deals
with property disputes, charged in a statement that the
government's campaign against the EOHR ``aims to weaken the human
rights movement in Egypt.''
	   The Land Center urged authorities to release Abu Saada, saying
his detention is ``part of a campaign aiming to terrorize people
working in the human rights field.''
	   The government to date has refused to register a single Egyptian
human rights group, putting them in the precarious position of
operating without the status of officially approved
non-governmental organizations.
	   The donation of dlrs 25,703 from a British Parliament committee
to the EOHR became the subject of controversy after an Egyptian
weekly, Al-Osboa, alleged last month that it was ``payment'' for a
report charging that Egyptian police had arrested and tortured
hundreds of Coptic Christians in a criminal investigation in
August.
	   Al-Osboa has close ties to the Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for internal security in Egypt. The government has
denied the torture allegations.
	   In its announcement, the board said it believed the government
was trying to stop human rights work in Egypt.
	   ``This campaign aims to terrorize the organization and eliminate
its role in protecting human rights and revealing these violations
sincerely and faithfully,'' the statement said.
	   The statement said the board would pursue the release of Abu
Saada and would continue to communicate with local and
international human rights groups.

FA demands explanation on Kinnear's `betting' comments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear could get his club
in trouble for his comments on betting.
	   The Football Association on Thursday demanded an urgent
explanation for Kinnear's comments following Wimbledon's 2-1
victory over Chelsea in the League Cup quarterfinals.
	   ``We were 66-1 (to win the cup) at the start of the season and I
think a few of the lads had a few quid on,'' he said.
	   Wimbledon players could face misconduct charges, fines and even
suspensions if the FA finds they broke rules on betting.
	   ``We are writing to Wimbledon for a full explanation,'' an FA
spokesman said. ``The rules state that it shall be deemed to be
misconduct to bet on any football match, other than those
registered for the football pools.''
	   The FA drew up new anti-betting rules last year in the wake of
the match-fixing trial of Bruce Grobbelaar, John Fashanu and Hans
Segers. The players were cleared in court but sanctioned by the FA
after admitting they forecast the results of games for an Asian
gambling syndicate.
	   The FA issued a blanket ban on all types of betting by players,
managers and directors.

Al-Tikriti begins three-day memorial rite for wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half-brother began a
three-day memorial rite Thursday for his wife, who died last month
in Switzerland where Barzan al-Tikriti was Baghdad's ambassador to
the United Nations.
	   Black mourning banners were put up on many buildings and at road
intersections from Baghdad to al-Tikriti's home village to the
north, where he received relatives and friends expressing
condolences for the death of his wife, Ahlam.
	   Al-Tikriti returned to Baghdad on Dec. 1 after denying rumors
that he had delayed his return because he was seeking to defect
amid disputes with the Iraqi president.
	   He had been recalled to Iraq last summer along with about two
dozen other diplomats. But he delayed his departure because his
wife was being treated for breast cancer.
	   Ahlam, 44, was the half-sister of Saddam's first wife, Sajida,
who is the mother of Odai and Qusai, Saddam's two powerful sons.
	   Al-Tikriti, who served as Iraq's U.N. ambassador in Geneva for a
decade, has said he didn't want a new government post so he could
spend more time with his family. The couple had six children, aged
11 to 26.
	   Journalists were barred from covering the memorial rite.

Strikes, protests extend across France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Labor unrest continued to mount across France
Thursday, with rail workers still on strike, and jobless protesters
holding sit-ins and even demanding a year-end bonus.
	   The rail strike, which began last Friday, hit 20 out of 23
regions, with services severely disrupted.
	   Rail workers say there is insufficient staff and are concerned
about how the government will implement a plan to cut the working
week from 39 to 35 hours.
	   Staff say a lack of employees has created a safety problem for
workers and travelers. The SNCF plans to hold a national meeting
Dec. 7 and 8 to address train workers' concerns.
	   A spate of physical attacks on transit workers has sparked
several strikes in recent months, and ticket-sellers in the
southwest city of Lyon walked off the job Thursday after a
colleague was held at gunpoint during a holdup.
	   Elsewhere, in the town of Canabiere, near Marseille in southern
France, police said 10,000 jobless protesters took to the streets
to demand a 3,000 franc (dlrs 526) year-end bonus.
	   Organizers said there were up to 20,000 people at the rally.
	   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Charles Hoareau, an official of
the CGT union grouping.
	   The protesters marched to police headquarters in
Bouches-du-Rhone where they were joined by several hundred striking
postal workers who are demanding a shorter working week and more
staff.
	   Guy Hermier, a Communist Party deputy for Bouches-du-Rhone, said
the plea for a year-end payment was justified.
	   ``This bonus would allow thousands of workers who have no jobs
to spend the New Year in decent conditions,'' he said.
	   In Lille, northern France, about 60 unemployed protesters
occupied government labor offices to demand more jobs and higher
benefits.

U.S. envoy presents Serbs with new Kosovo peace plan draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with eight Kosovo Albanians killed. RECASTS; no
pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Yugoslav border guards killed eight
ethnic Albanian rebels Thursday in the worst violation of a Kosovo
cease-fire reached in October under threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   The incident comes as the U.S. envoy for Kosovo presented Serb
leaders Thursday with a revised draft plan for the future of the
troubled province. The envoy, Christopher Hill, said slow progress
was being made toward a permanent peace.
	   But Hill also warned that time was at a premium because of fears
that fighting, now at a relative lull, could resume with the onset
of warmer weather in the spring.
	   ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' Hill said.
	   The eight armed ethnic Albanians were killed near the town of
Prizren when nine of them reportedly opened fire on Yugoslav
soldiers guarding the border with Albania at 4 a.m. (0200 GMT)
Thursday.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Kosovo's capital Pristina, which
reflects government views, said there were no injuries among the
Yugoslav troops. Kosovo Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for
Kosovo's independence, have frequently used illegal border routes
to arm themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   Yugoslavia's army command later confirmed the incident and said
the ethnic Albanians were trying to cross the border into Kosovo
``illegally.''
	   Before going into the meeting with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic in Belgrade, Hill said the new draft reflects previous
comments by rival Serb and ethnic Albanian officials on how to
achieve a settlement for the ethnic Albanian-majority Serbian
province.
	   Kosovo's Albanian leadership wants independence from Serbia but
is willing to settle for full autonomy as a first step. Serbia and
the Serbian leadership of Yugoslavia strongly oppose any plan that
would sideline Serbia in making decisions for Kosovo.
	   Hill did not elaborate on details, but said the new plan does
not explicitly specify whether Kosovo will become the third
Yugoslav republic or would remain a Serbian province. Republic
status for Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and
Montenegro, the present Yugoslav republics.
	   Hill told The Associated Press that he hoped the new draft would
provide an agreement which would ``shift the momentum from one of
violence to one of political settlement'' and said he planned to
meet ethnic Albanian officials Friday to present them with the new
draft.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless in the Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
that started in February. Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke on Oct. 12 to end the Kosovo campaign and begin
political negotiations on the province's future.
	   The agreement was reached as NATO was preparing an airstrike
campaign to force an end to the bloodshed.
	   Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own peace deal for Kosovo,
defying an earlier U.S. plan and warning that anything beyond some
sort of self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war.
	   Secessionist ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian
proposal, but have indicated they would accept a U.S. plan if it
gives Kosovo the right to become a third republic within
Yugoslavia.
	   Hill said the new draft ``does not create a third republic,''
but ``addresses the internal aspects of Kosovo and leaves the door
open for further developments of Kosovo status.''
	   While Hill said that the plan was still not in its final stage,
he said he would like to have a settlement by spring because of
fears that warmer weather could bring a resumption of fighting.
	   ``Negotiations cannot be dragged on forever,'' he said. ``We
have a cease-fire which is holding but which would be very much
strengthened by a political settlement.''
	   ``Spring should be the time for plowing and not for fighting,''
he added.
	   Hill also said that the U.S. ``is looking at the ways to help
establish a local peace force and we are also beginning to look at
the process of what might be needed in Kosovo in the economic area
... so people can put down their guns and take up jobs.''
	   In a separate incident Thursday, a Serb man was injured on the
main Pristina-Pec road Thursday when ethnic Albanian rebels shot at
his car when he refused their order to stop, the Serb media center
reported.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson was drawn
Thursday to play Italy's No. 2 Davide Sanguinetti while Andrea
Gaudenzi will be pitted against Magnus Norman in the opening
singles of the Davis Cup final.
	   Gaudenzi, Italy's top player, will play the inaugural match of
the three-day final against Norman on Friday, as Sweden's
top-ranked player Thomas Johansson was not included in the quartet
for the indoor final on clay at Assago Forum.
	   ``Right now, I have five players on my team who could all play
singles,'' said Swedish team captain Carl-Axel Hageskog. ``From
practice this week it seems like Gustafsson and Norman are the most
ready for this challenge.''
	   The draw, in Milan's 16th century city council hall, also
provided Saturday's doubles between the Italian duo of Gaudenzi and
Diego Nargiso against the Swedish pair of Nicklas Kulti and Jonas
Bjorkman.
	   Gaudenzi takes on Gustafsson in a duel between Number Ones in
the reversed singles Sunday with Sanguinetti playing Norman.
	   It's the first time in the 99 years of tennis' premier team
event that there is no one in the top 30 of the ATP lists playing
singles in the final.
	   Gustafsson is the highest ranked at 31.
	   Italy, which upset the United States in the semifinals, will be
playing its seventh final - the first since 1980 and the first ever
at home.
	   Sweden, a six-time Davis Cup titlist, will be in its 12th final
at Assago.

Former Ukrainian premier arrested in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Former Ukrainian premier Pavlo
Lazarenko has been arrested in Switzerland, a spokesman for the
Basel state prosecutor's office said Thursday.
	   Lazarenko was arrested by customs officials as he crossed by car
from France into Switzerland on Wednesday, spokesman Markus Melzl
said.
	   He was transferred to Geneva, where an investigating judge had
ordered his arrest.
	   Switzerland's Office of Police Affairs says it has received 20
separate requests from Ukraine for legal aid in the case of
Lazarenko, accused of corruption, since February 1997.
	   A spokesman for the office last month said Switzerland is
helping Ukrainian authorities in their attempts to track down money
he allegedly stashed away in Swiss banks.
	   Switzerland has handed over some bank documents to Ukraine, he
added.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister in 1996-97, when he was sacked by
President Leonid Kuchma. He now leads the centrist opposition
Hromoda party and has accused Kuchma and his allies of trying to
blacken his name by the corruption charges.
	   In October, he alleged that authorities were plotting to kill
him.
	   As well as Geneva, investigations are under way in the cantons
(states) of Fribourg and Zurich.
	   Under Switzerland's decentralized legal system, individual
cantons are responsible for investigating charges of money
laundering.

Five Thai girls fail in joint suicide bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Five teenage schoolgirls in Thailand
drank pesticide during their lunch break Thursday in a failed joint
suicide bid, a local television station reported.
	   The five students, all 13-14 years old, were upset at their
parents for not permitting them to be friends, TV Channel 7 quoted
their teacher as saying.
	   The teacher, Nantha Rangseepanya, said she went to look for the
girls immediately after receiving a tip-off from another student
about their plan.
	   She found them sitting in the school bathroom just moments after
they had consumed the poisonous substance.
	   The students subsequently were admitted to a nearby hospital and
were described as being in serious condition.
	   The police said their investigation had discovered this was just
the latest attempt by the group of students to take their lives,
the report said.
	   News of suicides has attracted widespread attention in Thailand
after the widely publicized death last month of a woman threatening
suicide who fell from a roof after a misguided rescue attempt.
	   The episode, shown repeatedly on television news broadcasts, has
inspired a rash of copycat suicide attempts.

Ukrainian miner believed killed in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ One Ukrainian miner was feared dead after
he and three more coal workers were flung several hundred meters
(yards) down a shaft by rushing water, officials said Thursday.
	   The accident occurred Tuesday at the Chervony Partyzan mine in
the eastern Luhansk region when a water pipe broke, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
	   The four miners were working at the depth of 700 meters (2,310
feet) at the time of the accident. Three were found alive later in
the day after having been driven down an additional 500 meters
(1,650 feet).
	   Rescue workers were still looking for the fourth miner, but he
was feared dead.
	   Ukraine's coal industry has been plagued by accidents at its
aging mines, which lack to money to maintain and upgrade safety
conditions.
	   More than 340 miners have died in mine accidents this year,
including four killed this week at different mines.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The Faeroe Islands' government on
Thursday appointed Joregen Niclasen as fisheries minister after his
precedessor was convicted last week of raping a teen-age girl.
	   John Petersen admitted having sex with the girl when she was
living in his house three years ago. However, he claimed she
consented and he has appealed the conviction.
	   Niclasen, 29, also is member of Premier Anfinn Kallsberg's
conservative Folkaflokkurin party. The fisheries minister position
is considered a key government post because fish make up 97 percent
of the islands' exports.
	   The Faeroes, an 18-island archipelago midway between Iceland and
Scotland, are Danish territory but have substantial home rule.

meet ethnic Albanian officials Friday to present them with the new
draft.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless in the Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
that started in February. Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke on Oct. 12 to end the Kosovo campaign and begin
political negotiations on the province's future.
	   The agreement was reached as NATO was preparing an airstrike
campaign to force an end to the bloodshed.
	   Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own peace deal for Kosovo,
defying an earlier U.S. plan and warning that anything beyond some
sort of self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war.
	   Secessionist ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian
proposal, but have indicated they would accept a U.S. plan if it
gives Kosovo the right to become a third republic within
Yugoslavia.
	   While Hill said that the plan was still not in its final stage,
he said he would like to have a settlement by spring because of
fears that warmer weather could bring a resumption of fighting.
	   ``Spring should be the time for plowing and not for fighting,''
he added.
	   In a separate incident Thursday, a Serb man was injured on the
main Pristina-Pec road when ethnic Albanian rebels shot at his car
when he refused their order to stop, the Serb media center
reported.

Report: Villagers loot town in eastern Indonesian province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An unspecified number of villagers
have looted a shopping complex in town in an eastern Indonesian
province that was recently rocked by a wave of religious-related
violence, a news report said Thursday.
	   The looting occurred Wednesday night in the Lobalaen district of
the island of Rote in the province of East Nusa Tenggara, said the
daily Suara Pembaruan.
	   Shopkeepers as well as security forces in the remote district
were outnumbered and could do nothing to stop the looters from
taking whatever they wanted, the report said.
	   Rote is an island in southeastern Indonesia, just south of the
East Nusa Tenggara provincial capital of Kupang, which is located
1,875 kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
	   Earlier this week, Christian mobs in Kupang burned and ransacked
Muslim mosques and houses in retaliation for the burning of
churches in Jakarta last month.
	   The civil disturbances come as Indonesia faces its worst
economic crisis in decades. The Southeast Asian country is beset by
mass unemployment, food shortages and huge foreign debt loads.

Duisenberg: labor market reform, not interest rates, key to
</HEADLINE>
job-creation

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg Thursday suggested governments should reform rigid labor
markets to create jobs rather than pressure him into cutting
interest rates.
	   ``The high unemployment rate in Europe is far more the
consequence of structural rigidities within the European labor and
product markets than a result of adverse cyclical developments,''
Duisenberg said in a speech.
	   Duisenberg has been under pressure from the left-leaning French
and German governments to lower rates when his bank takes over
monetary policy for the 11 nations that adopt the euro currency on
Jan. 1.
	   Speaking to European business and labor representatives,
Duisenberg said the ECB would do ``its utmost'' to help solve the
euro-zone's unemployment problem, but he insisted the bank's role
was ``very limited.''
	   In another message to European governments he stressed that
successful monetary policy must be supported by sound fiscal
policies and responsible wage settlements.
	   With inflation in the euro-zone nations at just 1 percent, and
unemployment stubbornly high at 10.9 percent, governments are
urging Duisenberg to boost business by setting lower rates.
	   He says the bank will resist political pressure, pointing out
that rates in the EU's core-economies are already low. The ECB is
expected to set the benchmark rate in the euro-zone close to
Germany's 3.3 rate.
	   Answering questions after his speech, Duisenberg stressed price
stability would be the main factor dictating ECB monetary policy,
but that currency exchange rates would also play a role.
	   He said exchange rate of the euro against the dollar will be
``one of a broad range of indices'' that will help the bank shape
policy.
	   ``We aren't concerned at present about the level of the euro
against the dollar,'' he said. ``What will be a concern is the
volatility, not the levels as such?''
	   Duisenberg said the ECB's focus on price stability matches that
of its U.S. counterpart the Federal Reserve.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two armed men who took two bank
employees hostage during a robbery in Lower Saxony state Thursday
freed both in a Frankfurt suburb, police said.
	   The men, armed with automatic pistols, fled toward Frankfurt in
a car belonging to one of the bank employees after bursting into
the bank in the Lower Saxony town of Bad Pyrmont shortly after it
opened.
	   Police said the men abandoned the car after freeing the
hostages, and fled on foot. Neither hostage was injured.
	   The armed men had threatened to shoot the hostages if they saw
any police vehicles along the road, and demanded that a police
helicopter trailing them be pulled back, police said.
	   It was not immediately clear how much, if any, money they took.
	   Police were talking with the men by mobile telephone for much of
the journey, but lost contact around midday.

Christo's wrapped trees to be uncovered early
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ Husband-and-wife artists Christo and
Jeanne-Claude have decided to unwrap about 178 trees in a Swiss
museum park a few weeks early _ for artistic reasons.
	   The exhibit, which transformed this quiet suburb of Basel when
it opened last month, was expected to remain on show until late
January.
	   But the artists decided for aesthetic reasons to start
unwrapping the trees Dec. 14, in an operation open to the public.
	   ``With all our previous temporary works of art, the 14-day
duration of the project's exhibition had been an aesthetic
choice,'' they said in a statement.
	   Although less grandiose than previous projects such as the 1995
wrapping of Berlin's Reichstag, the trees project involves 55,000
square meters (461,000 square feet) of woven polyester fabric and
23 kilometers (14 miles) of rope.
	   ``All materials will be recycled'' when the exhibit is
dismantled, Christo and Jeanne-Claude said.
	   The display coincides with a ``Magic of Trees'' exhibition
inside the Beyeler museum featuring works of art from Picasso,
Chagall, Cezanne and Giacometti, to name but a few.
	   The museum said it ``respects the artists' decision because it
was clear from the beginning that they alone would determine how
long the `Wrapped Trees' installation would last.''
	   ``We are deeply grateful to Christo and Jeanne-Claude for giving
us this unique experience and eagerly look forward to their next
project,'' it added.
	   With up to 20,000 people expected on a typical weekend, local
authorities put in place stringent traffic regulations to ensure
that the village of Riehen was not overwhelmed.

Israel requests that Clinton not land at Palestinian airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ Israel has asked that U.S. President Bill
Clinton not land at the newly opened Palestinian airport during an
upcoming visit, saying this would give a boost to Palestinian
claims to independence, a senior Israeli official said Thursday.
	   The Clinton administration is considering the request, said a
U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official
said Clinton's travel plans have not yet been finalized.
	   Clinton is to arrive in Israel in the evening of Dec. 12 and on
Dec. 14 is to fly to the Gaza Strip to usher in the second stage of
the Wye River land-for-peace agreement he helped negotiate.
	   A possible Clinton landing at Gaza International, which opened
last week as part of the agreement, had been considered by the
White House.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Thursday that the Israeli government asked for a
change in plans.
	   ``We have suggested this would not be appropriate,'' Bar-Illan
said. ``We have always said it (a landing) was something we felt
was tantamount to recognizing (Palestinian) sovereignty.''
	   The Palestinians consider the airport, their first gateway to
the world, a strong symbol of fledgling independence. The airport
opened after more than two years of disputes between Israel and the
Palestinians over security arrangements.
	   Israel's government, for the time being, does not permit Israeli
citizens to use the airport, citing security concerns.
	   On Thursday, an Israeli charter flight from Ben Gurion
International Airport to Gaza International was canceled after the
Defense Ministry imposed restrictions on who could fly.
	   The flight was to have carried Israeli legislators, peace
activists and dozens of journalists who were to have been greeted
at the Gaza airfield by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The legislators spoke on their cellular phones to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to try and persuade him to rescind his
decision.
	   The government offered to let the lawmakers fly, but only with
10 journalists, about one-fourth the number signed up for the
flight, and without the 30 peace activists who organized the trip.
	   The 13 lawmakers who represented both opposition and coalition
parties argued heatedly back and forth, then decided not to go.
	   Arafat's security chief in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Dahlan, who
had been waiting for the Israeli visitors at Gaza International,
said he was disappointed.
	   ``The aim of this plane trip to Gaza today was to support peace,
to build strong confidence between the two peoples and to give more
support to the peace process,'' Dahlan said. ``It looks to us that
this government doesn't want this to be.''

EU trade negotiator asks Washington to reconsider fast-track WTO
</HEADLINE>
panel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The chief European Union trade
negotiator appealed to the U.S authorities on Thursday to
reconsider an EU proposal for a speedy settlement of the
transatlantic banana dispute at the World Trade Organization.
	   Washington alleges the 15-nation EU banana regime,which allows
preferential import terms to certain African and Pacific nations,
is unfair to South American distributors, most of which are owned
by US companies.
	   EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told journalists that the
EU had offered a speedier process of 170 days to resolve the
dispute through an accelerated WTO panel. Under the normal
procedure, it takes 449 days, he said.
	   Brittan said Washington's insistance that the banana row should
be resolved before March 3 was ``ridiculous.'' March 3 is the
deadline under US trade law for the enforcement of a dlrs 1.5
billion fine the United States has slapped on the EU.
	   However, Brittan said the EU has assured Washington it will not
press for this time limit to be applied if the United States agrees
to the fast-track plan.
	   The WTO ruled earlier this year that the EU's banana import
system violates its rules. The EU operates a special banana trade
regime with certain developing countries - grouped in the so-called
African-Caribbean-Pacific bloc.
	   The WTO ruling was in response to a complaint by the United
States, Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico that the EU system
unfairly restricted their banana exports.

Former Olympic champion dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DEGERFORS, Sweden (AP) _ Bertil Nordahl, the oldest of three
Swedish brothers who starred on the 1948 Olympic champion team in
London, has died. He was 81.
	   One year after winning the Olympic gold, Nordahl signed a
professional contract with Atalanta in Italy. He played in Italy
three years before returning home to Swedish club soccer. Later, he
became a coach and had stints with Orebro, Brage and Degerfors.
	   Gunnar Nordahl, a powerful high-scoring center-forward for AC
Milan in the 1950s, was the most famous of the three brothers. He
won five season scoring titles with Milan and holds the all-time
record among foreigners with 225 goals.
	   Gunnar Nordahl and Knut Nordahl, the third brother who starred
on the 1948 Olympic team and also later played in Italy, passed
away earlier this decade.

Philippine official cautions U.S. on its ties with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine foreign secretary on
Thursday called some of China's policies ``disturbing'' and
cautioned the United States against forging deep ties with Beijing
at the expense of other nations.
	   Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon cited China's
``exuberant'' efforts to modernize its military at a time when
external threats have diminished and other countries in the region
are undertaking only modest defense upgrades because of the Asian
financial crisis.
	   ``Some aspects of Beijing's policies are, bluntly speaking,
disturbing for many observers in the region,'' Siazon told a forum
on Philippine-American relations.
	   He also cited as problematic China's claim to the entire South
China Sea, which has brought it into territorial conflicts with
other Asian countries, and its revived defense cooperation with
Russia.
	   Manila recently protested China's construction of additional
structures on the disputed Mischief Reef in the Spratly island
chain.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado has called the Chinese action
a ``creeping invasion.''
	   China, Vietnam and Taiwan claim all of the islands. The
Philippines and Malaysia claim some of them and Brunei claims one
reef.
	   The Spratlys straddle vital sea lanes and are believed to be
rich in minerals.
	   Foreign Affairs Secretary Siazon said Beijing's intransigence on
the Spratly issue has harmed its relations with neighboring states
and damaged its ability to assume a greater leadership role in the
region.
	   He also warned Washington against becoming too cozy with China.
	   ``The Philippines supports the U.S. policy of engaging China as
better than any attempt at confrontation or containment,'' he said.
``The issue here is that Washington may be tempted to invest too
much in its strategic partnership with Beijing to the detriment of
the interests of its regional allies.''
	   He said the ``greatest value'' of a Chinese-American strategic
partnership is in being able to ``leverage China into accepting
more encompassing regional discussions on such problems as the
South China Sea.''

Yeltsin's surgeon: Yeltsin needs to listen to his doctor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin needs to stay in bed to recover from
his latest bout of pneumonia, but the president has a long history
of ignoring the advice of his doctors, the president's heart
surgeon said Thursday.
	   Yeltsin has in the past rushed back to work without fully
recuperating from his ailments, and this has contributed to his
recurring illnesses, doctors have said.
	   The president's aides say Yeltsin is again urging doctors to
discharge him from a government clinic where he remained
hospitalized for a 12th straight day Thursday.
	   Yeltsin must ``fulfill all orders of his doctors as pilots obey
air traffic controllers,'' said Dr. Renat Akchurin, who performed
Yeltsin's heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   ``I have had pneumonia in my life and I can say that it is not
at all easy to live through the disease,'' Akchurin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   And Yeltsin was likely to make it even more difficult, Akchurin
said.
	   ``As far as I know the president, he will not stay in bed as
told, but will return to work,'' Akchurin was quoted as saying.
	   Akchurin said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that the president was not suffering from any heart
problems.
	   Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yuri Yarov said that the
president was to remain in the hospital through the end of the
week, but may return to the Kremlin on Monday.
	   Yeltsin has been handling limited paperwork and telephone
conversations in the clinic, the presidential press service has
said.
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a long string of illnesses that have diminished the
president's authority and raised doubts about his ability to stay
in office through the end of his term in 2000.
	   Yeltsin's foes in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
adopted a non-binding resolution Wednesday demanding the release of
Yeltsin's medical records.
	   Russian law gives parliament no power to make an inquiry into
the president's health, and Yeltsin's envoy to the legislature,
Alexander Kotenkov, quickly dismissed the resolution as having no
legal meaning.
	   ``No one will fulfill the decision made by the house because it
has no legal force,'' he said.

	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels have killed the fathers of 55
percent of children living in northern Uganda's Kitgum district, an
aid group said.
	   The International Service Volunteers Association also found that
15 percent of the children's mothers had been killed by the Lord's
Resistance Army.
	   Keith Wright, program coordinator for the U.N. Children's Fund,
said at a seminar Wednesday that at least two children a day had
been kidnapped from Kitgum by the rebels for the past two years.
	   ``When abducted, children are subjected to extreme brutality to
force them to become fighters, porters or sex slaves,'' Wright told
university scholars from France, England, West and East Africa and
representatives of nongovernmental organizations.
	   Wright said UNICEF was helping the volunteer association train
counselors to help families in Kitgum. The counselors also assist
families when an abducted child returns.
	   He said these interventions are made more difficult and
dangerous because of the continuing armed conflict, waged by the
LRA for the past 12 years to oust President Yoweri Museveni.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya's fertility rate has fallen from 5.4
children per woman in 1993 to 4.7 per woman this year, an official
said.
	   The recent survey showed nearly 40 percent of Kenyan women were
using some form of contraception to space children and safeguard
their reproductive health, Health Minister Jackson Kalweo said at a
conference Wednesday.
	   Despite the decline in fertility rates, health workers still
need to reach more men and convince them of the crucial role they
ought to play in promoting safer sexual and reproduction health
practices, he said.
	   ------
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of Guinea-Bissau's
ruling party and military rebels reportedly have agreed to appoint
Francisco Fadul, a former aide to President Joao Bernardo Vieira
who backed the June 7 army revolt against him, as interim prime
minister.
	   Fadul is to head the West African nation's planned government of
national unity which will sit until legislative and presidential
elections are held in March, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported Thursday.
	   The appointment was a political victory for the rebels who are
in negotiations with Vieira's supporters on appointments to the new
17-member cabinet.
	   Fadul, who split with Vieira in 1993, is currently political
adviser to Brig. Ansumane Mane who led the five-month army revolt
in the former Portuguese colony.
	   The two sides were due to continue their talks Thursday, Lusa
said.
	   A Nigerian-led regional force is due to arrive in the former
Portuguese colony later this month to oversee implementation of the

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A man drowned in a sewer when he was
dragged beneath downtown Harare for more than a kilometer (mile)
after heavy rains, police said.
	   In a statement, police said the man parked his car near a
downtown hotel to collect his child from a nearby church nursery
school on Tuesday.
	   He stepped into what he believed was a puddle of water, slipping
into an open sewer drain that workers failed to mark with warning
signs.
	   Police divers recovered his body in a drain near the main train
station after it had been sucked beneath Harare's main shopping
district.
	   The rare drowning in the city center highlighted growing
accusations of negligence by city authorities that has led to the
decline of public utilities and street maintenance in the city of
1.5 million people.
	   Power and water supplies have been frequently cut off in recent
weeks amid allegations of mismanagement and corruption by city
officials, including Mayor Solomon Tawengwa.
	   The drowning victim was not identified.

Former president Fidel Ramos awarded law doctorate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Philippines president Fidel
Ramos was received an law honorary degree by the University of
Sydney to the chants of angry demonstrators.
	   The ceremony awarding Ramos an honorary doctorate of laws
competed with the small band of demonstrators yelling for the
honour to be withdrawn.
	   University Vice-Chancellor Professor Gavin Brown told the
assembly Ramos had made a significant contribution to the stability
and economic growth of his country and to the Asia Pacific region.
	   The former president had been a consensus-building leader who
had transformed the ``Sick Man of Asia'' into a vibrant and stable
economy, better placed than many of its neighbors to weather the
financial turbulence which had engulfed the region, Brown said.
	   During Ramos' six year term in office, Ramos had presided over a
period of economic recovery which had renewed national confidence
and won respect for his leadership throughout the region.
	   Brown said Ramos had an outstanding track record of tolerance
for cultural and ethnic differences.
	   But the Philippines Australia Union Link condemned Ramos for a
series of human rights abuses they said he was responsible for
while martial law administrator and later armed forces chief of
staff under President Ferdinand
	   Marcos.
	   As Ramos accepted his doctorate, speaking of the need for
Australia and the Philippines to intensify their ties, the
protesters vowed to continue to lobby until the university withdrew
the honour.
	   Spokesman Peter Murphy said trade unionists and Filipino
community activists were outraged by the university's actions.
	   ``If it (the university) wants to demonstrate its positive
orientation to Asia, it should confer its honours on long-term
democracy advocates, not on a
	   military figure like Fidel Ramos,'' Murphy said.
	   ``He has blood on his hands stretching back to the declaration
of Martial Law in September 1972.''
	   Ramos accepted the honour in the name of the Filipino people.
	   He said it came at a special time, 1998 marking the 100th-year
of the proclamation of Philippine independence from Spain.

Arrest warrant issued for communist-era prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Warsaw military court issued an arrest
warrant Thursday for an elderly communist-era prosecutor, the first
step toward extraditing her from England.
	   The Warsaw Military District Court accepted a military
prosecutor's motion for the arrest warrant for Helena Wolinska.
	   Wolinska, 79, is accused of being responsible for the 1952
arrest and subsequent execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, a World War
II resistance hero, on allegedly fabricated evidence.
	   Last week, Wolinska rejected the accusations and said she feared
she would not get a fair trial in Poland.
	   But the military court ruled Thursday the allegations were
justified. It ordered the arrest warrant on the assumption that
Wolinska would try to avoid coming to Poland for an investigation
of Fieldorf's death.
	   Wolinska had been summoned to testify at the investigation on
Oct. 15, but she failed to show up, prompting the military
prosecutor to seek the arrest warrant.
	   The arrest warrant allows the government to prepare an
extradition motion.
	   Wolinska, who is married to Wlodzimierz Brus, emeritus professor
of modern Russian and East European studies at Oxford University,
has lived in Britain since 1972.
	   Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground
Home Army that fought the Nazis during World War II. After the war,
he refused to collaborate with the secret service of the new
communist regime.
	   He was charged in 1952 with killing Soviet soldiers and leftist
resisters during the war, and was hanged in 1953. Historians say
Wolinska fabricated the charges.
	   If convicted of denying Fieldorf his freedom, Wolinska could be
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bad weather forced a change of plan,
but Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej successfully lit the flame
Thursday for the 13th Asian Games, three days before they
officially start.
	   With rain-filled clouds covering the skies above his palace,
Bhumibol, the world's longest-reigning monarch, was forced to
abandon plans to light the flame with a magnifying glass and
instead used a lantern.
	   The king touched a candle to the lantern flame, then held it to
a larger ceremonial candle that covered in a gold-and-glass case.
It was paraded by bearers to Bangkok's Sanam Luang, or royal
fields, where it will be displayed for three days of colorful
ceremonies.
	   The flame will light the torch that will open the two-week event
Sunday. Two hundred and sixteen people led off by Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai will relay the torch to the main athletic center on
Bangkok's outskirts.
	   Somluck Kamsing, a Thai boxer who won a gold medal at the last
Asian Games in 1994 and was Thailand's first Olympic gold-medalist
ever in 1996, will carry the torch last and light the brazier that
will burn until the games close Dec. 20.
	   Somluck hopes to repeat his gold-medal performances as one of
the 6,000 athletes from 41 countries at the Olympic-style event,
billed by organizers as the last great sporting competition of the
20th Century.

German central bank cuts key interest rate, leaves others
</HEADLINE>
unchanged &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a suprise move, Germany's central
bank Thursday cut the country's key interest rate to 3 percent from
3.3 percent, reflecting concern over a weakening economy.
	   Germany's securities repurchase rate, known as the repo rate,
had been unchanged at 3.3 percent since October 1997.
	   President of the Deutsche Bundesbank Hans Tietmeyer said the
bank cut the rate because of the gloomy outlook for European
economies. The German government says growth, hit by the Asian and
Russian economic crises, will shrink to 2 percent in 1999 from this
year's expected 2.75 percent.
	   Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank was not responding to political
pressure to cut rates. The bank has come under sustained pressure
from Germany's Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine to drop rates to
stimulate the flagging economy and create jobs.
	   The bank left the other two main interest rates unchanged. The
Lombard rate stayed at 4.5 percent and the discount rate at 2.5
percent. Both have been at historic lows since April 1996.
	   The repo rate mainly influences money market transactions.
	   The decision was taken after a meeting of the bank's
policy-making central committee.
	   The move means Europe's interest rate for the 11 countries
launching a common currency on Jan. 1 might be lower than expected.
The euro rate is expected to be at or near Germany's rate,
reflecting Germany's status as the biggest economy among
participating countries.

Drunk-driving camel charge dismissed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COOBER PEDY, Australia (AP) _ An Alice Springs man has escaped
charges of
	   driving a team of camels while drunk.
	   Ricky Wilson Hall, 36, had been on trial in Coober Pedy
Magistrates Court
	   over an incident that police compared to something on
Australia's Funniest Home Videos.
	   Hall had pleaded innocent to two counts of driving camels under
the influence, one of assaulting police and one of resisting police
following an incident near Oodnadatta in South Australia in
September 1997. He did plead guilty to using offensive language.
	   Magistrate Alan Moss on Thursday dismissed a second drink
driving charge -- a first charge was dismissed earlier in the
hearing -- saying there was insufficient evidence to convict Hall.
	   And, while the offensive language charge was proved, Moss
dismissed it.
	   Moss found the assault and resisting police charges proven but
recorded no convictions.
	   But he placed Hall on a 100 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 63)
good behaviour bond for 12 months and ordered him to pay 140
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 83) in costs.
	   The court heard earlier that Hall had been driving a wagon
pulled by camels when then police Sgt. Garry Griffiths saw he was
drunk and told him to stop.
	   Police said Hall ignored the warning and, when warned a second
time by the police officer, untied a young camel from the wagon and
tried to ride off.
	   After a short distance, the young camel returned to its mother,
bringing Hall back to the waiting policeman.
	   Hall then leapt cowboy-style onto the back of one of the other
camels and
	   tried to ride off shouting, ``Yahoo!'' the court was told.
	   Griffiths likened the incident to something from Australia's
Funniest
	   Home Videos.
	   The police officer arrested Hall.
	   Moss earlier dismissed a first drunk driving charge relating to
the young camel, saying Hall was merely a hopeful passenger as he
held on to the animal's hump with his legs hanging over its back.
	   Moss also said he ``had concerns that Griffiths exaggerated
evidence and was a brusque and unreliable officer who handled the
situation poorly.''

Two runners admit taking plasma substance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two German medal-winning runners have
admitted taking a blood-thinning substance but have denied blood
doping.
	   Damian Kallabis, the 3,000-meter steeplechase champion at the
European Championship in Budapest in August, and Stephane Franke,
the 10,000 bronze medalist, confirmed taking the so-called blood
plasma expander HES, which helps the circulation of blood.
	   The substance was not banned at the time but the German
Athletics Federation (DLV) put it on the list of banned drugs as
soon as their confession was made public Thursday.
	   The two athletes made their admission in a fax to the newspaper
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) and in an interview with the
same newspaper, both of which were published Thursday.
	   ``Yes, we used the substance HES in Budapest,'' they said in the
fax.
	   Kallabis and Franke said they used the substance because the
weather was hot and humid in the Hungarian capital during the
European Championship.
	   ``But we never took EPO. We are ready to undergo blood tests any
time,'' they said in their statement.
	   EPO is a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of
oxygen-carrying red blood cells and cannot be detected by existing
doping tests.
	   The two athletes disputed statements by the chief DLV doctor
Karlheinz Graff that HES is used only to mask the usage of EPO.
	   ``Taking HES in no way means blood doping,'' they said.
	   Doctors involved in the case confirmed giving it to the athletes
at their request.
	   Franke said he took HES already at the 1995 World Championship
in Goteborg, Sweden, getting it from team doctor Wilfried
Kindermann, who is now chief doctor of the German soccer team.
	   ``Blood plasma substitutes like HES can, among other things,
improve the circulation of blood and allow better cooling off of
the body,'' Kindermann told FAZ.
	   Kindermann said he saw nothing wrong in giving the substance to
the athletes if they asked for it and it was not on the list of
banned drugs.
	   The DLV is investigating the case, which was brought to light by
Graff last month when he said some athletes had asked for HES in
Budapest.
	   The DLV doctor did not give any names.
	   Franke and Kallabis have been suspected by the German media of
being the two athletes. The two said they had kept silent until now
at the advice of their lawyers.

Romania's Defense Ministry says officials negotiated with Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ After initial denials, the government
said state-owned Romanian companies held negotiations starting in
1994 with Iraq and may have sold the country weapons' parts, the
Defense Ministry said in a statement released Thursday.
	   ``In 1994-96, there were some negotiation rounds between the
Military Industry Ministry of Iraq and the heads of Romtehnica,
Giara and Aerofina, Romanian military companies,'' said the Defense
Ministry in a statement.
	   Officials from the companies Giara and Romtehnica went to Iraq
in July 1994 to discuss the sale of short-range missile components
and raw materials for the defense industry.
	   ``We don't know whether a delivery was made,'' said Capt. Ovidiu
Dumitrascu, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
	   A representative for the state company Aerofina signed a
contract in 1995 for missile components to be delivered by a
Jordanian company serving as an intermediary, the statement said.
	   The contracts and negotiations were halted in December 1996, and
an army general, two colonels and the chief responsible for
procuring military equipment for the army were fired, the statement
said without elaborating.
	   An attempt to reactivate talks in 1998 was foiled by Romanian
and foreign intelligence services and negotiations broke down.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate long-range missiles, biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons under a U.N. Security Council
resolution adopted after the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq has insisted it
has destroyed all such weapons.
	   Earlier this week, the Defense Ministry had denied that any
Iraqi-Romanian negotiations took place or that there were any
dismissals in connection with the negotiations.

wins

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kenji Fukuda fired his third Asian
Games goal Thursday to secure a second-round berth for Japan's
young soccer squad in an otherwise unremarkable 1-0 victory over a
spirited India.
	   Viktor Zubarev scored a second-half hat-trick to seal
Kazakstan's 5-0 victory against an over-matched Laos in the kind of
lop-sided win that has characterized the 23-nation preliminary
round.
	   Uzbekistan tied Kuwait in a 3-3 thriller, while Qatar edged
Tajikistan, 2-1.
	   India's tough defense held Japan, playing in the southern city
of Trang, to a scoreless first half. But the Japanese quickly went
ahead in the second half when Fukuda took a headed pass from
Masahiro Koka and fired from five meters (yards).
	   Japan, which had a disappointing World Cup, brought an under-21
squad coached by Frenchman Philippe Troussier to prepare for the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Thursday's win follows a 5-0
victory over Group C weaklings Nepal.
	   Kuwait, winner of the Gulf Cup, went up against far stiffer
opposition in the northern city of Chiang Mai than in Tuesday's
11-0 humiliation of Mongolia, the weakest team in the games.
	   Uzbekistan kept the tough Kuwaiti attack at bay and drew the
keeper out of the penalty area in the 5th minute, letting Andrey
Fyodorov score a 25-meter (yard) shot into the open goal.
	   Kuwaiti star Jassem al-Huwaidi equalized in the early moments of
the second half, bringing his Asian Games total to five.
	   Uzbekistan went back ahead 20 minutes later when Alexander
Khvostunov beat two defenders and fired from 12 meters (yards) to
make it 2-1. Andrey Akopyants added insurance in the 31st minute.
	   Farj Laheeb quickly replied to keep Kuwait's hopes alive,
sliding into a shot that had just bounced off the crossbar and
squeezing it past three surprised defenders. Laheeb scored again in
the final seconds to pull out a 3-3 draw and his sixth Asian Games
goal.
	   Uzbekistan faces Mongolia on Saturday in the final Group G match
and is expected to win and advance.
	   In Group H in the northeastern city of Sisaket, Kazakstan used
greater height and weight to overcome the gritty Laotian defense,
which was was sharp in midfield but too often left the keeper
unsupported.
	   Guram Makeyev slotted in from directly before the goal in the
32nd minute. Azamat Niyazymbetov pushed the half-time advantage to
2-0. In the second half, Zubarev netted three, the last in the
final minute.
	   Kazakstan lost its Group H opener to Iran, one of the favorites
in the 13th Asian Games, but should move into the second round if
Iran beats Laos as expected Saturday.
	   In Group D in Suphan Buri, Ahmed al-Obaidly took Qatar ahead in
the first half. The scoreline increased to 2-0 early in the second.
	   Tajikistan, which routed the Maldives on Tuesday, was unable to
score until a penalty taken in injury time by Shokrat Djabarov
after Qatar's N. al-Khater was sent off after a rough tackle in the
penalty area. Qatar is favored to win Saturday's clash with the
Maldives.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa and Zimbabwe were
on a potential collision course over gay issues Thursday after
President Nelson Mandela met Zimbabwean former President Canaan
Banana, a fugitive convicted in his country of sodomy.
	   Banana, president of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987, was convicted
last week of sodomy and homosexual assault. He had been free on
bail and fled Zimbabwe for neighboring Botswana shortly before his
conviction.
	   After Zimbabwe requested Banana's extradition from Botswana, he
crossed into South Africa. On Wednesday, he met with Mandela at his
official residence in Pretoria.
	   Banana had requested the meeting, but there was no indication he
would seek asylum or whether he intended to stay in South Africa
for long, said Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana.
	   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has launched a campaign against
homosexuality, saying it was brought to Africa by the West. He has
described same-sex partners as ``lower than pigs and dogs.''
	   But in South Africa, the nation's highest court in October
struck down apartheid-era laws banning homosexual relations.
	   If a crime for which someone has been sentenced in another
country is not punishable in South Africa, then South Africa's
courts would likely reject any extradition request, said Paul
Setsetse, spokesman for Justice Minister Dullah Omar.
	   Said Mankahlana: ``This is a very sensitive matter. South Africa
and Zimbabwe have adopted totally different approaches to this
issue (of homosexual sex). What is considered unlawful in Zimbabwe
is not considered unlawful in South Africa.''
	   Officials at the Zimbabwe embassy could not be reached for
comment on whether Zimbabwe would seek Banana's extradition from
South Africa.
	   Banana, a 62-year-old Methodist minister, was convicted on Nov.
26 in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, of 11 counts of sodomy and
homosexual assault. While he was president, he allegedly threatened
his bodyguards, a cook and a gardener with their jobs unless they
performed homosexual acts.
	   Banana was brought to trial after a police inspector who worked
as his bodyguard killed a colleague who had taunted him for his
alleged relationship with the former president.
	   Sentencing for Banana has been scheduled for Dec. 10 in Harare.
He faces a possible maximum jail term of 22 years.

Israel requests that Clinton not land at Palestinian airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ Israel has asked that U.S. President Bill
Clinton not land at the newly opened Palestinian airport during an
upcoming visit, arguing it would give a boost to Palestinian claims
to independence, a senior Israeli official said Thursday.
	   The Clinton administration is considering the request, said a
U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official
said Clinton's travel plans had not yet been finalized.
	   Clinton is to arrive in Israel on Dec. 12. Two days later he is
to fly to the Gaza Strip to usher in the second stage of the Wye
River land-for-peace agreement he helped negotiate.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Thursday that the Israeli government asked for a
change in plans.
	   ``We have suggested this would not be appropriate,'' Bar-Illan
said. ``We have always said it (a landing) was something we felt
was tantamount to recognizing (Palestinian) sovereignty.''
	   The Palestinians consider the airport, their first gateway to
the world, a strong symbol of fledgling independence. The airport
opened, as part of the Wye agreement, after more than two years of
disputes between Israel and the Palestinians over security
arrangements.
	   Israel's government, for the time being, doesn't permit Israeli
citizens to use the airport, citing security concerns.
	   On Thursday, an Israeli charter flight from Ben Gurion
International Airport to Gaza International was canceled after the
Defense Ministry imposed restrictions on who could fly.
	   The flight was to have carried Israeli legislators, peace
activists and dozens of journalists who were to have been greeted
at the Gaza airfield by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The legislators tried to persuade Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai to rescind his decision, but ultimately decided not to go
after the government offered to let the lawmakers fly, but without
the peace activists and only with 10 journalists.
	   Arafat's security chief in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Dahlan, who
had been waiting for the Israeli visitors at Gaza International,
said he was disappointed.
	   ``The aim of this plane trip to Gaza today was to support peace,
to build strong confidence between the two peoples and to give more
support to the peace process,'' Dahlan said. ``It looks to us that
this government doesn't want this to be.''

Ex-FBI agent: Russian mafia had NY, LA clubs, ties to Miami,

	   GENEVA (AP) _ An alleged boss of the Russian mafia had
operations extending to New York, Houston and Los Angeles and used
Miami as a base to plan operations, a former FBI agent testified
Thursday.
	   Retired special agent Robert Levinson said the Solntsevskaya
organization headed by Sergei Mikhailov took over a nightclub in
New York's Brighton Beach area and another in an unspecified part
of Los Angeles.
	   ``They became a center for drugs and a meeting place for
racketeers,'' Levinson, who spent four years investigating the
Russian mafia, told the Geneva correctional court.
	   Mikhailov, who is being tried in Geneva on charges of membership
in a criminal organization, also invested several hundred thousand
dollars in a Houston car dealership, added Levinson.
	   ``When the individual who was involved didn't come up with the
cars that Mr. Mikhailov had ordered, he became in fear of his life.
He thought he was going to be murdered,'' said Levinson. He gave no
more details.
	   Mikhailov, 40, denies he has anything to do with the
organization. He also is charged with breaking Swiss laws on
purchase of property by foreigners and has been in custody in
Geneva for more than two years.
	   Levinson told the court that Mikhailov and his associates headed
Solntsevskaya and had a series of ``brigades'' below them.
	   ``The organization was engaged regularly in the extortion of
businesses, the distribution of drugs including cocaine,
counterfeiting of currency and trafficking in arms,'' he said.
	   Mikhailov personally directed two ``combat'' brigades,
specialized groups in assassination, said Levinson.
	   ``They would commit murders in Russia and other countries in
Europe and then come to Miami, Florida, where they would stay by
the beach and wait for the heat to cool off,'' he said.
	   Levinson also worked on the case of Russian mafia godfather
Vyacheslav Ivankov, imprisoned for nearly 10 years in New York last
year.
	   ``In Miami one or more meetings took place between the
Solntsevskaya leaders, including Mikhailov, with Ivankov during
which time the takeover and control of several Moscow hotels was
discussed,'' said Levinson.
	   The trial of Mikhailov, which began on Nov. 30, is expected to
hear evidence from more than 90 witnesses speaking six different
languages. If convicted, he faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half
years in prison.
	   Among witnesses who, for their own safety, testified by
closed-circuit television from an adjacent room Wednesday were two
Russians who fled to the United States and have since received FBI
protection. They told the court that they had been subjected to
extortion in Russia.

Romania's Defense Ministry says officials negotiated with Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ After initial denials, the government
acknowledged Thursday that state-owned Romanian companies held
negotiations starting in 1994 with Iraq and may have sold the
country weapons' parts.
	   ``In 1994-96, there were some negotiation rounds between the
Military Industry Ministry of Iraq and the heads of Romtehnica,
Giara and Aerofina, Romanian military companies,'' said the Defense
Ministry in a statement.
	   Officials from the companies Giara and Romtehnica went to Iraq
in July 1994 to discuss the sale of short-range missile components
and raw materials for the defense industry.
	   ``We don't know whether a delivery was made,'' said Capt. Ovidiu
Dumitrascu, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate long-range missiles, biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons under a U.N. Security Council
resolution adopted after the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq has insisted it
has destroyed all such weapons.
	   A representative for the state company Aerofina signed a
contract in 1995 for missile components to be delivered by a
Jordanian company serving as an intermediary, the statement said.
	   The contracts and negotiations were halted in December 1996, and
an army general, two colonels and the chief responsible for
procuring military equipment for the army were fired, the statement
said without elaborating.
	   An attempt to reactivate talks in 1998 was foiled by Romanian
and foreign intelligence services and negotiations broke down.
	   Earlier this week, the Defense Ministry had denied that any
Iraqi-Romanian negotiations took place or that there were any
dismissals in connection with the negotiations.

Turks celebrate violence-free Galatasaray-Juventus match

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turks had two reasons to celebrate on
Thursday: A draw between Galatasaray and Juventus assured Turkey's
team a shared first-place in their Championship League _ and the
violence-free game proved Turks could separate sports and politics.
	   ``Friendship was the winner,'' a headline in Turkey's Yeni
Yuzyil declared.
	   ``Turkey won,'' said the Radikal daily, alluding to the peaceful
atmosphere that reigned at the Ali Sami Yen stadium on Wednesday
night.
	   Apart from slogans denouncing Kurdish guerrilla groups and some
habitual chanting of obscenities by Galatasaray supporters, the
match ended with a 1-1 draw and none of the feared disturbances.
	   Turkey and Italy are locked in a bitter dispute over Abdullah
Ocalan, a Kurdish Turk rebel leader seeking asylum in Italy, and
there were fears the political tensions might spill onto the soccer
field.
	   Turkey deployed 22,000 police officers for the game and the
Juventus team flew home immediately afterward to avoid possible
trouble. The Italians face possible disciplinary action for
arriving Wednesday, in defiance of a UEFA rule that requires teams
to arrive a day before a match.
	   The draw brings Galatasaray to share the first place in Group B
with Norway's Rosenborg at 8 points, while Juventus _ which has yet
to win a game in the tournament _ is third with 5 points.
	   Turks tuned into the match: some out of passion for the game,
others worried that the security would not be enough to stop
clashes.
	   In Italy, too, where the Juventus players had expressed deep
concern for their security, the game got a 40 percent share of the
TV audience, with an estimated 12 million viewers.
	   No Italian fans attended the match because of security concerns,
leaving the pitch in a deadly silence after Juventus scored.
	   UEFA had postponed the match by one week for fear of violence.
``I hope Europe and the world is ashamed,'' said Haluk Ulusoy, the
president of Turkey's Football Federation, referring to the
European doubts that Turks would be able to restrain their anger.
	   Thousands of Turks poured out into the streets to celebrate
Galatasaray's new position as joint group leader.
	   Police in Ankara, the Turkish capital, used water cannons to
block off a main street leading to the Italian Embassy _ a frequent
target of anti-Italy, anti-Ocalan protests.
	   About 100 people gathered in front of the cannons to shout
slogans denouncing the rebel group. Hundreds of cars formed a
convoy through the streets with passengers waving flags and
chanting ``Down with the PKK.''
	   Italy's sports and foreign trade ministers met with Turkey's
justice and sports ministers before the game. Premier-designate
Bulent Ecevit said ``an encouraging dialogue has begun with
Italy.''

Yorke aims to knock former Villa colleagues off top spot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke returns to
Aston Villa on Saturday to try and knock his old club off the top
of the Premier League.
	   Only one point separates the two teams and Yorke, who faces
Aston Villa for the first time, has the chance of adding to his 12
Manchester United goals and putting United on top.
	   He's likely to get a less-than-friendly reception from the fans
at Villa Park, if not the players and coaching staff too.
	   After nine happy years at Villa, the Tobagan striker moved to
Old Trafford for 12.6 million pounds (dlrs 20.5 million) in August,
prompting Villa manager John Gregory to say: ``If I had a gun, I
would have shot him.''
	   Gregory says he still feels the pain.
	   ``It felt like being told by your wife or lover that she had
found somebody else,'' the Villa manager said in the buildup to
Saturday's game. ``That was how bad it felt when Dwight told me he
wanted to leave Villa. It really hurt.
	   ``On Saturday the fans should give Dwight a warm welcome for the
nine years loyal service he gave to Villa,'' Gregory said. ``But at
3 p.m. will be playing for the enemy.''
	   Although Gregory still fumes at the fact that Yorke left a club
he joined as an 18-year-old in 1989, he can say that the club has
barely missed him.
	   Villa opened up a 4-point lead at one stage at the top of the
standings and Yorke's replacement, Dion Dublin, scored seven goals
in his first three appearances after transfering from Coventry.
	   While it's Yorke vs. Dublin at Villa Park, it should be Shearer
and Ferguson at the Riverside on Sunday.
	   England captain Alan Shearer has recovered from a hamstring
problem and is expected to team up with new signing Duncan Ferguson
in a 22-million-pound (dlrs 36.75 million) Newcastle strikeforce at
Middlesbrough.
	   Ferguson scored twice on his debut in a 3-1 victory over
Wimbledon last week and Magpies fans can't wait to see the two
playing together, especially if they can put one over on neighbor
Middlesbrough, which stands four places higher in seventh.
	   West Ham, which has climbed to third, has a tough game at
sixth-place Leeds on Saturday while defending titlist Arsenal,
which has slipped to fourth, needs a win at Derby to stay in
contention. The Gunners hope to end a winless run of six games
which also saw them eliminated from the Champions Cup and domestic
League Cup.
	   Fifth place Chelsea, whose 19-game unbeaten streak ended Tuesday
when it lost to Wimbledon in the League Cup quarterfinal, goes to
Everton, which climbed to 14th last week by winning at Charlton
even without the departed Ferguson.
	   Rejuvenated under new manager George Graham, Tottenham ousted
Manchester United's weakened lineup from the League Cup on
Wednesday.
	   Now Spurs bid to improve their league position by beating
Liverpool for the second time in four weeks. When the two teams met
in the League Cup fourth round last month, Spurs won 3-1 at Anfield
and this time they meet at White Hart Lane.
	   After knocking defending champion Chelsea out of the League Cup
on Tuesday to set up a semifinal date with Tottenham, 10th place
Wimbledon has a more mundane league game at home to struggling
Coventry.
	   Last place Blackburn bids to lift its season by beating promoted
Charlton at home. Although Charlton is five places higher, it has
won only three of its 15 games.
	   Southampton, which beat Blackburn three weeks ago to climb away
from last, visits Leicester while Nottingham Forest is also in
danger of slipping to last because it doesn't play until Monday,
when it visits Sheffield Wednesday.
	   Division One leader Sunderland, which is four points clear of
its rivals, should gain three more from a home game against
Stockport, even though the visitor has managed to tie 11 of its 21
league games.
	   Second place Ipswich has a tricky home game against fifth place
Birmingham.
	   Scottish league leader Rangers hosts last place Dunfermline and
hopes to improve on its 2-point lead over Kilmarnock, which
welcomes Aberdeen.
	   Defending champion Celtic, which is third, goes to fifth-place
Hearts on Sunday.

Swedes drop Johansson; Norman to open against Gaudenzi

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Defending champion Sweden on Thursday
dropped its highest-ranked player from the Davis Cup team, leaving
to No. 31 Magnus Gustafsson the leading role in the three-day final
against Italy at the Assago Forum.
	   Thomas Johansson, ranked 17th in the ATP lists, was excluded at
the last minute from the Swedish quartet because of his uncertain
form and his questionable efficiency on clay.
	   Johansson, who's nursing a sore right knee, had been training
along with his teammates in Milan this week.
	   Thursday's draw, in Milan's 16th century city council hall, set
up opening day singles matches Friday between Italy's top player
Andrea Gaudenzi and Magnus Norman, followed by Gustafsson against
Italy's No. 2, Davide Sanguinetti.
	   They'll switch opponents for Sunday's two singles matches, while
the doubles is Saturday.
	   It's the first time in the 99 years of tennis' premier team
event that there is no one in the top 30 of the ATP lists playing
singles in the final.
	   Gaudenzi is 44th in the ATP lists, Sanguinetti 47th and Norman
52nd.
	   ``From practice this week it seems like Gustafsson and Norman
are the most ready for this challenge,'' said Sweden's non-playing
captain Carl-Axel Hageskog. ``I decided to go with Norman because
his clay court season this year was good, and he's a good clay
player.''
	   Italy, in its first Davis Cup final since 1980 and first ever at
home, decided to play on clay on the grounds Gaudenzi and
Sanguinetti may take advantage of a slower court against the
favored Swedes.
	   Sweden, a six-time Davis Cup titlist, is in its 12th final.
	   ``It's very special playing at home, but it also adds extra
pressure,'' said Italian captain Paolo Bertolucci, who played on
the team which won Italy's only Davis Cup title, in Chile, in 1976.
	   The hosts reached the final this time by upsetting a
second-string U.S. team in the semifinals, while Sweden swept
Spain.
	   Italian organizers expect sellout crowds of 13,000 each of the
final's three days and Gaudenzi said playing at home is exciting.
``What's going to be really special is the crowd cheering for us,''
he said.
	   Jonas Bjorkman, who will team with Nicklas Kulti in doubles
against the Italian pair of Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso, said the
home crowd should not give Italy any extra advantage.
	   ``We have too much experience to get into a situation where it
bothers us,'' he said.
	   Gustafsson said he felt more relaxed as the matches approached.
	   ``One or two weeks ago I was looking at (the final) as too big a
thing,'' he said. ``Then in recent days I relaxed a bit more and
realized it's just two tennis matches.''

Official: Russia to keep close control over food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia intends to keep tight control over food aid
being shipped from the United States and the European Union, a top
agriculture official said Thursday.
	   Past aid deals have been tainted by corruption, and U.S.
officials have said they stressed in their negotiations with Russia
that they wanted to avoid any hint of scandal in the aid program
this winter.
	   In an interview with the Interfax news agency, First Deputy Food
and Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev said strict guidelines
have been drafted for the companies allowed to bid on contracts to
deliver the aid.
	   Wholly state-owned companies will be given preference, he said,
and other companies must be at least 20 percent state-held and have
at least one government representative on their board of directors.
	   The bidders also must not have any debts to the government, and
must have at least three years' experience in buying and supplying
food, Gordeyev said.
	   A government commission will send tender offers to more than 10
Russian companies considered to be potential distributors of the
aid.
	   The Russian government has tentatively agreed to food aid deals
with the United States and the European Union valued at at a total
of roughly dlrs 1 billion. There have been concerns that some
Russians could go hungry this winter as a result of a poor grain
harvest and the country's economic crisis.

charges on Thursday against a man whom police had accused of
driving a team of camels while drunk.
	   Ricky Wilson Hall, 36, had been on trial in Coober Pedy
Magistrates Court over an incident that police compared to
something that could have appeared on a TV program of funny home
videos.
	   Hall had pleaded innocent to two counts of driving camels under
the influence, one of assaulting police and one of resisting police
following an incident near Oodnadatta in South Australia in
September 1997. He did plead guilty to using offensive language.
	   Magistrate Alan Moss on Thursday dismissed a second drink
driving charge, the first charge was dismissed earlier in the
hearing, saying there was insufficient evidence.
	   And, while the offensive language charge was proved, Moss
dismissed it.
	   Moss found the assault and resisting police charges proven but
recorded no convictions.
	   But he placed Hall on a 100 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 63)
good behavior bond for 12 months and ordered him to pay 140
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 83) in costs.
	   The court heard earlier that Hall had been driving a wagon
pulled by camels when then police Sgt. Garry Griffiths told him to
stop.
	   Police said Hall ignored the warning and, when warned a second
time by the police officer, untied a young camel from the wagon and
tried to ride off.
	   After a short distance, the young camel returned to its mother,
bringing Hall back to the waiting policeman.
	   Hall then leapt cowboy-style onto the back of one of the other
camels and tried to ride off shouting, ``Yahoo!'' the court was
told.
	   The police officer then arrested Hall.
	   Moss earlier dismissed the first drunk driving charge relating
to the young camel, saying Hall was merely a hopeful passenger as
he held on to the animal's hump with his legs hanging over its
back.
	   Moss also said he ``had concerns that Griffiths exaggerated
evidence and was a brusque and unreliable officer who handled the
situation poorly.''

Russian prime minister calls for more detailed economic plan

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government needs to come up with a
more detailed economic recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today, just a day after the International Monetary
Fund chief left without promising Moscow any new loans.
	   Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis program, but
the measures have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor
have they found favor with the IMF or other international lenders
who have frozen loans to Russia.
	   Primakov acknowledged the need to spell out the government's
intentions more clearly and called on the Cabinet to approve a more
detailed document.
	   ``Without such a concrete action plan, containing concrete tasks
and time frames, the government's steps will look merely like
intentions,'' Primakov said.
	   IMF chief Michel Camdessus left Russia on Wednesday after
meeting with Primakov and other top officials. He praised
Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis, but
said an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on loans.
	   The IMF organized a $22.6 billion bailout package this summer,
but only about $5 billion was disbursed before Russia's economic
crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen.
	   The IMF has indicated that Russia's draft budget for next year
appears overly optimistic, and it also does not like moves to
increase the government's role in the economy.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed out at the
IMF for refusing to release loans.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as
speaker for the State Duma, parliament's lower house. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay off its
debts and then refuse to take any more loans.
	   ``It's high time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he
told reporters.
	   In other economic developments today:
	   _ Sberbank, the giant state savings bank, has begun to service
individual accounts that were transferred to the bank from six
ailing commercial banks.
	   The government in September guaranteed the savings accounts of
all depositors who moved their money from the troubled commercial
banks into Sberbank.
	   Many individuals took the offer, though some keep their money in
commercial banks, which are still struggling to survive.
	   _ Inflation was up 5.7 percent in November, compared to 4.5
percent in October, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September
in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. However, inflation is up
about 70 percent compared to last December, Central Bank chief
Viktor Gerashchenko said Wednesday.
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves dropped by $200 million in the
last week of November and stood at $12.8 billion on Nov. 27, the
Central Bank said Thursday. It didn't give a reason, though the
government spent some of its reserves to service foreign debts
during this period.

Nationwide sweep yields two dozen arrests, 3,000 videos seized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Dozens of people were detained and 3,000 videos
featuring child pornography were seized in a sweep this week around
France by police trying to crack a pedophilia network, officials
said Thursday.
	   Some two dozen of the 55 people detained on Wednesday were
placed under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged
_ for receiving video cassettes of child pornography, police said.
	   Some 130 investigators took part in the sweep, the latest among
several to crack pedophilia rings. Police coordinated their action
in 34 regions across France.
	   Police said they were acting on a tipoff by one of four men
arrested last year on pedophilia charges. The four men were
arrested in Aveyron, southern France.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Vandals knocked over and shattered more
than 50 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in the Georgian capital

	   No group claimed responsibility for the attack.

NATO detains Bosnian Serb general charged with genocide

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ U.S. troops on Wednesday arrested
the highest-ranking Serb military officer seized so far in the
effort to bring to trial Bosnians who are accused of war crimes.
	   Radislav Krstic, a general, is accused of taking part, both
personally and through his troops, in the massacre of thousands of
Muslims after Bosnian Serbs took over the U.N. safe haven of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995.
	   He was indicted in October by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal,
which charged him with genocide, crimes against humanity and grave
breaches of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of civilians
during war. The indictment was secret so he wouldn't be prompted to
flee.
	   Krstic was arrested in a section of northern Bosnia controlled
by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization Force, better known
as SFOR. A spokeswoman, Maj. Sheena Thomson, said Krstic was
arrested without incident at noon.
	   The chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Louise Arbour of Canada,
called Krstic ``a very significant military leader'' and said his
arrest was important to the tribunal's ability to continue to do
its job. Krstic is the most senior officer seized so far for trial
before the U.N. tribunal in The Hague.
	   Amor Masovic, the head of the Bosnian Muslim commission for
people missing in the war, said he expected the arrest to shed
light on the fate of more than 8,000 people missing in the
Srebrenica region.
	   Muslim leaders in Bosnia expressed hope NATO would now focus on
apprehending the key architects of the war, former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' said Mirza Hajric, adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the country's joint presidency, Alija
Izetbegovic.
	   ``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders,'' Hajric
said.
	   He added the arrest ``could serve as a good example for the
French troops who have not yet arrested anybody.'' Bosnian Muslims
say Karadzic and Mladic are living in the part of the country under
French control.
	   The State Department said the arrest served as a warning to
other suspects still at large.
	   ``All persons indicted for war crimes, including Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, belong in The Hague in the custody of
the International Criminal Tribunal,'' State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said.
	   Bosnian Serbs criticized Krstic's secret indictment. Petar
Djokic, president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said it ``brings
uncertainty to people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika
Srpska can be regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of
the tribunal, and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody,
anytime, anywhere.'' Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within
Bosnia.
	   Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate of Karadzic and
Mladic, who have been indicted for genocide for allegedly
masterminding the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Wednesday after the arrest.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.
	   The last reported sighting of Krstic was at a joint military
exercise of the Yugoslav National Army and the Bosnian Serb
military in Manjaca, near Banja Luka, in October. SFOR banned his
5th Corps from taking part in the exercise, but let him monitor it.

Israel suspends troop withdrawal after attack on Israeli soldier

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers assembled around a TV
set and watched a video of a Palestinian mob ambushing an Israeli
soldier. When the tape stopped, the decision was unanimous: Israel
would suspend its West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the attack,
in which Palestinians holding rocks repeatedly struck the trapped
soldier in the head, was a direct result of incitement by the
Palestinian Authority against Israel.
	   ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli citizens being lynched,
or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that received incitement
from Palestinian officials,'' Netanyahu said in explaining his
decision to hold up the land-for-security agreement.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation once
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce
a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Israel has said it will not free those involved in attacks that
resulted in death or injury. The Palestinians demand that Israel
free prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The Palestinians appealed to the United States for help and
Arafat said Thursday that Netanyahu is ``violating completely'' the
Wye agreement.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin rejected the Israeli
conditions, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   Violence erupted for a second day Thursday.
	   In three Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, Palestinians threw
stones at police and Israeli motorists. Six Israeli police officers
and two Israeli civilians were injured by rocks and a Palestinian
was struck by a rubber bullet fired by police to disperse stone
throwers on the Mount of Olives.
	   In the main clash on Salah Eddin Street, the main thoroughfare
of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, undercover policemen wearing
checkered Arab headdresses drove up to a crowd of stone throwers in
a white van, jumped out, fired in the air and arrested four
Palestinians. In all, 18 Palestinians were arrested.
	   The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the peace
accord. The White House said the Clinton trip was still on.
	   In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel
is to release 250 more Palestinian prisoners.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation with the
Palestinians has helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition.
	   In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend the Wye
agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said they would not
support an early elections bill as initially planned.
	   The legislation was to have come before parliament Monday, but
its sponsors said they might delay the vote because they no longer
have a majority.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   Early Thursday, a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian
laborers from the Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they
were investigating whether the arsonists had political motives. The
laborers escaped unharmed.
	   After the attack on the Israeli soldier on Wednesday near the
West Bank town of Ramallah, Netanyahu convened his so-called
security Cabinet and played a videotape of the incident.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the
Cabinet room was tense during the screening and that those present
decided unanimously afterward to hold up the accord.
	   However, the Palestinian Authority blamed Israel for the latest
crisis, saying it had raised tensions by refusing to release
Palestinian prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The two sides also argued over whether the attack on the soldier
was orchestrated or spontaneous.
	   The incident began when about 150 Palestinian university
students, many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march
in Ramallah to press for prisoner releases.
	   The group then marched to the outskirts of town to throw stones
at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier was riding in.
	   Netanyahu said the incident was ``organized, orchestrated,
planned in advance and fomented by the Palestinian Authority.''
	   However, Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank,
said the incident was triggered by growing anger over Israel's
handling of the prisoner issue.
	   ``In clashes, rocks are thrown,'' Barghouti said. ``This car
stopped with the soldier and they took his weapon. It was later
returned. They did not use it to kill.''
	   Palestinian security forces have not arrested any of the rioters
involved in the attack, a senior official said. On Wednesday
evening, the soldier's M-16 assault rifle was handed to the
governor of Ramallah, but none of those making the delivery were
questioned or detained.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers assembled around a TV
set and watched a video of a Palestinian mob ambushing an Israeli
soldier. When the tape stopped, the decision was unanimous: Israel
would suspend its West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the attack,
in which Palestinians holding rocks repeatedly struck the trapped
soldier in the head, was a direct result of incitement by the
Palestinian Authority against Israel.
	   ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli citizens being lynched,
or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that received incitement
from Palestinian officials,'' Netanyahu said in explaining his
decision to hold up the land-for-security agreement.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation once
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce
a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Israel has said it will not free those involved in attacks that
resulted in death or injury. The Palestinians demand that Israel
free prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The Palestinians appealed to the United States for help and
Arafat said Thursday that Netanyahu is ``violating completely'' the
Wye agreement.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin rejected the Israeli
conditions, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   Violence erupted for a second day Thursday.
	   In three Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, Palestinians threw
stones at police and Israeli motorists. Six Israeli police officers
and two Israeli civilians were injured by rocks and a Palestinian
was struck by a rubber bullet fired by police to disperse stone
throwers on the Mount of Olives.
	   In the main clash on Salah Eddin Street, the main thoroughfare
of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, undercover policemen wearing
checkered Arab headdresses drove up to a crowd of stone throwers in
a white van, jumped out, fired in the air and arrested four
Palestinians. In all, 18 Palestinians were arrested.
	   The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the peace
accord. The White House said the Clinton trip was still on.
	   In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel
is to release 250 more Palestinian prisoners.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation with the
Palestinians has helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition.
	   In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend the Wye
agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said they would not
support an early elections bill as initially planned.
	   The legislation was to have come before parliament Monday, but
its sponsors said they might delay the vote because they no longer
have a majority.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   Early Thursday, a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian
laborers from the Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they
were investigating whether the arsonists had political motives. The
laborers escaped unharmed.
	   After the attack on the Israeli soldier on Wednesday near the
West Bank town of Ramallah, Netanyahu convened his so-called
security Cabinet and played a videotape of the incident.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the
Cabinet room was tense during the screening and that those present
decided unanimously afterward to hold up the accord.
	   However, the Palestinian Authority blamed Israel for the latest
crisis, saying it had raised tensions by refusing to release
Palestinian prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The two sides also argued over whether the attack on the soldier
was orchestrated or spontaneous.
	   The incident began when about 150 Palestinian university
students, many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march
in Ramallah to press for prisoner releases.
	   The group then marched to the outskirts of town to throw stones
at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier was riding in.
	   Netanyahu said the incident was ``organized, orchestrated,
planned in advance and fomented by the Palestinian Authority.''
	   However, Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank,
said the incident was triggered by growing anger over Israel's
handling of the prisoner issue.
	   ``In clashes, rocks are thrown,'' Barghouti said. ``This car
stopped with the soldier and they took his weapon. It was later
returned. They did not use it to kill.''
	   Palestinian security forces have not arrested any of the rioters
involved in the attack, a senior official said. On Wednesday
evening, the soldier's M-16 assault rifle was handed to the
governor of Ramallah, but none of those making the delivery were
questioned or detained.

Bad weather may stop shuttle launch

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Lousy weather forecast on both sides
of the Atlantic threatened to delay the liftoff Thursday of NASA's
first space station construction flight.
	   Clouds and rain were expected to move ashore. That could force
NASA to scrub space shuttle Endeavour's predawn launch with the
first American-built piece of the international space station.
	   What's more, cloudy skies and fog were forecast for the
emergency landing sites in Spain and Morocco. NASA will not launch
unless at least one of those sites is usable.
	   ``Basically, whether we get off the ground with respect to
weather is going to be a crap shoot,'' shuttle weatherman Ed
Priselac said Wednesday.
	   The flight is already a year late because of a cash crunch in
Russia, one of NASA's chief partners on the space station project.
	   Despite the dismal forecast, dignitaries from around the world
gathered to see Endeavour and its crew of six off. Most were
representatives of the 16 countries participating in the space
station effort. The guest list included Secretary of State Madeline
Albright.
	   The mission promises to be one of the most difficult in space
shuttle history. And the entire space station project promises to
be the most difficult undertaking since the Apollo moon landings
nearly 30 years ago.
	   ``We're not testing just hardware as part of this program,''
said Mikhail Sinelschikov, a Russian space official. ``We're
testing our relationship very much and our mutual trust and our
confidence in each other.''
	   Two weeks ago, the Russians put the first piece of the space
station into orbit.
	   During Endeavour's 12-day flight, the astronauts will use the
shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian piece and attach it to the
American component. Then, two astronauts will perform three
spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders.
	   The U.S. piece, named Unity, is a connecting passageway. It is
essentially an aluminum can with big holes where other chambers
eventually will attach. It contains six miles of wiring and more
than 50,000 mechanical pieces.
	   The Russian component, named Zarya, which means sunrise,
contains the power and propulsion systems that will keep the
station aloft until the Russians can launch a permanent control
module.
	   In all, more than 100 components weighing 1 million pounds are
to be launched over the next five years, requiring 45 U.S. and
Russian flights.
	   ``It's going to start out kind of small, but it's going to grow
to the size of a football field,'' said Endeavour's commander,
Robert Cabana.
	   Unity should have been put in orbit last December. But station
assembly was put on hold because of Russia's economic crisis, which
prevented the country's space agency from completing the permanent
control module. NASA has since bailed out the Russian Space Agency.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ With the weather on both sides of
the Atlantic vastly improving, a buoyant NASA pressed ahead for a
Thursday liftoff of the first space station construction flight.
	   All week, forecasters feared clouds and rain might delay space
shuttle Endeavour's predawn launch with the first American-built
piece of the international space station.
	   But by Wednesday night, the rain had stopped and the full moon
could be seen peeking from behind scattering clouds as NASA began
fueling the shuttle.
	   Better weather also was expected at the prime emergency landing
site in Spain. NASA will not launch unless at least one site in
Spain or Morocco is available.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ With the weather on both sides of
the Atlantic vastly improving, astronauts boarded the shuttle
Endeavour for a Thursday liftoff of the first space station
construction flight.

said it again as he strapped into Endeavour.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ An alarm that went off in the
cockpit just minutes before liftoff forced NASA to scrub Thursday's
launch of space shuttle Endeavour on the first space station
construction flight.
	   The alarm sounded with about five minutes remaining in the
countdown. NASA counted down to the 31-second mark and debated what
might have caused the master alarm to go off. Managers counted down
several more seconds before calling off the attempt for the day.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ An alarm that went off in the
cockpit just minutes before liftoff forced NASA to scrub Thursday's
launch of space shuttle Endeavour on the first space station
construction flight.
	   The alarm sounded with about five minutes remaining in the
countdown. NASA counted down to the 31-second mark and debated what
might have caused the master alarm to go off. Managers counted down
several more seconds before calling off the attempt for the day.
	   Until practically the last minute, NASA worried that rain and
accompanying clouds would foil the launch. But the rain drifted
away in time for the targeted 3:58 a.m. liftoff _ and then the
alarm went off.
	   Endeavour's pilots reported that the alarm sounded right around
the time shuttle hydraulic power units were turned on. But launch
controllers quickly determined that all three units were working
fine.
	   NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said a second launch attempt
could be made Friday, but that any such decision would have to be
made by the engineers.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from
around the world had gathered in the drizzle to see Endeavour and
its crew of six off following a year's delay caused by a cash
crunch in Russia. Most were representatives of the 16 countries
participating in the space station effort.
	   ``This is a visionary idea,'' Albright told reporters. ``This is
an investment in the future.''
	   The mission promises to be one of the most difficult in space
shuttle history. And the entire space station project promises to
be the most difficult undertaking since the Apollo moon landings
nearly 30 years ago.
	   ``We're not testing just hardware as part of this program,''
said Mikhail Sinelschikov, a Russian space official. ``We're
testing our relationship very much and our mutual trust and our
confidence in each other.''
	   Two weeks ago, the Russians put the first piece of the space
station into orbit.
	   During Endeavour's 12-day flight, the astronauts will use the
shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian piece and attach it to the
American component. Then, two astronauts will perform three
spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders.
	   The U.S. piece, named Unity, is a connecting passageway. It is
essentially an aluminum can with big holes where other chambers
eventually will attach. It contains six miles of wiring and more
than 50,000 mechanical pieces.
	   The Russian component, named Zarya, which means sunrise,
contains the power and propulsion systems that will keep the
station aloft until the Russians can launch a permanent control
module.
	   In all, more than 100 components weighing 1 million pounds are
to be launched over the next five years, requiring 45 U.S. and
Russian flights.
	   ``It's going to start out kind of small, but it's going to grow
to the size of a football field,'' said shuttle commander Cabana.
	   Unity should have been put in orbit last December. But station
assembly was put on hold because of Russia's economic crisis, which
prevented the country's space agency from completing the permanent
control module. NASA has since bailed out the Russian Space Agency.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ An alarm went off inside space
shuttle Endeavour's cockpit minutes before Thursday's planned
liftoff, forcing NASA to delay its first space station construction
flight.
	   By the time launch controllers debated what was wrong and what
to do about it, they ran out of time and Endeavour was grounded for
at least another day.
	   ``Please cut off,'' a launch controller urged his colleagues.
	   The master alarm _ a pair of rectangular red lights _ began
flashing about 4{ minutes before the scheduled pre-dawn launch.
Unsure of what caused it, shuttle managers counted down to the
31-second mark while discussing the problem.
	   Endeavour's pilots reported that the alarm went off right around
the time the shuttle hydraulic power units were turned on. But
launch controllers quickly determined that all three units were
working fine and counted down several more seconds before finally
giving up for the day.
	   The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle an hour later. Two
threw up their hands.
	   ``We'll try again another time,'' said commander Robert Cabana,
holding up his left thumb and index finger a half-inch apart. ``We
were that close.''
	   NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said engineers would meet
Thursday to decide whether to try again Friday.
	   NASA has only about five minutes each day to launch Endeavour in
order to meet up with the first space station part, launched two
weeks ago by the Russians.
	   Aboard Endeavour is the second station component, an
American-made connecting passageway named Unity. Once in orbit, the
astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian
piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two astronauts will perform
three spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and
cables between the two cylinders.
	   Until the alarm flashed, it looked as though weather would be
the culprit.
	   Rain and accompanying clouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{ hours
before liftoff. But the rain drifted away with minutes to spare and
the clouds were judged by NASA to be scattered and thin enough for
launch _ and then the alarm went off.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ An alarm went off inside space
shuttle Endeavour's cockpit minutes before today's planned liftoff,
forcing NASA to delay its first space station construction flight.
	   By the time launch controllers debated what was wrong and what
to do about it, they ran out of time and Endeavour was grounded for
another day. They missed the cutoff by only one to two seconds.
	   Launch director Ralph Roe, while disappointed, was convinced his
team did the right thing. He said they would try again Friday.
	   ``We want to err on the conservative side,'' Roe said. ``We
don't want to launch with something we don't understand.''
	   The master alarm _ a pair of rectangular red lights _ began
flashing about 4{ minutes before the scheduled pre-dawn launch.
Unsure of what caused it, shuttle managers counted down to the
31-second mark while discussing the problem.
	   Endeavour's pilots reported that the alarm went off right around
the time the shuttle hydraulic power units were turned on. But
launch controllers quickly determined that one of the three units
had experienced a momentary dip in pressure, and so they counted
down 12 more seconds before having to give up for the day.
	   ``Please cut off,'' a launch controller urged his colleagues.
	   The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle an hour later. Two
threw up their hands.
	   ``We'll try again another time,'' said commander Robert Cabana.
He held up his left thumb and index finger a half-inch apart. ``We
were that close.''
	   The one-day delay cost NASA about $600,000, mostly in fuel and
overtime pay. ``It's an expensive turnaround, but that's part of
the price we pay to be conservative and make sure that we don't
have unsafe situations,'' said Donald McMonagle, a shuttle manager.
	   McMonagle said engineers would meet throughout the day to make
sure they understood the fleeting drop in hydraulic pressure that
set off the alarm.
	   NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour
in order to meet up with the first space station part, launched two
weeks ago by the Russians.
	   Aboard Endeavour is the second station component, an
American-made connecting passageway named Unity. Once in orbit, the
astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian
piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two astronauts will perform
three spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and
cables between the two cylinders.
	   Until the alarm flashed, it looked as though weather would be
the culprit.
	   Rain and accompanying clouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{ hours
before liftoff. But the rain drifted away with minutes to spare and
the clouds were judged by NASA to be scattered and thin enough for
launch _ and then the alarm went off.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from
around the world had gathered in the drizzle to see Endeavour and
its crew off following a year's delay caused by a cash crunch in
Russia. Most were representatives of the 16 countries participating
in the space station effort.
	   ``This is a visionary idea,'' Albright told reporters. ``This is
an investment in the future.''
	   The mission promises to be one of the most difficult in space
shuttle history. And the entire space station project promises to
be the most difficult undertaking since the Apollo moon landings

	   In all, more than 100 components weighing 1 million pounds are

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
continued to dip this week, falling 4.8 percent to 1,723.4 points,
the National Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   The company warned in its weekly report that if ``clear
measures'' are not taken to correct the market, the index will fall
even lower, erasing all the gains of several years.
	   Investors say that the exchange, which lists 77 companies, is
suffering from lack of liquidity. But the Central Bank disagrees
and is conducting a survey before it decides what should be done.
	   Trading in the first day of the week was interrupted shortly
after it started by a bomb hoax.
	   Some 110.04 million shares changed hands this week, down 32.76
percent from last week, according to the report. The value of these
shares dropped 40.61 percent to 18.17 million dinars (dlrs 60.16
million).
	   Of the 66 companies that were traded, only 3 closed higher while
58 closed lower. The others were unchanged.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices shored up but turnover slipped
on the stock exchange this week because trading centered on shares
of lucrative commercial banks, brokers said Thursday.
	   A stock market report, reflecting activity for five business
days ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices
index nudged up 1.26 percent to 164.94 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks increased 1.86 percent. But shares of
industrial firms dropped 0.13 percent, insurance companies 0.95
percent and the services sector 0.35 percent.
	   Turnover also fell about 20 percent to 5.29 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 7.4 million), the report said.
	   It said stocks of 103 firms were traded during the week.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Trading was off sharply at the Baghdad
Stock Exchange this week amid instability in the exchange rate of
the dinar.
	   The market bulletin released Thursday said the number of shares
traded slumped 65 per cent to 28.48 million from 80.8 million the
previous week.
	   The value of these shares fell 30 per cent to 294 million dinars
(dlrs 172,000).
	   The bulletin, reflecting activity for the three business days
ending Wednesday, said trading was concentrated in banking and
industrial stocks.
	   The Iraqi dinar this week weakened to about 1,800 to the dollar,
firmed to 1,600 and then settled back to 1,750 amid concerns over
Iraqi cooperation on U.N. weapons inspections.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh left
for Egypt on Thursday for talks aimed at boosting trade
cooperation, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Saleh will head the Iraqi side in meetings of the joint
Iraqi-Egyptian Committee that coordinates cooperation in trade,
economic, and cultural fields, the agency said.
	   Egypt has been a major participant in the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities
of oil to buy needed food and medicine. The program is an exception
from U.N. trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Iraq has been importing soap, detergent, sugar and
pharmaceuticals from Egypt under the oil-for-food program. Egyptian
ready-made clothes and household utensils also are available in
Baghdad shops.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Oil and gas discoveries _ two of them in the
Western Desert and one in the Mediterranean _ were made in Egypt
last month, Al-Akhbar daily reported Thursday.
	   The newspaper quoted Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi as saying that
Khalda Oil Co. struck gas in the desert southeast of the
Mediterranean city of Mersa Matrouh.
	   He said the find was expected to produce 19 million cubic feet
(570,000 cubic meters) of natural gas and 732 barrels of
condensates per day, the paper said.
	   The second discovery was made by Gupco Co. in the Mediterranean
north of Port Said at a depth of 80 meters (yards), said the paper.
It was expected to produce 40 million cubic feet (1.2 million cubic
meters) of natural gas and 2,200 barrels of condensates a day.
	   The third, discovered by Agiba Co. in the Qattara depression in
the Western Desert, is expected to produce 800 barrels of oil a
day, Al-Akhbar said.
	   El-Banbi said there have been 22 oil and 14 natural gas
discoveries this year.

Baseball team investigating reports of sign stealing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 10th-12th grafs with report on questioning of players,
quote from one of the suspected players and emergency league board
meeting.
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Former Japanese star slugger Sadaharu Oh could face
a lifetime ban from baseball if an investigation finds that the
team that he manages was orchestrating a reported sign-stealing
scam.
	   Oh, who holds Japan's career record of 868 home runs, has not
been directly implicated in the embarrassing allegations against
his Daiei Hawks that have riveted this baseball-crazy country.
	   And the three players accused in the scam have denied
wrongdoing.
	   ``I can't believe it,'' Oh said. ``I'd like to believe my
players.''
	   According to the charges, which first surfaced Wednesday, a team
employee sitting in front of a TV monitor watched footage from one
of four cameras around Fukuoka Dome, Daiei's home stadium, that
clearly showed the catcher of the other team.
	   The employee deciphered the catcher's signs and used a
walkie-talkie to tell what pitch was coming to a youngster in the
stands, who had been specially hired for the job, Japanese media
reports said.
	   The youngster then relayed that information to the batter, using
his megaphone.
	   A megaphone held before his face meant the pitcher was about to
throw a fastball. A megaphone held out toward the right was a curve
or a slider, and to the left a forkball, the reports say.
	   Daiei _ which tied for third this season in the six-club Pacific
League _ is carrying out an investigation and has promised to
present its findings to the league office within a week.
	   On Thursday, the team questioned the trio of players suspected
of being involved, Japanese media reported. Infielders Koichiro
Yoshinaga and Shikato Yanagita and outfielder Noriyoshi Omichi all
denied the allegations against them.
	   ``There is no factual evidence to suggest that I'm involved and
I told the team that I didn't do it,'' Yanagita was quoted as
saying by Kyodo News agency.
	   Also Thursday, Japan's Pacific League decided to convene a
special meeting of its board of directors on Dec. 9 to discuss the
results of Daiei's internal investigation and decide what measures
to take, news reports said.
	   Meanwhile, speculation grew that Oh may have to resign to take
responsibility for the cheating, which allegedly began last year
and continued into the latest season ending in October.
	   In Japan, people in leadership positions often have to step down
when a scandal happens, even if they are not directly involved.
	   Blatant spying is against Japanese professional baseball rules.
	   Although the Pacific League does not clearly state the penalties
for violations, some Japanese media reports said Thursday that Oh
could be hit with a lifetime ban if the investigation finds that
the team was behind the scandal.
	   The rival Central League has the punishment in writing,
including a possible lifetime ban.
	   Trying to figure out an opposing team's strategy by deciphering
managers' and players' signs is common, especially in Japanese
baseball, which, unlike the U.S. major leagues, tends to rely more
on strategy than physical prowess.

Sweden defense forces falling after Cold War
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARALD MOLLERSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ At the height of the Cold War, Sweden
had one of the world's strongest militaries. Now, the thaw between
East and West has melted its might.
	   Sweden's formidable defense forces have helped keep it out of
war since 1814, even during the decades when the nearby Soviet
Union was seen as a threat.
	   After the Soviet Union collapsed and the Russian military was
revealed as poorly maintained and badly fed, Sweden began cutting
back its armed forces.
	   Top commanders watched uneasily as defense outlays were shaved _
from 11 percent of the national budget in 1975 to 6.9 percent last
year. The air force, which had been the world's fifth-largest 40
years ago with 850 planes, is now down to 220.
	   The Swedish navy has been pared from a fleet of more than 130
warships, including a dozen destroyers and 26 submarines, to just
24 lightly armed surface vessels and nine submarines. The army that
once comprised 31 brigades and 155,000 soldiers has seen its force
reduced to 13 brigades and 65,000 men.
	   In the latest blow to the military, the government on Tuesday
announced that it would not appropriate more money to pay for new
equipment that was ordered years ago. Instead, the government
suggested, the military could cover some of the $1.16 billion debt
by borrowing against future defense budgets.
	   Supreme Commander Owe Wiktorin found that suggestion
humiliating.
	   ``We have always kept our budgets. To borrow money to solve your
problems is a bad solution. Every breadwinner knows that,''
Wiktorin said. ``This is the worst possible scenario.''
	   Wiktorin says the current $5.5 billion defense budget falls $375
million short. To close the gap, Wiktorin says, the military may
have to limit itself to 6,000 conscripts next year instead of the
usual 25,000, and postpone or cancel equipment orders.
	   Halting weapons procurement would be a crushing blow to Sweden's
defense industry, which makes submarines, surface vessels,
armaments and planes. Especially vulnerable would be Saab, the
maker of the JAS Gripen warplane. Sweden is the only country using
the Gripen, although South Africa has indicated it wants to order
some two dozen of the planes.
	   The weapons were ordered in the waning years of the Cold War,
when the Soviet Union still looked intimidating and commanders were
concerned that Sweden's military equipment was becoming dangerously
outdated.
	   The curtain of Russian invincibility has slipped away.
Coincidentally, as the government was discussing military funding
on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was briefing Prime
Minister Goeran Persson on Russia's 40-percent force reduction in
the northwest.
	   The latest military budget decision reflects not only the new
post-Cold War politics but a new political balance in Sweden.
	   After weak election results in September, the governing Social
Democrats now rely on the Greens and the former communist Left
Party to stay in power _ and those two parties used their strength
to block more money to the military.
	   ``It's unthinkable that defense policy should rest on the Left
Party's and the Greens' views,'' Defense Minister Bjoern von Sydow
complained Tuesday.
	   Early next year the defense staff will submit a report on
threats to Sweden's security. On the basis of the study, the
government will decide whether to cut the defense budget further.

U.S. envoy presents Serbs with new Kosovo peace plan draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav border guards killed eight
ethnic Albanian rebels today, Serb sources said, in the worst
violation of a Kosovo cease-fire reached in October under threat of
NATO airstrikes.
	   The incident comes as the U.S. envoy for Kosovo presented Serb
leaders today with a revised draft plan for the future of the
troubled Serbian province and said some progress toward a permanent
peace was being made.
	   But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill also warned that time was at a
premium because of fears that fighting, now at a lull, could resume
in the warm weather of spring.
	   ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' Hill said. ``Spring should be the
time for plowing and not for fighting.''
	   The eight armed ethnic Albanians were killed near the town of
Prizren when nine of them fired on Yugoslav soldiers guarding the
border with Albania, the pro-government Serbian Media Center said.
Yugoslav troops were not injured, the center said
	   Yugoslavia's army command confirmed the deaths and said the
ethnic Albanians were trying to cross the border into Kosovo
``illegally.''
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   Before meeting with Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, Hill
said the new draft reflects previous comments by rival Serb and
ethnic Albanian officials on how to achieve a settlement for the
ethnic Albanian-majority province in southern Serbia.
	   Kosovo's Albanian leadership wants independence from Serbia but
is willing to settle for full autonomy as a first step. Serbia and
the Serb leaders of Yugoslavia are strongly opposed to any plan on
Kosovo that would sidestep Serbia.
	   Hill did not elaborate, but said the new plan does not
explicitly specify whether Kosovo will become the third Yugoslav
republic or would remain a Serb province. Republic status for
Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   Hill told The Associated Press that he hoped the new plan would
``shift the momentum from one of violence to one of political
settlement.'' He planned to meet ethnic Albanian officials on
Friday to present them with the new plan.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against Kosovo separatists in February. Bloodshed abated
_ but did not end _ after Milosevic promised U.S. Envoy Richard
Holbrooke Oct. 12 to end the Kosovo campaign and begin political
negotiations on the province's future.
	   Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own peace deal for Kosovo,
defying an earlier U.S. plan and warning that anything beyond some
sort of self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war.
	   Secessionist ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian
proposal.

Delta Air Lines to drop service to four cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Delta Air Lines will discontinue service to three
international destinations and to Bangor, Maine, next year, part of
its continuing effort to concentrate planes on more profitable
routes.
	   Flights to Prague, Czech Republic, which Delta services from New
York via Stuttgart, Germany, will end Jan. 17, the Atlanta-based
airline announced Wednesday.
	   Delta will continue to fly its Stuttgart route and will sell
seats to Prague aboard its codeshare partner, Swissair.
	   On March 2, Delta will end its flights to Bangor, the same day
its commuter affiliate, Comair, begins three daily nonstop flights
from Bangor to Cincinnati with 50-seat regional jets.
	   Delta will stop serving Calgary and Edmonton in Canada on April
4. Commuter affiliate SkyWest will pick up service to Calgary with
three daily flights to its Salt Lake City hub, but not to Edmonton,
the airline said.
	   ``It's the same story,'' Delta spokesman Todd Clay said. ``We've
got greater revenue generation opportunities elsewhere.''
	   As part of its Canadian restructuring, Delta also announced that
it will hire 100 more workers in 1999 at its Montreal reservations
center.
	   Halting its flights to Prague will leave Delta with 22 European
destinations.
	   Domestic destinations Delta has stopped serving this year
include Toledo, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Fresno, Calif.; Jackson
Hole, Wyo.; and Idaho Falls, Idaho.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Labor unrest continued to mount across France
Thursday, with rail workers still on strike, and jobless protesters
holding sit-ins and even demanding a year-end bonus.
	   The rail strike, which began last Friday, hit 20 out of 23
regions, with services severely disrupted.
	   Rail workers say there is insufficient staff and are concerned
about how the government will implement a plan to cut the working
week from 39 to 35 hours.
	   Many workers fear a 35-hour week, aimed at spreading jobs around
and cutting unemployment, will lead to salary cuts.

Orthodox boycott ceremonial opening of World Council of Churches
</HEADLINE>
assembly &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC; 
 &UR; AP Religion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The World Council of Churches began its
fiftieth anniversary assembly on treacherous footing Thursday as
representatives from the large Orthodox churches of Russia and
Greece decided to boycott the opening worship service.
	   Growing tensions between the restive Orthodox and the WCC's
Protestant majority are a major problem facing the international
church meeting, which is expected to address world political and
economic problems and a series of theological questions.
	   The boycott could have been worse. Many Orthodox participants
followed the lead of delegates from Istanbul's Ecumenical
Patriarchate, the symbolic center of Eastern Orthodoxy, who are
attending the worship but not are not participating in leading it.
	   The Orthodox partipants from various nations debated their
strategies at a sober caucus in a University of Zimbabwe lecture
hall that concluded just three hours before the WCC's opening
ceremony, scheduled for 4 p.m. (1400 GMT). As they conferred, the
non-Orthodox delegates were attending the scheduled assembly
orientation.
	   The Very Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, the first Orthodox president of
America's National Council of Churches and one of four Orthodox
members of the WCC executive committee, said ``the Russian Orthodox
position underscores the serious challenge faced by the ecumenical
movement as a whole and the World Council of Churches in
particular.''
	   The 960 delegates at the assembly, which meets daily through
December 14, represent a constituency of 330 denominations on all
continents, with some 350 million to 450 million Christians. The
biggest non-member, by far, is the Roman Catholic Church. The
assembly is also being attended by 3,500 visitors.
	   The WCC delegates will be discussing _ but not necessarily
resolving _ increasing Orthodox anxiety about liberal trends among
Protestants in Europe and North America. One current flashpoint is
homosexuality, which also divides the western liberals from many
rapidly growing Protestant churches in the Southern Hemisphere.
	   Contrary to earlier assurances from WCC officials, it seems
certain that the homosexual issue will reach the assembly floor, at
least obliquely. A message from a pre-assembly women's festival
will refer to ``human sexuality in all its diversity.'' Such
language was opposed by Orthodox women as well as Protestants from
Africa and the Mideast.
	   During the discussions, Aruna Gnanadason, who runs WCC women's
programs, apologized that ``our lesbian sisters'' in attendance had
been left off the festival program.
	   In addition, the WCC is staging an open forum during the
assembly in which a dozen by various Christian organizations will
address homosexuality. It remains unclear whether those
presentations will have any impact on the assembly itself.
	   The WCC's struggle over homosexuality reflects conditions among
its member churches.
	   At a meeting last summer of the world's Anglican and Episcopal
bishops, Africans helped push through a clear stand against
homosexuality, over objections from western liberals. The issue has
long been troublesome for three WCC stalwarts in the U.S.: The
Episcopal Church, Presbyterian Church (USA) and United Methodist
Church.

German court blocks compensation for Nazi-era slave labor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A German court denied compensation Thursday
to a Polish-born Jewish woman who was forced into slave labor under
the Nazis, dampening hopes for other survivors in eastern Europe.
	   The state superior court in Cologne threw out an award of 15,000
marks (dlrs 9,000) for Rywka Merin, who toiled for the Union
munitions factory under Nazi SS guard while imprisoned at the
Auschwitz camp during World War II.
	   A court in Bonn had ordered the payment last November because
Merin lived behind the Iron Curtain until 1968 and missed a 1965
deadline for seeking health and imprisonment compensation from
Germany.
	   But the higher court upheld the government's appeal against the
award, citing postwar German restitution laws that paid reparations
for suffering or health loss but give former slave workers no
possibility to sue for back pay.
	   It also rejected appeals on behalf of 22 other former Jewish
slave laborers who were denied back wages in last year's ruling
because they had already been compensated by Germany.
	   Lawyers for the survivors or their families were expected to
appeal further.
	   All plaintiffs were slave workers while interned at Auschwitz
during 1943-1945 _ 12 hours a day, six days a week for periods
ranging from 27 to 68 weeks. Most were Polish citizens.
	   Germany has paid more than 100 billion marks (dlrs 60 billion)
in reparations to Nazi victims, but it has refused to honor wage
claims by slave workers, who were technically working for private
companies.
	   About 7 million slave laborers were forced to work in Nazi
Germany during the war. Most were from Poland and the Soviet Union,
and many were Jews.
	   Under pressure from lawsuits against German companies in the
United States, new Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has launched talks
on a government foundation to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers, a
step refused by his predecessor Helmut Kohl.
	   It's still unclear whether the government will pay into the
fund, or only industry.
	   ``The German government will work for a solution that satisfies
former Nazi-era slave laborers,'' the Finance Ministry said after
Thursday's verdict.

Deputy mayor: Moscow may restore statue of secret police chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's deputy mayor said the city will restore a
statue of a dreaded Soviet secret police chief if parliament
formalizes its request to do so, news reports said Thursday.
	   The Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, voted 237-69 on Wednesday to give tentative approval to
a resolution asking the Moscow city government to return the statue
of Felix Dzerzhinsky to the spot it occupied for decades in front
of the old KGB headquarters.
	   ``If the State Duma makes a final decision of restoring to
monument to Felix Dzerzhinsky, then the government of Moscow, as
executive power, will fulfill that decision,'' said Moscow Deputy
Mayor Valery Shantsev, according to reports by the Interfax news
agency and the daily Segodnya.
	   However, the Moscow city parliament must also approve the plan,
according to city laws, Segodnya reported.
	   ``What monument will stand on Lubyanka Square may be decided
only by Muscovites, through their representatives in the city
Duma,'' deputy speaker of the city's legislature Alexander Krutov
was quoted as saying.
	   Communists have significantly less weight in the Moscow city
parliament than in its national counterpart, and the city
legislature is likely to block the decision to restore the statue.
	   Moscow's powerful Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has so far kept silent on
the issue. In the past, Luzhkov did not exhibit particular
Communist sympathies. But the populist mayor is a leading potential
contender in Russia's next presidential elections in 2000, and
recently has seemed to be courting some of the country's many
hard-liners.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the Cheka,
the first Soviet secret police, was a landmark during the Soviet
era. It was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has
since languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   Human rights activists have denounced the proposal to restore
the statue, saying Dzerzhinsky was a symbol of murderous repression
during the Soviet era.
	   Dzerzhinsky headed the secret police after the Bolshevik
Revolution and oversaw the ruthless crackdowns on political
opponents.
	   Lubyanka Square, where the statue stood, is used by human rights
groups for vigils to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule.
Relatives of victims whose remains were never found use the square
as a gravesite, bringing flowers every year.

Last-minute alarm in the cockpit keeps Endeavour grounded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 16th graf, `For Friday...', to UPDATE with new forecast,
odds of good weather now put at just 40 percent. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ An alarm went off inside space
shuttle Endeavour's cockpit minutes before today's planned liftoff,
forcing NASA to delay its first space station construction flight.
	   By the time launch controllers figured out what was wrong and
concluded they could launch safely, they had run out of time and
Endeavour was grounded for another day. They missed the cutoff by
only one to two seconds.
	   Launch director Ralph Roe, while disappointed, was convinced his
team did the right thing. He said they would try again Friday.
	   ``We want to err on the conservative side,'' Roe said. ``We
don't want to launch with something we don't understand.''
	   The master alarm _ a pair of rectangular red lights _ began
flashing and beeping about 4{ minutes before the scheduled pre-dawn
launch. Unsure of what caused it, shuttle managers counted down to
the 31-second mark while discussing the problem.
	   Endeavour's pilots reported that the alarm sounded right around
the time the shuttle hydraulic power units were turned on. But
launch controllers quickly determined that one of the three units
had experienced a momentary dip in pressure, and so they counted
down 12 more seconds before having to give up for the day.
	   ``Please cut off,'' a launch controller urged his colleagues.
	   The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle an hour later. Two
threw up their hands.
	   ``We'll try again another time,'' said commander Robert Cabana.
He held up his left thumb and index finger a half-inch apart. ``We
were that close.''
	   The one-day delay cost NASA about $600,000, mostly in fuel and
overtime pay. ``It's an expensive turnaround, but that's part of
the price we pay to be conservative and make sure that we don't
have unsafe situations,'' said Donald McMonagle, a shuttle manager.
	   McMonagle said engineers would meet throughout the day to make
sure they understood the fleeting drop in hydraulic pressure that
set off the alarm.
	   NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour
in order to meet up with the first space station part, launched two
weeks ago by the Russians.
	   Aboard Endeavour is the second station component, an
American-made connecting passageway named Unity. Once in orbit, the
astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian
piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two astronauts will perform
three spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and
cables between the two cylinders.
	   Until the alarm flashed, it looked as though weather would be
the culprit.
	   Rain and accompanying clouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{ hours
before liftoff. But the rain drifted away with minutes to spare and
the clouds were judged by NASA to be scattered and thin enough for
launch _ and then the alarm went off.
	   For Friday, forecasters put the odds of good weather at the 3:36
a.m. launch time at just 40 percent.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from
around the world had gathered in the drizzle to see Endeavour and
its crew off following a year's delay caused by a cash crunch in
Russia. Most were representatives of the 16 countries participating
in the space station effort.
	   ``This is a visionary idea,'' Albright told reporters. ``This is
an investment in the future.''
	   The mission promises to be one of the most difficult in space
shuttle history. And the entire space station project promises to
be the most difficult undertaking since the Apollo moon landings
nearly 30 years ago.
	   In all, more than 100 components weighing 1 million pounds are
to be launched over the next five years, requiring 45 U.S. and
Russian flights.

Lee Westwood gets Player of Year prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; FOR RELEASE AT 2300 GMT, Thursday, Dec. 3; time set by source

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ England's Lee Westwood, who
captured seven titles in six countries in 1998, has won the
European Tour's golfer of the year award.
	   Westwood, 25, was a unanimous winner in the voting by a panel of
golf writers, beating out Colin Montgomerie and Darren Clarke.
	   Montgomerie had won the award the past three years and finished
as the top money-winner in Europe this season for the sixth
straight year.
	   Westwood won European Tour events in Germany, England, Scotland
and Belgium on the way to finishing third in the order of merit
(behind Montgomerie and Clarke) with 814,386 pounds (dlrs 1.3
million).
	   Westwood also won for the first time on the U.S. tour when he
captured the Freeport-McDermott Classic in New Orleans. Last month,
he won back-to-back tournaments in Japan. This week, he's playing
in the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun City, South Africa.
	   ``I'd almost given up hope of getting an award this year after
missing out on golfer of the month all season,'' Westwood said.
``Had the award been purely for Europe, I probably wouldn't have
won it because I finished third in the Volvo Ranking. My win in
America and the two in Japan probably swung it for me.
	   ``My results throughout the world have been the best of any
European this year and nobody else won four times in Europe so I
know I must have been in with a chance. But I was still shocked and
delighted to have won it.''

Fire extinguished after raging for 30 hours at Coca-Cola plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Fireman managed Thursday to put out a
blaze at the Coca-Cola bottling plant which had raged for nearly 30
hours, causing no injuries but considerable damage to one of the
country's major foreign investments.
	   Officials were expected to issue a damage report Friday,
including an estimate of the cost of the blaze.
	   Workers said the fire started early Wednesday after plastic
boxes placed near a huge lamp melted and then ignited the blaze.
	   The four-year-old plant is a joint venture between Atlanta-based
	   Coca-Cola and Italy's Gruppo Busi, which also operates bottling
plants in Italy. The Albanian plant produces about 100 million
bottles annually in a country of fewer than 3 million people.

Court agrees to extradite Turkish mafia boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ A French appeals court on
Thursday agreed to extradite an alleged Turkish mafia boss to
Turkey. But it said it would set conditions for the extradition.
	   Alaatin Cakici, 45, who is believed to be one of Turkey's top
mafia bosses, was arrested in France in August on an international
arrest warrant.
	   A court sentenced him to six months in prison for using a false
passport and a fake identity card.
	   Court officials said the extradition would be subject to
conditions set by the French court. They did not immediately
elaborate.
	   Cakici has been on the run from Turkish justice for years. He
was caught Aug. 17 in Nice by French police using a diplomatic
passport.
	   He is wanted in Turkey for a series of murders since 1978.

Turkey president on third visit to Romania in two years

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
arrived Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at boosting trade with
this former communist country.
	   In his third official visit to Romania in two years, Demirel
praised good relations with Romania, vowed a rapid increase in
bilateral trade and repeated support for Romania's integration into
NATO and other Western institutions.
	   Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, speaking at Demirel's
side, said he expected trade between the two Balkan countries to
soon reach dlrs one billion yearly from about two-thirds of that
now.
	   Demirel, traveling with Turkish businessmen and academics,
downplayed the collapse last week of Turkey's center-right
government. On Wednesday, veteran politician Bulent Ecevit was
asked to try to form a new administration.
	   ``There is nothing going wrong in Turkey,'' Demirel said.
``Governments can change, this is not new.''
	   Demirel is to inaugurate a Turkish-owned Efes Pilsen beer
factory in Ploiesti, 60 kilometers (38 miles) north of Bucharest.
Some 4,000 Turkish businessmen live in Romania, mostly among the
large Turkish population on the country's Black Sea coast.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government needs to come up with a
more detailed economic recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today, just a day after the International Monetary
Fund chief left without promising Moscow any new loans.
	   Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis program, but
the measures have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor
have they found favor with the IMF or other international lenders
who have frozen loans to Russia.
	   Primakov acknowledged the need to spell out the government's
intentions more clearly and called on the Cabinet to do so.
	   ``Without such a concrete action plan, containing concrete tasks
and time frames, the government's steps will look merely like
intentions,'' Primakov said.
	   IMF chief Michel Camdessus left Russia on Wednesday after
meeting with Primakov and other top officials. He praised
Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis, but
said an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on loans.
	   The IMF organized a $22.6 billion bailout package this summer,
but only about $5 billion was disbursed before Russia's economic
crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen.
	   The IMF has indicated that Russia's draft budget for next year
appears overly optimistic, and it also does not like moves to
increase the government's role in the economy.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said the new plan
envisages drafting more than 80 bills in the next two months to
help revive the moribund economy.
	   They will detail the government's intentions to subsidize some
key industries, pay off wage and pension debts, index some incomes,
restructure the banking system and tighten currency controls, he
said.
	   Some of these measures have been criticized by the IMF, but
Shapovalyants said he hoped that will not prove a stumbling block
to securing the loans. He added that Russia continues to count on
IMF loans as it drafts next year's budget.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed out at the
IMF for refusing to release loans.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as
speaker for the State Duma, parliament's lower house. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay off its
debts and then refuse to take any more loans. ``It's high time to
take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he told reporters.
	   In other economic developments today:
	   _ Inflation was up 5.7 percent in November, compared to 4.5
percent in October, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September
in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. However, inflation is up
about 70 percent compared to last December, Central Bank chief
Viktor Gerashchenko said.
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves dropped by $200 million in the
last week of November and stood at $12.8 billion on Nov. 27, the
Central Bank said today.

Explosion in Armenian resort kills four children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ An explosion tore through a children's
sanitarium at an Armenian resort on Thursday, killing at least four
children and injuring 12 other people.
	   Investigators believe the mid-afternoon blast may have been
caused by a gas leak, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   The building partially collapsed and rescuers were searching the
rubble for more victims.
	   The sanitarium in Dzhermuk _ a well-known mineral water resort
150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Armenia's capital, Yerevan _
housed children accompanied by their mothers.
	   It was not immediately clear how many people were in the
building at the time of the explosion.
	   Armenia's President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister Armen
Darbinian expressed condolences to the victims' families.

Report: bomb in western Algeria kills 14, injures 24
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A bomb exploded at a market in western Algeria on
Thursday, killing 14 people and injuring 24 others, French radio
reported.
	   The explosion occurred shortly before midday in Khemis Miliana,
about 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of Algiers, France Info radio
reported.
	   No further details were immediately available.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in an insurgency that erupted
when Algeria's military-backed government canceled January 1992
elections that an Islamic fundamentalist group, the Islamic
Salvation Front, was poised to win.
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins this year on Dec.
20, has been marred by waves of violence each year since the
insurgency began.

Government rejects opposition demand to quit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's political opposition demanded
Thursday that the governing Hindu nationalists resign over their
poor handling of the economy.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government should quit
immediately, because it was leading the country toward stagflation,
Rajesh Pilot of the main opposition Congress party said in
parliament. Economists define stagflation as persistent inflation
combined with stagnant consumer demand and high unemployment.
	   Leaders of the 19-party governing coalition led by Vajpayee's
Bharatiya Janata Party rejected the call to step down.
	   Still smarting from a setback in state elections last week, the
BJP has found itself increasingly on the defensive for its handling
of the economy and foreign affairs.
	   Pilot and Geeta Mukherjee of the Communist Party of India said
the BJP had lost elections in two key northern states, New Delhi
and Rajasthan, and failed to topple Congress in a third because
voters were angry over rising prices.
	   None of the governing coalition's allies rose to Vajpayee's
defense during the parliament debate on prices Thursday, though the
partners reiterated their support for the government.
	   Following the introduction of market reforms in 1991, India
enjoyed a period of economic improvement. In recent months,
however, the economy has faltered.
	   The wholesale price index has risen to 8.6 percent from 5
percent since Vajpayee assumed power in March. Industrial growth
has fallen to 1.4 percent in the year ending September, as compared
to 8.5 percent in the previous year.
	   BJP spokesman and member of parliament K.L. Sharma said that the
economic slowdown was caused by international sanctions imposed
after India tested nuclear devices in May. However, the
government's own economic experts have been saying for months that
the sanctions have had little effect.
	   Sharma also blamed flooding in northern India that destroyed
crops.
	   ``A steep rise in overall prices was a temporary phenomenon
which has been arrested by the government,'' he said.

Japan's economy shrinks for fourth straight quarter as recession

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest sign of Japan's economic woes, the
government said the world's second-largest economy shrank at an
annualized pace of 2.6 percent in the most recent quarter, marking
the longest slump in more than four decades.
	   The country's gross domestic product _ a measure of all goods
and services produced _ slid 0.7 percent in the three months from
July through September, compared to the previous quarter, the
Economic Planning Agency said.
	   It was the first time the economy has contracted for four
consecutive quarters since the government started compiling growth
statistics in 1955 and showed Japan remains mired in its worst
recession since World War II.
	   The news comes as Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi struggles
to prevent the economy from shrinking for a third consecutive year
and fulfill a pledge to engineer a recovery within two years.
	   Japan's top economic official, Economic Planning Agency head
Taichi Sakaiya, said Thursday that the economy was unlikely to meet
a government target for minus 1.8 percent growth in the fiscal year
ending next March.
	   ``It's going to be a little tough,'' Sakaiya told reporters.
	   But the EPA chief said the worst may be over and expressed
relief that the latest batch of data did not contain any negative
surprises.
	   ``These figures actually were a little better than I expected,''
he said.
	   Many private sector economists were less sanguine.
	   ``This talk about bottoming out is extremely premature,'' said
Ron Bevacqua, economist in the Tokyo office of Merrill Lynch, who
expects Japan's economy to shrink 2.1 percent in the current fiscal
year.
	   ``The prospect for recovery is quite remote,'' added Andrew
Shipley, economist at Schroders Securities Japan Ltd.
	   The government has tried to jump start the economy with massive
investment in public works projects and temporary tax relief. Its
latest stimulus package totals a record 24 trillion yen (dlrs 201
billion).
	   But consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the
overall economy, remains sluggish as people pinch their purse
strings amid growing fears about job security and falling incomes.
Japanese corporations have also trimmed outlays on new plants and
equipment.
	   Worry over the stability of the banking system has also fanned
concerns among both business leaders and consumers, even though the
government recently earmarked about 25 trillion yen (dlrs 210
billion) to bailout troubled lenders.
	   What's more, Japan has been hurt by a regionwide economic
downturn as slack demand from its Asian neighbors has curtailed
demand for exports, a traditional engine of growth.
	   The government also said Thursday the economy shrank by a
revised 0.4 percent during the last fiscal year ended in March
1998, its biggest annual drop since 1974, Kyodo News reported.
	   The Japanese economy hasn't shrunk two years in a row since the
end of World War II.

Fire extinguished after raging for 30 hours at Coca-Cola plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Firefighters managed Thursday to put out
a fire that had raged at a Coca-Cola bottling plant for nearly 30
hours.
	   The blaze caused no injuries but considerable damage to one of
the country's major foreign investments.
	   Officials are expected to issue a damage report Friday,
including an estimate of the cost of the blaze.
	   Workers said the fire started early Wednesday after plastic
boxes placed near a huge lamp melted and then ignited.
	   The four-year-old plant is a joint venture between Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola and Italy's Gruppo Busi, which also operates bottling
plants in Italy. The Albanian plant produces about 100 million
bottles annually in a country of fewer than 3 million people.

Serbs report finding more than 80 bodies in mass graves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KULA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Serb forensic experts said
Thursday they have recovered 81 bodies from various cemeteries in
Sarajevo over the past 10 days, many of them suspected Serb victims
of wartime atrocities.
	   Among the bodies are 27 presumed victims of Musan Topalovic, the
Bosnian Muslim warlord known as Caco, the experts told reporters.
Caco, killed later in a government sweep on criminals, massacred
more than two dozen Serb civilians in 1993 and left their bodies in
a pit at the edge of the city.
	   Sarajevo's Muslim authorities later had the bodies buried in a
Sarajevo cemetery from where the Serb teams exhumed them recently
under an agreement with Bosnia's Muslim officials and foreign
diplomats overseeing postwar Bosnia.
	   Milan Ivancevic, a member of the Serb forensic team, praised the
``great help from ... Muslim and international officials.''
	   Other members of the team said exhumations would resume in
March, with the onset of warmer weather, and investigations of how
Serbs buried during the war in Sarajevo died would continue.
	   The Serb figures were contested by Vlado Raguz, an undertaker in
charge of funerals in Sarajevo during the war. He asserted in
separate comments that among the remains exhumed by the Serbs was a
Croat who died of natural causes.
	   About 200,000 people were killed in the 3 1/2 year Bosnian war
that ended in 1995 with the U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
An additional 20,000 went missing and are feared dead.
	   Exhumations have been conducted by all three sides _ Muslims,
Croats and Serbs _ since 1995 in an effort to track down the fate
of the missing. No totals exist on the number of bodies recovered
since then.
	   But international and Muslim experts have recovered more than
2,000 bodies in northwestern Bosnia, many of them apparently
Srebrenica inhabitants massacred after the Serbs overran the Muslim
enclave in 1995.
	   And this year alone, more than 1,700 bodies were recovered by
all three sides, according to statistics released by the office of
the Bosnian High Representative, Carlos Westendorp. Of those, about
1,300 were Muslims, apparently killed by Serbs or Croats.
	   The three sides signed an agreement in 1996 committing them to
allow burials of victims in the towns and communities they came
from even if these are now controlled by other ethnic groups.
	   But Jasmin Odobasic, a member of the Muslim commission for
missing persons, said Serbs controlling Srebrenica have refused
requests from family members of Muslim victims for such burials.

Clashes at village over power line needed for Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KRYONERI, Greece (AP) _ Police clashed with villagers opposed to
a major electrical line Thursday as workers began laying cables
considered essential to meet power demands for the 2004 Olympics.
	   One demonstrator was arrested and two others slightly injured in
the confrontations with police in Kryoneri, about 15 kilometers
(nine miles) northeast of Athens.
	   State power officials repeated warnings last month that the
power line is vital to safeguard the city's electric grid during
the summer Games.
	   Successive court battles launched by Kryoneri residents have
blocked work on one of three major supply lines running from power
stations in northern Greece to densely populated Athens.
	   Nearly half of Greece's 10.2 million live in greater Athens.
	   The unfinished line _ just a few hundred meters (yards) from
completion _ was blamed for a major blackout in Athens during
storms in March.
	   ``No one has the right to blackmail 4 million people,''
Development Minister Vasso Papandreou told reporters. She said the
work could be completed within three weeks.
	   Kryoneri residents are at odds with the state power company over
land expropriation agreements and assurances that the high voltage
power lines pose no safety risk.
	   The government has agreed to place some of the cables
underground and erect pylons farther away from homes.

Ukraine's parliament postpones debate of 1999 budget draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Thursday postponed
debate over the 1999 budget draft after criticizing many of its
figures as unrealistic.
	   Deputies in the 450-seat legislature overwhelmingly voted 312-10
to put off the first reading of the document until Dec. 9 to let
parliament's budget committee revise it.
	   The draft, presented to lawmakers on Wednesday, provided for a
zero deficit and sharply raised the central government's projected
revenues and expenditures to nearly 50 percent more than the
Cabinet had initially proposed.
	   The revenues and expenditures were set at 35.1 billion hryvna
(dlrs 10.2 billion).
	   The budget draft must pass three readings in parliament before
final approval.
	   But Thursday's postponement and widespread dissatisfaction with
the proposed document have led many analysts to predict that the
budget has little chance of approval before the end of the year.
	   Cabinet officials objected to the draft Wednesday, an amended
version of what the government had submitted last month.
	   Many lawmakers echoed the Cabinet's criticism Thursday, calling
the budget's revenue target impossible to meet and questioning
several unorthodox sources proposed for filling government coffers.
	   The budget committee has proposed, for instance, raising extra
money by taxing commercial banks, extracting payment for using
Ukraine's air space and pushing enterprises to repay loans received
under government guarantees.
	   The legislators also cast doubt on the budget draft and its
optimistic tax projections after noting the government's extremely
poor tax collection so far this year.
	   Budget revenues in the first nine months of 1998 were just 50.8
percent of the annual target, while companies' tax debts
skyrocketed to 9.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.68 billion) as of Nov. 1.

German central bank cuts key interest rate, leaves others

 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Germany-Interest Rates &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a surprise move, nations adopting
the new European currency, the euro, dropped key interest rates
Thursday, effectively setting the rate that will be adopted
throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1.
	   Ten of the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest
rate to 3 percent. Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent.
	   The coordinated move was a key step in preparing for economic
union. Setting a common interest rates had been a particularly
contentious issue as center-left governments in Germany and France
pressed for lower rates to help boost growth and cut unemployment,
a stubborn 10.9 percent in the euro zone.
	   European Central Bank chief, Wim Duisenberg, gave no hint of the
rate cuts during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday, instead
suggesting that governments should reform rigid labor markets to
create jobs.
	   In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central
bankers cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent.
Rates before the cuts had varied throughout the future currency
zone, from 3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria.
	   The European Central Bank said in a statement from its Frankfurt
headquarters that the move was decided during a meeting Tuesday of
its the policy-making governing council.
	   The governing council comprises the 11 heads of national central
banks plus a six-member directorate, including the bank president
Duisenberg.
	   ``The joint reduction in interest rates has to be seen as a de
facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the (bank)
will start ... monetary union,'' the statement said, adding the
3-percent rate would be maintained ``for the foreseeable future.''
	   In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the move
reflected the worsening outlook for European economies, and wasn't
a capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine.
	   ``It's not a dramatic step. It wasn't in response to political
pressure,'' Tietmeyer said, referring to Germany's cut.
	   ``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the
current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,''
he said.
	   But Tietmeyer, head of the bank on which the ECB is modeled,
promised that the rate cut does not signal the start of a volatile
monetary policy. ``It's not a shift from the Bundesbank's
steady-hand policy,'' he said.
	   Growth in Europe has been hit by the Asian and Russian economic
crises and turbulence on international financial markets.
Duisenberg has said growth in the euro area countries next year
will be about 2.5 percent, lower than the 3 percent predicted
earlier.

Season's final Grand Prix NHK Trophy opens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAPPORO, Japan (AP) _ The NHK Trophy, the sixth and final event
of the figure skating Grand Prix, opened Thursday with French pair
Marina Annissina and Gwendal Peizerat leading in the compulsory
program of ice dancing.
	   Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of Russia were second,
followed by Lithuanians Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas,
Kati Winkler and Rene Lohse of Germany and Tatijana Navka and Roman
Kastamarov of Russia.
	   It is a non-point event for Lobacheva and Averbukh, who have
already qualified for the Champions Series final in St. Petersburg,
Russia, in March.
	   Figure skaters are allowed to compete in only three of the six
events in a season, designating two for points scoring in order to
be able to compete in the series final.
	   Three dance couples have qualified, leaving two places to be
settled at the NHK Trophy. Top contenders are Olympic bronze
medalists Annissina and Peizerat, currently on 12 points.
	   Drobiazko and Vanagas are currently tied in fourth place at 16
points with Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy, who
are not competing here.
	   There are two couples in the field on 7 points _ Winkler and
Lohse, third in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and the new paring of Navka
and Kastamarov, third in Russia last month.
	   If there is a tie for the fifth after the competition here, both
couples will qualify for the final.
	   The NHK Trophy has fewer big-name skaters this time, with
Russians Elena Sokoiova, Maria Butyrskaya, Alexei Yagudin and
Alexei Urmanov and other leaders on the standings skipping the
event after qualifying for the series final.
	   Even without Olympic champions competing this season, the
Russians have so far won 14 of 20 titles.
	   In Skate America and Skate Canada, the Russians won four of the
eight events. They swept the titles in Gelsenkirchen and added two
more at the Lalique Trophy competition in France. Like
Gelsenkirchen, they swept all four in Moscow.
	   Men's gold medalist Ilia Kulik and pairs champion Oksana
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev have bypassed the Grand Prix series
this year, preferring to enter pro-ams and do the show circuit
while staying eligible for future Olympic competition.

Customs workers continue strike as government ponders action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with problems on borders, protests in capital, cost of
customs strike, TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With fuel supplies running critically low,
the government and striking customs workers were on a collision
course Thursday after union leaders ignored a court order to return
to work.
	   The walkout, which began Monday, has severely cut the flow of
gasoline and heating oil _ which mostly arrives in Greece via
non-European Union nations. Goods shipped from EU partners are not
affected by the strike.
	   Many gas stations have run dry and heating oil is growing scarce
_ a particular problem in chilly northern Greece.
	   Hundreds of buses, cars and trucks stuck at Greece's northern
borders with Bulgaria, Macedonia and Turkey formed lines nearly six
kilometers (four miles) long at some points.
	   The government was considering declaring a national emergency
and forcing the workers back to their posts.
	   Except for shortages and strikes, the capital was also hit by
demonstrations and marches staged by high school and university
students protesting education reforms.
	   Thousands of students blocked key arteries leading into the
capital before marching to the Education Ministry in the city
center. Students have occupied nearly 300 school buildings around
Greece to protest a new law changing the system for admittance into
state universities. Teachers are also on strike.
	   As the demonstrators roared ``this law won't pass,'' the same
slogan was heard in two other parts of the city. Striking water
company employees and railroad workers staged their own protests
against government efforts to streamline public services.
	   The main labor unions also plan a nationwide general strike Dec.
15.
	   Many of the few cars left on the capital's streets were tied up
in traffic jams, while crowds at bus and trolley stops were nearly
as big as the demonstrators on the streets.
	   In an effort to end the customs strike, a judge declared the
strike illegal Wednesday. But workers refused to obey as union
leaders sought legal loopholes to bypass the ruling. Customs
workers are protesting plans to consolidate their pension fund with
other agencies.
	   According to the finance ministry, the customs strike was
costing Greece an average of eight billion drachmas (dlrs 28.3
million) a day. It said a nearly week-long strike in November cost
Greece about 100 billion drachmas (dlrs 354.6 million).
	   The Socialist government is determined not to back pedal on
proposed reforms aimed at qualify Greece for the EU single currency
group by 2001.

OSCE ministers urge peace in Kosovo, fully back monitor mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Foreign minsters of the OSCE on Thursday
urged all parties in the Kosovo conflict to seek a peaceful
solution, and gave full backing to the 2,000 monitors being sent to
the Yugoslav province in a risky mission to ease tensions.
	   The two day ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe concluded with 18 pages of declarations,
including one on the Kosovo conflict, where hundreds have died and
hundreds of thousands have fled ethnic violence.
	   ``The plight of so many people in Kosovo caught up in violent
confrontation and fleeing their homes in fear has moved us all,''
said the declaration, which was adopted by consensus. ``There is
still violence in Kosovo, and this is of deep concern to us.''
	   The OSCE is sending 2,000 unarmed monitors, in its biggest and
most dangerous mission ever, to oversee terms of a truce reached
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in October, under the
threat to NATO air strikes.
	   The ministers adopted their resolution at roughly the same as
Yugoslav border guards killed eight ethnic Albanian rebels in the
worst violation yet of that cease-fire.
	   The ministers urged Yugoslav authorities and ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo to ``stop the violence and resolved their
differences by peaceful means.''
	   ``There is a wide consensus on the importance of the OSCE
involvement in Kosovo, which represents both a challenge and an
opportunity for the OSCE,'' said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, outgoing chairman of the OSCE.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for allegedly
stirring up ethnic violence in the Balkans. Milosevic is still
widely seen as an obstacle to peace, but the ministers stopped
short of criticizing the president or his government.
	   Geremek said the declaration was reached through ``the painful,
painful act of consensus.'' He refused to discuss what was said
during the closed meeting, in which some nations were believed to
have called for sharp rebuke of Yugoslavia.
	   Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, who assumes the
OSCE's rotating chairmanship in January, said the biggest challenge
will be the Kosovo conflict, with the monitor team now at about 500
and expected to reach full strength by mid-January.
	   ``Kosovo is by far the greatest challenge this organization has
ever faced,'' he said in closing remarks to the meeting. ``A
successful mission will contribute to stability and security not
only in Kosovo, but in the entire region.''
	   Apart from Kosovo, the ministers made a series of decisions that
Geremek describing as important, but ``without breakthroughs or
sensational elements.''
	   Among the 11 issues covered in their final declaration was a
decision to move ahead with drafting a Charter on European Security
at the next years OSCE summit, which the statement said would be in
Istanbul, Turkey on Nov. 14-15, 1999. The ministers also appointed
Austria to serve as chairman in 2000.
	   Although the meeting from about 45 countries, some key countries
_ including the United States and Britain _ sent lower-ranking
delegations. Non-members including Japan and South Korea sent
observers to the meeting.

Hariri dispels rumors about ouster as Hoss begins Cabinet talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BEI-101
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Outgoing Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said
in his farewell remarks Thursday that the ``painful'' decision to
quit was his own and denied he was ousted in a political coup.
	   Hariri declined to form a government after what appeared to be a
power struggle with the new president, Emile Lahoud.
	   On Wednesday, Lahoud appointed Salim Hoss, a U.S.-educated
economist to become Lebanon's next prime minister after a majority
of the deputies in the 128-seat Parliament expressed their support
for him.
	   Hoss spent Thursday discussing with legislators about the makeup
of his Cabinet, which is expected to be formed early next week.
	   Rumors, fueled by Hariri's sudden and surprise departure,
suggested that the premier may have lost a power struggle to the
assertive Lahoud, the 62-year-old army commander who was
unanimously elected president by Parliament in October and took
office Nov. 24.
	   But at a news conference Thursday, Hariri, who had been certain
to be re-named as prime minister, said he bowed out because of what
he described was the president's violation of constitutional rules
in naming him as premier.
	   ``It was a painful decision but the right one,'' Hariri told
reporters, dismissing the rumors that he was forced out by Lahoud
and his political foe, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   ``I am out of the government by my own will,'' he stressed.
	   He said he had even prepared an acceptance speech, lending some
credence to the speculations that he was pushed out.
	   Lahoud had initially been inclined to re-appoint Hariri, the
billionaire businessman who had been prime minister since 1992.
	   Hariri even had the majority support of legislators but not the
overwhelming margin he had enjoyed in the past because 31 of the
128 legislators left it to the president to decide, precipitating
the feud.
	   Hariri has maintained that the lawmakers must present a
candidate's name to the head of state because ``we should not put
the president in a position where he can be part'' of political
bargaining.
	   Under former President Elias Hrawi, whose term ended Nov. 24,
Hariri had virtually run the country.
	   As the architect of the multibillion dollar drive to rebuild the
country from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war, Hariri is
credited with restoring economic confidence and attracting
investment to this small Arab country.
	   On Thursday, the 53-year-old Hariri took pride in his work over
the past six years, saying he was leaving office with his
``conscience clear'' and stressing that the achievements made were
a ``precious trust'' in the hands of the new government.
	   With his advisers present, the prime minister said he will
continue to serve the nation as a member of the legislature and
head of a political bloc in Parliament.
	   Hoss, in his acceptance speech Wednesday, sought to calm fears
that Hariri's departure would undermine the reconstruction program
or devalue the currency.
	   He said his government would honor contracts signed but will
execute ``austerity to the extreme'' in government spending.
	   Hariri said Thursday that he was pleased with Hoss' remarks but

Ambassador designate outlines priorities

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador designate John
Shattuck singled out security and the rule of law Thursday as his
chief priorities while serving as Washington's envoy to the Czech
Republic.
	   Shattuck, the State Department's top human rights official who
pushed to prosecute war criminals in Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia, is due to submit his credentials to President Vaclav
Havel on Dec. 10. He succeeds Ambassador Jenone Walker.
	   ``At the moment the issues of NATO accession are dominating...it
is a very important process that is underway,'' Shattuck said.
	   He confirmed the Czech Republic together with Poland and Hungary
are on track for NATO membership at the alliance's summit in
Washington in April next year.
	   Shattuck said security issues were his number one priority as
Czechs are about to share NATO's privileges and responsibilities.
	   ``Issues of security involve law-enforcement and the protection
of Czech people and Americans from crime and from terrorism,'' he
said.
	   Economic prosperity and reforms were also mentioned as crucial
in U.S.-Czech relations.
	   ``Continued market reforms are very important especially in the
banking and industrial sectors and the capital markets,'' Shattuck
said.
	   He also singled out corruption as a danger to fledgling
democracies.
	   ``The rule of law is essential...corruption can eat at the heart
of democracy,'' Shattuck said.
	   For years a human rights official, Shattuck also voiced his
concerns over civil rights abuses in the Czech Republic.
	   At least 20 Gypsies have been killed in racially motivated
attacks after the demise of Communism in 1989.
	   ``We are concerned about the violence by those who preach hate
and we have to send a strong signal of unacceptability of these
attacks by skinheads and others,'' Shattuck said.

Two-division format approved in radical move
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the most radical change in the 109-year history
of English county cricket, the 18 teams agreed Thursday to
introduce a two-division championship starting in 2000.
	   The proposal, rejected last year, was approved this time by the
First Class Forum with 15 votes in favor, two against and two
abstentions.
	   Under the plan, there will be two divisions of nine teams each,
with a soccer-style promotion and relegation system.
	   The top nine teams in next year's championship will play in the
top tier division in 2000, with the remainder in the lower tier.
	   Counties will play the other eight teams in their divisions on a
home and away basis in 16 four-day matches, with three promoted and
three relegated.
	   It's the first major change in the structure of county cricket
since the competition began in 1890.
	   The move is designed to improve the quality of first-class
cricket and make England more competitive on an international
level.
	   ``This is an historic day for cricket in England and Wales,''
said Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the England Cricket Board. ``We
can raise the profile of the game and improve the quality of the
players by making this change and I'm confident that Team England
will benefit from the introduction of a harder edged competition.''
	   The vote comes just three days after England's seven-wicket
defeat to Australia in the second Test of the Ashes series. The
result, which came after England was saved from defeat by a
thunderstorm in the first Test, offered further proof that England
is no longer a world power in the sport it invented and is falling
further behind the top nations.
	   ``There is a universal belief in the game that we need to narrow
the gap in standard between the four-day domestic game and Test
match cricket,'' ECB chief executive Tim Lamb said. ``By
introducing a two-division format and continuing with the ECB's
range of coaching and development initiatives, we will start to
effectively close that gap.
	   ``I am sure that greater competitiveness will also raise the
level of media and public interest and encourage more spectators to
come to county championship matches.''
	   The ECB said all teams will be treated equally in terms of
financial distribution, voting rights and registration rules. That
means teams in the lower division will not lose out on vital cash
and there will be no free-for-all in the movement of players to the
more attractive sides.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The U.N. World Food
Program has granted Ethiopia dlrs 94.8 million in
development assistance.
	   In an agreement signed Wednesday between the
government and WFP, dlrs 90.2 million of the grant will be
used to provide 215,817 tons of food assistance. The
remainder, dlrs 4.6 million, will be used for training,
technical equipment, and monitoring and evaluation.
	   ``The agreement provides a framework for community
participation in Ethiopia's development efforts by
allowing individuals and communities to rank their needs
and propose their solutions,'' said WFP country director
Judith Lewis. 
	   The agreement also will provide meals in schools and
aims to alleviate poverty in cities, helping 130,000
primary school students in four regions and 60,000 women
in the capital.
	   ``We want to tackle food insecurity issues before they
reach crisis level,'' said Stephen Anderson, WFP's
development coordinator in Ethiopia.
	   Mulatu Teshome Ethiopian, deputy minister of economic
development and cooperation, said the grant will support
the government's efforts to attain food self-sufficiency,
and to alleviate the chronic poverty in the country.

Snow-less Spaniards stage dog race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZARAGOZA, Spain (AP) _ A dog team race without snow?
	   Yes, 35 mushers will set off Saturday with dog teams pulling
carts or bicycles.
	   The four-day race will take them across 200 kilometers (120
miles) of Los Monegros, a largely flat, semi-desert expanse in the
Aragon region of northeast Spain.
	   The dogs _ huskies, malamutes and Samoyeds _ will pull
four-wheeled carts built especially for the event.
	   ``There are no sleds because there is no snow,'' said Rafael
Arnaiz, a spokesman for the regional tourism office.
	   There are three categories of teams: carts with six to 12 dogs,
carts with two to five, and bicycles with one to three. The largest
of the modern-day chariots are about three meters long (10 feet)
and 1.5 meters (five feet) wide.
	   Drivers get a map and a compass and that's it.
	   ``The terrain is so uniform that the hardest part is not getting
lost,'' Arnaiz said.
	   The winners in each category will get a ceramic trophy.
	   The Aragon government has staged the race for the last six years
as a promotional event to boost tourism in Los Monegros.

European defense identity on agenda at Anglo-French summit

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with agreement to be signed on crisis management,
military operations &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French and British leaders were beginning a two-day
summit meeting Thursday evening that seeks to give Europe more
military muscle and resolve to counterbalance U.S. power.
	   The European Union, sensitive to criticism that it reacts too
slowly and in disjointed fashion to crises such as Kosovo, is
seeking to forge a new defense identity.
	   France is pushing for an independent European defense, starting
with a European pillar within NATO. But Britain insists NATO must
remain the cornerstone of defense and security.
	   ``At stake is the European Union's ability to have the political
and strategic leadership necessary to conduct military operations,
including with NATO,'' said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   ``So it must have a framework to help it make decisions, and the
capacity for action.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were to attend the talks,
beginning Thursday evening and lasting until noon on Friday, in the
Britanny port town of Saint Malo.
	   Topics to be discussed include EU tax levels, small business,
and cooperation in Africa, where both countries have former
colonies.
	   But defense and security were expected to dominate.
	   Blair is being accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott, Chancellor Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and
Defense Secretary George Robertson.
	   France will be also be represented by Defense Minister Alain
Richard and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Officials met in Paris Wednesday for three hours to discuss
defense.
	   Britain's Defense Ministry said Thursday that Robertson and
Richard will sign an agreement Friday allowing for better
cooperation in crisis management and military operations.
	   ``This agreement is a major and practical step towards
strengthening Europe's defense capability,'' Robertson said.
	   Britain and France, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security
Council members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of
the European Union.
	   But both now recognize the need for Europe to cope militarily
when the United States does not get involved in crises.
	   Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish
the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to
merge it into the European Union.
	   The summit comes on the heels of a Franco-German summit earlier
this week in Potsdam.
	   French officials say the summit, unprecedented in terms of the
number of officials attending, is the result of a change in British
policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor Party took over from the
Conservative Party in May 1997.
	   On Thursday, the newspaper Ouest-France published a special
supplement on the summit in both French and English and headlined:
``Welcome to Saint-Malo.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government needs to come up with a
more detailed economic recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today, just a day after the International Monetary
Fund chief left without promising Moscow any new loans.
	   Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis program, but
the measures have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor
have they found favor with the IMF or other international lenders
who have frozen loans to Russia.
	   Primakov acknowledged the need to spell out the government's
intentions more clearly and called on the Cabinet to do so.
	   ``Without such a concrete action plan, containing concrete tasks
and time frames, the government's steps will look merely like
intentions,'' Primakov said.
	   IMF chief Michel Camdessus left Russia on Wednesday after
meeting with Primakov and other top officials. He praised
Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis, but
said an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on loans.
	   The IMF organized a $22.6 billion bailout package this summer,
but only about $5 billion was disbursed before Russia's economic
crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen.
	   The IMF has indicated that Russia's draft budget for next year
appears overly optimistic, and it also does not like moves to
increase the government's role in the economy.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said the new plan
envisages drafting more than 80 bills in the next two months to
help revive the moribund economy.
	   They will detail the government's intentions to subsidize some
key industries, pay off wage and pension debts, index some incomes,
restructure the banking system and tighten currency controls, he
said.
	   Some of these measures have been criticized by the IMF, but
Shapovalyants said he hoped that will not prove a stumbling block
to securing the loans. He added that Russia continues to count on
IMF loans as it drafts next year's budget.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed out at the
IMF for refusing to release loans.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as
speaker for the State Duma, parliament's lower house. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay off its
debts and then refuse to take any more loans. ``It's high time to
take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he told reporters.
	   In other economic developments today:
	   _ Inflation was up 5.7 percent in November, compared to 4.5
percent in October, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September
in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. However, inflation is up
about 70 percent compared to last December, Central Bank chief
Viktor Gerashchenko said.
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves dropped by $200 million in the
last week of November and stood at $12.8 billion on Nov. 27, the
Central Bank said today.

Vandals destroy gravestones in Jewish cemetery

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 60 graves destroyed, president comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Vandals knocked over and shattered 60
gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in the Georgian capital Thursday,
authorities said.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the act, and police said
they were investigating. It was the second such incident at a
Jewish cemetery in Tbilisi in recent years.
	   Georgia's chief rabbi, Ariel Levin, denounced the ``barbarous
act,'' which he said was carried out by someone ``with provocative
goals.''
	   However, he added, ``Nobody will be able to cast a pall over
good and fraternal relations between Georgians and Jews, which have
existed for more than 26 centuries now.''
	   Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze echoed the rabbi's words,
saying: For Georgia this is not only inadmissible but is also
unheard of. ... Last fall we celebrated 26 centuries of peaceful
coexistence.''
	   Shevardnadze ordered police to tighten security at the cemetery
and urged a quick, thorough investigation, according to
presidential spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze.

British chief expresses doubts on German proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The new president of Britain's governing body of
track and field expressed reservations Thursday about a German
proposal to scrap all existing world records because many are
tainted by suspicions of drug use.
	   David Hemery, elected the first president of UK Athletics two
weeks ago, is flying to Frankfurt on Friday for a meeting of the
European Athletic Association.
	   Hemery, former Olympic champion and world record-holder in the
400 meter hurdles, said he wants to talks with his German
counterpart about his proposal to start afresh with a new world
record list in 2000.
	   Digel, president of the German federation (DLV), believes the
shadow of drugs hangs over long-standing records _ some set during
the 1980s at a time of systematic doping in Eastern Bloc countries.
	   Digel wants the world governing body, the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, to vote on the proposal at its congress next
August before the world championships in Seville, Spain.
	   But Hemery, who advocates tough anti-doping measures, believes
Digel's plan may be off the mark.
	   ``I am open minded and want to listen to the proposals, but the
caution I have is that it almost implies every record is tainted
before that date,'' Hemery was quoted as saying in The Times.
``That, for me, would be unjust. A second implication is that by
2000 we would have in place absolute certainty that everything from
then on was clean. That, also, is unrealistic. ...
	   ``We can not hold up our hands and say, after the clean-sheet
start, that records are undoubtedly going to be clean.''
	   Digel's proposal has also failed to win the support of IAAF
president Primo Nebiolo.
	   ``This is a fascinating idea but I don't think it's realistic,''
Nebiolo said in an interview with The Associated Press last month.
``How can you tell Michael Johnson you are canceling his world
record of 19.32 seconds in the 200? How can you do this?''

Church agency denies labor dispute caused Somali fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Swedish church aid agency denied
Thursday that a labor dispute involving its workers led to fighting
that killed at least 60 people in a southwestern Somalia town.
	   Fighting in Sakow erupted Nov. 15 because of a dispute over the
sharing of a levy at a roadblock normally mounted by militiamen
belonging to two subclans, Swedish Church Relief said.
	   The church group said the division of the tariffs among the
subclans as well as the number of employees and contracts that go
to each are agreed on by elders and the Sakow district committee,
without the participation of the SRC.
	   ``Reports concerning labor equity being the cause of the latest
fighting are false,'' the church group said in a statement.
	   It said there were reports of widespread looting in Sakow, 380
kilometers (240 miles) southwest of Mogadishu, during the fighting,
but the church group's compound was protected by a joint force of
militiamen from the warring subclans.
	   The church group said the warring Geldle and Maclinwein subclans
of the Rahanwein clan agreed on a cease-fire Monday, and Tuesday a
55-member peace committee was formed.
	   On Thursday, negotiations were underway on a venue for peace
negotiations, the agency said.
	   Since Somalia descended into civil war after the ouster of
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, militiamen loyal to clans or
subclans have carved out territories. Squabbles over jobs and
contracts from aid agencies often lead to shootouts.

Farmers protest government policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Despite frigid weather, several thousand
farmers from across Poland gathered Thursday in downtown Warsaw to
demand government protection for farms and fewer imports.
	   The farmers, with banners reading ``Polish bread from Polish
grain'' and ``Polish authorities betray farmers,'' demanded
government guarantees their products will be bought and more
spending on agriculture in the draft budget for 1999.
	   Farmers carried an effigy of Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz, a stringent supporter of fiscal discipline, who they
blame for what they call insufficient spending on agriculture. Some
protesters beat the effigy with rods.
	   Balcerowicz introduced so-called ``shock therapy'' measures
promoting market-led reforms after communist rule ended in 1989.
The reforms have included a reduction in state subsidies for Polish
agriculture products.
	   A government statement expressed surprise that farmers organized
the protest a day before scheduled talks between farmers and
agriculture ministry officials,
	   Farmers have repeatedly demonstrated throughout Poland,
sometimes blocking roads and border crossings, to protest grain
imports and low prices for Polish-grown products.
	   Poland's agriculture sector is considered inefficient and
ill-equipped, and analysts say the industry needs major reforms in
preparation for the country's bid to join the European Union.
	   But the powerful 4-million-strong farm lobby has resisted
reforms, fearing a shift from small, family-owned farms to large
farming conglomerates will force many people to give up
agriculture.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africans trekked in the
rain to voter registration stations Thursday but washed-out roads
and other problems hampered the nation's attempt to create its
first all-race voters list.
	   The massive registration effort in the southern half of the
country is seen as a test of the Independent Electoral Commission's
ability to hold free and fair elections next year _ only the second
since the end of white rule.
	   Problems also plagued the registration for 12.7 million
potential voters in South Africa's five northern provinces last
weekend, with voters including President Nelson Mandela having been
directed to the wrong sites. About one-third of potential voters in
the north registered, IEC chairman Johann Kriegler told reporters.
	   The process appeared smoother Thursday as it began in the
southern half of the country.
	   Marthinus van Schalkwyk, the leader of the National Party which
ruled during apartheid, said as he registered in Cape Town: ``It
seems as if the Independent Electoral Commission has done its
homework in this province.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ The deputy leader of Conservatives in the House of
Lords resigned Thursday in a rebellion against Tory leader William
Hague, in a dispute centering on the government's plan to abolish
hereditary peers.
	   Lord Fraser of Carmyllie said he was ``disgusted and appalled''
at Hague's decision Wednesday to dismiss Lord Cranborne as Tory
leader in the Lords. Later in the day, three other members of the
Tory leadership team _ Lord Bowness, Lord Pilkington and the Earl
of Home _ also resigned.

 &UR; Syria's ruling coalition wins expected majority in parliament

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria's ruling coalition, the National
Progressive Front, as expected won the majority of seats in the
250-member Parliament, the government announced Thursday.
	   The front, led by the Baath Party of President Hafez Assad, can
win up to 167 seats in the Parliament, and Interior Minister
Mohammed Harba announced it won its full allotment.
	   He said 7.1 million people, or nearly 82 per cent of the more
than 8 million eligible voters, cast ballots Monday and Tuesday. He
said the elections took place in a ``quiet ... and democratic
atmosphere'' and called the turnout ``distinguished.''
	   Voting was repeated in one polling station at Deir al-Zour in
eastern Syria after a ballot box was found to contain more votes
than registered voters, Harba told a news conference.
	   The National Assembly, or parliament, has limited legislative
power, with effective control held by Assad, who came to power in a
bloodless coup in 1970.
	   Five of Syria's most powerful businessmen won seats running as
independents. The private sector hopes to gain more say in the new
parliament, following government efforts to encourage more private
investment.
	   Twenty-six women were among winning candidates, compared to 24
who held seats in the last parliament, Harba said.
	   The control of seats was the same in the previous four-year
term, which ended in September. The Baath got 135 seats, and 32
went to the six allied parties. Independents make up the remaining
83 seats.
	   Among seats held by the National Progressive Front, 51 percent
are controlled by workers and peasants, who form the backbone of
the Baath party, in power since 1963.
	   Some 7,350 candidates ran in the elections.

Duisenberg: labor market reform, not interest rates, key to
</HEADLINE>
job-creation

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg on Thursday suggested governments should reform rigid
labor markets to create jobs rather than pressure him into cutting
interest rates.
	   ``The high unemployment rate in Europe is far more the
consequence of structural rigidities within the European labor and
product markets than a result of adverse cyclical developments,''
Duisenberg said in a speech.
	   Duisenberg has been under pressure from the left-leaning French
and German governments to lower rates when his bank takes over
monetary policy for the 11 nations that adopt the euro currency on
Jan. 1.
	   Speaking to European business and labor representatives,
Duisenberg said the ECB would do ``its utmost'' to help solve the
euro-zone's unemployment problem, but he insisted the bank's role
was ``very limited.''
	   In another message to European governments he stressed that
successful monetary policy must be supported by sound fiscal
policies and responsible wage settlements.
	   With inflation in the euro-zone nations at just 1 percent, and
unemployment stubbornly high at 10.9 percent, governments are
urging Duisenberg to boost business by setting lower rates.
	   He says the bank will resist political pressure, pointing out
that rates in the EU's core-economies are already low. The ECB is
expected to set the benchmark rate in the euro-zone close to
Germany's 3.3 rate.
	   Answering questions after his speech, Duisenberg stressed price
stability would be the main factor dictating ECB monetary policy,
but that currency exchange rates would also play a role.
	   He said exchange rate of the euro against the dollar will be
``one of a broad range of indices'' that will help the bank shape
policy.
	   ``We aren't concerned at present about the level of the euro
against the dollar,'' he said. ``What will be a concern is the
volatility, not the levels as such?''
	   Duisenberg said the ECB's focus on price stability matches that
of its U.S. counterpart the Federal Reserve.

Top general instigated executions of thousands, indictment says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A top Bosnian Serb general
arrested by NATO troops on genocide charges guided the soldiers who
massacred thousands of Muslims and dumped them in mass graves, his
U.N. indictment revealed Thursday.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic, seized by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force on Wednesday, was secretly indicted on six
counts, including genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions and crimes against humanity.
	   Krstic is the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be
arrested for U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges. He was
arrested without incident in a section of northern Bosnia
controlled by U.S. troops.
	   Krstic was expected to arrive Thursday at the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal's high-security holding cell outside The Hague. The
date of his arraignment, which will be his first appearance in
court, has not been announced.
	   Offenses allegedly committed by his troops occurred following
the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N. so-called ``safe haven'' of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, where thousands of
Muslims were massacred.
	   According to his indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most of the members of the Bosnian Muslim population of
the Srebrenica enclave, using automatic weapons, hand grenades and
other weaponry.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October. It was kept secret so he wouldn't be prompted to flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic, who held the rank of general-major during the Srebrenica
operation, is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic _ the tribunal's top two suspects _
also have been indicted on genocide charges for allegedly
orchestrating the massacres at Srebrenica. Both remain at large.
	   Krstic was the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Two more victims of Poland's prolonged
cold front were found Thursday, raising the death toll from more
than two weeks of freezing temperatures to at least 74.
	   Police said a 40-year-old man was found frozen to death in
central Poland on Thursday morning. Most victims have been men who
passed out from drinking and homeless people.
	   The cold front arrived on Nov. 16 with temperatures dipping as
low as minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). It already has
claimed 20 more lives than the number of cold-related deaths all of
last winter, police say.

EOHR freezes activities after government detains leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with second statement of support. &QL; 
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's largest human rights group announced
Thursday that it was suspending its activities because of a
government campaign that ``aims to terrorize the organization and
eliminate its role.''
	   The decision was made at a Wednesday night meeting of the
15-member board of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights.
	   The announcement came two days after Egyptian security officials
detained the group's secretary-general, Hafez Abu Saada, on grounds
he accepted a donation from the British government without Egyptian
government approval. He can be held for 15 days for investigation.
	   The statement said the board decided to ``freeze the
activities'' of the organization ``in all parts of the republic.''
	   This means the EOHR won't send investigators into the field and
will not issue any public statements on human rights cases, the
board decided. If citizens come with complaints, they will be
referred to other human rights groups, it said.
	   Also Thursday, the Land Center for Human Rights, which deals
with property disputes, charged in a statement that the
government's campaign against the EOHR ``aims to weaken the human
rights movement in Egypt.''
	   The Land Center urged authorities to release Abu Saada, saying
his detention is ``part of a campaign aiming to terrorize people
working in the human rights field.''
	   Meanwhile, the Cairo-headquartered Arab Center for the
Independence of the Judiciary issued a statement charging that the
government was targeting the human rights movement ``to threaten
its very existence.''
	   The Arab Center expressed concern that Egyptian police would not
disclose where Abu Saada was being detained and interrogated.
	   The government to date has refused to register a single Egyptian
human rights group, putting them in the precarious position of
operating without the status of officially approved
non-governmental organizations.
	   The donation of dlrs 25,703 from a British Parliament committee
to the EOHR became the subject of controversy after an Egyptian
weekly, Al-Osboa, alleged last month that it was ``payment'' for a
report charging that Egyptian police had arrested and tortured
hundreds of Coptic Christians in a criminal investigation in
August.
	   Al-Osboa has close ties to the Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for internal security in Egypt. The government has
denied the torture allegations.
	   In its announcement, the board said it believed the government
was trying to stop human rights work in Egypt.
	   ``This campaign aims to terrorize the organization and eliminate
its role in protecting human rights and revealing these violations
sincerely and faithfully,'' the statement said.
	   The statement said the board would pursue the release of Abu
Saada and would continue to communicate with local and
international human rights groups.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In defiance of the United States, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday he wouldn't back down
from a decision to suspend the Wye River peace agreement over what
he says are a series of Palestinian violations.
	   ``We are not to be made fools,'' said an angry Netanyahu, who
won unanimous backing from his Cabinet ministers after they viewed
footage of an attack on an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian mob.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation of the
land-for-peace deal once Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly
dropped plans to announce a state in May and accepted Israel's
criteria for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   Israel has said it will not free those involved in attacks that
resulted in death or injury. The Palestinians demand that Israel
free prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The Palestinians appealed to the United States for help and
Arafat said Thursday that Netanyahu is ``violating completely'' the
Wye agreement.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin rejected the Israeli
conditions, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   In three Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem on Thursday,
Palestinians threw stones at police and Israeli motorists. Six
Israeli police officers and two Israeli civilians were injured by
rocks and a Palestinian was struck by a rubber bullet fired by
police to disperse stone throwers on the Mount of Olives.
	   In the main clash on Salah Eddin Street, the main thoroughfare
of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, undercover policemen wearing
checkered Arab headdresses drove up to a crowd of stone throwers in
a white van, jumped out, fired in the air and arrested four
Palestinians. In all, 18 Palestinians were arrested.
	   The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the peace
accord. The White House said the Clinton trip was still on.
	   In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel
is to release 250 more Palestinian prisoners.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation with the
Palestinians has helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition.
	   In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend the Wye
agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said they would not
support an early elections bill as initially planned.
	   The legislation was to have come before parliament Monday, but
its sponsors said they might delay the vote because they no longer
have a majority.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   Early Thursday, a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian
laborers from the Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they
were investigating whether the arsonists had political motives. The
laborers escaped unharmed.
	   After the stabbing, about 150 Palestinian university students,
many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march in
Ramallah to press for prisoner releases.
	   The group then marched to the outskirts of town to throw stones
at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier was riding in.
	   Netanyahu said the incident was ``organized, orchestrated,
planned in advance and fomented by the Palestinian Authority.''
	   However, Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank,
said the incident was triggered by growing anger over Israel's
handling of the prisoner issue.
	   ``In clashes, rocks are thrown,'' Barghouti said. ``This car
stopped with the soldier and they took his weapon. It was later
returned. They did not use it to kill.''
	   After the attack, Netanyahu convened his so-called security
Cabinet and played a videotape of the incident.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the
Cabinet room was tense during the screening and that those present
decided unanimously afterward to hold up the accord.
	   Palestinian security forces have not arrested any of the rioters
involved in the attack, a senior official said. On Wednesday
evening, the soldier's M-16 assault rifle was handed to the
governor of Ramallah, but none of those making the delivery were
questioned or detained.

Medical tests point to doping at TVM

<TEXT>
	   REIMS, France (AP) _ Medical tests suggest that cyclists on the
TVM team took banned drugs during the Tour de France, judicial
sources said Thursday.
	   The results came to light as Odile Madrolle, the judge
investigating the Dutch team, called seven cyclists to a Reims
court for questioning over the affair.
	   Madrolle interviewed Dutchmen Joroen Blijlevens, Tristan
Hoffmann, Servais Knaven and Bart Voskamp, Belgium's Hendrick van
Dijk and Peter van Petegem, and Sergei Outschakov of Ukraine.
	   TVM withdrew from the Tour de France during the race, saying
that police tactics made it impossible for its riders to compete.
	   But judicial sources, citing the results of medical tests taken
during the Tour, said that four cyclists took EPO _ one of whom
also took both amphetamines and cannabis _ and others had traces of
corticoides.
	   The medical tests could prove crucial in the case against TVM,
as officials and cyclists all deny the use of banned substances.
	   At Festina, the team thrown out of the Tour de France, officials
admitted to the use of EPO, though some cyclists still deny that
they knowingly took any banned substances.
	   French customs authorities found banned substances in a TVM team
van back in March, but the discovery only became public in July,
after the doping controversy that saw the expulsion of Festina.
	   During the tour, police found more evidence suggesting the use
of banned drugs in a hotel trash can used by the TVM team.
	   Two TVM officials, sporting director Cees Priem and doctor
Andrei Mikhailov, have since been placed under formal investigation
by French authorities, one step short of being formally charged.

Swiss airline's operating license suspended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's transport ministry
Thursday suspended the operating license of newcomer Swiss World
Airways, which has halted flights just three months after taking to
the skies.
	   SWA, which started flying from Geneva to Newark, New Jersey, in
September, suspended flights until further notice Wednesday and
announced it was applying to defer its payments.
	   It had been operating six return flights a week with its single
Boeing 767 jet.
	   State authorities in western Switzerland and private investors
helped finance the airline, whose launch followed months of
bureaucratic and financial delays.
	   The airline said last week it needed 3 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 2.15 million) immediately to keep flying. Geneva state
authorities on Monday refused to bail SWA out.
	   Western Swiss states had invested almost 7 million francs (dlrs
5 million) in the transatlantic newcomer. The suspension of
operations left more than 100 staff without work.
	   SWA was founded in 1996 following national flag carrier
Swissair's controversial decision to cut costs by transferring most
long-haul flights to Zurich. The move caused outrage among the
French-speaking population of western Switzerland.
	   Swissair still operates a daily return flight between Geneva and
New York.
	   SWA had planned to operate its first flight last December, but
delays in sorting out contractual issues prevented it getting
government clearance. Its license was initially valid for one year.

Security agent convicted of shooting at subordinate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior Russian intelligence officer has been
convicted of badly wounding his subordinate while shooting at a
glass placed on top of his head, news reports said Thursday.
	   The incident happened several months ago when a young agent
asked Lt. Col. Vladimir Popov, the head of the Federal Security
Service branch in the Evenkia region of central Siberia, to send
him on a mission to some of Russia's more volatile regions. The
Federal Security Service, or FSB, is the main successor to the
Soviet KGB.
	   Popov, who was drunk at the time, said he should test the
officer first. He placed a glass on his head, took out his service
pistol and opened fire. After the first shot, the agent asked Popov
to stop and test somebody else.
	   Popov ignored his plea and the next bullet ricocheted from the
wall into the agent's head, badly wounding him. The young officer
has become an invalid and had to quit the service, the daily
Kommersant reported.
	   Facing a military court in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk on
Wednesday, Popov said he regretted his action but insisted he was
an excellent marksman and wounded his subordinate by accident.
	   The court sentenced Popov to 2 1/2 years in prison and ordered
him to pay his subordinate 30,000 rubles (dlrs 1,600) in damage.
The reports did not give the younger officer's name.
	   Shootings, suicides and other fatal accidents have become
increasingly common in the cash-strapped and demoralized Russian
military and security services.
	   Kommersant quoted military prosecutors as saying that FSB
officials are trying to hush up most of the incidents. ``Only the
most notorious cases usually become known,'' it said.
	   Last month, prosecutors in the Ural Mountains city of
Chelyabinsk launched criminal proceedings against three FSB
officers who detained a local man on suspicion of having a forged
passport and put him in the trunk of their car.
	   The agents were allegedly drunk and forgot about the man,
driving around in temperatures of -30 degrees C (-22 F). The man
nearly froze to death before they finally remembered he was there.
	   Another FSB officer in Chelyabinsk was recently stabbed to death
by his 19-year-old son when he was harassing his family while
drunk, police said.
	   There were no immediate comments Thursday from FSB officials.

Barcelona in crisis and Real Madrid in intercontinental heaven
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Much more than just a league match, FC
Barcelona's game Saturday against Deportivo La Coruna could prove
decisive for Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal.
	   ``Van Gaal knows his head could roll, and the team knows that
there is much more at stake than just a result,'' the
Barcelona-based daily El Mundo Deportivo said Thursday about the
13th-round match.
	   Upset at being knocked out of European soccer at an
embarrassingly early stage, and languishing in fifth place in the
domestic league, Barcelona fans are calling for Van Gaal's head.
	   Sports dailies reported that the dour coach on Tuesday pleaded
with the players to help him stay in his job by doing their best
against Deportivo.
	   Relatively humble Deportivo sits at No. 4 in the table with 20
points, two points behind leader Mallorca and one above No. 5
Barcelona.
	   Meanwhile, the imminent return of team captain Pep Guardiola
after more than a year out of action through injury is being
treated as a glimmer of hope within the Barcelona crisis.
	   ``Guardiola carries the heavy load of savior,'' wrote La
Vanguardia Thursday.
	   It pointed to the midfielder's reputation for team play and his
status as the only link to Johan Cruyff's ``dream team'' that won
the European Cup and three consecutive league championships.
	   ``If the fans want to ask me for the moon, let them ask for it.
I am not a magic solution but I will do my best,'' said Guardiola,
one of Spain's most respected internationals.
	   In the meantime, El Mundo Deportivo published an unconfirmed
report that club chairman Jose Luis Nunez is thinking of hiring
Italian coach Fabio Capello to replace Van Gaal.
	   The paper said a three-year pre-contract already exists that if
firmed up would be worth 500 million pesetas (dlrs 3.5 million) a
year to Capello.
	   Real Madrid, the other traditional powerhouse of Spanish soccer,
also plays away from home on Saturday, against lower-half Espanyol.
	   Although Madrid is also struggling in the domestic league,
currently four points behind the leader at No. 8, the team is
euphoric with Tuesday's 2-1 victory in Tokyo over Brazilian team
Vasco da Gama to claim the Intercontinental Cup.
	   ``We needed this great victory,'' Raul Gonzalez, scorer of the
class goal that won Madrid the game, told the state-owned news
agency EFE Thursday.
	   ``We had had many defeats and a lot of criticism and we were not
receiving the respect we deserve,'' the born-again golden boy of
Spanish soccer said.
	   Also in action Saturday are first-placed Mallorca, second-placed
Celta and third-placed Celta.
	   Mallorca plays at home against Betis. Leading the table with 22
points, Mallorca heads the list of relatively humble clubs who this
season have wiped some of the shine off the superteams.
	   But Betis could prove a tough rival with team confidence growing
as it overcomes a dismal start to the season by moving from bottom
place to No. 9, despite being joint bottom scorer with only eight
goals.
	   Fresh from its 1-0 triumph over Barcelona last week,
third-placed Atletico de Madrid hosts Athletic de Bilbao. The
latter, like Barcelona, is also celebrating its 100th anniversary
this year with a disappointing season.
	   Celta, meanwhile, travels to play lower-half Salamanca in search
of the victory that could mean snatching the No. 1 spot from
Mallorca.
	   Saturday's only other game pits mid-table Real Sociedad against
struggling Extremadura.
	   Sunday wraps up the 13th-round sending No. 6 Valencia away to
play division newcomer Alaves, last-placed Tenerife at home to No.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Two more victims of Poland's prolonged
cold front were found Thursday, raising the death toll from more
than two weeks of freezing temperatures to at least 74.
	   Police said a 40-year-old man was found frozen to death in
central Poland on Thursday morning. Most victims have been men who
passed out from drinking and homeless people.
	   The cold front arrived on Nov. 16 with temperatures dipping as
low as minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). It already has
claimed 20 more lives than the number of cold-related deaths all of
last winter, police say.

	   REIMS, France (AP) _ Four cyclists from the TVM team took EPO
and other banned drugs during the Tour de France, judicial sources
said Thursday.
	   The results came to light as Odile Madrolle, the judge
investigating the Dutch team, called seven cyclists to a Reims
court for questioning over the affair.
	   Madrolle interviewed Dutchmen Joroen Blijlevens, Tristan
Hoffmann, Servais Knaven and Bart Voskamp, Belgium's Hendrick van
Dijk and Peter van Petegem, and Sergei Outschakov of Ukraine.
	   TVM withdrew from the Tour de France during the race, saying
that police tactics made it impossible for its riders to compete.
	   But judicial sources, citing the results of medical tests taken
during the Tour, said that four cyclists took EPO _ one of whom
also took both amphetamines and cannabis _ and others had traces of
corticoides.
	   The four cyclists were not identified.

Top international official sets goals for next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Ahead of an international
conference on peace in Bosnia, the top international official in
the country Thursday announced his goals for the new year: to make
peace self-sustaining and to prepare the country to live without
foreign aid.
	   The Peace Implementation Council that will meet Dec. 10 in
Madrid, Spain, should send a clear signal to Bosnian leaders that
international assistance in implementing peace accords is at its
height, and will begin diminishing after 1999, said Simon Haselock,
the spokesman for Carlos Westendorp, the top international official
in Bosnia.
	   ``Its leaders must use the time that remains to prepare their
country for a life without foreign aid,'' he said.
	   Westendorp is convinced that ``any exit strategy of the
international community from Bosnia-Herzegovina must be accompanied
by an entry strategy for Bosnia-Herzegovina into European
institutions,'' like the Council of Europe and the European Union,
Haselock said.
	   To accomplish this, local and international leaders must work to
strengthen Bosnia's free-market economy, develop political
institutions and the rule of law, and bolster ties with Europe,
Haselock said.
	   Next year's priorities also will include a dramatic push for the
return of refugees and making Bosnia ``a country fit for the
returnees to live in,'' he said.
	   In 1996, Bosnia received dlrs 5.1 billion in reconstruction aid,
and dlrs 1 billion remains to be spent in 1999.
	   Asked how far the country has come since the Dayton peace
agreement was signed in late 1995, Haselock said it was a matter of
``looking at the bottle being half-empty or half-full. ... I would
say we have come more then half the way.''
	   While political structures have been established, work still
needs to be done to ensure they function properly, he said.

Report: bomb in western Algeria kills 14, injures 24
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that 19 other people killed in recent attacks, background
on visit by U.N. Secretary General

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A bomb exploded at a market in western Algeria on
Thursday, killing 14 people and injuring 24 others, French radio
reported.
	   The explosion occurred shortly before midday in Khemis Miliana,
about 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of Algiers, France Info radio
reported.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm the attack, and no
further details were available.
	   If confirmed, it would be the sixth violent attack in a week, a
week that saw the visit of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins this year on Dec.
20, has been marred by waves of violence since the insurgency
began. This year has proved no exception.
	   Twelve villagers were slaughtered in their sleep in a massacre
early Wednesday. Algerian security forces immediately launched a
search for the armed attackers in the Sidi Rached region about 60
miles west of Algiers.
	   The attack on the villagers came as Annan met with Algerian
President Liamine Zeroual, on a visit aimed at ending the conflict
in the Western Sahara.
	   On Sunday, officials said four attacks in the western mountains
of Algeria had left seven people dead.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in an insurgency that erupted
when Algeria's military-backed government canceled January 1992
elections that an Islamic fundamentalist group, the Islamic
Salvation Front, was poised to win.

Israel suspends troop withdrawal after attack on Israeli soldier

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In defiance of the United States, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday he will not back down
from a decision to suspend the Wye River peace agreement over what
he says are a series of Palestinian violations.
	   ``We are not to be made fools,'' said an angry Netanyahu who won
unanimous backing from his Cabinet ministers after they viewed
footage of an attack on an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian mob.
	   Ministers assembled around a TV set and watched a video of
Wednesday's brutal attack. When the tape stopped, the decision was
unanimous: Israel would suspend its West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu said the attack, in which Palestinians holding rocks
repeatedly struck the trapped soldier in the head, was a direct
result of incitement by the Palestinian Authority against Israel.
	   ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli citizens being lynched,
or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that received incitement
from Palestinian officials,'' Netanyahu said in explaining his
decision to hold up the land-for-security agreement.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation once
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce
a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Israel has said it will not free those involved in attacks that
resulted in death or injury. The Palestinians demand that Israel
free prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The Palestinians appealed to the United States for help and
Arafat said Thursday that Netanyahu is ``violating completely'' the
Wye agreement.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin rejected the Israeli
conditions, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   Violence erupted for a second day Thursday.
	   In three Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, Palestinians threw
stones at police and Israeli motorists. Six Israeli police officers
and two Israeli civilians were injured by rocks and a Palestinian
was struck by a rubber bullet fired by police to disperse stone
throwers on the Mount of Olives.
	   In the main clash on Salah Eddin Street, the main thoroughfare
of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, undercover policemen wearing
checkered Arab headdresses drove up to a crowd of stone throwers in
a white van, jumped out, fired in the air and arrested four
Palestinians. In all, 18 Palestinians were arrested.
	   The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the peace
accord. The White House said the Clinton trip was still on.
	   In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel
is to release 250 more Palestinian prisoners.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation with the
Palestinians has helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition.
	   In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend the Wye
agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said they would not
support an early elections bill as initially planned.
	   The legislation was to have come before parliament Monday, but
its sponsors said they might delay the vote because they no longer
have a majority.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   Early Thursday, a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian
laborers from the Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they
were investigating whether the arsonists had political motives. The
laborers escaped unharmed.
	   After the attack on the Israeli soldier on Wednesday near the
West Bank town of Ramallah, Netanyahu convened his so-called
security Cabinet and played a videotape of the incident.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the
Cabinet room was tense during the screening and that those present
decided unanimously afterward to hold up the accord.
	   However, the Palestinian Authority blamed Israel for the latest
crisis, saying it had raised tensions by refusing to release
Palestinian prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The two sides also argued over whether the attack on the soldier
was orchestrated or spontaneous.
	   The incident began when about 150 Palestinian university
students, many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march
in Ramallah to press for prisoner releases.
	   The group then marched to the outskirts of town to throw stones
at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier was riding in.
	   Netanyahu said the incident was ``organized, orchestrated,
planned in advance and fomented by the Palestinian Authority.''
	   However, Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank,
said the incident was triggered by growing anger over Israel's
handling of the prisoner issue.
	   ``In clashes, rocks are thrown,'' Barghouti said. ``This car
stopped with the soldier and they took his weapon. It was later
returned. They did not use it to kill.''
	   Palestinian security forces have not arrested any of the rioters
involved in the attack, a senior official said. On Wednesday
evening, the soldier's M-16 assault rifle was handed to the
governor of Ramallah, but none of those making the delivery were
questioned or detained.

Moldova trade unions call rally against unpaid wages, budget cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) _ Moldovan trade unions called Thursday
for a mass rally in the nation's capital to protest unpaid wages
and deep state budget cuts.
	   Moldova's General Federation of Unions will gather at least half
its 60,000 members in front of the government headquarters Friday
in the largest protest here since the 1992 fall of communism,
deputy federation leader Petru Chiriac said.
	   The protest is sponsored mainly by disgruntled employees in the
state-dominated industry, education and agriculture sectors.
	   Moldovan Premier Ion Ciubuc last week promised to subsidize some
basic foods in an unsuccessful attempt to avert the threatened
protest.
	   Meanwhile, municipal authorities vow to take legal action
against the protesters under a national law that prohibits rallies
in front of the government building. Authorities say the protest
will snarl traffic throughout downtown.
	   Facing a harsh winter, tens of thousands of workers haven't been
paid for months as its already lagging economy follows Russia, its
main trading partner, into a downturn.
	   The representative of the International Monetary Fund in
Chisinau, Mark Horton, warned the government it must further cut
spending in order to receive a badly-needed loan of dlrs 35
million.

Top general instigated executions of thousands, indictment says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A top Bosnian Serb general
arrested by NATO troops on genocide charges guided the soldiers who
massacred thousands of Muslims and dumped them in mass graves,
according to his U.N. indictment released Thursday.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic, seized by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force on Wednesday, was secretly indicted on six
counts, including genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions and crimes against humanity.
	   Krstic is the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be
arrested for U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges. He was
arrested without incident in a section of northern Bosnia
controlled by U.S. troops.
	   Krstic was expected to arrive Thursday at the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal's high-security holding cell outside The Hague. The
date of his arraignment, which will be his first appearance in
court, has not been announced.
	   Offenses allegedly committed by his troops occurred following
the Serb takeover of the so-called U.N. ``safe haven'' of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, where thousands of
Muslims were massacred.
	   According to his indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most of the members of the Bosnian Muslim population of
the Srebrenica enclave, using automatic weapons, hand grenades and
other weaponry.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October. It was kept secret so he wouldn't try to flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic, who held the rank of general-major during the Srebrenica
operation, is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic _ the tribunal's top two suspects _
also have been indicted on genocide charges for allegedly
orchestrating the massacres at Srebrenica. Both remain at large.
	   Krstic was the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Court agrees to extradite Turkish mafia boss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lawyers saying they will appeal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ A French appeals court on
Thursday agreed to extradite an alleged Turkish mafia boss to
Turkey. But it said it would set conditions for the extradition.
	   Alaatin Cakici, 45, who is believed to be one of Turkey's top
mafia bosses, was arrested in France in August on an international
arrest warrant.
	   Court officials said the extradition would be subject to
conditions set by the French court. They did not immediately
elaborate.
	   But Cakici's lawyers said they would appeal the ruling, Turkey's
Anatolia news agency reported.
	   A French court sentenced him to six months in prison for using a
false passport and a fake identity card.
	   Cakici has been on the run from Turkish justice for years. He
was caught Aug. 17 in Nice by French police using a diplomatic
passport.
	   He is wanted in Turkey for a series of murders since 1978.

McEnroe to meet up again with former target of wrath
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John McEnroe comes face to face this week with the
man he once called ``a disgrace to the human race.''
	   George Grime was in the umpire's chair at Wimbledon 17 years ago
when McEnroe launched into his famous ``You cannot be serious''
tirade.
	   Who knows what will happen when Grime umpires McEnroe's matches
at the ATP Seniors Tour of Champions, which runs Thursday through
Sunday at London's Olympia arena?
	   ``There are only two umpires in this tournament, so I can hardly
avoid him,'' Grime said.
	   Grime, now 60, first came across McEnroe in the quarterfinals of
Wimbledon in 1977 when Mac was just 17.
	   ``What a polite young American, I thought, although I knew that
he had been giving some of my colleagues a bit of trouble earlier
in the tournament,'' Grime recalled in Thursday's Daily Telegraph.
``By 1981, he had become a real fireball and had earned the famous
nicknames like Super Brat and so on.''
	   Grime was in the chair when McEnroe played Rod Frawley in the
1981 semifinals.
	   When McEnroe shouted, ``You umpires screw me up,'' Grime gave
him a code violation warning.
	   ``Later, he looked at me and said, `You are a disgrace to
mankind.' It was abusive and everyone heard it. So I gave him
another court violation. `You cannot be serious, I was talking to
myself,' he replied. It caused quite a stir. I had an escort off
court. It was extraordinary, really.''
	   Grime said he ran into Frawley years later, and the Australian
was still seething over the incident.
	   ``He believed I should have kicked McEnroe off the court,''
Grime said.
	   The last time Grime was the target of McEnroe's wrath was in the
final of the ATP over-35s event in Germany two years ago.
	   When McEnroe questioned a line call, he said, ``I guess there's
no point in asking you whether you saw the ball. You haven't been
able to see a ball for 20 years.''

Price takes lead in first round of Million Dollar Challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Zimbabwe's Nick Price takes a
two-shot edge into the second round of the Million Dollar Challenge
after a five-under 67 over the windswept Gary Player Country Club
course Thursday.
	   Price, the defending champion in the tournament that carries the
biggest single check in golf, was two shots up on a three-way
logjam of double Major winner Mark O'Meara, Justin Leonard and
Germany's Bernhard Langer. South African hometown hero Ernie Els
was a shot back at 70.
	   Price had six birdies in his round, picking up shots at the
par-5 2nd, the short 7th, par-5 10th and 14th before finishing
back-to-back birdies on No. 17 and 18, both par 4.
	   O'Meara, holder of the U.S. Masters and British Open titles,
reached 4-under to share the lead on the 14th in the two-ball ahead
of Price, but surrendered this when Price birdied No. 14 and
O'Meara made his second bogey of a five-birdie round on No. 15.
	   O'Meara had started the day a relieved man after his clubs
finally arrived in Sun City Wednesday night. They had been lost en
route from Florida to South Africa Sunday night.
	   Els, who had been four under after four, made bogey on numbers
6, 11 and 17 against a solitary relieving birdie on the 10th.
	   ``It was really a long course out there today,'' he said of the
layout that had been battered by heavy rain and a day where a
swirling wind made things even more difficult for the elite 12-man
field.
	   The final round is Sunday at the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter),
par-72 Gary Player Country Club course. Prize money totals dlrs
2.57 million.

Serbs report finding more than 80 bodies in mass graves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KULA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Serb forensic experts said
Thursday they have recovered 81 bodies from various cemeteries in
Sarajevo over the past 10 days, many of them suspected Serb victims
of wartime atrocities.
	   Among the bodies are 27 presumed victims of Musan Topalovic, the
Bosnian Muslim warlord known as Caco, the experts told reporters.
Caco, killed later in a government sweep on criminals, massacred
more than two dozen Serb civilians in 1993 and left their bodies in
a pit at the edge of the city.
	   Sarajevo's Muslim authorities later had the bodies buried in a
Sarajevo cemetery from where the Serb teams exhumed them recently
under an agreement with Bosnia's Muslim officials and foreign
diplomats overseeing postwar Bosnia.
	   The Serb figures were contested by Vlado Raguz, an undertaker in
charge of funerals in Sarajevo during the war. He asserted that
among the remains exhumed by the Serbs was a Croat who died of
natural causes.
	   About 200,000 people were killed in the 3 1/2 year Bosnian war
that ended in 1995 with the U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
An additional 20,000 went missing and are feared dead.
	   Exhumations have been conducted by all three sides _ Muslims,
Croats and Serbs _ since 1995 in an effort to track down the fate
of the missing. No totals exist on the number of bodies recovered
since then.
	   But international and Muslim experts have recovered more than
2,000 bodies in northwestern Bosnia, many of them apparently
Srebrenica inhabitants massacred after the Serbs overran the Muslim
enclave in 1995.
	   And this year alone, more than 1,700 bodies were recovered by
all three sides, according to statistics released by the office of
the top international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp. Of
those, about 1,300 were Muslims, apparently killed by Serbs or
Croats.

Schroeder's coalition pledges unity after crisis talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Leaders of Germany's new center-left ruling
alliance pledged better cooperation Thursday to stop squabbling
that has marred Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's debut.
	   The comments followed emergency talks between the Social
Democrats and the environmentalist Greens to counter growing
disunity in the 6-week-old government over taxes and foreign
policy.
	   Schroeder pledged in the Wednesday night talks to work more
closely with the Greens, his junior coalition partner, by attending
their policy meetings.
	   Both sides also agreed to hold regular coalition strategy
sessions, which they had previously resisted as smacking of former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top-down governing style.
	   ``Two parties that govern together need a framework to
coordinate regularly between Cabinet, parliamentary group and
party, and also to clear up atmospheric differences,'' Greens
co-leader Gunda Roestel said Thursday on German radio.
	   Schroeder has struggled both with the Greens and his own Social
Democrats over tax reform plans, part of the fight to lower
unemployment stuck above 10 percent.
	   Wolfgang Clement, a Schroeder ally and powerful state governor,
openly called for more tax relief for small and medium-size firms,
prompting a meeting with the chancellor this week to get him to
back down.
	   Schroeder also was reportedly angered by a Greens leader's call
to raise gasoline taxes well beyond the 6 pfennigs (3.5 cents) per
liter agreed to by both parties.
	   Despite occasionally chaotic preparation by the coalition,
parliament is expected to pass the first new law Friday, including
a slight cut in income taxes and an increase in aid to families
with children.
	   Regular meetings by the coalition's lawmakers should now provide
early warning on ``where problems are developing,'' said Social
Democratic lawmaker Wilhelm Schmidt.
	   Other signs of disunity have included a Greens politician's call
to lift the ban on the Kurdistan Workers Party, which was promptly
rejected by Interior Minister Otto Schily.
	   And while Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping met U.S. officials
in Washington last week, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer called on
NATO to consider dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear strike
without first being targeted.
	   U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen dismissed the proposal.

Report: postwar commission was pressured to drop investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Unpublished government documents show the French
government pressured a postwar restitution commission to drop an
inquiry into state agents who got rich selling off Jewish property,
a French newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The pressure was so great that the restitution service, created
in 1946 and headed by a former Resistance leader, was disbanded
after a year, Le Parisien reported. With a few exceptions, no state
agents were prosecuted, it said.
	   The newspaper said documents retrieved from a French Finance
Ministry cellar describe the function of the agents, appointed by
the pro-Nazi Vichy regime, as ``to make money and to serve the
enemy.''
	   In 1941, Vichy officials passed a series of anti-Jewish laws
banning Jews from many professions and ordering the liquidation of
all Jewish-owned real estate and businesses, large and small. About
7,000 agents handled the so-called ``aryanization'' process.
	   The proceeds went into state coffers, with agents taking a 10
percent commission, but sometimes much more.
	   The revelations come amid heated criticism of France in
Washington this week for what some call half-hearted efforts to
find the rightful owners of some 2,000 unclaimed art works, looted
by the Nazis and now held in French museums.
	   Stung by such charges, the government last year created a
commission to study the issue of wartime Jewish assets. The
Matteoli Commission has not seen the newly revealed documents, Le
Parisien said, and its final report _ scheduled by 2000 _ may be
incomplete.
	   A member of the Matteoli Commission, speaking to The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity, confirmed it had not reviewed the
documents, and added that an exhaustive anaylsis of wartime
archives was impossible.
	   The documents contain the private correspondence of a Resistance
leader ``Professor Terroine,'' who went on to head the restitution
service in 1946. But he quickly ran into a wall of protest.
	   One high-ranking local official from Alsace-Lorraine, quoted by
Le Parisien, wrote to Terroine urging him to stop the
investigation.
	   In the letter, Georges Tessier defended the agents, saying they
``acted in good faith, like father figures.''
	   ``They shouldn't be hauled in as if they'd made money
illegally,'' he wrote.
	   Terroine quit in 1947 and the service dissolved.
	   Another document fingers a bank employee in the city of
Clermont-Ferrand who appropriated shares of stock after learning
its owners had been exterminated in Nazi death camps.
	   And a box of archives contained detailed information about
diamonds, gold bars, watches and wedding rings seized by the Nazis
in Marseilles.
	   American troops later returned the goods to France, but
according to the documents, ``the government did not identify their
rightful owners and kept the booty,'' Le Parisien wrote.

Police raid store selling hemp products
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police on Thursday raided a shop selling
hemp merchandise in the latest step in a crackdown on stores
selling items from the European Union-subsidized crop.
	   Police also detained the shop owner, Yuli Kalofolia, but did not
immediately charge her with any crime.
	   Owners of the Greek chain, known as Kannabishop, appear to be
fighting a losing battle to sell products manufactured from
industrial hemp, including clothing, beauty products, shoe
polishes, furniture oils, cough lozenges and building insulation.
They do not sell drug paraphernalia.
	   Industrial hemp, or Cannabis sativa, is a cousin of the
marijuana plant. It contains only traces of tetrahydrocannabinol,
or THC, the substance that makes pot smokers high.
	   Hemp production is legal in nearly all EU states and is heavily
subsidized by the 15-nation bloc. Greece's commerce ministry not
only freely allows its import, but the agriculture ministry has
been considering its introduction as a cash crop.
	   In the past month, police have raided more than half the 15
Kannabishop stores around Greece, seized merchandise and charged
some of the owners on felony counts of promoting narcotics use.
	   Prosecutors supporting the crackdown claim the industrial hemp
shops indirectly promote drug use.

Man arrested in tourist shooting in Barbados
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ A 26-year-old Barbadian man was
charged in connection with an October hotel shooting that
critically wounded a British tourist, police said Thursday.
	   Darrie Smith, of St. Michael Parish, was arrested Wednesday in
the Oct. 1 shooting of Paula Bridges. Smith faces charges of
shooting with intent to maim, armed robbery, illegal possession of
firearms and possession of marijuana and was to appear before a
magistrate later Thursday.
	   A gun owned by Smith may have been used in the shooting, police
said, adding that more arrests were possible.
	   Bridges, 41, of Suffolk, was shot in the heart during a robbery
at a restaurant bar at Barbados' Palm Court Hotel with her
boyfriend, John Martin. She was hospitalized in critical condition
in Bridgetown before being flown Oct. 11 to James Paget Hospital
near Great Yarmouth, on England's east coast.
	   Martin, 53, was unhurt.
	   The shooting produced an outcry in Barbados, where Attorney
General David Simmons authorized a task force to investigate the
crime.
	   In an effort to curb crimes involving firearms, Barbados
recently increased the penalty for illegal possession of guns from
two years in prison to 20 years.

Ex-agents found guilty of Stalinist-era murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - In the first conviction under
Lithuania's broad genocide law, three former agents of the Soviet
NKVD were found guilty Thursday of killing a family of four in
1945.
	   The three were serving in a unit of the NKVD, a predecessor of
the KGB, when they burned down a house in the village of Saliniu
and killed four of its inhabitants, including a pregnant woman.
	   The killing took place a year after the Soviet takeover of
Lithuania, when the NKVD was brutally suppressing dissent.
	   One of those convicted, 76-year-old Kiril Kurakin, was sentenced
to six years in prison. Petras Bartasevicius and Juozas Sakalys,
both 75, were handed three-and-a-half year sentences. The court
also ordered that all their property be confiscated.
	   After sentencing, however, the judge said he would reduce the
prison terms by a third because all three men were partially
physically handicapped.
	   Under Lithuanian law, the killing of Lithuanians by Soviet
functionaries is considered genocide.
	   Prosecutors have also indicted several Lithuanians in the
killings of Jews during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation. But many
Jewish groups accuse Lithuania of not pushing hard enough to
convict and sentence alleged Nazis.
	   Genocide trials against Aleksandras Lileikis and Kazys
Gimzauskas, both in their 90s, were recently postponed pending a
decision about whether they were fit enough for their court cases
to continue.

Tory leader faces rebellion in House of Lords
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs; updates with comment, background &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unwilling to shed blue blood in a hopeless cause,
Britain's hereditary nobles were ready to go quietly from the House
of Lords _ only to get into a fight with the commoner who leads
their party.
	   Conservative Party leader William Hague was caught by surprise
when the Tory leader in the Lords accepted a compromise with Prime
Minister Tony Blair's government to retain some hereditary nobles
in the house during a transition period.
	   ``It was a deal which, if accepted, would mean that the
Conservative party would support the government's changes to the
House of Lords lock, stock and barrel,'' Hague said Thursday.
	   Hague said he cannot support the abolition of the voting rights
of 759 Lords with inherited titles until the government spells out
how it will choose members in the future. At present, the
aristocrats sit alongside some 500 peers with lifetime titles,
mostly former politicians, in the unelected upper chamber.
	   Blair plans to refer that issue to a commission, while going
ahead with the eviction of most of the hereditary members.
	   Given the government's large majority in the House of Commons,
Hague conceded he was bound to lose the fight. ``But that does not
mean that the Conservative Party has to withdraw its objections,''
Hague said in a radio interview Thursday.
	   A day earlier he had dismissed Lord Cranborne as Conservative
leader in the Lords. Cranborne, one of the Cecil family who have
been politically prominent since the Elizabethan age, confessed
that he had behaved ``like an ill-trained spaniel'' by going behind
Hague's back.
	   Cranborne's deputy, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, resigned on
Thursday _ ``disgusted and appalled'' that Hague had sacked
Cranborne. Three more Conservative leaders in the Lords _ Lord
Bowness, Lord Pilkington and the Earl of Home _ resigned later in
the day.
	   The Conservatives' infighting, ultimately, is only a sideshow.
By a long-settled convention and by law, a government that promised
to do something before an election gets its way.
	   At most, the Conservatives could have delayed the Lords reform
for one year. The falling out between Hague and Cranborne, and the
Lords' evident distaste for a fight, is likely to make the
government's task easier.
	   For the young and struggling Conservative leader, the ruckus is
partly about stamping his authority on a party dispirited by its
disastrous defeat a year ago.
	   ``It is my job to rebuild my party ... with some discipline, and
when people behave without authority in that way, I'm afraid they
have to go,'' said Hague, 37, who became leader last year.
	   Cranborne's deal called for 91 of the hereditary peers to remain
in the House of Lords until there was agreement on a new method of
selection. Some members of the Labor Party have been pressing for
an elected upper house.
	   The Conservatives' position was not entirely clear. Hague said
he accepted the government's concession on the 91 hereditary peers,
but would not promise to abstain from opposing the legislation.
	   The government's leader in the Lords, Baroness Jay, said the
deal was off unless the Conservatives kept their end of the
bargain.
	   Cranborne argued that saving a few seats was better than
nothing.
	   ``There are purists who feel it is more honorable to die like
James IV at Flodden Field in 1513,'' Cranborne said. ``But the
difficulty about dying is that you are dead.''

European central banks cuts key interest rate for euro launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with analyst reaction, market reaction, EDITS
slightly &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a surprise move, nations adopting
the new European currency, the euro, dropped key interest rates
Thursday, effectively setting the rate that will be adopted
throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1.
	   Ten of the 11 countries launching the euro dropped their key
interest rate to 3 percent. Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4
percent, and was expected to drop to the unified rate by the euro's
launch.
	   The adoption of a single interest rate is a necessary step
toward the creation of a single economic zone. Setting the rate had
been a contentious issue as center-left governments in Germany and
France pressed for a rate cut to help boost growth and cut
unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the euro zone.
	   The style of the announcements _ sudden and unexpected _ bore
the hallmark of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank.
	   ``We'd been expecting rates to come down, but not until the 21st
of December. This was true Bundesbank-style, trying to make an
impact,'' said James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist with
Nomura.
	   The rate cut boosted some stock markets. Germany's stock market
jumped on news of the cuts before falling back, but was still up
1.7 percent by late afternoon. Portugal's market surged 2.3 percent
on the news.
	   ``The reaction is _ `oh good, they're doing a little bit to prop
up the euro economy.' But confidence has taken quite a hit across
Europe recently, and I think further action from the (European
Central Bank) will be needed next year, maybe down to 2.5
percent,'' said Mitchell.
	   The cuts were timely, Brussels-based economist Liesbeth Van de
Craen said.
	   ``We are clearly headed for a slowdown,'' said the international
economist at Banque Bruxelles Lambert, adding the move didn't
threaten to overheat the economy.
	   ``On the inflation front, there's absolutely no problem. There's
no risk of price increases in Europe,'' she said.
	   Interest rate cuts can spur growth in two ways: they make it
cheaper to borrow money, leading to more investment and new
businesses; and they make it less worthwhile to save, inducing
people to put their money in circulation, expanding the economy.
	   European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg gave no hint of the
rate cuts during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday, instead
suggesting that governments should reform rigid labor markets to
create jobs.
	   In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central
bankers cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent.
Rates before the cuts had varied throughout the future currency
zone, from 3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria.
	   The European Central Bank said in a statement from its Frankfurt
headquarters that the move was decided during a meeting Tuesday of
its the policy-making governing council.
	   The governing council comprises the 11 heads of national central
banks plus a six-member directorate, including bank president
Duisenberg.
	   ``The joint reduction in interest rates has to be seen as a de
facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the (bank)
will start ... monetary union,'' the statement said, adding the
3-percent rate would be maintained ``for the foreseeable future.''
	   In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the
Bundesbank's move reflected the worsening outlook for European
economies, and wasn't a capitulation to political pressure from
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine.
	   ``It's not a dramatic step. It wasn't in response to political
pressure,'' Tietmeyer said.
	   But Tietmeyer, head of the Bundesbank on which the ECB is
modeled, promised that the coordinated rate cut does not signal the
start of a volatile monetary policy. ``It's not a shift from the
Bundesbank's steady-hand policy,'' he said.
	   ``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the
current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,''
he said.
	   Growth in Europe has been hit by the Asian and Russian economic
crises and turbulence on international financial markets.
Duisenberg has said growth in the euro area countries next year
will be about 2.5 percent, lower than the 3 percent predicted
earlier.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Human rights group freezes activities after Egypt detains leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's largest human rights group announced
Thursday that it was suspending its activities because of a
government campaign that ``aims to terrorize the organization and
eliminate its role.''
	   The decision was made at a Wednesday night meeting of the
15-member board of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights.
	   The announcement came two days after Egyptian security officials
detained the group's secretary-general, Hafez Abu Saada, on grounds
he accepted a donation from the British government without Egyptian
government approval. He can be held for 15 days for investigation.
	   The statement said the board decided to ``freeze the
activities'' in Egypt, meaning it won't send investigators into the
field or issue any public statements on human rights cases. If
citizens come with complaints, they will be referred to other human
rights groups, it said.
	   ``This campaign aims to terrorize the organization and eliminate
its role in protecting human rights and revealing these violations
sincerely and faithfully,'' the statement said.
	   Also Thursday, the Land Center for Human Rights, which deals
with property disputes, charged in a statement that the
government's campaign against the group ``aims to weaken the human
rights movement in Egypt.''
	   The Land Center urged authorities to release Abu Saada, saying
his detention is ``part of a campaign aiming to terrorize people
working in the human rights field.''
	   Meanwhile, the Cairo-headquartered Arab Center for the
Independence of the Judiciary issued a statement charging that the
government was targeting the human rights movement ``to threaten
its very existence.''
	   The Arab Center expressed concern that Egyptian police would not
disclose where Abu Saada was being detained and interrogated.
	   The government to date has refused to register a single Egyptian
human rights group, putting them in the precarious position of
operating without the status of officially approved
non-governmental organizations.

EU trade negotiator asks Washington to reconsider fast-track WTO
</HEADLINE>
panel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The chief European Union trade
negotiator appealed to the U.S. authorities on Thursday to
reconsider an EU proposal for a speedy settlement of the
trans-Atlantic banana dispute at the World Trade Organization.
	   Washington alleges the 15-nation EU banana regime, which allows
preferential import terms to certain African and Pacific nations,
is unfair to South American distributors, most of which are owned
by U.S. companies.
	   EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told journalists that the
EU had offered a speedier process of 170 days to resolve the
dispute through an accelerated WTO panel. Under the normal
procedure, it takes 449 days, he said.
	   Brittan said Washington's insistence that the banana row should
be resolved before March 3 was ``ridiculous.'' March 3 is the
deadline under U.S. trade law for the enforcement of a dlrs 1.5
billion fine the United States has slapped on the EU.
	   However, Brittan said the EU has assured Washington it will not
press for this time limit to be applied if the United States agrees
to the fast-track plan.
	   The WTO ruled earlier this year that the EU's banana import
system violates its rules. The EU operates a special banana trade
regime with certain developing countries, grouped in the so-called
African-Caribbean-Pacific bloc.
	   The WTO ruling was in response to a complaint by the United
States, Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico that the EU system
unfairly restricted their banana exports.

Ukraine's top opposition party protests arrest of its leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Switzerland-Ukraine-Corruption &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's top opposition party on Thursday
protested the arrest of its controversial leader by Swiss police,
and said the news of his detention was invented by authorities to
diminish the party's position.
	   Pavlo Lazarenko, a former prime minister who now leads the
opposition Hromada party, was arrested by customs officials on the
Swiss-French border Wednesday evening. He was later transferred to
Geneva, where a judge had ordered his arrest.
	   Hromada said in a statement that the information about
Lazarenko's arrest distributed by Ukrainian media Thursday had not
been confirmed and could be seen as ``the latest provocation'' by
authorities who ``are continuing their course aimed at destroying
the opposition and its leaders.''
	   Swiss prosecutors later confirmed the details of the arrest.
	   Lazarenko, who is also a lawmaker in Ukraine's parliament, is at
the center of a corruption probe focusing on his time as prime
minister in 1996-97.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain, in particular reaping huge profits from gas
imports to Ukraine by giving preferential status to private energy
trader Unified Energy Systems (UES).
	   The company recently lost an appeal in Ukraine's Supreme
Arbitration Court over a 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 409 million) fine
imposed by tax authorities for evading taxes and illegally
transferring abroad dlrs 690 million received from gas sales.
	   The chief prosecutor's office in Kiev, which is investigating
several charges against Lazarenko, recently asked Swiss police to
assist in tracking down money Lazarenko allegedly illegally stashed
in Swiss banks.
	   Investigations against Lazarenko are under way in several
cantons in Switzerland.
	   The country's influential Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper
reported last month that about dlrs 40 million in bank accounts
linked to Lazarenko already had been frozen.
	   Hromada and UES officials say the corruption probe and tax fine
have no grounds and describe the scandal as politically motivated
and organized by President Leonid Kuchma and his close supporters.
Kuchma appointed Lazarenko prime minister and later fired him.
	   Lazarenko recently told the opposition daily Kievskie Vedomosti
that authorities were planning to kill him to get rid of a powerful
opposition leader.
	   ``I've never committed any crimes. Moreover, I never did
anything to deserve killers being sent to me,'' Lazarenko said at
the time.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor Mykhailo Potebenko has dismissed any
suggestions of politics in the corruption case.

Officials: Local election `unusually harsh' even for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A local election campaign in St. Petersburg is
``unusually harsh'' even by Russia's standards, officials said
Wednesday _ a strong statement in a country where murder,
corruption and fraud have become widespread.
	   The election to St. Petersburg's city legislature on Sunday is
believed to have played a part in the recent slaying of a prominent
liberal lawmaker. Multiple campaign violations have also been
reported, and two of the candidates have been formally accused of
corruption.
	   The campaign is proceeding ``in unusually harsh forms, far from
the methods of normal election struggles,'' the city electoral
commission said in a statement Wednesday.
	   Election officials also appealed to voters ``not to yield to
deception and psychological pressure by some candidates (who)
violate the law, moral norms and ethics,'' said the statement
quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The commission promised to investigate all reports of
violations.
	   Russia's parliament also criticized the election campaign
Wednesday, saying that ``methods of deceiving and bribing voters,
and applying psychological pressure to them are widely used,''
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``This election may become a model for manipulating citizens'
freedom of expression in other regions of Russia,'' said a
statement by parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   St. Petersburg is a particularly crime-ridden city. Several
prominent political and business leaders have been killed or
attacked in there in recent weeks.
	   Police in St. Petersburg have said the city's 1,500 polling
stations will be heavily guarded on election day.
	   Russian media and politicians have suggested that lawmaker
Galina Starovoitova was killed to prevent her faction, Northern
Capital, from making a strong showing in the election.
	   Starovoitova was gunned down by unidentified assailants in her
apartment building in St. Petersburg last week. Police have
announced no major breakthroughs in the case.
	   Starovoitova was not on the ballot but was campaigning for her
allies, who have often spoken out against corruption.

Ukraine's president hopeful about outcome of loan talks with IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma voiced
hope Thursday that the government would win a delayed tranche of a
dlrs 2.2 billion loan during negotiations with an International
Monetary Fund delegation.
	   An IMF mission arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday for a four-day
visit to check whether this former Soviet republic was meeting
conditions for further disbursement of the three-year loan approved
in September.
	   Kuchma said the negotiations in Kiev were proceeding
``normally,'' and said he hoped their outcome would be ``successful
for Ukraine.''
	   ``(The IMF) understands our position, and we are making steps to
implement as fully as possible the fund's conditions for the loan
deal,'' Kuchma was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Ukraine so far has received dlrs 335 million of the IMF loan,
but the November tranche was delayed after the fund's previous
delegation to Kiev expressed disapproval over the government's
compliance with the deal.
	   The IMF was worried about the government's persistent failure to
raise enough budget revenues, and sharply criticized proposals to
print money to pay off some government debts.
	   Ukraine badly needs the IMF money to meet its 1999 foreign debt
obligations of more than dlrs 2 billion. Its lending credibility
has been undermined by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia
that scared away most foreign investors.
	   Ukraine's economy, plagued by lack of reforms, has been
declining since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The government is owed more than 9 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.6
billion) in unpaid taxes, while its own debt in unpaid pensions and
wages totals more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 875 million).
	   Ukrainian leaders have urged the IMF to soften its lending
conditions, saying the cash-poor country is unlikely to implement
them.

Turkmenistan bans most currency trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Turkmenistan has sharply tightened limits on
residents' access to foreign currency in an effort to protect its
dwindling hard currency reserves, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The only people allowed to exchange the Turkmen manat for
foreign currency are: those who need medical treatment outside the
impoverished central Asian nation, and then only with a certificate
from the Health Ministry; students going to school abroad; and
government employees traveling to other countries.
	   Companies operating in Turkmenistan can exchange money only to
buy medicines or raw materials or to repay government loans,
according to a Central Bank statement quoted by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Foreigners in the former Soviet republic can only buy foreign
currency they previously sold to the Central Bank.
	   The bank's hard currency reserve department said the move was
indefinite and was an effort to save the bank's hard currency
reserves, which have been depleted because of a plunge in natural
gas exports and the bank's intervention to keep the manat stable.
	   Turkmenistan's natural gas reserves are among the world's
largest, but revenues from gas exports have been constrained by
non-payment for deliveries by neighboring countries and the lack of
pipelines to access other markets.
	   Turkmenistan has also suffered some fallout from the economic
crisis in Russia.
	   The country inherited a highly specialized economy from the
Soviet period, and has failed to diversify since the 1991 Soviet
collapse or introduce any serious economic reforms.
	   It has also built up a huge foreign debt _ 75 percent of gross
domestic product, Interfax said.
	   In the absence of a fully convertible currency, the black market
for dollars has flourished.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's Muslim leaders
cheered the arrest Wednesday of a Bosnian Serb general wanted for
war crimes_ with hopes the action sets a new trend.
	   NATO troops in northern Bosnia arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic,
charged with genocide and crimes against humanity in the 1995
massacre of Muslims fleeing Srebrenica.
	   Krstic is the most senior person wanted by the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal to be arrested so far. He is also the first one
related to the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, in which some 8,000
people went missing.
	   ``We welcome this arrest _ particularly the fact that they have
started arresting generals,'' said Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic.
``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders.''
	   Krstic was arrested in the northern part of Bosnia, controlled
by U.S. troops. Most of the nine actions against alleged war
criminals by international forces have taken place in either in the
British or U.S. sectors.
	   Muslim leaders in Bosnia expressed hope NATO would now focus on
apprehending the key architects of the war, former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic.
	   To strengthen the current political atmosphere in Bosnia, it
would be important for the masterminds of crime to be arrested,
Hajric said.
	   The State Department said the arrest served as a warning to
other suspects still at large.
	   ``All persons indicted for war crimes, including Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, belong in The Hague in the custody of
the International Criminal Tribunal,'' State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said.
	   In last September's nationwide elections, the Bosnian Serbs
elected Nikola Poplasen, a Bosnian Serb ultranationalist who
cooperated with Karadzic and Mladic during the 1992-95 war, as
president of their half of Bosnia.
	   The move frustrated international agencies charged with the
implementing the peace agreed upon in the 1995 Dayton accord.
	   ``This would also be an important message to Nikola Poplasen
that would made him understand that his policy has come to an
end,'' Hajric stressed.
	   Speaking in the capital of the Bosnian Serb republic, Poplasen
criticized the arrest by NATO-led troops, better known as SFOR.
	   ``Unfortunately...SFOR went beyond its mandate in this arrest,''
Poplasen said. ``It happened in a drastic way, several more of his
(Krstic's) associates were also arrested and that is contrary to
procedure.''
	   He did not specify how many others were arrested, or what had
been done with them.
	   Poplasen was meeting late Wednesday with the Bosnian Serb
republic's defense body, which was expected to comment on Krstic's
arrest. Heading into the meeting, he said their stand on the issue
``will be based on clear support to the Dayton peace agreement.''

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be seized for
U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
charged him in the 1995 massacre of Muslim civilians fleeing
Srebrenica.
	   Krstic was ``a very significant military leader,'' said Louise
Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
Arbour said she was delighted at the arrest of Krstic, who was
indicted in October on charges of genocide, grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Krstic was arrested
without incident and would be sent to The Hague tribunal for trial
on charges stemming from the wartime massacre of thousands of
Muslims who fled the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica after it was
taken over by Serb rebels.
	   He was indicted for genocide, complicity to commit genocide,
extermination, murder, and persecution for his alleged personal
involvement in the atrocities and his command of troops carrying
out the massacres, the tribunal announced.
	   In a statement, Arbour, of Canada, said the arrest was ``very
significant for the continuing work of the tribunal.''
	   Amor Masovic, the head of a Bosnian Muslim commission unearthing
mass graves containing victims of the 3 1/2-year war, said he
expected the case to yield important facts related 8,000 people
still missing from Srebrenica.
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' he said.
	   In Sarajevo, the Bosnian Muslim leadership welcomed the arrest
and expressed hope that NATO would now focus on apprehending the
key architects of the war.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic
said Wednesday.
	   ``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders,'' referring
to former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic, who also have been indicted on
genocide charges for allegedly masterminding the massacre at
Srebrenica.
	   The U.S. State Department also said the arrest served as a
warning to other suspects still at large.
	   ``All persons indicted for war crimes, including Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, belong in The Hague in the custody of
the International Criminal Tribunal,'' State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said.
	   But Petar Djokic, president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said
Krstic's arrest on a secret indictment ``brings uncertainty to
people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika Srpska can be
regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of the tribunal,
and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody, anytime, anywhere.''
	   Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within Bosnia. Serbs account
for the vast majority of suspects publicly indicted by the U.N.
court.
	   Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen accused SFOR of going
beyond its mandate in making the arrest.
	   ``It happened in a drastic way, several more of his (Krstic's)
associates were also arrested and that is contrary to the procedure
set in SFOR mandate regarding arresting war crimes suspects,''
Poplasen said.
	   He did not say what had happened to the other Serbs who were
arrested.
	   Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic, the tribunal's top two indicted suspects.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic have been indicted for genocide for
allegedly masterminding the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica.
Neither is in custody.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Wednesday after the arrest.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.

Heating shortages forces families to leave homes in northern
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 130 families have moved out of their
homes and into office buildings and a military base in Russia's far
northeast due to a lack of heating fuel, a news report said
Thursday.
	   Blizzards and temperatures of minus 25 Celsius (minus 13
Fahrenheit) forced the families out in Cape Schmidt, on the
northern coast of the Chukotka Peninsula, which juts out toward
Alaska, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The region has been plagued by chronic fuel shortages in recent
years, and last month the government evacuated more than 1,000
people because it was too expensive to supply them with food and
fuel during the winter.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government has been unable to provide
subsidies as the Soviet Union did, and as a result, Chukotka's
population has shrunk by half to 80,000 during this decade.
	   Meanwhile, in the Kamchatka Peninsula, which is south of
Chukotka, a local legislator began a hunger strike to protest the
federal government's failure to deliver fuel and other supplies to
the region.
	   Lawmaker Alexander Ivanov noted that Sergei Shoigu, the minister
for emergency situations, visited the region last month and agreed
to provide urgent help. But Ivanov said conditions have only been
getting worse.
	   Power supplies were cut Wednesday to apartments in the main
city, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Electricity was being supplied only
to hospitals and other places that provide essential services.

Russian parliament inches its way toward decision on START II
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Senior Russian lawmakers voiced hopes Thursday
that parliament would soon ratify the START II arms reduction
treaty with the United States.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, agreed to finish its
work by next Tuesday on a measure that outlines Russia's nuclear
weapons program, said Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov. The bill will
then be sent to President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``It will spell out Russia's military doctrine and guidelines
for developing new weapons that would ensure Russia's security,''
Seleznyov told reporters.
	   Some Duma members in the past have talked about setting
conditions for ratification _ a move that might require the U.S.
Senate to review the treaty again. However, Seleznyov didn't
mention any proposals that would make ratification conditional on
additional actions by the United States.
	   Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Duma's foreign affairs
committee, said he expected the president to return the bill to the
Duma without any major alterations. That could set the stage for
approval of the START II treaty.
	   Yeltsin previously submitted the START II treaty to the Duma for
ratification.
	   But Russian lawmakers wanted to outline priorities for
developing the country's nuclear arsenal before approving the
treaty.
	   START II, which the two countries signed in 1993, would halve
Russian and American nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led
opposition in the Russian parliament has balked, claiming that
dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's security and be
too expensive.
	   The Russian government and military leaders have strongly pushed
for ratification, saying that Russia will have to soon decommission
its aging missiles anyway.
	   There's been some progress in recent weeks, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov has made a renewed push to convince lawmakers to
ratify the document.

Ukraine's top opposition party protests arrest of its leader

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's top opposition party on Thursday
protested the arrest of its controversial leader by Swiss police,
and said the news of his detention was invented by authorities to
diminish the party's position.
	   Pavlo Lazarenko, a former prime minister who now leads the
opposition Hromada party, was arrested by customs officials on the
Swiss-French border Wednesday evening. He was later transferred to
Geneva, where a judge had ordered his arrest.
	   Hromada said in a statement that the information about
Lazarenko's arrest distributed by Ukrainian media Thursday had not
been confirmed and could be seen as ``the latest provocation'' by
authorities who ``are continuing their course aimed at destroying
the opposition and its leaders.''
	   Swiss prosecutors later confirmed the details of the arrest.
	   Lazarenko, who is also a lawmaker in Ukraine's parliament, is at
the center of a corruption probe focusing on his time as prime
minister in 1996-97.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain, in particular reaping huge profits from gas
imports to Ukraine by giving preferential status to private energy
trader Unified Energy Systems (UES).
	   The company recently lost an appeal in Ukraine's Supreme
Arbitration Court over a 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 409 million) fine
imposed by tax authorities for evading taxes and illegally
transferring abroad dlrs 690 million received from gas sales.
	   The chief prosecutor's office in Kiev, which is investigating
several charges against Lazarenko, recently asked Swiss police to
assist in tracking down money Lazarenko allegedly illegally stashed
in Swiss banks.
	   Investigations against Lazarenko are under way in several
cantons in Switzerland.
	   The country's influential Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper
reported last month that about dlrs 40 million in bank accounts
linked to Lazarenko already had been frozen.
	   Hromada and UES officials say the corruption probe and tax fine
have no grounds and describe the scandal as politically motivated
and organized by President Leonid Kuchma and his close supporters.
Kuchma appointed Lazarenko prime minister and later fired him.
	   Lazarenko recently told the opposition daily Kievskie Vedomosti
that authorities were planning to kill him to get rid of a powerful
opposition leader.
	   ``I've never committed any crimes. Moreover, I never did
anything to deserve killers being sent to me,'' Lazarenko said at
the time.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor Mykhailo Potebenko has dismissed any
suggestions of politics in the corruption case.

Lithuania gives food aid to Russian region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The first batch of Lithuanian food aid was
delivered Thursday to Russia's Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad to
stave off potential shortages, a news report said.
	   Authorities in Kaliningrad _ which is sandwiched between
Lithuania and Poland _ previously declared an ``emergency
situation'' to make sure the region does not run out of food and
fuel during the winter.
	   The federal government in Moscow insists that Russia has enough
food, but a lack of money has delayed deliveries to outlying
regions. The problem is especially acute in Kaliningrad, which is
cut off from the rest of Russia.
	   Lithuania delivered 100,000 cans of condensed milk, 100,000 cans
of meat, and 40 tons of cheese to Kaliningrad on Thursday, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   In all, Lithuania plans to provide 220 tons of food worth 3.5
million litai (dlrs 875,000) to the Kaliningrad region, said the
Lithuanian consul in Kaliningrad, Jonas Voronavicius.
	   The food will be distributed among hospitals and kindergartens,
Voronavicius said, according to Interfax.
	   Russia is to receive food aid from the European Union and the
United States worth about dlrs 1 billion this winter.

Russian cadet shot after stealing rifle, trying to flee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A cadet from a military college in central Siberia
stole a rifle and tried to flee, but was shot to death by a sentry,
a news report said Thursday.
	   Dmitry Filyagin, a third-year cadet in the city of Novosibirsk,
walked into the college's storage area on Wednesday and seized a
rifle from the guard, a fellow cadet, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Filyagin then tried to flee, but was stopped by a sentry, who
shot after Filyagin pulled the rifle's breach block, Interfax said.
	   Military officials said the incident may have been a result of
Filyagin's family troubles, Interfax reported. It did not
elaborate.
	   A severe lack of funding and miserable living conditions in the
Russian army have driven scores of servicemen to attack their own
comrades or commit suicide.

Russian prime minister calls for more detailed economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with economics minister describing a new plan in grafs
8-11. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government needs to come up with a more
detailed economic recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday, just a day after the International Monetary Fund
chief left without promising Moscow any new loans.
	   Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis program, but
the measures have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor
have they found favor with the IMF or other international lenders
that have frozen loans to Russia.
	   Primakov acknowledged the need to spell out the government's
intentions more clearly and called on the Cabinet to approve a more
detailed document.
	   ``Without such a concrete action plan, containing concrete tasks
and time frames, the government's steps will look merely like
intentions,'' Primakov said.
	   IMF chief Michel Camdessus left Russia on Wednesday after
meeting with Primakov and other top officials. He praised
Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis, but
said an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on loans to Russia.
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package this
summer, but only about dlrs 5 billion was disbursed before Russia's
economic crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen.
	   The IMF has indicated that Russia's draft budget for next year
appears overly optimistic, and it also does not like moves to
increase the government's role in the economy.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said the new plan
envisages drafting more than 80 bills and other legal acts within
the next two months to help revive the moribund economy.
	   They will detail the government's intentions to subsidize some
key industries, pay off wage and pension debts, index some incomes,
restructure the banking system and tighten currency controls, he
said.
	   Some of these measures have been criticized by the IMF, but
Shapovalyants voiced hope that it will not prove a stumbling block
to securing the loans.
	   ``Talks with Mr. Camdessus have shown that the issue (of getting
new loans) remains open,'' he said at a news conference, adding
that Russia continues to count on IMF loans as it drafts next
year's budget.
	   Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed out at the
IMF for refusing to release loans.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as
speaker for the State Duma, parliament's lower house. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay off its
debts and then refuse to take any more loans.
	   ``It's high time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he
told reporters.
	   In other economic developments Thursday:
	   _ Sberbank, the giant state-savings bank, has begun to service
individual accounts that were transferred to the bank from six
ailing commercial banks.
	   The government in September guaranteed the savings accounts of
all depositors who moved their money from the troubled commercial
banks into Sberbank.
	   Many individuals took the offer, though some keep their money in
commercial banks, which are still struggling to survive.
	   _ Inflation was up 5.7 percent in November, compared to 4.5
percent in October, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September
in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. However, inflation is up
about 70 percent compared to last December, the government said
Wednesday.
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves dropped by dlrs 200 million in
the last week of November and stood at dlrs 12.8 billion on Nov.
27, the Central Bank said Thursday.

Ukrainian miner believed killed in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ One Ukrainian miner was feared dead after
he and three more coal workers were flung several hundred meters
(yards) down a shaft by rushing water, officials said Thursday.
	   The accident occurred Tuesday at the Chervony Partyzan mine in
the eastern Luhansk region when a water pipe broke, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
	   The four miners were working at the depth of 700 meters (2,310
feet) at the time of the accident. Three were found alive later in
the day after having been driven down an additional 500 meters
(1,650 feet).
	   Rescue workers were still looking for the fourth miner, but he
was feared dead.
	   Ukraine's coal industry has been plagued by accidents at its
aging mines, which lack to money to maintain and upgrade safety
conditions.
	   More than 340 miners have died in mine accidents this year,
including four killed this week at different mines.

Yeltsin's surgeon: Yeltsin needs to listen to his doctor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin needs to stay in bed to recover from
his latest bout of pneumonia, but the president has a long history
of ignoring the advice of his doctors, the president's heart
surgeon said Thursday.
	   Yeltsin has in the past rushed back to work without fully
recuperating from his ailments, and this has contributed to his
recurring illnesses, doctors have said.
	   The president's aides say Yeltsin is again urging doctors to
discharge him from a government clinic where he remained
hospitalized for a 12th straight day Thursday.
	   Yeltsin must ``fulfill all orders of his doctors as pilots obey
air traffic controllers,'' said Dr. Renat Akchurin, who performed
Yeltsin's heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   ``I have had pneumonia in my life and I can say that it is not
at all easy to live through the disease,'' Akchurin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   And Yeltsin was likely to make it even more difficult, Akchurin
said.
	   ``As far as I know the president, he will not stay in bed as
told, but will return to work,'' Akchurin was quoted as saying.
	   Akchurin said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that the president was not suffering from any heart
problems.
	   Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yuri Yarov said that the
president was to remain in the hospital through the end of the
week, but may return to the Kremlin on Monday.
	   Yeltsin has been handling limited paperwork and telephone
conversations in the clinic, the presidential press service has
said.
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a long string of illnesses that have diminished the
president's authority and raised doubts about his ability to stay
in office through the end of his term in 2000.
	   Yeltsin's foes in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
adopted a non-binding resolution Wednesday demanding the release of
Yeltsin's medical records.
	   Russian law gives parliament no power to make an inquiry into
the president's health, and Yeltsin's envoy to the legislature,
Alexander Kotenkov, quickly dismissed the resolution as having no
legal meaning.
	   ``No one will fulfill the decision made by the house because it
has no legal force,'' he said.

Romania's Defense Ministry says officials negotiated with Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ After initial denials, the government
acknowledged Thursday that state-owned Romanian companies held
negotiations starting in 1994 with Iraq and may have sold the
country weapons' parts.
	   ``In 1994-96, there were some negotiation rounds between the
Military Industry Ministry of Iraq and the heads of Romtehnica,
Giara and Aerofina, Romanian military companies,'' said the Defense
Ministry in a statement.
	   Officials from the companies Giara and Romtehnica went to Iraq
in July 1994 to discuss the sale of short-range missile components
and raw materials for the defense industry.
	   ``We don't know whether a delivery was made,'' said Capt. Ovidiu
Dumitrascu, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate long-range missiles, biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons under a U.N. Security Council
resolution adopted after the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq has insisted it
has destroyed all such weapons.
	   A representative for the state company Aerofina signed a
contract in 1995 for missile components to be delivered by a
Jordanian company serving as an intermediary, the statement said.
	   The contracts and negotiations were halted in December 1996, and
an army general, two colonels and the chief responsible for
procuring military equipment for the army were fired, the statement
said without elaborating.
	   An attempt to reactivate talks in 1998 was foiled by Romanian
and foreign intelligence services and negotiations broke down.
	   Earlier this week, the Defense Ministry had denied that any
Iraqi-Romanian negotiations took place or that there were any
dismissals in connection with the negotiations.

Official: Russia to keep close control over food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia intends to keep tight control over food aid
being shipped from the United States and the European Union, a top
agriculture official said Thursday.
	   Past aid deals have been tainted by corruption, and U.S.
officials have said they stressed in their negotiations with Russia
that they wanted to avoid any hint of scandal in the aid program
this winter.
	   In an interview with the Interfax news agency, First Deputy Food
and Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev said strict guidelines
have been drafted for the companies allowed to bid on contracts to
deliver the aid.
	   Wholly state-owned companies will be given preference, he said,
and other companies must be at least 20 percent state-held and have
at least one government representative on their board of directors.
	   The bidders also must not have any debts to the government, and
must have at least three years' experience in buying and supplying
food, Gordeyev said.
	   A government commission will send tender offers to more than 10
Russian companies considered to be potential distributors of the
aid.
	   The Russian government has tentatively agreed to food aid deals
with the United States and the European Union valued at at a total
of roughly dlrs 1 billion. There have been concerns that some
Russians could go hungry this winter as a result of a poor grain
harvest and the country's economic crisis.

Deputy mayor: Moscow may restore statue of secret police chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's deputy mayor said the city will restore a
statue of a dreaded Soviet secret police chief if parliament
formalizes its request to do so, news reports said Thursday.
	   The Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, voted 237-69 on Wednesday to give tentative approval to
a resolution asking the Moscow city government to return the statue
of Felix Dzerzhinsky to the spot it occupied for decades in front
of the old KGB headquarters.
	   ``If the State Duma makes a final decision of restoring to
monument to Felix Dzerzhinsky, then the government of Moscow, as
executive power, will fulfill that decision,'' said Moscow Deputy
Mayor Valery Shantsev, according to reports by the Interfax news
agency and the daily Segodnya.
	   However, the Moscow city parliament must also approve the plan,
according to city laws, Segodnya reported.
	   ``What monument will stand on Lubyanka Square may be decided
only by Muscovites, through their representatives in the city
Duma,'' deputy speaker of the city's legislature Alexander Krutov
was quoted as saying.
	   Communists have significantly less weight in the Moscow city
parliament than in its national counterpart, and the city
legislature is likely to block the decision to restore the statue.
	   Moscow's powerful Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has so far kept silent on
the issue. In the past, Luzhkov did not exhibit particular
Communist sympathies. But the populist mayor is a leading potential
contender in Russia's next presidential elections in 2000, and
recently has seemed to be courting some of the country's many
hard-liners.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the Cheka,
the first Soviet secret police, was a landmark during the Soviet
era. It was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has
since languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   Human rights activists have denounced the proposal to restore
the statue, saying Dzerzhinsky was a symbol of murderous repression
during the Soviet era.
	   Dzerzhinsky headed the secret police after the Bolshevik
Revolution and oversaw the ruthless crackdowns on political
opponents.
	   Lubyanka Square, where the statue stood, is used by human rights
groups for vigils to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule.
Relatives of victims whose remains were never found use the square
as a gravesite, bringing flowers every year.

Explosion in Armenian resort kills four children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ An explosion tore through a children's
sanitarium at an Armenian resort on Thursday, killing at least four
children and injuring 12 other people.
	   Investigators believe the mid-afternoon blast may have been
caused by a gas leak, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   The building partially collapsed and rescuers were searching the
rubble for more victims.
	   The sanitarium in Dzhermuk _ a well-known mineral water resort
150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Armenia's capital, Yerevan _
housed children accompanied by their mothers.
	   It was not immediately clear how many people were in the
building at the time of the explosion.
	   Armenia's President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister Armen
Darbinian expressed condolences to the victims' families.

Ukraine's parliament postpones debate of 1999 budget draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Thursday postponed
debate over the 1999 budget draft after criticizing many of its
figures as unrealistic.
	   Deputies in the 450-seat legislature overwhelmingly voted 312-10
to put off the first reading of the document until Dec. 9 to let
parliament's budget committee revise it.
	   The draft, presented to lawmakers on Wednesday, provided for a
zero deficit and sharply raised the central government's projected
revenues and expenditures to nearly 50 percent more than the
Cabinet had initially proposed.
	   The revenues and expenditures were set at 35.1 billion hryvna
(dlrs 10.2 billion).
	   The budget draft must pass three readings in parliament before
final approval.
	   But Thursday's postponement and widespread dissatisfaction with
the proposed document have led many analysts to predict that the
budget has little chance of approval before the end of the year.
	   Cabinet officials objected to the draft Wednesday, an amended
version of what the government had submitted last month.
	   Many lawmakers echoed the Cabinet's criticism Thursday, calling
the budget's revenue target impossible to meet and questioning
several unorthodox sources proposed for filling government coffers.
	   The budget committee has proposed, for instance, raising extra
money by taxing commercial banks, extracting payment for using
Ukraine's air space and pushing enterprises to repay loans received
under government guarantees.
	   The legislators also cast doubt on the budget draft and its
optimistic tax projections after noting the government's extremely
poor tax collection so far this year.
	   Budget revenues in the first nine months of 1998 were just 50.8
percent of the annual target, while companies' tax debts
skyrocketed to 9.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.68 billion) as of Nov. 1.

Security agent convicted of shooting at subordinate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior Russian intelligence officer has been
convicted of badly wounding his subordinate while shooting at a
glass placed on top of his head, news reports said Thursday.
	   The incident happened several months ago when a young agent
asked Lt. Col. Vladimir Popov, the head of the Federal Security
Service branch in the Evenkia region of central Siberia, to send
him on a mission to some of Russia's more volatile regions. The
Federal Security Service, or FSB, is the main successor to the
Soviet KGB.
	   Popov, who was drunk at the time, said he should test the
officer first. He placed a glass on his head, took out his service
pistol and opened fire. After the first shot, the agent asked Popov
to stop and test somebody else.
	   Popov ignored his plea and the next bullet ricocheted from the
wall into the agent's head, badly wounding him. The young officer
has become an invalid and had to quit the service, the daily
Kommersant reported.
	   Facing a military court in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk on
Wednesday, Popov said he regretted his action but insisted he was
an excellent marksman and wounded his subordinate by accident.
	   The court sentenced Popov to 2 1/2 years in prison and ordered
him to pay his subordinate 30,000 rubles (dlrs 1,600) in damage.
The reports did not give the younger officer's name.
	   Shootings, suicides and other fatal accidents have become
increasingly common in the cash-strapped and demoralized Russian
military and security services.
	   Kommersant quoted military prosecutors as saying that FSB
officials are trying to hush up most of the incidents. ``Only the
most notorious cases usually become known,'' it said.
	   Last month, prosecutors in the Ural Mountains city of
Chelyabinsk launched criminal proceedings against three FSB
officers who detained a local man on suspicion of having a forged
passport and put him in the trunk of their car.
	   The agents were allegedly drunk and forgot about the man,
driving around in temperatures of -30 degrees C (-22 F). The man
nearly froze to death before they finally remembered he was there.
	   Another FSB officer in Chelyabinsk was recently stabbed to death
by his 19-year-old son when he was harassing his family while
drunk, police said.
	   There were no immediate comments Thursday from FSB officials.

Ukraine's president hopeful about outcome of loan talks with IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma voiced
hope Thursday that the government would win a delayed tranche of a
dlrs 2.2 billion loan during negotiations with an International
Monetary Fund delegation.
	   An IMF mission arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday for a four-day
visit to check whether this former Soviet republic was meeting
conditions for further disbursement of the three-year loan approved
in September.
	   Kuchma said the negotiations in Kiev were proceeding
``normally,'' and said he hoped their outcome would be ``successful
for Ukraine.''
	   ``(The IMF) understands our position, and we are making steps to
implement as fully as possible the fund's conditions for the loan
deal,'' Kuchma was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Ukraine so far has received dlrs 335 million of the IMF loan,
but the November tranche was delayed after the fund's previous
delegation to Kiev expressed disapproval over the government's
compliance with the deal.
	   The IMF was worried about the government's persistent failure to
raise enough budget revenues, and sharply criticized proposals to
print money to pay off some government debts.
	   Ukraine badly needs the IMF money to meet its 1999 foreign debt
obligations of more than dlrs 2 billion. Its lending credibility
has been undermined by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia
that scared away most foreign investors.
	   Ukraine's economy, plagued by lack of reforms, has been
declining since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The government is owed more than 9 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.6
billion) in unpaid taxes, while its own debt in unpaid pensions and
wages totals more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 875 million).
	   Ukrainian leaders have urged the IMF to soften its lending
conditions, saying the cash-poor country is unlikely to implement
them.

OSCE ministers urge peace in Kosovo, fully back monitor mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ European foreign ministers Thursday urged
all parties in the Kosovo conflict to seek a peaceful solution, and
gave full backing to the 2,000 monitors being sent to the Yugoslav
province in a risky mission to ease tensions.
	   The two day meeting of foreign ministers belonging to the
54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
concluded with 18 pages of declarations, including one on the
Kosovo conflict, where hundreds have died and about 300,000 have
fled ethnic violence.
	   ``The plight of so many people in Kosovo caught up in violent
confrontation and fleeing their homes in fear has moved us all,''
said the declaration, which was adopted by consensus. ``There is
still violence in Kosovo, and this is of deep concern to us.''
	   In its largest and most dangerous mission to date, the OSCE is
sending unarmed monitors to oversee terms of a truce reached with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in October. The agreement was
concluded under the threat of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
	   The ministers adopted their resolution at roughly the same as
Yugoslav border guards killed eight ethnic Albanian rebels in the
worst violation yet since the cease-fire.
	   The ministers urged Yugoslav authorities and ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo to ``stop the violence and resolved their
differences by peaceful means.''
	   ``There is a wide consensus on the importance of the OSCE
involvement in Kosovo, which represents both a challenge and an
opportunity for the OSCE,'' said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, the organization's outgoing chairman.
	   Geremek refused to discuss what was said during the closed
meeting, in which some nations were believed to have called for a
sharp rebuke of Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for allegedly
stirring up ethnic violence in the Balkans. Milosevic is still
widely seen as an obstacle to peace, but the ministers stopped
short of criticizing the president or his government.
	   Although the meeting drew representatives from about 45
countries, some key countries _ including the United States and
Britain _ sent lower-ranking delegations. Non-members, including
Japan and South Korea, sent observers to the meeting.

Health Ministry approves use of Viagra in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government was reported Thursday
to have approved the importation of the anti-impotence pill Viagra
via the private sector.
	   The newspaper Al-Zawra said the Health Ministry has no objection
to the pill manufactured by New York-based Pfizer coming into Iraq,
likely through private pharmacies and hospitals.
	   ``The blue pill is in demand by many Iraqis,'' the weekly quoted
an unnamed ministry official as saying. He suggested prescriptions
would be required.
	   The official said the government would not bring Viagra in
because it is not ``a badly needed humanitarian item.''
	   Most of Iraq's food and medicine is imported under the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell
limited quantities of oil to buy necessities for its 22 million
people.
	   The sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, limit oil sales, ban air travel and bar most international
financial transactions.

Hariri dispels rumors about ouster as Hoss begins Cabinet talks

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Outgoing Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said
in his farewell remarks Thursday that his ``painful'' decision to
quit was his own and denied he was pushed.
	   Hariri declined to form another government after what appeared
to be a power struggle with the new president, Emile Lahoud.
	   On Wednesday, Lahoud appointed Salim Hoss, a U.S.-educated
economist to become Lebanon's next prime minister after a majority
of the deputies in the 128-seat Parliament expressed their support
for him.
	   Hoss spent Thursday discussing with legislators about the makeup
of his Cabinet, which is expected to be formed early next week.
	   Rumors, fueled by Hariri's surprise departure, suggested that
the premier may have lost a power struggle to the assertive Lahoud,
the 62-year-old army commander who was unanimously elected
president by Parliament in October and took office Nov. 24.
	   But at a news conference Thursday, Hariri, who had been certain
to be re-named as prime minister, said he bowed out because of what
he described was the president's violation of the constitution in
naming him as premier.
	   When Lahoud first asked legislators who they wanted as prime
minister, 31 of 128 lawmakers declined to name a candidate and
effectively gave their vote to the president. Lahoud named Hariri,
who had been backed by 83 legislators.
	   Hariri said this was wrong as ``we should not put the president
in a position where he can be part'' of the political bargaining.
	   However, experts say the constitutional clause on which Hariri
bases his argument is open to interpretation.
	   ``It was a painful decision but the right one,'' Hariri told
reporters, dismissing the rumors that he was forced out by Lahoud
and his political foe, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   ``I am out of the government by my own will,'' he stressed. The
billionaire businessman has been prime minister since 1992.
	   He said he had even prepared an acceptance speech, lending some
credence to the speculations that he was pushed out.
	   On Monday, when Hariri announced the withdrawal of his
candidacy, he appeared to be uncomfortable with a majority that
fell short of the overwhelming support he had enjoyed in the past.
	   The prime minister was also reported to taken aback that some of
his allies had snubbed him and by the fact that he had needed the
backing of Berri's 19-seat bloc in Parliament to receive 83 votes.
	   Hariri had virtually run the country under former President
Elias Hrawi, whose term ended Nov. 24.
	   As the architect of the multibillion dollar drive to rebuild the
country from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war, Hariri is
credited with restoring economic confidence and attracting
investment to this small Arab country.
	   On Thursday, the 53-year-old Hariri took pride in his work over
the past six years, saying he was leaving office with his
``conscience clear'' and stressing that the achievements made were
a ``precious trust'' in the hands of the new government.
	   With his advisers present, the prime minister said he will
continue to serve the nation as a member of the legislature and
head of a political bloc in Parliament.
	   Hoss, in his acceptance speech Wednesday, sought to calm fears
that Hariri's departure would undermine the reconstruction program
or devalue the currency.
	   He said his government would honor contracts signed but will
execute ``austerity to the extreme'' in government spending.
	   Hariri said Thursday that he was pleased with Hoss' remarks but
that he would watch the new government's policies and will speak
out if he fails to convince the new leadership.
	   Hariri, whose government remains in caretaker capacity until the
new Cabinet is installed, left Thursday for Syria on his way to the
United States on a private visit.

	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Nick Price of Zimbabwe, fighting
off swirling winds on one of his favorite courses, took a two-shot
lead Thursday with a five-under 67 at the Million Dollar Challenge.
	   The defending champion at the Gary Player Country Club was two
shots up on a three-way logjam of double Major winner Mark O'Meara,
Justin Leonard and Germany's Bernhard Langer. South African
hometown hero Ernie Els -- a seven-time veteran of the challenge
and seeking his first win -- was a shot back at 70.
	   Tiger Woods was level at 72 in the field of 12 of the world's
top golfers, vying for the largest single check in golf.
	   Price had six birdies in his round, picking up shots at the
par-5 2nd, the short 7th, par-5 10th and 14th before finishing
back-to-back birdies on No. 17 and 18, both par 4.
	   ``This course likes me,'' said Price, also winner in 1993 with a
record 24-under par. ``It makes me focus a lot more than I do
normally.''
	   Unusually strong, shifting winds, more Scottish style than
African, caused some of the players to guess on the right club, he
said.
	   Price is coming off his third win at the Zimbabwe Open in four
years, closing with a Royal Harare-record 9-under-par 63 for a
five-stroke victory.
	   ``This is a game of momentum. No doubt about it,'' he said.
	   O'Meara, named U.S. player of the year last week and holder of
the U.S. Masters and British Open titles, reached 4-under to share
the lead on the 14th in the two-ball ahead of Price. He surrendered
the spot when Price birdied No. 14 and O'Meara made his second
bogey of a five-birdie round on No. 15.
	   In his first round of African golf, Woods birdied on the 2nd,
10th, 12th, 16th and 17th, but went a stroke over par on four other
holes. He said he felt in better form than two months ago. ``I'm
very pleased with the way I'm striking the ball,'' he said. ``It
feels like I'm making progress.''
	   Woods said playing in South Africa had special meaning for him
as ``a person of color.''
	   ``To play golf in Africa, particularly South Africa -- it's
something I've wanted to do,'' he said.
	   Els came out blazing on the first four holes, with birdies on
each. But he made bogey on numbers 6, 11 and 17 against a solitary
birdie on the 10th.
	   ``It was really a long course out there today,'' he said of the
layout that had been battered by heavy rain.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac on Thursday
unveiled a memorial dedicated to the victims of terrorism, on the
second anniversary of a bombing at a Paris train station in which
four people died.
	   The bronze tribute stands in a garden near the gold-domed Hotel
des Invalides, where Napoleon is entombed. It depicts an abstract
human form cradling its severed head. Water flows at its feet.
	   ``The struggle (against terrorism) is, and will always be,
without mercy,'' Chirac told a group of about 200 people, including
many survivors of the Dec. 3, 1996 bombing of Paris' Port Royal
station.
	   Some 170 others were injured in the attack which remains
unsolved. Authorities have long suspected Muslim extremists who
waged a 1995 bombing campaign in France that killed eight people,
but have been unable to make a direct connection.
	   The group S.O.S. Terrorism commissioned the memorial by Nicolas
Alquin. Francoise Rudetzki, the group's president and herself a
victim of a 1980s bombing in Paris, said she hoped the sculpture
would enable people to confront loss and to begin mourning.
	   Some people in the crowd were in tears. One man, a former
hostage in Lebanon, Jean-Paul Kauffmann, strayed from the crowd,
listening to the dedication from under the branches of a tree.
	   After the dedication, survivors and family members addressed the
group. Dominique Brocheriou, whose sister died in a 1995 bombing in
the St. Michel metro station, urged listeners not to be afraid to
speak to victims' families.
	   ``We must continue to talk about her,'' Brocheriou said. In a
memorial booklet, she wrote a tribute to her sister, giving advice
for those who have lost family members.
	   ``Nobody talks about her anymore,'' she wrote. ``Death and those
who have died have become taboo. But I can't bear that.''

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A Zimbabwe official said
Thursday his country would demand the return of a former president
convicted of sodomy after the fugitive, Canaan Banana, met with
President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria.
	   Banana, titular president of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987, was
convicted last week of sodomy and homosexual assault. He had been
free on bail and fled Zimbabwe for neighboring Botswana shortly
before his conviction.
	   It is not clear when he arrived in South Africa.
	   ``We want Banana back, that is our requirement,'' said George
Charamba, spokesman for President Robert Mugabe, in the Zimbabwe
capital of Harare.
	   Banana met the South African president Wednesday in Pretoria at
Mandela's official residence, Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana
told The Associated Press.
	   Banana requested the meeting, but did not indicate he would seek
asylum or residence in South Africa, Mankahlana said.
	   Zimbabwe has strict laws against homosexuality and sodomy, but
South Africa's highest court in October struck down apartheid-era
laws banning homosexual relations.
	   ``This is a very sensitive matter,'' said Mankahlana. ``South
Africa and Zimbabwe have adopted totally different approaches to
this issue (of homosexual sex). What is considered unlawful in
Zimbabwe is not considered unlawful in South Africa.''
	   In Zimbabwe, Charamba said his government had not been informed
of the meeting with Mandela. Mankahlana said the meeting took place
with full knowledge of the Zimbabwe government.
	   Zimbabwe has no extradition treaty with South Africa but
criminals have been exchanged by non-binding mutual agreement.
	   A demand for Banana's hand over could put the two countries on a
collision course. South Africa's courts would likely reject any
extradition request for crimes that are not punishable under South
African law, said Paul Setsetse, spokesman for Justice Minister
Dullah Omar.
	   ``This man has not broken any laws in South Africa,'' Mankahlana
told APTN.
	   He dismissed suggestions the issue would add tension to
relations between the two countries. Mandela has objected to
Mugabe's sending arms and troops to back Congolese President
Laurent Kabila in his fight against a rebel incursion.
	   Mugabe has launched a campaign against homosexuality, describing
same-sex partners as ``lower than pigs and dogs.''
	   Banana, a 62-year-old Methodist minister, was convicted on Nov.
26 in Harare of 11 counts of sodomy and homosexual assault. While
he was president, he allegedly threatened his bodyguards, a cook
and a gardener with their jobs unless they performed homosexual
acts.
	   Banana was brought to trial after a police inspector who worked
as his bodyguard killed a colleague who had taunted him for his
alleged relationship with the former president.
	   In his defense during a three-week trial in June, Banana said
the charges were an attempt to destroy his character and standing
amid rumors he was planning a political comeback.
	   Sentencing for Banana has been scheduled for Dec. 10 in Harare.
He faces a possible maximum jail term of 22 years.

Government privatizes first state-owned bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Romanian Bank for Development
became the first Romanian bank to turn private when France's
Societe Generale de France won the bid for a majority stake,
privatization authorities said Thursday.
	   Details of the deal will be announced next week, said Radu
Sarbu, head of the State Ownership Fund, the Romanian privatization
agency.
	   According to initial plans, the government was offering a 51
percent stake in the bank, conditional on the investor agreeing to
raise the bank's capital by 20 percent to 50 percent.
	   Romania's government wants at least dlrs 600 million from the
sale. The bank is the country's fourth-largest state-owned bank,
and had a net profit of dlrs 100 million last year.
	   Societe Generale is one of France's big retail lenders and has
operations worldwide.
	   The Banque Nationale de Paris SA also made a bid, but Sarbu said
its offer was less interesting.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which is expected to resume
negotiations for a new stand-by loan for Romania in January, has
conditioned further loans on the privatization of banks.
	   The IMF suspended a dlrs 430 million loan for the country in
May, due to political bickering and an economic crisis.
	   The agreement with IMF is badly needed to help the government
pay off dlrs 2.2 billion of foreign debts next year.
	   Analysts said the sale of some state banks and the reform of the
others would help solve the country's antiquated, underfinanced and
inefficient banking system.

Estonian-Russian talks begin in Tallinn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - Rare, high-level talks between Estonia
and Russia began Thursday in Tallinn and were expected to focus on
disputes between the countries.
	   The discussions, the highest-level talks between the countries
in years, are being headed by Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Valentina Matviyenko and Estonian Prime Minister Mart Siimann.
	   Matviyenko said she hoped the discussions would lead to improved
relations.
	   ``We're interested in the harmonious development of relations,
where one would arrive, step by step, at solutions to problems that
have emerged,'' she was quoted by the Baltic News Service as
saying.
	   After the breakup of the Soviet Union, relations between the two
countries have often been strained. Moscow has accused Estonia of
discriminating against its large Russian-speaking minority, while
Tallinn says Russia is still playing the role of regional bully.
	   Estonia has also angered the Kremlin by seeking membership in
NATO alliance, which Russia says would threaten its own security
interests.
	   Relations have also been strained over a failure to sign a
treaty fixing the countries' border.
	   While Estonia has largely reoriented its trade to the West,
Russia still accounts for more than 10 percent of Estonia's total
trade. At the two-days of talks, Tallinn is also expected to push
for a reduction of high Russian tariffs on imports from Estonia.

US congresswoman suggests Nobel prize for slain Russian lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A U.S. congresswoman suggested Thursday that a
prominent Russian liberal lawmaker recently shot to death be
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio who is visiting Moscow, said
members of the U.S. Congress considered Galina Starovoitova ``a
sister in liberty and an outspoken advocate for the democratic rule
of law and human rights,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kaptur said that if Starovoitova wins the peace prize
posthumously, some of the winnings should be used to support
democratic reforms in Russia.
	   Since Soviet times, Starovoitova had been a staunch defender of
political and market reforms and human rights, and she traveled
often to the United States for speaking and teaching engagements.
	   She was killed Nov. 20 in her apartment building in St.
Petersburg. Police have announced no major breakthroughs in the
case, but many believe the motive was political and may have been
connected to an upcoming local election.

Greenpeace says Pemex dumped toxic waste in wetlands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Greenpeace has filed a criminal complaint
against Mexico's oil monopoly Pemex, accusing it of dumping
thousands of gallons of toxic waste in wetlands along Mexico's Gulf
coast.
	   The environmental group described one incident Aug. 10 in the
town of Ixhuatlan, in which it said villagers saw a truck owned by
a Pemex contractor dumping 16 53-gallon (200-liter) drums of toxic
waste into a pond, Mexican newspapers reported Thursday.
	   According to the complaint, the driver said the company had been
dumping waste in the same place for two weeks, totaling 11,600
gallons (44,000 liters). Greenpeace also named the contractor, J
and M Industrial Construction, in the complaint.
	   None of the newspapers specified what the toxic waste was.
	   Greenpeace spokesman Alejandro Calvillo demanded that health
officials check residents of nearby villages to see how the toxic
waste was affecting them.
	   He said Pemex _ as the oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos is
commonly known _ had set up more than 60 such dumping sites in the
state of Veracruz. The sites were on land expropriated by the
government for Pemex to build access roads, pipelines and dams _
but not to dump waste.
	   ``Company employees were caught in the act,'' the daily The News
quoted Calvillo as saying. ``Authorities must stop behaving as
accomplices of Pemex, which is without doubt the top environmental
criminal in Mexico.''
	   Calvillo said Pemex, which takes in nearly a third of the
Mexican government's income, has long been considered above the
law.
	   A Pemex spokeswoman said Thursday the company had no comment.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The World Council of Churches began its
fiftieth anniversary assembly on treacherous footing Thursday as
representatives from the large Orthodox churches of Russia and
Greece decided to boycott the opening worship service.
	   Growing tensions between the restive Orthodox and the WCC's
Protestant majority are a major problem facing the international
church meeting, which is expected to address world political and
economic problems and a series of theological questions.
	   The boycott could have been worse. Many Orthodox participants
followed the lead of delegates from Istanbul's Ecumenical
Patriarchate, the symbolic center of Eastern Orthodoxy, who are
attending the worship but not are not participating in leading it.
	   The Orthodox partipants from various nations debated their
strategies at a sober caucus in a University of Zimbabwe lecture
hall that concluded just three hours before the WCC's opening
ceremony, scheduled for 4 p.m. (1400 GMT). As they conferred, the
non-Orthodox delegates were attending the scheduled assembly
orientation.
	   The Very Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, the first Orthodox president of
America's National Council of Churches and one of four Orthodox
members of the WCC executive committee, said ``the Russian Orthodox
position underscores the serious challenge faced by the ecumenical
movement as a whole and the World Council of Churches in
particular.''
	   The 960 delegates at the assembly, which meets daily through
December 14, represent a constituency of 330 denominations on all
continents, with some 350 million to 450 million Christians. The
biggest non-member, by far, is the Roman Catholic Church. The
assembly is also being attended by 3,500 visitors.
	   The WCC delegates will be discussing _ but not necessarily
resolving _ increasing Orthodox anxiety about liberal trends among
Protestants in Europe and North America. One current flashpoint is
homosexuality, which also divides the western liberals from many
rapidly growing Protestant churches in the Southern Hemisphere.
	   Contrary to earlier assurances from WCC officials, it seems
certain that the homosexual issue will reach the assembly floor, at
least obliquely. A message from a pre-assembly women's festival
will refer to ``human sexuality in all its diversity.'' Such
language was opposed by Orthodox women as well as Protestants from
Africa and the Mideast.
	   During the discussions, Aruna Gnanadason, who runs WCC women's
programs, apologized that ``our lesbian sisters'' in attendance had
been left off the festival program.
	   In addition, the WCC is staging an open forum during the
assembly in which a dozen of the 550 workshops by various Christian
organizations will address homosexuality. It remains unclear
whether those presentations will have any impact on the assembly
itself.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley
said Thursday he wants to boost trade between Africa and America,
but advised Kenya that attracting U.S. business means ``your
economic house must be in order.''
	   Daley, who is on the second leg of his four-country mission to
Africa with a 16-member trade delegation, said corruption,
political stability, regional markets and transparency were all
issues of concern to companies looking for new markets or
investment opportunities.
	   ``This is the message I gave to the trade minister: this is a
good opportunity to sell your markets ... but these companies are
not going to invest here if they don't see things change,'' Daley
told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier, the secretary, who met Thursday with President Daniel
arap Moi, regional ministers and business leaders, told a luncheon
in his honor that representatives of the companies traveling with
him, including Coca Cola, DuPont, Chevron, Eastman Kodak, and
PanAmSat, a satellite company, are being courted by countries all
over the world.
	   ``Every area of the world wants their business,'' Daley said.
``And I think, to be frank with you, they are more skittish to
invest, at least in the short term, because of problems with
Asia.''
	   Daley said the first thing businesses look at is the economic
situation.
	   ``Your economic house must be in order,'' he said. ``I encourage
Kenya to build on the progress to date in privatizing and cutting
trade barriers,'' he said.
	   He said infrastructure in Kenya was also cause for concern in
terms of getting products to market quickly, the lack of efficient
phone lines and reliable power, and that the rebellion being fought
in Congo was a destabilizing factor for the entire region.
	   The secretary dismissed complaints about 1996 U.S. quotas on
textile imports which led several Kenyan textile manufacturers to
close, saying Kenya was not even meeting the existing quotas.
	   ``This says to me that the private sector in Kenya has got to
get it together,'' the secretary said in a brief interview.
	   But corruption and the legal structures, meaning access to an
impartial judge and to rules that won't change arbitrarily, are key
concerns, Daley said.
	   In South Africa earlier this week, Daley told southern African
businessmen corruption was the greatest obstacle to foreign
investment in Africa.
	   Kenyan trade and manufacturing officials were quick to
acknowledge corruption, and insisted they were fighting it.
	   ``Kenya is a democratic country. Kenya is a free country ...
determined to root out every level of corruption in our society,''
Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho assured his visitors.
	   Still, four cooperation understandings were signed Thursday: one
to harmonize U.S. and Kenyan size standards for easier marketing; a
new loan from the U.S. government's Export-Import Bank for Kenya
Airways to purchase a Boeing 737-300 aircraft; and the private U.S.
firm Monsanto's sharing of a virus-resistant sweet potato with
Kenya's Agricultral Research Institute.
	   A fourth memorandum of understanding was signed between the
Kenyan government and the Overseas Investment Corporation, a U.S.
government company which sells political risk insurance and
financing to U.S. companies, to promote investment in Kenya.
	   Daley assured his audience that he believed the Growth and
Opportunities Act, which would require President Clinton to start
free-trade negotiations with African countries and increase funding
to back U.S. investments in Africa, would pass early next year.
	   He said the bill passed the House of Representatives but died in
the Senate before Congress recessed in October only because of
other issues that had been linked to it in the Senate vote.
	   The visit, Daley's third to Africa this year, had been postponed
from September after the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi
left 213 people dead.
	   During a luncheon in Daley's honor, Daley and U.S. Ambassador
Prudence Bushnell distributed awards to Commerce Department staff
in Kenya, including several who assisted Bushnell down 21 flights
of stairs, and to the wives of two staff members who died in the
blast.
	   ``We are alive and we are doing business. It can't get better
than that,'' Bushnell said.
	   Daley was to leave for Nigeria later Thursday and then head to
the Ivory Coast.

Customs workers continue strike as government ponders action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with chief prosecutor ordering customs officers to
release fuel trucks parked at refinery depot &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With fuel supplies running critically low,
the government and striking customs workers were on a collision
course Thursday after union leaders ignored a court order to return
to work.
	   The walkout, which began Monday, has severely cut the flow of
gasoline and heating oil _ which mostly arrives in Greece via
non-European Union nations. Goods shipped from EU partners are not
affected by the strike.
	   Many gas stations have run dry and heating oil is growing scarce
_ a particular problem in chilly northern Greece.
	   Chief Athens prosecutor Giorgos Koliokostas ordered customs
officers to release about 100 fuel trucks parked at Greece's main
refinery, on the outskirts of the capital. Police were told to
arrest anyone preventing the trucks, which have paid customs
duties, from leaving the depot.
	   Koliokostas also launched an investigation to determine if the
strikers had provoked a national emergency.

Ex-FBI agent: Russian mafia operations extended to U.S. cities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NAOMI KOPPEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A reputed Russian mafia boss on trial in
Switzerland for membership in a criminal organization had
operations in New York, Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, a former
FBI agent testified today.
	   Retired special agent Robert Levinson said the Moscow-based
Solntsevskaya crime organization, allegedly headed by Sergei
Mikhailov, took over a nightclub in New York's Brighton Beach area
and another in Los Angeles.
	   ``They became a center for drugs and a meeting place for
racketeers,'' said Levinson, who spent four years investigating the
Russian mafia.
	   Mikhailov also invested several hundred thousand dollars in a
Houston car dealership, Levinson said.
	   Mikhailov, 40, who is also charged with breaking Swiss property
laws in acquiring a villa near Geneva, faces a maximum 7{ years in
prison if convicted.
	   He has denied any connection to the crime group. The trial,
which began Monday, is expected to hear evidence from more than 90
witnesses.
	   Levinson told the court today that Mikhailov and his associates
headed Solntsevskaya and directed so-called ``combat brigades''
specialized in assassination.
	   ``The organization was engaged regularly in the extortion of
businesses, the distribution of drugs including cocaine,
counterfeiting of currency and trafficking in arms,'' Levinson
said.
	   ``They would commit murders in Russia and other countries in
Europe and then come to Miami ... where they would stay by the
beach and wait for the heat to cool off,'' he said.
	   Levinson also worked on the case of Russian mafia godfather
Vyacheslav Ivankov, imprisoned for nearly 10 years in New York last
year.

Top general instigated executions of thousands, indictment says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS throughout to ADD reaction from Srebrenica
survivors; UPDATES with Krstic's arrival in The Hague. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Survivors of the Bosnian war's
worst massacre expressed joy Thursday that a top Serb military
leaders charged with orchestrating the killings would soon stand
trial for genocide.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic, indicted on U.N. charges that he and
others guided the soldiers who massacred thousands of Muslims and
dumped them in mass graves, was arrested by U.S. members of the
NATO peacekeeping force on Wednesday.
	   He arrived late Thursday in The Hague, where the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal will try him for genocide, war crimes, crimes
against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   Krstic is the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be
arrested for U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges. An
arraignment date has not been set.
	   Details of his indictment _ unsealed and made public Thursday _
allege that offenses allegedly committed by his troops occurred
following the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N. so-called ``safe
haven'' of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most of the members of the Bosnian Muslim population of
the Srebrenica enclave, using automatic weapons, hand grenades and
other weaponry.
	   In Sarajevo, survivors of the Srebrenica massacre applauded
Krstic's arrest.
	   ``Since July 13, 1995, I've never felt happiness in my heart,''
Kada Hotic told The Associated Press, referring to the date the
Serbs overran the town. ``Last night when I heard he was arrested,
I felt happy.''
	   Another survivor, Munira Subasic, said she hoped Krstic ``will
give answers to where are our relatives, our children.''
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October. It had been kept secret so he wouldn't be prompted to
flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic, who held the rank of general-major during the Srebrenica
operation, is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic _ the tribunal's top two suspects _
also have been indicted on genocide charges for allegedly
orchestrating the massacres at Srebrenica. Both remain at large.
	   Krstic was the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ U.S. rapper Coolio was found guilty
Thursday of charges stemming from a confrontation with a boutique
owner who said the star punched her when she tried to stop him from
taking merchandise without paying.
	   A court in Stuttgart sentenced Coolio to six months probation
and fined him 50,000 marks (dlrs 30,000) after convicting him of
being an accessory to robbery and causing bodily injury.
	   The Grammy-award winning artist and six members of his band, the
40 Thievs, are accused of leaving the boutique in the Stuttgart
suburb last Nov. 20 with clothing worth 1,500 marks (dlrs 940).
	   Coolio, 35, has denied punching the woman and said the incident
was a misunderstanding. He says he signed autographs in the
boutique, and that in exchange a clothing company had promised him
and his group free outfits.
	   A dozen German and foreign news cameras trailed the court to the
boutique Thursday, where the owner walked through the incident.
	   Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., has already paid
the boutique owner 5,000 marks (dlrs 3,000) damages. He faced a
maximum sentence of four years.
	   Four members of Coolio's group also were charged, but did not
show up for trial. The judge has issued warrants for their arrest.
	   The rapper won a Grammy for best rap solo in 1996 for
``Gangsta's Paradise,'' which was featured in the film ``Dangerous
Minds.'' He is scheduled to tour Germany in January.

England bids to foil Springboks 18-win record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ This time last year, England halted New Zealand's
streak of 11 straight wins in 1997 by gaining a draw at Twickenham.
	   Now Lawrence Dallaglio's team aims to stop South Africa from
setting a world record of 18 wins in a row.
	   The Springboks arrive at Twickenham saying all they want to do
is beat the English. But the big prize is achieving a Grand Slam
sweep of all British Isles nations _ having already beaten Wales,
Scotland and Ireland _ and improving on the 17-match winning streak
it now shares with New Zealand.
	   ``The world record is not as important as beating England,''
South African coach Nick Mallett said in a bid to take his players'
minds off the streak.
	   ``We cannot afford to lose any game and we will not class this
as a successful tour if we don't beat England,'' he said. ``A world
record and a Grand Slam is just an addendum to winning this game.''
	   South Africa needs little motivation for this match and has the
players capable of teaching England a lesson in fast-handling,
all-action rugby.
	   Fly half Henry Honiball is in standout form with his visionary
play, long passes and tactical kicking, and speedy back row forward
Bobby Skinstad is emerging as one of the best runners, handlers and
tacklers in the game.
	   Toronto-born Christian Stewart, who played 14 times for Canada
before switching to South Africa where he was raised, is part of a
fast, well-organized three-quarter line. Scrum half Joost van der
Westhuizen will become only the second South African, after lock
forward Mark Andrews, to make 50 international appearances.
	   The Springboks, who defend their World Cup title next year, are
expected to beat England. But the All Blacks were favored to do the
same in early December last year and were held 26-26 after trailing
20-3.
	   England has the power and the expertise to surprise South Africa
on Saturday. The problem is, the English are not playing well.
	   They struggled to beat Italy in a World Cup qualifying game last
month. Last week, they lost 12-11 to below-strength Australia,
despite scoring the only try of the match.
	   Coach Clive Woodward knows his players are underperforming as he
tries to get them tuned for the upcoming Five Nations championship
and the World Cup next October.
	   Roared on by 75,000 fans at Twickenham, however, England could
rise to the occasion and beat the South Africans, who are at the
end of a gruelling tour.
	   The Springboks will field an unchanged team if hooker Grant
Dalton shakes off a hamstring injury. The big contest of the match
will be between the two back rows _ Johan Erasmus, Skinstad and
team captain Gary Teichman against England captain Dallaglio, Neil
Back and Richard Hill.
	   The same England back row played against New Zealand last year
and Hill and Dallaglio both scored tries. Tim Rodber replaces
Garath Archer at second row in the only change in the pack from
that game.
	   Behind the scrum, however, only center Phil de Glanville keeps
his place. The rest are all changed from 12 months ago, with South
African-born Mike Catt returning to fly half, Jeremy Guscott back
at center, Tony Underwood on the right and Dan Luger replacing
Austin Healey on the left wing.
	   Dallaglio saluted the Springboks' achievement at winning 17 in a
row but said that was a huge motivation for his team to stop it
going any further.
	   ``Equalling New Zealand's record of 17 is a fantastic
achievement, given the caliber of the opposition and the fact that
the bulk of their matches have been away from home,'' the England
captain said.
	   ``They have played all the top sides in the world and I am sure
that if they beat us they will think that they can extend the
record through the 20 mark at the start of their season.
	   ``But we don't need any other motivation than the fact that we
are playing the world champions and want to end a disappointing
year on a memorable high.''
	   Lineups:
	   England _ Nick Beal; Tony Underwood, Phil de Glanville, Jeremy
Guscott, Dan Luger; Mike Catt, Matt Dawson; Jason Leonard, Richard
Cockerill, Darren Garforth, Martin Johnson, Tim Rodber, Lawrence
Dallaglio (captain), Neil Black, Richard Hill.
	   South Africa _ Percy Montgomery; Stefan Terblanche, Andre
Snyman, Christian Stewart, Pieter Rossouw; Henry Honiball, Joost
van der Westhuizen; Adrian Garvey, James Dalton, Robbie Kempson,
Mark Andrews, Krynauw Otto, Johan Erasmus, Bobby Skinstad, Gary
Teichmann (captain).

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Outgoing Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said
in his farewell remarks Thursday that his ``painful'' decision to
quit was his own and denied he was pushed.
	   Hariri declined to form another government after what appeared
to be a power struggle with the new president, Emile Lahoud.
	   On Wednesday, Lahoud appointed Salim Hoss, a U.S.-educated
economist to become Lebanon's next prime minister after a majority
of the deputies in the 128-seat Parliament expressed their support
for him.
	   Hoss spent Thursday discussing with legislators about the makeup
of his Cabinet, which is expected to be formed early next week.
	   Rumors, fueled by Hariri's surprise departure, suggested that
the premier may have lost a power struggle to the assertive Lahoud,
the 62-year-old army commander who was unanimously elected
president by Parliament in October and took office Nov. 24.
	   But at a news conference Thursday, Hariri, who had been certain
to be re-named as prime minister, said he bowed out because of what
he described was the president's violation of the constitution in
naming him as premier.
	   When Lahoud first asked legislators who they wanted as prime
minister, 31 of 128 lawmakers declined to name a candidate and
effectively gave their vote to the president. Lahoud named Hariri,
who had been backed by 83 legislators.
	   Hariri said this was wrong as ``we should not put the president
in a position where he can be part'' of the political bargaining.
	   However, experts say the constitutional clause on which Hariri
bases his argument is open to interpretation.
	   ``It was a painful decision but the right one,'' Hariri told
reporters, dismissing the rumors that he was forced out by Lahoud
and his political foe, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   ``I am out of the government by my own will,'' he stressed. The
billionaire businessman has been prime minister since 1992.
	   He said he had even prepared an acceptance speech, lending some
credence to the speculations that he was pushed out.
	   On Monday, when Hariri announced the withdrawal of his
candidacy, he appeared to be uncomfortable with a majority that
fell short of the overwhelming support he had enjoyed in the past.
	   The prime minister was also reported to taken aback that some of
his allies had snubbed him and by the fact that he had needed the
backing of Berri's 19-seat bloc in Parliament to receive 83 votes.
	   Hariri had virtually run the country under former President
Elias Hrawi, whose term ended Nov. 24.
	   As the architect of the multibillion dollar drive to rebuild the
country from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war, Hariri is
credited with restoring economic confidence and attracting
investment to this small Arab country.
	   On Thursday, the 53-year-old Hariri took pride in his work over
the past six years, saying he was leaving office with his
``conscience clear'' and stressing that the achievements made were
a ``precious trust'' in the hands of the new government.
	   With his advisers present, the prime minister said he will
continue to serve the nation as a member of the legislature and
head of a political bloc in Parliament.
	   Hoss, in his acceptance speech Wednesday, sought to calm fears
that Hariri's departure would undermine the reconstruction program
or devalue the currency.
	   He said his government would honor contracts signed but will
execute ``austerity to the extreme'' in government spending.
	   Hariri said Thursday that he was pleased with Hoss' remarks but
that he would watch the new government's policies and will speak
out if he fails to convince the new leadership.
	   Hariri, whose government remains in caretaker capacity until the
new Cabinet is installed, left Thursday for Syria on his way to the
United States on a private visit.

Manchester United reportedly seeking Japanese star of Perugia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Manchester United has made an unsuccessful
28 billion lire (dlrs 16.6 million) bid for Hidetoshi Nakata, the
Japanese star-forward of Italian first division Perugia, Italy's
largest sports daily reported Thursday.
	   Milan's Gazzetta dello Sport wrote that the English Premier
League club has been repeatedly bidding for Nakata in the last few
weeks, getting only refusals from Perugia so far.
	   The young Japanese player is a current sensation in the Italian
Serie A after scoring six goals in 10 league games on his first
season with Perugia.
	   His spectacular overhead kick in last Sunday's match against
Piacenza - the first of his two goals _ was repeatedly shown by
Italian television networks.
	   Perugia officials said several clubs have been seeking Nakata
recently, but declined to comment on Manchester United reported
bid.
	   Gazzetta also reported that negotiations for the transfer of
Internazionale's Nigerian star Nwankwo Kanu to Arsenal have
collapsed at the last minute.

expenses and salaries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament's legislators
on Thursday decided to streamline their salaries and expenses after
they had come under increasing criticism of public opinion as being
too lavish.
	   A ``common statute'' for members of parliament set their wage at
the average wage of 5.677 Ecus (dlrs 6,580) a month and also
included a decision to bring travel expenses in line with real
costs.
	   Up to now a Spanish parliamentarian received only 2.827 Ecus
(dlrs 3,280) a month, while Italy's legislators topped the list
with 9.635 Ecus (dlrs 11,175). Daily expenses in Brussels stood at
some 9,000 Belgian francs (dlrs 265).
	   European Parliament's total travel bill every year for the 625
parliamentarians from 15 countries costs the taxpayers almost dlrs
30 million.

Several incidents reported as U.S. envoy presents Serbs with new
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo peace plan draft
 &UR; Eds AMs; UPDATES with more incidents reported; statement from
Milutinovic, other details &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the worst breach of the Kosovo
cease-fire, Yugoslav border guards killed eight ethnic Albanians on
Thursday. Meanwhile, a U.S. envoy sought to persuade Serbs to
accept a peace plan before the tense province plunges into renewed
war.
	   Several other armed incidents were reported Thursday as U.S.
envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, presented Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic with a revised draft plan for the future of the
Serb province.
	   Hill said some progress toward a permanent peace was being made,
but also warned that time was at a premium because of fears that
fighting, now at a lull, could resume by spring.
	   ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' Hill said. ``Spring should be the
time for plowing and not for fighting.''
	   The eight armed ethnic Albanians were killed near the town of
Prizren when nine of them fired on Yugoslav soldiers guarding the
border with Albania, the pro-government Serbian Media Center said.
Yugoslav troops were not injured, the center said
	   Yugoslavia's army command confirmed the deaths and said the
ethnic Albanians were trying to cross the border into Kosovo
``illegally.''
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   The border clash took place one day after three ethnic Albanians
were gunned down in their car in Kosovo's capital Pristina. A woman
pedestrian was injured. Serbian police said they found three
automatic weapons and two hand grenades in the car, which was raked
by machine-gun fire.
	   On Thursday, rebel spokesman Adem Demaci blamed the killings on
Serbia's secret police, saying one of the victims was a leading
member of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army while the two others
were civilians: a journalist of the main Albanian language
newspaper Bujku and a university student.
	   The journalist, Afrim Malici, had complained that he had been
followed by Serbia's secret service, his colleagues said.
	   Before meeting Milutinovic in Belgrade on Thursday, Hill said
the new draft reflects previous comments by rival Serb and ethnic
Albanian officials on how to achieve a settlement for the ethnic
Albanian-majority province in southern Serbia.
	   Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own peace deal for Kosovo,
defying an earlier U.S. plan and warning that anything beyond some
sort of self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war.
	   Secessionist ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian
proposal.
	   In a statement after meeting Hill, Milutinovic said he would
``carefully study'' the new U.S. proposal, but added that the
Serbian plan should be ``the main basis for the political
solution'' of the Kosovo crisis.
	   Hill said in a statement after the talks that ``President
Milutinovic agreed to to study the text and give us his comments as
soon as possible.''
	   Kosovo's Albanian leadership wants independence from Serbia but
is willing to settle for full autonomy as a first step. Serbia and
the Serb leaders of Yugoslavia are strongly opposed to any plan on
Kosovo that would sidestep Serbia.
	   Hill did not elaborate, but said the new plan does not
explicitly specify whether Kosovo will become the third Yugoslav
republic or would remain a Serb province. Republic status for
Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   Hill told The Associated Press that he hoped the new plan would
``shift the momentum from one of violence to one of political
settlement.'' He planned to meet ethnic Albanian officials on
Friday to present them with the new plan.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against Kosovo separatists in February.
	   Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _ after Milosevic agreed on a
cease-fire and promised U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke Oct. 12 to end
the Kosovo campaign and begin political negotiations on the
province's future.
	   In more separate incidents, a Serb man was injured on the main
Pristina-Pec road Thursday when ethnic Albanian rebels shot at his
car when he refused their order to stop, the Serb media center
reported.
	   It also said that an ethnic Albanian was killed ``by a masked
gunman'' with Kosovo Liberation Army markings while traveling on
the same road Wednesday.

Leverkusen won't let go Brazilian-born forward to another
</HEADLINE>
Bundesliga club &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) _ Paulo Rink, the unhappy
Brazilian-born forward of Bayer Leverkusen, won't be allowed to
transfer to another Bundesliga club, but might be able to move
abroad, his club manager said Thursday.
	   Rink, who now has German citizenship, has been benched by
Leverkusen coach Christoph Daum in favor of Ulf Kirsten and Erik
Meijer, a Dutchman.
	   Stuttgart and Hertha Berlin have expressed interest in acquiring
the forward, who is unhappy with sitting on the bench.
	   But Reiner Calmund, the powerful Leverkusen business manager,
ruled out any such transfer to another Bundesliga club.
	   ``If any player says again that he won't sit on the bench, then
he really won't be released, even if we have to take a financial
loss,'' Calmund said.
	   ``If Rink wants to move on at some point, it won't be to Hertha
Berlin or Stuttgart. We have very different financial
possibilities. He would go to southern Europe or Brazil,'' Calmund
said.
	   Rink received German citizenship this summer but his national
team career ended after one game with the resignation of coach
Berti Vogts in September.
	   He has not been considered by new coach Erich Ribbeck and has
not been able to establish himself as a starter in Leverkusen.

 &UR; Bomb in western Algeria kills 14, injures 23

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A homemade bomb exploded at a market in
western Algeria on Thursday, killing 14 people and injuring 23
others, local police said.
	   The explosion occurred at 11:15 a.m. in Ein Delfa near Khemis
Miliana, about 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of Algiers, police
said on customary anonymity.
	   They gave no further details, and hospital officials could not
immediately be reached.
	   It was the sixth violent attack in a week, a week that saw the
visit of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins this year on Dec.
20, has been marred by waves of violence since the insurgency
began. This year has proved no exception.
	   Twelve villagers were slaughtered in their sleep in a massacre
early Wednesday. Algerian security forces immediately launched a
search for the armed attackers in the Sidi Rached region about 60
miles west of Algiers.
	   The attack on the villagers came as Annan met with Algerian
President Liamine Zeroual, on a visit aimed at ending the conflict
in the Western Sahara.
	   On Sunday, officials said four attacks in the western mountains
of Algeria had left seven people dead.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in an insurgency that erupted
when Algeria's military-backed government canceled January 1992
elections that an Islamic fundamentalist group, the Islamic
Salvation Front, was poised to win.

Train derails in western India, 8 killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A high-speed train jumped the tracks in
western India on Thursday, killing eight people and injuring 42 in
the latest in a series of railroad accidents.
	   Eleven cars of the Kurla-Howrah Express tumbled over the tracks
near the town of Jalgaon in Maharashtra state, Press Trust of India
said. Details of the accident were sketchy but the domestic news
agency quoted officials as saying five cars were badly damaged.
	   At least 211 people died last week when the Sealdah Express
collided with the Frontier Mail near Khanna in the state of Punjab.
	   On Wednesday, a passenger train derailed just as a freight train
was passing by in the western state of Rajasthan. No one was
injured.
	   India has around 300 accidents a year on its railways, the
largest rail network under one management in the world. Three years
ago, a train slammed into a stationary train, killing 358 people.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley
said Thursday he wants to boost trade between Africa and America,
but advised Kenya that attracting U.S. business means ``your
economic house must be in order.''
	   Daley, who is on the second leg of his four-country mission to
Africa with a 16-member trade delegation, said corruption,
political stability, regional markets and transparency were all
issues of concern to companies looking for new markets or
investment opportunities.
	   ``This is the message I gave to the trade minister: this is a
good opportunity to sell your markets ... but these companies are
not going to invest here if they don't see things change,'' Daley
told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier, the secretary, who met Thursday with President Daniel
arap Moi, regional ministers and business leaders, told a luncheon
in his honor that representatives of the companies traveling with
him, including Coca Cola, DuPont, Chevron, Eastman Kodak, and
PanAmSat, a satellite company, are being courted by countries all
over the world.
	   ``Every area of the world wants their business,'' Daley said.
``And I think, to be frank with you, they are more skittish to
invest, at least in the short term, because of problems with
Asia.''
	   Daley said the first thing businesses look at is the economic
situation.
	   ``Your economic house must be in order,'' he said. ``I encourage
Kenya to build on the progress to date in privatizing and cutting
trade barriers,'' he said.
	   He said infrastructure in Kenya was also cause for concern in
terms of getting products to market quickly, the lack of efficient
phone lines and reliable power, and that the rebellion being fought
in Congo was a destabilizing factor for the entire region.
	   The secretary dismissed complaints about 1996 U.S. quotas on
textile imports which led several Kenyan textile manufacturers to
close, saying Kenya was not even meeting the existing quotas.
	   ``This says to me that the private sector in Kenya has got to
get it together,'' the secretary said in a brief interview.
	   But corruption and the legal structures, meaning access to an
impartial judge and to rules that won't change arbitrarily, are key
concerns, Daley said.
	   In South Africa earlier this week, Daley told southern African
businessmen corruption was the greatest obstacle to foreign
investment in Africa.
	   Kenyan trade and manufacturing officials were quick to
acknowledge corruption, and insisted they were fighting it.
	   ``Kenya is a democratic country. Kenya is a free country ...
determined to root out every level of corruption in our society,''
Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho assured his visitors.
	   Still, four cooperation understandings were signed Thursday: one
to harmonize U.S. and Kenyan size standards for easier marketing; a
new loan from the U.S. government's Export-Import Bank for Kenya
Airways to purchase a Boeing 737-300 aircraft; and the private U.S.
firm Monsanto's sharing of a virus-resistant sweet potato with
Kenya's Agricultral Research Institute.
	   A fourth memorandum of understanding was signed between the
Kenyan government and the Overseas Investment Corporation, a U.S.
government company which sells political risk insurance and
financing to U.S. companies, to promote investment in Kenya.
	   Daley assured his audience that he believed the Growth and
Opportunities Act, which would require President Clinton to start
free-trade negotiations with African countries and increase funding
to back U.S. investments in Africa, would pass early next year.
	   He said the bill passed the House of Representatives but died in
the Senate before Congress recessed in October only because of
other issues that had been linked to it in the Senate vote.
	   The visit, Daley's third to Africa this year, had been postponed
from September after the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi
left 213 people dead.
	   During a luncheon in Daley's honor, Daley and U.S. Ambassador
Prudence Bushnell distributed awards to Commerce Department staff
in Kenya, including several who assisted Bushnell down 21 flights
of stairs, and to the wives of two staff members who died in the
blast.
	   ``We are alive and we are doing business. It can't get better
than that,'' Bushnell said.
	   Daley was to leave for Nigeria later Thursday and then head to
the Ivory Coast.

Lebanon's Hariri dispels rumors he was ousted premier

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Outgoing Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said in his farewell remarks Thursday that the ``painful''
decision to quit was his own and denied he was ousted in a
political coup.
	   Hariri declined to form a government after what appeared to be a
power struggle with the new president, Emile Lahoud.
	   On Wednesday, Lahoud appointed Salim Hoss, a U.S.-educated
economist, to become Lebanon's next prime minister after a majority
of the 128-member Parliament expressed support for him.
	   Hoss spent Thursday discussing with legislators the makeup of
his Cabinet, which is expected to be formed early next week.
	   Rumors, fueled by Hariri's sudden and surprise departure,
suggested that the premier may have lost a power struggle to the
assertive Lahoud, the 62-year-old army commander who was
unanimously elected president by Parliament in October and took
office Nov. 24.
	   But at a news conference Thursday, Hariri, who had been certain
to be renamed as prime minister, said he bowed out because of what
he described was the president's violation of constitutional rules
in naming him as premier.
	   When Lahoud first asked legislators who they wanted as prime
minister, 31 of 128 lawmakers declined to name a candidate and
effectively gave their vote to the president. Lahoud named Hariri,
who had been backed by 83 legislators.
	   Hariri said it was wrong to ``put the president in a position
where he can be part'' of the political bargaining.
	   However, experts say the constitutional clause on which Hariri
bases his argument is open to interpretation.
	   Lahoud had initially been inclined to re-appoint Hariri, the
billionaire businessman who had been prime minister since 1992.
	   As the architect of the multibillion dollar drive to rebuild the
country from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war, Hariri is
credited with restoring economic confidence and attracting new
investment to Lebanon.
	   Hoss, in his acceptance speech Wednesday, sought to calm fears
that Hariri's departure would undermine the reconstruction program
or devalue the currency.

FA demands explanation on Kinnear's `betting' comments

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear could get his club
in trouble for his comments on betting.
	   The Football Association on Thursday demanded an urgent
explanation for Kinnear's comments following Wimbledon's 2-1
victory over Chelsea in the League Cup quarterfinals.
	   ``We were 66-1 (to win the cup) at the start of the season and I
think a few of the lads had a few quid on,'' he said.
	   Reacting to the FA's demand, Kinnear denied he was refering to
his players.
	   ``When I said the lads had a few quid on us I was talking about
friends of mine, not the players,'' said the Wimbledon manager, who
described the FA's move as ``an absolute joke.''

Jordanians beseech God for rain

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's prime minister and thousands of
other citizens prayed for rain Thursday as a drought threatened
crops in this desert kingdom.
	   Muslim clerics had called for nationwide prayers in the belief
that God will grant rain if one asks for His forgiveness. Women,
children and animals usually take part in the ceremony in order to
beseech God to be merciful for their sake.
	   In Amman, about 1,500 people took part in the prayers, including
Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh and senior security officials, at an
empty lot on the city's outskirts.
	   Thousands more people attended similar prayer ceremonies in
other towns, the state-run Petra News Agency reported.
	   ``I am here to ask forgiveness from God and beg him to bring us
rain,'' said housewife Fayzeh Khalil after finishing her prayers in
Amman.
	   Rainfall constitutes two thirds of the water supply in Jordan.
	   Israel, Jordan's western neighbor, pumped water to the country
in 1996 when it was suffering an acute drought after successive dry
winters.
	   The Weather Department has warned that this year's drought could
kill crops.

Inmates riot in Costa Rica's main prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Inmates rioted in Costa Rica's main
prison Thursday after guards killed a prisoner and wounded six as
they tried to escape.
	   Riot police, carrying shields and launching tear gas, stormed La
Reforma prison in northeastern San Jose early Thursday to end the
uprising of 500 inmates.
	   At least 25 prisoners identified as leaders of the riot were
transferred to other prisons, Channel 6 television reported.
	   The riot began after guards foiled the escape attempt. The
inmates dug a tunnel under a wall, and guards opened fire as they
tried to run, said Justice Minister Monica Nagel.
	   Violence in Costa Rica's overcrowded prisons is nothing new. On
Monday, two prisoners were killed and two were wounded in the same
prison in what authorities called a fight between gangs in the
prison.
	   Escape attempts are common, and President Miguel Angel Rodriguez
has given guards specific orders to open fire on any prisoners who
try to escape. Human rights groups have criticized the
instructions.
	   Costa Rica has 5,300 prisoners, while its prisons have a
capacity of less than half that.

Serbs report finding more than 80 bodies in mass graves

<TEXT>
	   KULA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Serb forensic experts searching
for victims of wartime atrocities have recovered 81 bodies from
various cemeteries in Sarajevo over the past 10 days, they said
today.
	   Among the bodies are 27 presumed victims of Musan Topalovic, the
Bosnian Muslim warlord known as Caco, the experts told reporters.
Caco, killed later in a government sweep on criminals, massacred
more than two dozen Serb civilians in 1993 and left their bodies in
a pit at the city's edge.
	   Sarajevo's Muslim authorities later had the bodies buried in a
Sarajevo cemetery from where the Serb teams exhumed them under an
agreement with Bosnia's Muslim officials and foreign diplomats
overseeing postwar Bosnia.
	   Milan Ivancevic, a member of the Serb forensic team, praised the
``great help from ... Muslim and international officials.''
	   The Serb figures were contested by Vlado Raguz, an undertaker in
charge of funerals in Sarajevo during the war. He asserted in
separate comments that among the remains exhumed by the Serbs was a
Croat who died of natural causes.
	   About 200,000 people were killed in the 3{ year Bosnian war that
ended in 1995 with the U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement. An
additional 20,000 went missing and are feared dead.
	   Exhumations have been conducted by all three sides _ Muslims,
Croats and Serbs _ since 1995 in an effort to track down the fate
of the missing. No totals exist on the number of bodies recovered
since then.
	   But international and Muslim experts have recovered more than
2,000 bodies in northwestern Bosnia, many of them apparently
Srebrenica inhabitants massacred after the Serbs overran the Muslim
enclave in 1995.

Naumann: Poland needs years to reach full NATO integration

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland will need a ``couple of years'' to
achieve full ``interoperability'' with NATO, but can take initial
steps toward that goal next year, a top official of the Western
alliance said Thursday.
	   Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of NATO's military committee,
listed several conditions that Poland, a former Warsaw Pact nation
and NATO enemy, has to meet before it reaches interoperability _
meaning Polish forces can interchange with NATO forces.
	   Those conditions for Poland's military include adapting to all
NATO standards and commands, a working knowledge of English, and
integrating the Polish air defense system with the NATO system.
	   Poland is scheduled to join the Czech Republic and Hungary as
the first former Soviet bloc countries to become NATO members at
the NATO summit in Washington in April.
	   Marek Siwiec, the head of Poland's National Security Office,
said Poland would like to join NATO before the summit so that it
can take part as a full member in the policy discussions at the
meeting, the PAP state news agency reported Thursday.
	   But Siwiec, on a trip to Washington, said Poland must first
adopt a new law on classified information to bring it in line with
Western standards, PAP reported.
	   A bill on protecting state secrets has been approved by the
government and needs approval from parliament.
	   Ending a three-day visit to Poland, Naumann said Poland's
earliest date for joining NATO would be in March, because of
procedural reasons. He also said Poland could reach an initial
stage of ``interoperability'' with NATO in 1999.
	   But he stressed it would take a few years for Polish forces to
achieve full interoperability, and said the government must support
the transition process with enough money to make it happen.
	   Facing broad social needs in the transition from decades of
communist rule to a market-led economy, government officials say
they lack the money to make all the needed changes right away.
	   Naumann also expressed his support for a NATO doctrine that
allows the alliance to use nuclear weapons before being attacked by
them _ the so-called ``first-use'' doctrine.
	   Germany has called for NATO to drop the policy, but also said it
would go along with whatever decision NATO reaches on the matter.
	   ``As a military, I strongly believe that we should retain
uncertainty in the opponent's risk calculation in order to preserve
peace,'' Naumann said. ``For that reason I am strongly opposed to
this idea of no-first use policy because it would make peace less
likely and war more likely.''

Price takes first-round lead with 67

 &UR; EDS: Stands as 3rd Ld-Writethru to African, European lines to

Woods' birdie-bogey sequence. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Zimbabwe's Nick Price shot a
5-under-par 67 and took a two-stroke lead over Americans Mark
O'Meara and Justin Leonard and Germany's Bernhard Langer in
Thursday's first round of the Million Dollar Challenge.
	   The defending champion finished with consecutive birdies in his
six-birdie, one-bogey round over the windswept 7,597-yard
(6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club course.
	   South African hometown hero Ernie Els was three strokes back at
70 while American Tiger Woods shot an even-par 72 in the elite
12-man field of the world's top golfers vying for the largest
single prize in golf.
	   ``This course likes me,'' said Price, who won the event in 1993
with a record 24 under par. ``It makes me focus a lot more than I
do normally.''
	   Unusually strong, shifting winds, more Scottish style than
African, caused some of the players to guess on the right club, he
said.
	   Price is coming off his third victory in four years at the
Zimbabwe Open, closing with a Royal Harare-record 9-under-par 63
for a five-stroke victory.
	   ``This is a game of momentum. No doubt about it,'' he said.
	   O'Meara, winner of the U.S. Masters and British Open titles and
playing in the twosome ahead of Price, momentarily held the the
lead with a quick start on the back nine.
	   After making the turn at 1 under, he birdied Nos. 11, 13 and 14
to reach 4 under, but he gave the lead right back on the next hole
when Price also birdied 14 and O'Meara proceeded to bogey 15.
	   O'Meara started the day a relieved man after his clubs finally
arrived from Florida Wednesday night.
	   Els birdied each of the first four holes to go 4 under but
slowly gave it nearly all back, with bogeys on 6, 11 and 17. He
also birdied 10.
	   ``It was really a long course out there today,'' he said of the
layout that had been battered by heavy rain and a day where a
swirling wind made things even more difficult for the elite 12-man
field.
	   In his first round of African golf, Woods started with a birdie
on No. 2 hole but dropped to 2 over by the turn with a bogey at 7
and a double bogey on the par-4 eighth.
	   ``I'm very pleased with the way I'm striking the ball,'' he
said. ``It feels like I'm making progress.''
	   Woods said playing in South Africa had special meaning for him
as ``a person of color.''
	   ``To play golf in Africa, particularly South Africa _ it's
something I've wanted to do,'' he said.

Morocco submits official World Cup 2006 bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Morocco has formally notified FIFA of
its interest in hosting the 2006 World Cup finals, world soccer's
governing body confirmed Thursday.
	   The north African country, which submitted its notification on
Wednesday, is the sixth country to confirm it wants the tournament.
	   It follows Germany, England, Brazil, Egypt and Ghana.
	   Prospective candidates have until Dec. 31 to signal their intent
and until the end of July to submit their full bid documents.
FIFA's 24-member Executive Committee will decide in March 2000.
	   In Johannesburg last week, FIFA President Sepp Blatter declared
that FIFA had a ``responsibility'' to make sure the tournament
takes place in Africa.
	   South Africa is expected to formally signal its interest this
month. Blatter has long made it clear that he wants the finals to
be awarded to the country.
	   The case of both Germany and England has been weakened by the
fact that they are both from the same continent. The 2002 finals
are being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA has said
co-hosting would be a one-time exception.

U.N. appeals for dlrs 153 million in Mitch relief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations on Thursday appealed for some
dlrs 153 million to help countries hit by Hurricane Mitch get
through the next six months.
	   The new joint appeal to donors by U.N. agencies is intended to
``tide over'' aid efforts while rebuilding programs for individual
countries are worked out, according to a U.N. statement.
	   Some dlrs 83 million of the money is intended for Honduras and
dlrs 38 million for Nicaragua. The rest will go to El Salvador,
Guatemala and Belize.
	   More than 9,000 people were killed when the hurricane struck a
month ago, most in Honduras. More than a million people were left
homeless.
	   ``There is now an urgent need for humanitarian assistance,
particularly to the poorest, in the form of clean water and food,
shelter, emergency health services, education as well as urgently
needed help in agriculture,'' the U.N. agencies said.

EU Commission denies it eying phone tax to help finance EU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU head office denied Thursday it
planned to propose a telephone tax to help fund the European Union
and its ambitious aspirations to take in a dozen newcomers.
	   In a statement it said a story to that effect in the German
tabloid daily Bild ``is wrong.''
	   Spokeswoman Martine Reichert said the commission had looked at
studies dealing with new income for the EU.
	   One mentioned a ``communications'' or ``telephone tax'' but that
had been dismissed as unrealistic. ``There is no proposal
whatsoever of the commission in this context,'' Reichert added.
	   The urgency with which the EU head office denied the report
follows the emergence of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's leftist
government in Germany that has led to a split among EU members
about tax issues.
	   Schroeder favors EU governments deciding on such issues by
majority voting. EU rules now require unanimous decisions and
Britain and other EU members want to keep it that way.
	   In Britain's tabloid press has been on a virulent crusade of
late against German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, calling him
Europe's ``most dangerous man.''
	   The EU's annual budget _ some dlrs 100 billion this year _ is
funded largely through sales tax contributions and a flat fee that
reflects each EU member's gross national product. Pressure is
rising to find a new source of income as the EU looks at taking in
12 newcomers in the decade ahead.

Polish consortium takes over historic Gdansk Shipyard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish shipbuilding consortium on
Thursday became the new owner of the historic Gdansk Shipyard,
where the Solidarity movement was born in 1980.
	   The shipyard, now bankrupt, was controlled by a
government-appointed receiver who signed the final documents
shortly after midnight to allow the consortium to take it over,
said Maciej Paluszynski, a spokesman for the receiver.
	   The consortium has until Monday to pay 115 million zloty (dlrs
33 million) for the state-owned shipyard, which has debts of at
least 628 million zloty (dlrs 180 million).
	   Under the agreement, the new owners will maintain Gdansk
Shipyard as a separate company and pledged to spend up to dlrs 100
million in the next 12 years to modernize the shipyard and create
1,000 more jobs.
	   The shipyard currently employs 2,500 people, Paluszynski said.
	   At the height of anti-communist strikes in August 1980, shipyard
electrician Lech Walesa launched Solidarity, the former East Bloc's
first independent trade union. It became a pro-democracy movement
that led Poles to topple the totalitarian regime in 1989, and
Walesa became the first post-communist president.
	   On Aug. 8, 1996, the government declared the indebted shipyard
bankrupt after banks refused to grant further credits.

Banana bickering worsens trans-Atlantic trade climate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes from trade negotiator, details, ADDS
byline
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Trans-Atlantic trade relations took a
turn for the worse Thursday with the European Union calling U.S.
demands over a banana dispute ``ridiculous,'' and warning
Washington's threat of sanctions bodes ill for next year's world
trade negotiations.
	   Chief EU trade negotiator Leon Brittan appealed to U.S.
authorities to reconsider an European proposal to settle the banana
dispute at a special panel at the World Trade Organization instead
of threatening sanctions.
	   Washington alleges the new EU banana import regime is unfair to
South American distributors, most of which are owned by U.S.
companies. The WTO had already condemned an earlier EU banana
import system, but Brittan said the new regime met all the WTO
concerns.
	   Washington disagrees and is threatening to impose sanctions
worth up to dlrs 1.5 billion on a wide range of EU products even
before the WTO comes up with a new decision, Brittan said. He
denounced the March 3 deadline set by the U.S. for resolving the
issue.
	   ``I said that was ridiculous,'' Brittan told reporters.
``Sentence first, trial afterwards is what the United States are
proposing.''
	   Under normal WTO procedure, a ruling on the new EU regime would
take 449 days, but the U.S. is offering just 90 days, Brittan said.
To meet Washington halfway, Brittan offered to resolve the dispute
in 170 days through an accelerated WTO panel.
	   ``The United States appears ready to break off negotiations and
to resort to a course of action which is very likely to lead to a
major trade dispute between the EU and the U.S., and to do great
damage to the WTO,'' Brittan wrote in a letter to U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshevsky.
	   The WTO ruled earlier this year that the EU's banana import
system which favors former European colonies in Africa and the
Caribbean violates its rules. In response the EU announced changes
to its system to come into operation on Jan. 1
	   ``The European Union has changed its banana regime in major and
substantive ways and it will fully meet the requirements of the
WTO,'' said Brittan.
	   The WTO ruling was in response to a complaint by the United
States, Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico that the EU system
unfairly restricted their banana exports.
	   The dispute comes at a bad time since a new round of global
trade talks supervised by the World Trade Organization is to be
initiated next year and agriculture again is poised to feature
prominently.
	   ``We should be working hard on these things, not just on
bananas,'' Brittan said.

Arrest warrant issued for communist-era prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 4th graf with report of Wolinska comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Warsaw military court issued an arrest
warrant Thursday for an elderly communist-era prosecutor, the first
step toward extraditing her from England.
	   The Warsaw Military District Court accepted a military
prosecutor's motion for the arrest warrant for Helena Wolinska, 79,
who now lives in Oxford.
	   Wolinska is accused of being responsible for the arrest and
subsequent execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, a World War II
resistance hero, on allegedly fabricated evidence.
	   She called the move to arrest her ``a political case'' but
refused to discuss the allegations Thursday, the PAP state news
agency reported. Last week, Wolinska said she feared she would not
get a fair trial in Poland.
	   The military court ruled Thursday the allegations against
Wolinska were justified. It ordered the arrest warrant on the
assumption that Wolinska would try to avoid coming to Poland for an
investigation of Fieldorf's death.
	   Wolinska had been summoned to testify at the investigation on
Oct. 15, but she failed to show up, prompting the military
prosecutor to seek the arrest warrant.
	   The arrest warrant allows the government to prepare an
extradition motion.
	   Wolinska, who is married to Wlodzimierz Brus, emeritus professor
of modern Russian and East European studies at Oxford University,
has lived in Britain since 1972.
	   Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground
Home Army that fought the Nazis during World War II. After the war,
he refused to collaborate with the secret service of the new
communist regime.
	   He was charged in 1952 with killing Soviet soldiers and leftist
resisters during the war, and was hanged in 1953. Historians say
Wolinska fabricated the charges.
	   If convicted of denying Fieldorf his freedom, Wolinska could be
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

US congresswoman suggests Nobel prize for slain Russian lawmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nobel prize rules saying nominee must be living. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A U.S. congresswoman suggested Thursday that a
prominent Russian liberal lawmaker recently shot to death be
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize _ even though that goes against
prize rules.
	   Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio who is visiting Moscow, said
members of the U.S. Congress considered Galina Starovoitova ``a
sister in liberty and an outspoken advocate for the democratic rule
of law and human rights,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kaptur said that if Starovoitova wins the peace prize
posthumously, some of the winnings should be used to support
democratic reforms in Russia.
	   However, Nobel prize rules say nominees must be living. Some
winners have died after the prizes were announced but before the
awards were presented.
	   Since Soviet times, Starovoitova had been a staunch defender of
political and market reforms and human rights, and she traveled
often to the United States for speaking and teaching engagements.
	   She was killed Nov. 20 in her apartment building in St.
Petersburg. Police have announced no major breakthroughs in the
case, but many believe the motive was political and may have been
connected to an upcoming local election.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Incoming U.S. House Speaker Bob Livingston
said Thursday he hopes the House wraps up its impeachment inquiry
by the end of the month but held out the possibility it could carry
over to the next year unless the Judiciary Committee completes its
work next week.
	   ``I can't say I'd be perfectly happy,'' if that were to happen,
Livingston said during a news conference his Republican colleague
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
	   Livingston said it is too early to make any decision on whether
the House should consider censuring President Bill Clinton as an
alternative to impeachment.

US congresswoman suggests Nobel prize for slain Russian lawmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nobel prize rules saying nominee must be living. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A U.S. congresswoman suggested Thursday that a
prominent Russian liberal lawmaker recently shot to death be
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize _ even though that goes against
prize rules.
	   Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio who is visiting Moscow, said
members of the U.S. Congress considered Galina Starovoitova ``a
sister in liberty and an outspoken advocate for the democratic rule
of law and human rights,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kaptur said that if Starovoitova wins the peace prize
posthumously, some of the winnings should be used to support
democratic reforms in Russia.
	   However, Nobel prize rules say nominees must be living. Some
winners have died after the prizes were announced but before the
awards were presented.
	   Since Soviet times, Starovoitova had been a staunch defender of
political and market reforms and human rights, and she traveled
often to the United States for speaking and teaching engagements.
	   She was killed Nov. 20 in her apartment building in St.
Petersburg. Police have announced no major breakthroughs in the
case, but many believe the motive was political and may have been
connected to an upcoming local election.

Strikes, protests extend across France

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Labor unrest mounted across France on Thursday,
with rail workers still on strike, jobless protesters holding
sit-ins to demand a year-end bonus and school monitors walking off
the job.
	   The rail strike, which began last Friday, hit most of the
country's 23 regions, with services severely disrupted. The strike
was set to continue Friday.
	   Rail workers say there is insufficient staff to counter growing
crime on trains and worry about how the government will implement a
plan to cut the working week from 39 to 35 hours.
	   Many workers fear a 35-hour week, aimed at spreading jobs around
and cutting unemployment, will lead to salary cuts.
	   Staff say a lack of employees has created a safety problem for
workers and travelers. The SNCF plans to hold a national meeting
next week to address train workers' concerns.
	   A spate of physical attacks on transit workers has sparked
several strikes in recent months, and ticket-sellers in the
southwest city of Lyon walked off the job Thursday after a
colleague was held at gunpoint during a holdup.
	   Elsewhere, in the town of Canabiere, near Marseille in southern
France, police said 10,000 jobless protesters took to the streets
to demand a 3,000 franc (dlrs 526) year-end bonus.
	   Organizers said there were up to 20,000 people at the rally.
	   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Charles Hoareau, an official of
the CGT union grouping.
	   The protesters marched to police headquarters in
Bouches-du-Rhone where they were joined by several hundred striking
postal workers who are demanding a shorter working week and more
staff.
	   Guy Hermier, a Communist Party deputy for Bouches-du-Rhone, said
the plea for a year-end payment was justified.
	   ``This bonus would allow thousands of workers who have no jobs
to spend the New Year in decent conditions,'' he said.
	   In Lille, northern France, about 60 unemployed protesters
occupied government labor offices to demand more jobs and higher
benefits.
	   About half of the school monitors in junior high schools and
high schools stayed off the job Thursday to protest reforms that
they say downgrades the status of their work.

Vandals destroy gravestones in Jewish cemetery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Vandals knocked over and shattered 60
gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in the Georgian capital Thursday,
authorities said.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the act, and police in the
former Soviet republic said they were investigating. It was the
second such incident at a Jewish cemetery in Tbilisi in recent
years.
	   Georgia's chief rabbi, Ariel Levin, denounced the ``barbarous
act,'' which he said was carried out by someone ``with provocative
goals.''
	   However, he said, ``Nobody will be able to cast a pall over good
and fraternal relations between Georgians and Jews, which have
existed for more than 26 centuries now.''
	   President Eduard Shevardnadze ordered police to tighten security
at the cemetery and urged a quick, thorough investigation,
according to presidential spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze.

With season slipping away, labor talks resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with talks resuming &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Labor talks to end the U.S. National Basketball
Association lockout resumed Thursday, with Alonzo Mourning of the
Miami Heat blaming the five-month lockout on the club owners.
	   ``This lockout won't end until the owners get as much as they
can out of the players. It comes down to greed on their part,''
Mourning said as he arrived at the negotiations, a hotel across
from NBA headquarters.
	   The bargaining session was the first in 13 days with both sides'
full negotiating committees attending.
	   The first order of business was to decide whether to continue
negotiating under the framework that the sides had discussed in two
previous sessions _ a six- or seven-year agreement with a
complicated ``escrow tax'' system in the final three or four years.
	   The proposals put on the table in the last session Nov. 20 would
include players having 10 or 15 percent of their paychecks withheld
if a targeted percentage of revenues devoted to salaries was
exceeded.
	   ``I think we've given up way more than enough and we've
compromised way more than enough. It's time for us to dig our heels
into the ground and make a stand,'' Mourning said. ``It's time for
them to try to meet us halfway, and I don't think they've done that
at all.''
	   Union director Billy Hunter said he was hoping to continue
working within the same proposed framework, but deputy commissioner
Russ Granik, the owners' lead negotiator, has suggested it may be
time to throw it out and start from scratch.
	   ``Maybe something has changed, but right now I can't be very
optimistic,'' Granik said upon his arrival. ``We've taken a few
(steps) back since our last meeting, so we'll see.
	   ``There's a sense of urgency, but the owners have said they
won't operate our business in a way that makes no financial
sense,'' he said.
	   If the sides can't come up with a solution in the next couple of
weeks, the entire 1998-99 season will be canceled. Commissioner
David Stern has steadfastly refused to reveal on what date it will
be too late to save the season.
	   ``It's not even about finding a middle ground that both sides
can be happy with, it's about finding a middle ground that the
sides can be equally unhappy with,'' said union negotiating team
member Danny Schayes of the Orlando Magic.
	   This was only the second full bargaining session since the
season was supposed to begin Nov. 3. The last time the sides met,
Nov. 20, they called it their most productive session to date.
	   Yet things quickly fell apart in the next couple of days as the
union said proposed changes to free agency timing rules were a
``deal-killer,'' and the owners then said the union reneged on its
acceptance of a complicated tax formula in the escrow years.
	   The sides agreed to talk again only by agreeing that everything
is negotiable.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is money. The owners
have insisted on maximum salary costs and the union has refused to
accept a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped as
the sides have fought over how to divide about dlrs 2 billion in
projected annual revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.
	   The owners moved to 52 and 53 percent on Nov. 20 and the players
dropped to 57 percent, but those concessions are now void under the
ground rules that have been set for the new talks.

Romanian holy man persecuted by communists dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Orthodox Monks have one name &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Cleopa, the charismatic Romanian monk
persecuted by communists and admired by pilgrims, has died in his
secluded wilderness monastery, a church official announced
Thursday. He was 87.
	   Cleopa, who hid in forests from communists and was known for
comforting words for common people, succumbed to age-related
illnesses Wednesday in the Sihastria monastery deep in the forest
of northern Romania, said the Romanian Orthodox Church in Iasi.
	   Hounded by the Securitate communist secret police, who feared
his popular appeal, Cleopa fled to the forest in 1953 and built an
underground den, where he lived in hiding for almost a decade.
	   Every month, a woodcutter brought him a sack of potatoes. Cleopa
said he ate one potato a day _ all he needed to survive.
	   In an interview with the Associated Press in October, Cleopa
talked about his 60 years of work as a spiritual father or
``duhovnic'' in the Romanian Orthodox Church.
	   ``The spiritual father is the soul of the monastery and of the
village. He should be the light of the world by his life and
sermons,'' he said.
	   Born into a family of peasants in a village in northern Romania,
Cleopa became a monk at 25. After he entered the monastery he
worked as a shepherd for 12 years.
	   He was best known for his understanding of ordinary peoples'
problems and his healing words. Tens of thousands sought his
advice, both under communism and in the years of hardship that
followed the toppling of communist rule in 1989.
	   ``He knew the needs and soul of the Romanian people,'' said Dan
Ciachir, a Christian Orthodox expert. ``He didn't have a very
elevated language, but he knew how to comfort people.''
	   Cleopa will be buried Saturday at the Sihastria monastery, 200
miles north of Bucharest, where he had lived for 30 years.
Thousands are expected to attend the funeral.
	   Romanian Orthodox monks are buried sitting in a chair, which is
lowered directly into the ground.

El Salvador blames sharp rise in inflation on hurricane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ El Salvador blamed a sharp rise
in inflation for November on Hurricane Mitch, saying price-gouging
after the disaster had caused prices to rise across the board.
	   November's inflation was 2.2 percent, the highest monthly rate
in three years and double the rates of previous months, which were
between 1 percent and 1.3 percent, the Central Reserve Bank said
Thursday.
	   It said food prices in particular had risen, despite the arrest
of some price-gougers.
	   El Salvador's agricultural sector was heavily affected by the
storm, which killed 239 people here a month ago. Across Central
America, Mitch killed more than 9,000 people and caused at least
dlrs 4 billion in damage.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Two more victims of Poland's prolonged
cold front were found Thursday, raising the death toll from more
than two weeks of freezing temperatures to at least 74.
	   Police said a 40-year-old man was found frozen to death in
central Poland on Thursday morning. A second man was found
overnight in Elblag province in northern Poland, near Gdansk.
	   Most victims have been the homeless or men who passed out from
drinking.
	   The cold front arrived on Nov. 16 with temperatures dipping as
low as minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). It already has
claimed 20 more lives than the number of cold-related deaths in all
of last winter, police say.

Rented bride saga sours after woman doesn't get money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ When a young Romanian man was jilted
days before his wedding, his parents came up with a novel solution
_ they rented a bride.
	   Determined to save their 22-year-old son's honor and not lose
the money they had spent on the nuptials, the family also rented
``parents'' for the ``bride,'' the daily Evenimentul Zilei
reported.
	   A childhood friend named Mariana stepped in, feeling sorry for
Lucian. The newspaper gave no family names.
	   For days, the actors rehearsed lines and practiced the wedding
ceremony. Lucian's family agreed that the ``bride'' would receive 1
million lei (dlrs 100) for her trouble.
	   In Romania, wedding guests give money to help cover the costs.
If the wedding had been canceled, the family would have lost all
the millions of lei (hundreds of dollars) it had spent.
	   Things got off to a bad start at the wedding in Bacau, some 250
kilometers (156 miles) northeast of Bucharest last weekend. The
priest who presided wished the couple ``a house of stone and many
children'' in traditional Orthodox fashion.
	   But only two-thirds of the invited guests showed up, and some
guests who seemed surprised by the new bride, weren't as generous
as expected.
	   Mariana only received lei 32,000 (dlrs 3.20) because the takings
were so small and she has another headache _ apparently Lucian has
fallen for her and wants the marriage to last.

Trott Moloto named new South African soccer coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Soccer officials on Thursday
named Trott Moloto to coach the South African national team through
to the end of the African Nations Cup in March 2000.
	   South African Football Association chief executive Raymond Hack
made the announcement.
	   As caretaker coach for the past four months, Moloto coached
Bafana Bafana _ or ``The Boys'', as the national team is known in
the Zulu language _ in their 1-0 triumph against Angola in the
African Nations Cup qualifier in October.
	   ``I am really honored that I am to lead Bafana Bafana,'' Moloto
said. ``I am going to continue the work of past coaches like
Screamer Tshabalala, Augusto Palacios, Clive Barker and Jomo Sono.
They have shown commitment in serving the nation.''
	   The selection committee also considered South Africans Ron
Atkinson and Shakes Mashaba; Brazil's Carlos Alberto Parreira, who
coached Saudi Arabia at the World Cup; Dutchman Ruud Krol; and
Gordon Igesund, coach of the South African team Manning Rangers.
	   Moloto takes over a team whose morale slumped after their
failure in the World Cup earlier this year.
	   South Africa were eliminated in the first round after losing 3-0
to France, drawing 1-1 with Denmark and drawing 2-2 with Saudi
Arabia, under French soccer coach Philippe Troussier.
	   Moloto said he would make some changes in the team for a match
against Egypt, the current African Nations Cup champions, in
Johannesburg Dec. 16.

of last winter, police say.

Party leaders say tax cut high on 1999 agenda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-US Clinton Impeachment &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID ESPO &QC;

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The top U.S. Republican leaders of the House
and Senate pledged Thursday to work to preserve Social Security,
cut taxes and improve education as they sketched the outlines of an
agenda for the 106th Congress that convenes in January.
	   Tax cuts are ``very, very high on the agenda,'' said Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, who will become speaker of the House in
January, the No. 3 position in U.S. politics.
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi added: ``We
want to work to preserve Social Security, and work to make sure we
have a fairer, simpler tax code.''
	   Lott and Livingston, fellow southerners and longtime
congressional colleagues, appeared jovial and relaxed in what
amounted to their national television debut as the face of the
Republican-controlled Congress.
	   In their brief question-and-answer session with reporters, the
two men were peppered with questions about the pending impeachment
inquiry against President Bill Clinton.
	   Livingston indicated he hopes the House can be called into
session later this month to vote on any articles of impeachment, if
the Judiciary Committee concludes its work next week.
	   Lott said he believed a trial would go forward in the Senate if
any impeachment charges cleared the House. ``I think that it would
be very hard not to if the House in fact acted. But I think to
speculate beyond that would be totally inappropriate,'' he said.
	   Both men said they had been discussing an agenda for after
lawmakers convene in January, and offered only the slightest
detail. They also intend to meet Friday with Republican governors,
some of whom have made clear they want greater input into the
drafting of a legislative agenda than they were granted in the
past.
	   ``Providing more jobs, saving Social Security, making sure that
our youngsters have good schools to attend, and all of these things
are going to be right at the forefront of our agenda next year,''
said Livingston, whom Republicans have chosen to replace Newt
Gingrich as speaker. He added that tax cuts will be ``very, very
high on the agenda.''
	   In his comments, Lott also cited preserving Social Security and
education and stressed the need for a fairer tax code. He also made
reference to fixing the ``unfair marriage penalty,'' which requires
come couples to pay higher taxes than they would if single. Earlier
this week, Lott also said he would push for across-the-board cuts
in taxes.

	   BULLA IFTIN, Kenya (AP) _ As three camels grazed nearby,
10-year-old Sahara Mouit Abdi sat in a tent reading a book about
Kenyan geography that the animals had just delivered.
	   ``It is a good book,'' said the fourth-grader, wearing a blue
veil and white trousers. ``It has good stories from many places.''
	   Sahara was one of two dozen ethnic Somali schoolchildren who had
gathered under an acacia tree to wait for Kenya's only Mobile Camel
Library.
	   Two camels delivered 200 books in four wooden boxes. A third
flatly refused to carry a load, and leisurely strode at the rear of
the little convoy along winding paths through the bush of northern
Kenya.
	   As soon as the tent was pitched in Bulla Iftin, Somali for
``village that is becoming enlightened,'' and the books displayed
on wooden shelves, the children plopped down on thick grass mats
that are also used to cushion the loads the camels carry.
	   ``All of you will have to tell me what you have read,''
librarian Joseph Otieno said to the children in Swahili. They chose
from novels, picture books and educational texts.
	   For the next two hours, the children read, some occasionally
seeking Otieno's help with difficult English words.
	   The children speak Somali with their families and learn in both
Swahili and English in school.
	   In 1996, Wycliffe S.O. Oluoch, the Kenya National Library
Service's head librarian in Garissa District, was seeking an
efficient and inexpensive way of delivering books from the main
library in the town of Garissa, about 390 kilometers (240 miles)
east of Nairobi, to outlying villages and nomadic settlements.
	   The roads in the region are so bad that even four-wheel-drive
vehicles get stuck in the sand. The inhabitants are spread thinly
in clusters of dome-like thatched huts or are on the move in search
of pasture for their goats, cattle and camels.
	   Vehicles were too expensive and impractical. Camels, said
Olouch, were the natural choice.
	   ``We also wanted to use something the community can identify
with,'' he said.
	   Camels are widely used in semi-arid northern Kenya because of
their ability to carry heavy loads and travel long distances
without drinking water. Camels also provide meat and milk, and
their dung is used for fuel.
	   Garissa journalist Abdulwahab Ahmed, himself a Kenyan Somali,
said that Somalis, who are predominantly Muslim, hold the camel in
great regard.
	   ``They say if you look at a camel from a certain angle, the
curves spells Allah in Arabic,'' Ahmed said.
	   The camel library is on the road five days a week, serving
children who are more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) outside Garissa.
Each location is designated and a library day set.
	   ``The service is so popular we cannot meet the demand,'' Oluoch
said. ``The days when people thought nomads don't want to read are
long gone.''
	   Each location is served once every two weeks. But only third-
through seventh-graders can take books home when school is in
session. During vacation, everyone has to read in the tents.
	   ``First- and second-graders are not mature enough, and
eighth-graders are getting ready to leave school, which would make
it difficult for us to trace them,'' Oluoch said.
	   Mohamed Farah, a teacher at Bulla Ifkin Primary School, said the
camel library supplements what the children read in school and
broadens their access to information.
	   The camels are on the road for two weeks, eat for two weeks,
then return to the road again with camel driver Yusuf Khalif Ahmed.
	   Otieno, a second librarian and a handyman complete the camel
library team.
	   For now, it is the only one because Garissa is the only district
capital in northern Kenya that has a library to supply the books.

Banana bickering worsens trans-Atlantic trade climate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes from trade negotiator, details, ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Trans-Atlantic trade relations took a
turn for the worse Thursday with the European Union calling U.S.
demands over a banana dispute ``ridiculous,'' and warning
Washington's threat of sanctions bodes ill for next year's world
trade negotiations.
	   Chief EU trade negotiator Leon Brittan appealed to U.S.
authorities to reconsider an European proposal to settle the banana
dispute at a special panel at the World Trade Organization instead
of threatening sanctions.
	   Washington alleges the new EU banana import regime is unfair to
South American distributors, most of which are owned by U.S.
companies. The WTO had already condemned an earlier EU banana
import system, but Brittan said the new regime met all the WTO
concerns.
	   Washington disagrees and is threatening to impose sanctions
worth up to dlrs 1.5 billion on a wide range of EU products even
before the WTO comes up with a new decision, Brittan said. He
denounced the March 3 deadline set by the U.S. for resolving the
issue.
	   ``I said that was ridiculous,'' Brittan told reporters.
``Sentence first, trial afterwards is what the United States are
proposing.''
	   Under normal WTO procedure, a ruling on the new EU regime would
take 449 days, but the U.S. is offering just 90 days, Brittan said.
To meet Washington halfway, Brittan offered to resolve the dispute
in 170 days through an accelerated WTO panel.
	   ``The United States appears ready to break off negotiations and
to resort to a course of action which is very likely to lead to a
major trade dispute between the EU and the U.S., and to do great
damage to the WTO,'' Brittan wrote in a letter to U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshevsky.
	   The WTO ruled earlier this year that the EU's banana import
system which favors former European colonies in Africa and the
Caribbean violates its rules. In response, the EU announced changes
to its system to come into operation on Jan. 1
	   ``The European Union has changed its banana regime in major and
substantive ways and it will fully meet the requirements of the
WTO,'' said Brittan.
	   The WTO ruling was in response to a complaint by the United
States, Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico that the EU system
unfairly restricted their banana exports.
	   The dispute comes at a bad time since a new round of global
trade talks supervised by the World Trade Organization is to be
initiated next year and agriculture again is poised to feature
prominently.
	   ``We should be working hard on these things, not just on
bananas,'' Brittan said.

Snow-less Spaniards stage dog race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZARAGOZA, Spain (AP) _ A dog team race without snow?
	   Yes, 35 mushers and their huskies, malamutes and Samoyeds will
set off Saturday with dog teams pulling four-wheeled carts or
bicycles.
	   The four-day race will take them across 200 kilometers (120
miles) of Los Monegros, a largely flat, semi-desert expanse in the
Aragon region of northeast Spain.
	   ``There are no sleds because there is no snow,'' said Rafael
Arnaiz, a spokesman for the regional tourism office said.
	   There are three categories of teams: carts with six to 12 dogs,
carts with two to five, and bicycles with one to three dogs each.
	   Drivers are limited to a map, a compass and their own instincts.
	   ``The terrain is so uniform that the hardest part is not getting
lost,'' Arnaiz said.
	   The winners in each category will get a ceramic trophy.
	   The Aragon government has staged the race for the last six years
as a promotional event to boost tourism in Los Monegros.

Saudis launching new campaign against illegal workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Saudi authorities are to revive their
campaign against illegal workers in order to create jobs for their
own citizens, a regional newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Arab News said Saudi police are to raid workplaces,
including shops and restaurants, and the government will introduce
tougher laws against illegally employed foreigners.
	   The raids will begin Friday, the Jiddah-based newspaper said.
	   The Saudi government began cracking down on illegal labor in
October 1997. Since then some 700,000 workers have been deported to
their home countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, the paper
said, quoting official statistics by the immigration department.
	   The campaign aims to provide hundreds of thousands of jobs for
Saudis, reduce crime and curb the estimated dlrs 16 million sent
abroad each year by foreign laborers.
	   Saudi Arabia has a population of 18 million, including six
million foreigners. About 4.3 million foreigners have work permits.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Cleopa, the charismatic Romanian monk
persecuted by communists and admired by pilgrims, has died in his
secluded wilderness monastery, a church official announced
Thursday. He was 87.
	   Cleopa, who hid in forests from communists and was known for
comforting words for common people, succumbed to age-related
illnesses Wednesday in the Sihastria monastery deep in the forest
of northern Romania, said the Romanian Orthodox Church in Iasi.
	   Hounded by the Securitate communist secret police, who feared
his popular appeal, Cleopa fled to the forest in 1953 and built an
underground den, where he lived in hiding for almost a decade.
	   Every month, a woodcutter brought him a sack of potatoes. Cleopa
said he ate one potato a day _ all he needed to survive.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press in October, Cleopa
talked about his 60 years of work as a spiritual father or
``duhovnic'' in the Romanian Orthodox Church.
	   ``The spiritual father is the soul of the monastery and of the
village. He should be the light of the world by his life and
sermons,'' he said.
	   Born into a family of peasants in a village in northern Romania,
Cleopa became a monk at 25. After he entered the monastery he
worked as a shepherd for 12 years.
	   He was best known for his understanding of ordinary peoples'
problems and his healing words. Tens of thousands sought his
advice, both under communism and in the years of hardship that
followed the toppling of communist rule in 1989.
	   ``He knew the needs and soul of the Romanian people,'' said Dan
Ciachir, a Christian Orthodox expert. ``He didn't have a very
elevated language, but he knew how to comfort people.''
	   Cleopa will be buried Saturday at the Sihastria monastery, 200
miles (320 kilometers) north of Bucharest, where he had lived for
30 years. Thousands are expected to attend the funeral.
	   Romanian Orthodox monks are buried sitting in a chair, which is
lowered directly into the ground.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sam Chisholm resigned Thursday as a director of
Tottenham because of a conflict of interests involving the Premier
League.
	   Chisholm stepped down after being appointed as a consultant to
the Premier League on future television contracts.
	   League rules state that no employee of, nor consultant to, the
Premier League can be a director of a Premier League club.
	   Chisholm was appointed by Spurs before the start of the current
season because of his experience of media issues, particularly in

	   Chisholm's appointment had already prompted questions from
Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards.
	   League bosses were concerned that Chisholm would be central to
the television talks while still a director of a Premier League
club.

Livingston wants impeachment inquiry ended this month

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Incoming U.S. House Speaker Bob Livingston
said Thursday he hopes the House wraps up its impeachment inquiry
this year but held out the possibility it could carry over to the
next Congress in January unless the Judiciary Committee completes
its work next week.
	   ``I can't say I'd be perfectly happy'' if the fight extends into
the new year, Livingston said during a news conference with Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott.
	   As the Judiciary Committee prepares to end its impeachment
inquiry, White House lawyers are readying a ``vigorous defense'' of
President Bill Clinton and demanding sensitive fund-raising memos
and other material gathered by Republican investigators.
	   Livingston said it is too early to make any decision on whether
the House should consider censuring Clinton as an alternative to
impeachment _ an option that has support in both parties. ``I'm
just not going to make a decision on that,'' Livingston said.
	   Rep. Peter King, a Republican, was circulating a censure
proposal Thursday . It would include a strong condemnation of
Clinton and require him to pay a financial penalty and issue a
statement acknowledging wrongdoing, according to King's spokesman,
Kevin Fogarty.
	   Clinton was asked by a reporter whether he would accept a
censure. Aide Bruce Lindsey responded, ``I have no earthly idea.''
	   Lott said ``we're not making any plans or any preparation at
this time'' for a Senate trial of Clinton in case the House votes
impeachment. He said he knows of no constitutional requirement that
the Senate hold a trial but ``it would be very hard not to'' if the
House impeached the president.
	   Livingston told reporters he had discussed impeachment briefly
in meetings this week with two senior House Republican leaders.
DeLay. And he took a shot at Democratic complaints, joining the
partisan brawling that has characterized the proceedings.
	   ``I think it's interesting that just about a month ago, people
on the Democratic side of the House were complaining because the
process was either moving too fast or later too slow and they were
condemning the speaker (Rep. Newt Gingrich) for being too
involved,'' Livingston said. ``Now they're mad at me for not being
involved enough.''
	   Whether or not Republicans turn over investigative materials on
Clinton, the president's lawyers plan to press a defense before the
Judiciary Committee.
	   Republican aides and Rep. Henry Hyde, who chairs the panel, are
not saying whether the inquiry would be expanded to include
information on Clinton's campaign finances and Kathleen Willey, who
has accused the president of groping her.
	   The White House legal team accepted an invitation from the
committee Wednesday to make a defense before the inquiry next
Tuesday and possibly even call witnesses, but demanded access to
the fund-raising memos and additional investigative material
related to Monica Lewinsky and Ms. Willey.
	   Ms. Willey, a former White House aide, contends that Clinton
made an unwanted sexual advance, and the committee is trying to
determine whether anyone tried to intimidate her from testifying
about the alleged incident. Clinton denies making the advance.
	   Heading into what lawmakers of both parties hope is the final
two weeks of the impeachment inquiry, the committee is preparing
for four days of hearings next week, beginning with the White House
defense and ending with votes on at least one article of
impeachment. If such a proposal passes, the full House is likely to
vote the following week.

EMU will impact tourism around Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Monetary union will impact tourism around
Europe, and countries must modernize their industries to take
advantage of the change.
	   Experts said Thursday that even countries such as Greece, which
will not be part of the Eurozone in 1999, must nonetheless begin
improving the services they provide.
	   ``More emphasis will be given to the quality of services offered
as the `value for money' approach from the tourists will prevail,''
said Marios Raphael, former chairman of the executive committee of
the World Tourism Organization.
	   He made the comments at a two-day conference on ``Tourism: The
foundation for growth and prosperity in Greece.''
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of the single currency. It will join
the Eurozone on Jan. 1, 2001, and the Euro will replace national
currencies by July 2002. Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of
joining.
	   Tourism is one of Greece's most important industries, with an
estimated 12 million foreigners having visited this year. Foreign
arrivals are expected to increase in 1999.
	   According to Raphael and others, the Euro will make tourist
industries around Europe more competitive as there will be a stable
financial environment defined by a lack of monetary fluctuations,
and low inflation.
	   ``He will also save money from not having to change foreign
currency,'' said Raphael, who added that an estimated 50 percent of
the value of a tourist's money is lost by exchanging currencies in
several countries.
	   The drop in interest rates in countries such as Greece will
encourage new investments in tourism, Raphael said.
	   With the 2004 Summer Olympic games to be held in Athens, Greece
must take advantage of lower rates to improve its tourism
infrastructure, said Theodoros Pandalakis, deputy governor of the
National Bank of Greece.

Nokia hits 100 million mobile phone mark, bullish on growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finnish telecommunications company
Nokia has manufactured its 100 millionth cellular phone, and
expects high growth next year, Nokia said Thursday.
	   Its 100 millionth cellular phone was a Nokia 9110, which also
has a keyboard and can send and receive telefaxes, Nokia said.
	   The company expects to maintain 25 to 35 percent sales growth in
1999, despite global economic uncertainty, Nokia's president Jorma
Ollila told analysts in London.
	   ``An increasing part of all personal communications, be it
voice, images, data or video, will be mobile in the future,'' Matti
Alahuhta, chief of Nokia Mobile Phones said in a statement.
	   Nokia expects 1 billion global mobile phone users by 2005,
Alahuhta said.
	   In a seperate report, the Dataquest market research and
consulting firm said Nokia had become the market leader in mobile
phone sales in the United States, the Finnish news agency STT said.
	   During January to September Nokia's U.S. market share was 40.3
percent, compared to 19.8 percent during the same period in 1997,
STT said.
	   In October, Nokia reported a near-doubling of cellular phone
sales worldwide in the third quarter, and a 75-percent increase in
pretax profit of 9.6 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.9 billion) for the
first nine months of the year.
	   Net sales for all Nokia's divisions jumped to 53.3 billion
markkaa (dlrs 10.6 billion), compared to 36.7 billion markkaa for
the January-September period last year.
	   Ollila said preliminary market data indicate Nokia has overtaken
its major rival, Motorola Inc., based in Schaumburg, Illinois, in
mobile phone sales.
	   Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology, and
has supplied GSM equipment to 67 operators in 35 countries. It has
sales in 130 countries, and employs 42,000 people.

Russia wants to restrict publications about drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government on Thursday approved a bill that
would ban publishing or broadcasting material about methods of
manufacturing or using drugs, or places where drugs could be
bought, news reports said.
	   The bill _ actually an amendment to Russia's media law _ would
outlaw such coverage in the print and broadcast media and on the
Internet, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agency reported.
	   It would also ban ``propaganda about any advantages of (drug)
use,'' or publication of arguments about the advantages of one type
of drug over another, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Drug use in Russia has soared in recent years. The most popular
kinds are cheap opium derivatives and home-made chemical
concoctions.
	   However, there are no specialized publications that cater to
drug users, and mainstream media rarely publish anything that could
be used as instructions for obtaining or using drugs.
	   The bill would still have to be approved by Russia's parliament
and signed by the president.

Barcelona in crisis, Real Madrid in intercontinental heaven
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Stands as 1st Ld-Writethru to clarify Celta in second place
and Atletico in third in 13th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Much more than just a league match, FC
Barcelona's game Saturday against Deportivo La Coruna could prove
decisive for Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal.
	   ``Van Gaal knows his head could roll, and the team knows that
there is much more at stake than just a result,'' the
Barcelona-based daily El Mundo Deportivo said Thursday regarding
the 13th-round match.
	   Upset at being eliminated from contention in the European
Champions League with a match still remaining, and languishing in
fifth place in the domestic league, Barcelona want Van Gaal sent
back to the Netherlands.
	   Sports dailies reported that the dour coach on Tuesday pleaded
with the players to help him stay by giving an extra effort against
Deportivo.
	   Relatively humble Deportivo sits in fourth place with 20 points,
two behind league leader Mallorca and one ahead of Barcelona.
	   Meanwhile, the imminent return of team captain Pep Guardiola
after more than a year because of injury is being seen as a glimmer
of hope.
	   ``Guardiola carries the heavy load of savior,'' wrote La
Vanguardia Thursday.
	   It pointed to the midfielder's reputation for team play and his
status as the only link to Johan Cruyff's ``dream team'' that won
the European Champions Cup and three consecutive league
championships.
	   ``If the fans want to ask me for the moon, let them ask for it.
I am not a magic solution but I will do my best,'' said Guardiola,
one of Spain's most respected internationals.
	   In the meantime, El Mundo Deportivo published an unconfirmed
report that club chairman Jose Luis Nunez is thinking of hiring
Italian coach Fabio Capello to replace Van Gaal.
	   The paper said a three-year agreement already exists that if
signed would be worth 500 million pesetas (dlrs 3.5 million) a year
to Capello.
	   Real Madrid, the other traditional Spanish powerhouse, also
plays away from home on Saturday, against lower-half Espanyol.
	   Although Madrid also is struggling in league play, in eighth
place four points behind Mallorca, the team already has a major
title this season _ the biggest of all _ the Toyota
(Intercontinental) Cup, which it won 2-1 over Vasco da Gama on
Tuesday in Tokyo.
	   ``We needed this great victory,'' Raul Gonzalez, scorer of the
82nd-minute goal that won the game, told the state-owned news
agency EFE Thursday.
	   ``We had had many defeats and a lot of criticism and we were not
receiving the respect we deserve.''
	   Also in action Saturday are Mallorca, second-placed Celta and
third-placed Atletico Madrid.
	   Mallorca, which has lost two of its last three, will host Betis,
which has won three of its last four and climbed from last to ninth
since Javier Clemente replaced Vicente Cantatore.
	   Fresh from its 1-0 victory over Barcelona last week, Atletico
Madrid hosts Athletic Bilbao.
	   Like Barcelona, Bilbao also is celebrating its centennial
season, and also like Barca, has been disappointing.
	   Celta, meanwhile, travels to play lower-half Salamanca in search
of the victory that could restore it to the league lead.
	   Saturday's only other game pits mid-table Real Sociedad against
struggling Extremadura.
	   The 13th round wraps up Sunday with Valencia traveling to play
division newcomer Alaves, last-placed Tenerife at home against
Zaragoza, Oviedo vs. Racing and a lower-half tussle pitting
Villarreal against Valladolid

	   LONDON (AP) _ Yannick Noah saved four match points before
beating fellow Frenchman Guy Forget 6-7 (7-2), 6-4, 13-11 on
Thursday in the opening match of the ATP Seniors tournament at
Olympia.
	   The one hour, 25-minute match went into a tie-break third set,
which lasts a minimum 10 points but went to 24.
	   Noah saved two match points at 9-7 down, one more at 10-9 and
another at 11-10 before winning on his first match point at 12-11
with a smash.
	   The eight-man competition included John McEnroe, who faced
Guillermo Vilas later Thursday.
	   The eight-man competition is split into two groups.
	   McEnroe is grouped with Vilas, Henri Leconte and Mansour
Bahrami, while Noah and Forget are in with Pat Cash and John Lloyd.
	   Five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg was scheduled to play
but pulled out last week through injury.
	   McEnroe has won four consecutive events, putting him ahead of
Jimmy Connors at the top of the senior rankings. Connors has not
played in the European events.

Russia demands ratification of new arms treaty before NATO expands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister on Thursday said a
revised conventional arms reduction treaty for Europe must be
ratified before NATO admits former East Bloc nations or the pact
could end up mired in problems.
	   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will join the Western
military alliance during a NATO summit in Washington D.C. in April.
Russia has repeatedly objected to such NATO expansion into the
former East Bloc.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, in Oslo for a meeting of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the
revised Conventional Forces in Europe treaty must be ratified
before the NATO summit.
	   ``We think there is a new reality in Europe,'' he through an
interpreter. ``A ratification has to be done before the NATO summit
in Washington, where NATO accepts three new members.''
	   ``If we don't agree on ratification of the CFE before the NATO
summit, it will be even harder to realize an agreement
afterwards,'' he said.
	   The CFE treaty was negotiated in 1990, before the Warsaw Pact
ceased to exist. It took effect in 1992, and was being revised to
reflect the demise of the Warsaw Pact.
	   In July 1997, 30 European nations, including the United States
and Russia, agreed to set conventional arms limits for Europe and
set weapons limits for new members of NATO. However, the details
remain to be settled.
	   Ivanov appeared at a brief news conference with Norwegian
Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek after bilateral talks in Oslo. The
Russian foreign minister did not say why the treaty had to be
ratified by April.
	   However, admitting members of the former Warsaw Pact into NATO
raises the question of whether their treaty ceilings for
conventional weapons go with them. During last year's talks on the
revised treaty, diplomats predicted that Russia would try to commit
the new 19-nation NATO not to exceed the weapons ceilings already
set for the current 16-nation alliance.
	   Vollebaek, who takes over the OSCE chairmanship in January, said
he did not know whether the treaty could be ratified by April.

	   Lazarenko, 45, was arrested by customs officials as he crossed

	   Geneva state authorities requested his transfer from Basel.
	   ``He will be questioned Friday morning in connection with an
inquiry in Geneva into the laundering of dirty money,''
investigating judge Laurent Kasper Ansermet said.
	   Folco Galli, spokesman for the Swiss Office of Police Affairs
said customs officials had made inquiries over Lazarenko with the
office, which then informed Geneva authorities of the arrest.
	   Switzerland says it has received 20 separate requests from
Ukraine for legal aid in the case of Lazarenko, accused of
corruption, since February 1997.
	   The federal police office last month said Switzerland is helping
Ukrainian authorities in their attempts to track down money he
allegedly stashed away in Swiss banks. Switzerland has handed over
some bank documents to Ukraine.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister in 1996-97, when he was sacked by
President Leonid Kuchma. He now leads the centrist opposition
Hromoda party and has accused Kuchma and his allies of trying to
blacken his name by the corruption charges.
	   In October, he alleged that authorities were plotting to kill
him.
	   As well as Geneva, investigations are under way in the cantons
(states) of Fribourg and Zurich.
	   Under Switzerland's decentralized legal system, individual
cantons are responsible for investigating charges of money
laundering.

Iraq says cancer rates up, blames U.S., British weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi scientists said Thursday that birth
defects and childhood cancers have risen dramatically since the
1991 Gulf War and blamed the depleted uranium used in American and
British tank-piercing shells.
	   The two-day conference was attended by some 600 Iraqi doctors
and scientists, who urged the government to seek redress from the
United Nations and international courts.
	   They also urged affected Iraqi families to seek compensation
from the world bodies.
	   At the conference, which ended Thursday, Iraqi scientists showed
pictures and slides of disfigured babies who were born without
hands or legs or with distorted heads.
	   They said that the number of children born with birth defects
had increased three-fold around the city of Basra in the south,
which was close to Gulf War battlefields.
	   Hospital statistics, they said, indicated that the number of
Iraqi children with cancer rose to 130,000 in 1997 from 32,000 in
1990.
	   The single Western scientist attending the symposium _ Dr. Hari
Sharma, a radiology specialist from Waterloo University in Ontario,
Canada _ cautioned the Iraqis not to jump to conclusions.
	   ``The numbers are impressive and the deformations we have seen
are heart-breaking,'' Sharma told The Associated Press. ``But the
weakness in (Iraqi) presentation is the absence of causative
agent.''
	   He suggested that the increase in cancer cases could be due to
chemical particles in the huge oil well fires during the war.
	   ``Or simply they may be a result of (U.N.) trade sanctions,'' he
said.
	   It was a reference to U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, that have led to shortages of food and medicine
in the country. That invasion sparked the Gulf War.
	   Depleted uranium is a metal residue left when natural uranium is
refined. It is used in artillery shells and bombs designed to
penetrate the armor of tanks. On impact, the shells create an
airborne dust, which if inhaled or ingested, can be poisonous.
	   Some American veterans groups have suggested that the shells
could be a factor in Gulf War syndrome _ the name for a variety of
ailments that have afflicted scores of veterans.
	   American researchers also have looked into whether U.S. troops
could have been affected by chemical agents released by allied
bombing of Iraqi ammunition sites or, possibly, by vaccines or
pesticides in use in the war theater.
	   Sharma said he has analyzed urine samples of six American Gulf
War veterans and one British veteran.
	   ``There was depleted uranium, and it came from the Gulf War if
the samples were not doctored,'' he said.
	   Sharma said he had 60 more urine samples to analyze and urged
the Iraqis to allow him to take his own samples from Iraqi veterans
suffering from ailments they believe stem from the Gulf War.
	   ``There are complications,'' he said when asked whether the
Iraqis will allow him to do so.
	   Three Western Gulf War veterans _ former Sgt. 1st Class Carol
Picou from the United States and Raymond Bristow and Colin
Dursell-Lee from Britain _ participated in the conference. All said
they were seeking relief from Gulf War-related illness.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Assassination brigades of the Russian mafia
relaxed in Miami after a hit, while their organization ran
operations in New York, Los Angeles and Houston, a former FBI agent
testified Thursday.
	   Retired special agent Robert Levinson, giving evidence in
Switzerland in the trial of Sergei Mikhailov, the reputed head of
the Solntevskaya organization, said Mikhailov had personal control
of two so-called combat brigades, which specialized in
assassination.
	   ``They would commit murders in Russia and other countries in
Europe and then come to Miami, Florida, where they would stay by
the beach and wait for the heat to cool off,'' said Levinson.
	   He said that during four years of investigating the Russian
mafia for the FBI he was able to assemble an overview of
Solntsevskaya, which he was founded in the late 1980s by a group of
people including Mikhailov.
	   Another founding member, Sergei Timoviev, was killed in a 1994
car bombing in Moscow, Levinson said. The bomb was set off by
remote control, he added, but didn't suggest who might have killed
Timoviev, although he did say he had links to another criminal
organization.
	   The court heard from other witnesses Tuesday that the
organization is made up of 1,700 people. Levinson said they are
organized in brigades of at least 10 people each under a brigade
leader, who reported to Mikhailov and his partner Viktor Averin.
	   Solntsevskaya has taken over nightclubs in New York's Brighton
Beach area and in Los Angeles, he said, adding that that clubs
these became ``a center for drugs and a meeting place for
racketeers.''
	   Mikhailov, who is being tried in Geneva on charges of membership
in a criminal organization, also invested several hundred thousand
dollars in a Houston car dealership, added Levinson.
	   ``When the individual who was involved didn't come up with the
cars that Mr. Mikhailov had ordered, he became in fear of his life.
He thought he was going to be murdered,'' said Levinson. He gave no
more details.
	   Mikhailov, 40, denies he has anything to do with the
organization. He also is charged with breaking Swiss laws on
purchase of property by foreigners and has been in custody in
Geneva for more than two years.
	   Levinson also worked on the case of Russian mafia godfather
Vyacheslav Ivankov, imprisoned for nearly 10 years in New York last
year.
	   ``In Miami one or more meetings took place between the
Solntsevskaya leaders, including Mikhailov, with Ivankov during
which time the takeover and control of several Moscow hotels was
discussed,'' said Levinson.
	   The trial of Mikhailov, which began on Nov. 30, is expected to
hear evidence from more than 90 witnesses speaking six different
languages. If convicted, he faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half
years in prison.

Police arrest 11 for setting fire to wedding tent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Police arrested 11 people Thursday after
they set fire to a tent at a Calcutta museum where an industrial
tycoon's son was getting married.
	   Members from the youth wing of the opposition Congress party set
the fire to protest the government's decision to let steel magnate
Lakshmi Mittal celebrate the wedding of his son there. No one was
injured.
	   The protesters had shouted slogans before setting the blaze,
saying the party would damage the museum.
	   The government said Thursday that no damage was caused either to
the lawns or to the building, which houses rare paintings and other
memorabilia connected with the British rule of India.
	   Police charged the protesters with vandalism.
	   The state government in Calcutta has been trying to woo Mittal
to invest in West Bengal state. Mittal, whose base is in London,
owns several steel plants throughout the world.

U.N. chief reconfirms Saturday trip to Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Thursday reconfirmed his plans to travel to Libya this weekend to
try to resolve differences with Tripoli about putting two suspects
on trial in the 1988 Pan Am bombing.
	   ``Yes, I will travel to Libya on Saturday to discuss the
Lockerbie affair,'' Annan said referring to the bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   ``We will try to resolve some problems and to find solutions
together,'' he said in answer to reporters' questions.
	   Asked if he would meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi,
Anna replied ``Yes, I think so.''
	   The remarks expanded upon comments by Annan on Wednesday in
Algiers as he prepared to fly to neighboring Tunisia, the last
scheduled stop on a swing through North Africa aimed at unblocking
plans for a U.S.-sponsored referendum on the fate of the disputed
Western Sahara territory.
	   It was not immediately known whether the U.N. chief would seek a
dispensation from U.N. sanctions that ban flights to and from
Libya. He could travel to Libya overland from neighboring Tunisia.
	   The sanctions were leveled in 1992 to try to force Libya to hand
over two suspects in the bombing.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Annan had said last week he had hoped for a breakthrough in the
case by the end of November. He said then that a trip to Libya ``to
bring the issue finally to closure ... has not been excluded.''
	   Annan's North African tour has taken him, in two separate
visits, to Mauritania, Morocco, which claims the Western Sahara,
the Western Sahara itself, a refugee camp in southern Algeria for
the Polisario Front and Algiers.

Two-division format approved in radical move
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more quotes, reaction, clarifies voting

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the most radical change in the 109-year history
of English county cricket, the 18 teams agreed Thursday to
introduce a two-division championship starting in 2000.
	   The proposal, rejected last year, was approved this time by the
First Class Forum with 15 votes in favor, one against and three
abstentions.
	   Under the plan, there will be two divisions of nine teams each,
with a soccer-style promotion and relegation system.
	   The top nine teams in next year's championship will play in the
top tier division in 2000, with the remainder in the lower tier.
	   Counties will play the other eight teams in their divisions on a
home and away basis in 16 four-day matches, with three promoted and
three relegated.
	   It's the first major change in the structure of county cricket
since the competition began in 1890.
	   The move is designed to improve the quality of first-class
cricket and make England more competitive on an international
level.
	   ``It's not the magical cure for it all,'' said Lord MacLaurin,
chairman of the England Cricket Board. ``Of course it's not, there
are all sorts of things to happen as well as two divisions.
	   But I think it's better than the system that has failed us over
the last dozen years or so.
	   ``This is an historic day for cricket in England and Wales. We
can raise the profile of the game and improve the quality of the
players by making this change and I'm confident that Team England
will benefit from the introduction of a harder edged competition.''
	   The vote comes just three days after England's seven-wicket
defeat to Australia in the second Test of the Ashes series. The
result, which came after England was saved from defeat by a
thunderstorm in the first Test, offered further proof that England
is no longer a world power in the sport it invented and is falling
further behind the top nations.
	   The move was welcomed by David Graveney, England chairman of
selectors.
	   ``It will add some spice to the championship, so personally I'm
pleased,'' he said. ``The benefits will be difficult to quantify
right now, but it will probably start to show next season and get
cricket played a bit closer to the edge.''
	   ECB officials hope that the increased strength of the top league
will have a knock-on effect to the England team.
	   ``There is a universal belief in the game that we need to narrow
the gap in standard between the four-day domestic game and Test
match cricket,'' ECB chief executive Tim Lamb said.
	   ``By introducing a two-division format and continuing with the
ECB's range of coaching and development initiatives, we will start
to effectively close that gap.
	   ``I am sure that greater competitiveness will also raise the
level of media and public interest and encourage more spectators to
come to county championship matches.''
	   The ECB said all teams will be treated equally in terms of
financial distribution, voting rights and registration rules. That
means teams in the lower division will not lose out on vital cash
and there will be no free-for-all in the movement of players to the
more attractive sides.
	   Glamorgan, the sole Welsh county in the championship, was the
only team to vote against the proposal while Essex, Durham and the
MCC abstained.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fears that Russia has started printing money,
having been left without foreign aid, drove the ruble down Thursday
despite the Central Bank's attempts to support it.
	   The currency had been relatively stable for weeks, and fell
Thursday to its lowest point since September.
	   When the ruble slides, the Central Bank usually begins spending
its hard-currency reserves to buy rubles on the currency market _
increasing demand for the ruble and driving its rate back up.
	   But while the bank was actively trying to support the ruble
Thursday, traders said, the currency still fell to 20 to the
dollar, from 19.1 on Wednesday.
	   The ruble's fall came a day after International Monetary Fund
chief Michel Camdessus left Moscow without promising to free up
frozen loans that Russia badly wants to dig itself out of its
latest economic crisis.
	   Without that money, dealers warned Thursday, Russia's government
has run out of alternatives to printing rubles. Some reported signs
that the money-printing has already begun.
	   Printing money can cause high inflation. But Russia owes
billions of dollars to workers, pensioners and foreign creditors
and has warned repeatedly that it would resort to printing money
unless it gets more foreign loans.
	   While Camdessus showed no sign of releasing the IMF money, he
praised Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis,
and said an IMF team would return to Russia next month for further
negotiations.
	   The IMF and other lenders froze a dlrs 22.6 billion aid package
to Russia after the government defaulted on its treasury debts and
devalued the ruble in August.
	   The speaker of the lower house of parliament called Thursday for
breaking with the IMF and cranking up the money-printing presses.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print money to pay off its debts
and then refuse to take any more loans.
	   ``It's high time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he
told reporters.
	   The leader of the reformist party Our Home is Russia ridiculed
Seleznyov's proposal. ``If the IMF accepted rubles for debt
payments, it would be a brilliant method,'' Alexander Shokhin said
on the ``Hero of the Day'' television program.
	   Russia has also asked foreign creditors to restructure payments
of dlrs 9 million in Soviet-era debts due next year, former deputy
Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Thursday.
	   ``We cannot repay this money,'' Nemtsov was quoted as saying by
the Interfax news agency.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September,
and stood at 5.7 percent in November, the State Statistics
Committee said Thursday. But inflation is up about 70 percent since
last December.
	   Officials have said that international loans would help it keep
inflation under 30 percent in 1999.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, apparently still hopeful about
IMF money, said Thursday the government needs to come up with a
more detailed plan for economic recovery.
	   Primakov's government has produced a general anti-crisis
program, but the measures have not reversed the country's economic
slide, nor have they found favor with the IMF.
	   Also Thursday, the giant state-savings bank, Sberbank freed up
individual accounts that were transferred to the bank months ago
from six commercial banks crippled by the crisis.

Brian Kidd takes Blackburn manager's job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with appointment

<TEXT>
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ After eight years as Alex Ferguson's
assistant at Manchester United, Brian Kidd on Thursday became the
manager of his own Premier League club.
	   Kidd took over at Blackburn Rovers, signing a contract that runs
until June 2002.
	   Kidd succeeds Roy Hodgson, who was fired last month after
Blackburn's 2-0 defeat to Southampton.
	   United had agreed reluctantly to let Kidd talk with last-place
Rovers about filling their managerial vacancy.
	   ``He wants to progress his career and he wants to have the
chance of being a No. 1,'' chief executive Martin Edwards said.
``He wants that opportunity to speak to them and so reluctantly we
have agreed to that.''
	   Only last week Edwards claimed the only way Kidd would leave
United would be ``over my dead body.''
	   Rovers' dismal season continued Wednesday night with a 1-0 loss
to Leicester in the quarterfinals of the League Cup.
	   Blackburn, which won the Premier League title in 1995, is now
bottom of the table with only two victories in 15 games.
	   Kidd has been associated with Manchester United throughout his
career. As a 19-year-old, he scored a goal in the club's European
Cup victory over Benfica in 1968.
	   He managed Preston for three months in 1986 before moving to
United as a junior coach. He became Ferguson's No. 2 in 1991,
replacing Archie Knox.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's top opposition party on Thursday
protested the arrest of its controversial leader by Swiss police,
and said the news of his detention was invented by authorities to
diminish the party's position.
	   Pavlo Lazarenko, a former prime minister who now leads the
opposition Hromada party, was arrested by customs officials on the
Swiss-French border Wednesday afternoon.
	   Hromada said in a statement that the information about
Lazarenko's arrest distributed by Ukrainian media Thursday had not
been confirmed, and could be seen as ``the latest provocation'' by
authorities who ``are continuing their course aimed at destroying
the opposition and its leaders.''
	   However, Swiss prosecutors later confirmed the arrest to the
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry.
	   Lazarenko was detained after producing a passport showing him to
be a citizen of Panama, and was then transferred to Geneva, where a
judge had ordered his arrest, the ministry said, citing Swiss
officials.
	   Lazarenko, who is also a lawmaker in Ukraine's parliament, is at
the center of a corruption probe focusing on his time as prime
minister in 1996-97.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain, in particular reaping huge profits from gas
imports to Ukraine by giving preferential status to private energy
trader Unified Energy Systems (UES).
	   The company recently lost an appeal in Ukraine's Supreme
Arbitration Court over a 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 409 million) fine
imposed by tax authorities for evading taxes and illegally
transferring abroad dlrs 690 million received from gas sales.
	   The chief prosecutor's office in Kiev, which is investigating
several charges against Lazarenko, recently asked Swiss police to
assist in tracking down money Lazarenko allegedly illegally stashed
in Swiss banks.
	   Investigations against Lazarenko are under way in several
cantons in Switzerland.
	   The country's influential Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper
reported last month that about dlrs 40 million in bank accounts
linked to Lazarenko already had been frozen.
	   Hromada and UES officials say the corruption probe and tax fine
have no grounds and describe the scandal as politically motivated
and organized by President Leonid Kuchma and his close supporters.
Kuchma appointed Lazarenko prime minister and later fired him.
	   Lazarenko recently told the opposition daily Kievskie Vedomosti
that authorities were planning to kill him to get rid of a powerful
opposition leader.
	   ``I've never committed any crimes. Moreover, I never did
anything to deserve killers being sent to me,'' Lazarenko said at
the time.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor Mykhailo Potebenko has dismissed any
suggestions of politics in the case.

Yeltsin's surgeon: Yeltsin needs to listen to his doctor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with DeBakey saying no heart trouble, new grafs 9-10. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin needs to stay in bed to recover from
his latest bout of pneumonia, but the president has a long history
of ignoring the advice of his doctors, the president's heart
surgeon said Thursday.
	   Yeltsin has in the past rushed back to work without fully
recuperating from his ailments, and doctors have said this has
contributed to his recurring illnesses.
	   The president's aides say Yeltsin is again urging doctors to
discharge him from a government clinic where he remained
hospitalized for a 12th straight day Thursday.
	   Yeltsin must ``fulfill all orders of his doctors as pilots obey
air traffic controllers,'' said Dr. Renat Akchurin, who performed
Yeltsin's heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   ``I have had pneumonia in my life and I can say that it is not
at all easy to live through the disease,'' Akchurin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   And Yeltsin was likely to make it even more difficult, Akchurin
said.
	   ``As far as I know the president, he will not stay in bed as
told, but will return to work,'' Akchurin was quoted as saying.
	   Akchurin said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that the president was not suffering from any heart
problems.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, a renowned American cardiologist who
consulted on the 1996 surgery, also said Thursday that renewed
heart problems were unlikely.
	   DeBakey, who was visiting a medical center under construction in
the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan on Thursday, said that
Yeltsin looked fine when DeBakey examined him several months ago,
ITAR-Tass reported.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Canadian-Swiss ice hockey player Chad
Silver, who played for the Swiss national team, was found dead in
his Zurich flat Thursday, his club's sports director said. He was
29.
	   Authorities ordered an autopsy, but there was no immediate
information on the cause of death.
	   A statement from his team, the Zurich-based ZSC Lions, said
Silver played in a Swiss league game without problem Tuesday in
Davos and had taken part in training Wednesday.
	   ``When he didn't appear for the warmup Thursday morning, we
found him dead in his bed,'' said the statement.
	   Investigating Judge Daniel Regenmass said there was no
indication of violence. Simon Schenk, club sports director, said
Silver took no drugs and a recent doping test on the player was
negative.
	   Silver, who played junior hockey in his home town of Brandon,
Manitoba, has played the past nine years in Switzerland.

	   Pavlo Lazarenko, a former prime minister who now leads the
opposition Hromada party, was arrested by customs officials on the
Swiss-French border Wednesday afternoon.
	   Hromada said in a statement that the information about
Lazarenko's arrest distributed by Ukrainian media Thursday had not
been confirmed, and could be seen as ``the latest provocation'' by
authorities who ``are continuing their course aimed at destroying
the opposition and its leaders.''
	   However, Swiss prosecutors later confirmed the arrest to the
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry.
	   Lazarenko was detained after producing a passport showing him to
be a citizen of Panama, and was then transferred to Geneva, where a
judge had ordered his arrest, the ministry said, citing Swiss
officials.
	   Lazarenko, who is also a lawmaker in Ukraine's parliament, is at
the center of a corruption probe focusing on his time as prime
minister in 1996-97.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain, in particular reaping huge profits from gas
imports to Ukraine by giving preferential status to private energy
trader Unified Energy Systems (UES).
	   The company recently lost an appeal in Ukraine's Supreme
Arbitration Court over a 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 409 million) fine
imposed by tax authorities for evading taxes and illegally
transferring abroad dlrs 690 million received from gas sales.
	   The chief prosecutor's office in Kiev, which is investigating
several charges against Lazarenko, recently asked Swiss police to
assist in tracking down money Lazarenko allegedly illegally stashed
in Swiss banks.
	   Investigations against Lazarenko are under way in several
cantons in Switzerland.
	   The country's influential Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper
reported last month that about dlrs 40 million in bank accounts
linked to Lazarenko already had been frozen.
	   Hromada and UES officials say the corruption probe and tax fine
have no grounds and describe the scandal as politically motivated
and organized by President Leonid Kuchma and his close supporters.
Kuchma appointed Lazarenko prime minister and later fired him.
	   Lazarenko recently told the opposition daily Kievskie Vedomosti
that authorities were planning to kill him to get rid of a powerful
opposition leader.
	   ``I've never committed any crimes. Moreover, I never did
anything to deserve killers being sent to me,'' Lazarenko said at
the time.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor Mykhailo Potebenko has dismissed any
suggestions of politics in the case.

Yeltsin's surgeon: Yeltsin needs to listen to his doctor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with DeBakey saying no heart trouble, new grafs 9-10. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin needs to stay in bed to recover from
his latest bout of pneumonia, but the president has a long history
of ignoring the advice of his doctors, the president's heart
surgeon said Thursday.
	   Yeltsin has in the past rushed back to work without fully
recuperating from his ailments, and doctors have said this has
contributed to his recurring illnesses.
	   The president's aides say Yeltsin is again urging doctors to
discharge him from a government clinic where he remained
hospitalized for a 12th straight day Thursday.
	   Yeltsin must ``fulfill all orders of his doctors as pilots obey
air traffic controllers,'' said Dr. Renat Akchurin, who performed
Yeltsin's heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   ``I have had pneumonia in my life and I can say that it is not
at all easy to live through the disease,'' Akchurin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   And Yeltsin was likely to make it even more difficult, Akchurin
said.
	   ``As far as I know the president, he will not stay in bed as
told, but will return to work,'' Akchurin was quoted as saying.
	   Akchurin said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that the president was not suffering from any heart
problems.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, a renowned American cardiologist who
consulted on the 1996 surgery, also said Thursday that renewed
heart problems were unlikely.
	   DeBakey, who was visiting a medical center under construction in
the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan on Thursday, said that
Yeltsin looked fine when DeBakey examined him several months ago,
ITAR-Tass reported.

Lewinsky interview set for British TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky has agreed to do an interview with
a British television network for broadcast in Britain in February,
Channel 4 announced Thursday.
	   Channel 4 said its interview, to be taped in the United States,
will be transmitted ``within a few hours'' of the NBC interview Ms.
Lewinsky has already agreed to for North American television, and
before publication of the book on which she is collaborating.
	   The network said Ms lewinsky had agreed to talk about ``her life
and the events of the past year, including her relationship with
President Clinton.
	   Channel 4 did not announce what it was paying for the interview,
but the British national news agency Press Association reported the
sum was 400,000 pounds (dlrs 664,000). NBC's interview is free, as
major U.S. networks don't pay for interviews.
	   Channel 4 will be able to sell the rights for the interview to
all countries outside North America.

Iraq says cancer rates up, blames U.S., British weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi scientists said Thursday that birth
defects and childhood cancers have risen dramatically since the
1991 Gulf War and blamed the surge on depleted uranium used in
American and British tank-piercing shells.
	   A two-day medical conference which ended Thursday was attended
by about 600 Iraqi doctors and scientists, who urged the government
and individual families to seek redress from the United Nations and
international courts.
	   At the conference, Iraqi scientists showed pictures and slides
of babies born without hands or legs or with distorted heads.
	   They said that the number of children born with birth defects
had increased three-fold around the city of Basra in the south,
which was close to Gulf War battlefields.
	   Hospital statistics, they said, indicated that the number of
Iraqi children with cancer rose to 130,000 in 1997 from 32,000 in
1990.
	   The sole Western scientist attending the symposium _ Dr. Hari
Sharma, a radiology specialist from Waterloo University in Ontario,
Canada _ cautioned the Iraqis not to jump to conclusions.
	   ``The numbers are impressive and the deformations we have seen
are heart-breaking,'' Sharma told The Associated Press. ``But the
weakness in (Iraqi) presentation is the absence of causative
agent.''
	   He suggested that the increase in cancer cases could be due to
chemical particles in the huge oil well fires during the war.
	   ``Or simply they may be a result of trade sanctions,'' he said.
	   He was referring to U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, that have led to shortages of food and medicine
in the country. The invasion sparked the Gulf War.
	   Depleted uranium is a metal residue left when natural uranium is
refined. It is used in artillery shells and bombs designed to
penetrate the armor of tanks. On impact, the shells create an
airborne dust, which if inhaled or ingested, can be poisonous.
	   Some American veterans groups have suggested that the shells
could be a factor in Gulf War syndrome _ the name for a variety of
ailments that have afflicted scores of veterans.
	   American researchers also have looked into whether U.S. troops
could have been affected by chemical agents released by allied
bombing of Iraqi ammunition sites or, possibly, by vaccines or
pesticides in use in the war theater.
	   Three western Gulf War veterans _ former Sgt. 1st Class Carol
Picou from the United States and Raymond Bristow and Colin
Dursell-Lee from Britain _ participated in the conference. All said
they were seeking relief from Gulf War-related illness.

Former Paraguayan general says he's not going to jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ A former army commander will not
return to prison despite a Supreme Court ruling that ordered him to
finish serving a 10-year-sentence for rebellion, his lawyer said
Thursday.
	   Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo was convicted in March by a military
court for refusing an order by then-President Juan Carlos Wasmosy
to resign as army chief-of-staff in April 1996, setting off a
crisis that tested Paraguay's young democracy.
	   But Oviedo was released from prison in August after being
pardoned by his friend, newly inaugurated President Raul Cubas _ an
act that prompted calls for Cubas' impeachment.
	   Incensed lawmakers in this landlocked South American nation
appealed Cubas' decision to the Supreme Court, which ruled
Wednesday that Oviedo should serve out the sentence.
	   However, Oviedo's attorney, Jose Francisco Appleyard, said
Thursday he believes the Supreme Court ruling does not mean his
client has to return to prison.
	   The ruling, he said, means Cubas' presidential decree freeing
Oviedo was ``inapplicable'' but ``did not annul it.''
	   Many lawmakers who were angered by Cubas' decision to free
Oviedo have now called on the president to uphold the Supreme Court
decision.
	   ``If Cubas does not respect the decision, he will be subjected
to a political trial,'' said Sen. Luis Gonzalez.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ An explosion tore through a cafeteria at
a children's wing of an Armenian resort on Thursday, killing at
least four people and injuring 12 others.
	   Investigators believe the mid-afternoon blast may have been
caused by a gas leak, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   The building partially collapsed and rescuers were searching the
rubble for more victims with the help of search dogs.
	   The children's sanitarium in Dzhermuk _ a well-known mineral
water resort 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Armenia's

	   Forty-two people were in the building at the time of the blast,
though it was unclear how many were in the cafeteria.
	   Armenia's President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister Armen

German TV reports Degussa, not IG Farben, produced gas for death
</HEADLINE>
camps &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German television reported Thursday
that the chemical firm Degussa AG was primarily responsible for
production of the gas used for death-camp executions, not IG Farben
as long held.
	   The report by ARD is based on new information taken from files
recently made available in Poland.
	   Degussa, based in Frankfurt, declined to comment on specifics of
the report, pointing to a class-action suit charging it with
willingly helping the Nazis produce Zyklon B and in assisting in
processing gold seized from Jews. The suit, filed in the United
States in August, seeks all of Degussa's assets, which totaled
about dlrs 2.1 billion at the end of the 1997 fiscal year.
	   Degussa and IG Farben each owned equal 42.2 percent shares in
Degesch GmbH, which delivered to the Nazis the Zyklon-B cyanide
tablets used to gas hundreds of thousands of concentration camp
inmates. IG Farben, a chemical company dissolved after the war, has
long been identified as the chief producer of Zyklon B through a
subsidiary.
	   But citing documents at the High Commission for Investigating
Nazi Crimes in Poland, ARD reported that Degussa's sales division
actually controlled Degesch, not IG Farben.
	   The gas was produced by a facility in Dessau under contract for
Degussa, ARD reported. Degussa paid for the gas, and turned it over
to Degesch without receiving commission. Degesch then delivered it
to the Nazis.
	   Degussa also controlled two known Zyklon B production sites east
of Prague.
	   ARD said Degesch earned a profit of 300,000 Reichs marks, or 300
million marks (dlrs 176 million) in today's currency, through the
delivery of 20 tons of Zyklon B to the former Nazi death camp
Auschwitz from 1942-43.
	   After the war, Degussa chief Hermann Schlosser denied any
knowledge of Zyklon-B production. He remained on the board of
directors into the 1950s.
	   Degussa, the largest precious metals refiner in Europe in the
1930s and '40s, has opened its archives to researchers to
``clarify'' its smelting of gold, silver and jewelry confiscated
from Jews by the Nazis during that period, as well as its part in
making the gas Zyklon-B.

Former Ukrainian premier arrested in Switzerland

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Former Ukrainian premier Pavlo
Lazarenko has been arrested in Switzerland in connection with a
money-laundering investigation, officials said Thursday.
	   Lazarenko, 45, was arrested by customs officials as he crossed
by car from France into Switzerland on Wednesday, Basel state
prosecutor spokesman Markus Melzl said. Geneva state authorities
requested his transfer from Basel.
	   ``He will be questioned Friday morning in connection with an
inquiry in Geneva into the laundering of dirty money,''
investigating judge Laurent Kasper Ansermet said.
	   Switzerland says it has received 20 separate requests from
Ukraine since February 1997 for help in tracking down money
Lazarenko allegedly stashed away in Swiss banks. Switzerland has
already handed over some bank documents.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister in 1996-97, when he was sacked by
President Leonid Kuchma. He now leads the centrist opposition
Hromoda party and has accused Kuchma and his allies of trying to
blacken his name by the corruption charges.
	   In October, he alleged that authorities were plotting to kill
him.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A young man and woman whose bodies were
found at the bottom of a remote cliff have been identified as
Chinese students, police said Thursday.
	   Their bodies were apparently thrown over a cliff near the
mountain monastery of Trooditissa, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north
of Limassol, after having been strangled, police said after they
were discovered Wednesday.
	   The man and woman were both 23 and had arrived in Cyprus on Oct.
11, police said in a statement Thursday. They registered at a
college in the port of Limassol.
	   The police declined to name the couple as their next of kin had
not yet been informed.
	   The couple's apartment in Limassol had been ransacked and there
were bloodstains on its doorstep, a policeman said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   This is a ``most unusual crime for Cyprus,'' District Police
Chief Miltiades Neocleous told The Associated Press.
	   ``We are trying to establish a motive, but for the moment we
don't have a clue,'' he said.
	   Robbery has been ruled out as a motive as they were found
wearing jewellery.
	   Police said the couple's fellow students last saw them on
Tuesday. Neighbors described the couple as very quiet and likeable
and said they spent most of their time studying.

Bulgarian star gets heavy fine for kneeing opponent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German soccer federation Thursday
banned Bulgaria's World Cup star Krasimir Balakov until Jan. 28 for
kneeing Tunisian Zoubaier Baya in a Bundesliga game.
	   Balakov was also fined 40,000 marks (dlrs 24,000) for the
incident that took place last weekend in a game between Balakov's
Stuttgart and Baya's Freiburg, which won 2-0.
	   The incident was missed by the referee but the soccer federation
imposed the ban after seeing television replays.
	   The ban covers a maximum of eight official games and Balakov
will miss the last three Bundesliga games before the winter break
starts Dec. 20.
	   Because the eight-game ban also covers an indoor competition run
by the soccer federation during the break, Balakov should be
available when the Bundesliga resumes Feb. 19.
	   The Bulgarian midfielder is at odds with Stuttgart coach
Winfried Schaefer and was dropped from the German Cup game against
Bayern Munich on Tuesday although he was technically eligible to
play. Stuttgart lost 3-0.

FIFA confirms Zen-Ruffinen as new general secretary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA's executive committee on
Thursday confirmed Michel Zen-Ruffinen of Switzerland as the world
governing body's new general secretary.
	   He had been acting general secretary since April. His
predecessor, Sepp Blatter, was elected as president of FIFA in
June.
	   Zen-Ruffinen, 39, had been Blatter's deputy since early 1995.
The former international referee and trained lawyer joined FIFA in
1986, taking charge of refereeing matters.
	   He also took over responsibility for legal affairs within FIFA.
	   Zen-Ruffinen, like Blatter, comes from the southern Swiss state
of Valais.

Prince Philip: Countries not doing enough to protect oceans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Countries around the world haven't done nearly
enough to protect the seas, Prince Philip said Thursday, calling
for more participation in a United Nations agreement to control
over-fishing.
	   The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, made a rare public
appearance to help draw the curtain on the globally recognized
``International Year of the Ocean.'' Prince Philip serves as
president emeritus of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which was
behind the campaign.
	   Fund officials said the oceans campaign this year raised
awareness around the world, but was only marginally successful at
prompting conservation measures. A major disappointment has been
the failure of most major fishing countries to adopt the U.N. Fish
Stocks Agreement aimed at conserving fisheries.
	   Prince Philip called the efforts ``depressingly inadequate.''
	   ``Fishing nations ought to sign up to ratify the fish stocks
agreement,'' the prince said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``I think they should be thinking much more about
controlling the fishing that takes place in their own economic
zones. I think they need to look at the conservation of coastal
zones and estuaries, many of which are important breeding areas for
fish.''
	   The U.N. reports that as much as 70 percent of the world's fish
stocks require urgent intervention to avoid further decline or
restore depleted species. But many nations are hesitant to put any
controls on fishing for fear of disrupting the marine economy.
	   ``It's a Catch-22 situation,'' the prince acknowledged. ``If you
don't conserve it, there won't be any fish for the next generation,
and if you do conserve it, you're going to put some people out of a
job.
	   ``It's not an easy answer, but if you're stupid enough to get
into government, then these are the sort of problems you have to
deal with,'' the prince said with characteristic bluntness.
	   Fund director Claude Martin said changes aren't coming fast
enough.
	   ``The world oceans are in a perilous state,'' Martin said.
``While some governments made measurable progress during the past
12 months, most governments failed to take the critical steps
needed to manage this last wild frontier and to ensure that its
resources are safeguarded for future generations.''
	   Prince Philip said the future of the oceans depends on raising
awareness and getting people to pressure their lawmakers for
changes.
	   ``It's something that unless it is taken up by the media as an
issue, I don't think the (conservation organizations) on their own
can do very much,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ The United States has received requests that
U.S. President Bill Clinton not land at the newly opened
Palestinian airport during an upcoming visit, a U.S. official said
Thursday.
	   The Clinton administration is considering the Israeli request,
said the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
official said Clinton's travel plans have not yet been finalized.
	   Clinton is to arrive in Israel in the evening of Dec. 12 and on
Dec. 14 is to fly to the Gaza Strip to usher in the second stage of
the Wye River land-for-peace agreement he helped negotiate.
	   A possible Clinton landing at Gaza International, which opened
last week as part of the agreement, had been considered by the
White House.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said earlier Thursday that the Israeli government felt a
presidential landing in Gaza ``was tantamount to recognizing
(Palestinian) sovereignty,'' something Israel rejects.
	   However, Bar-Illan said later that Israel had not officially
requested that Clinton refrain from using the airstrip.

Italy counting on crowd against favored Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS.
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy figures it has an extra weapon for the
Davis Cup final.
	   Defending champion Sweden may have the richer tradition, and the
better players, but the hosts can count on sellout partisan crowds
to rattle the opposition.
	   ``It's a big occasion _ I couldn't miss this,'' Italy's Andrea
Gaudenzi said. ``What's going to make it really special is the
crowd and 13,000 people cheering for us.''
	   And, perhaps, more than just cheering.
	   Italy's raucous fans have been known to toss everything from
coins to sandwiches onto tennis courts, yell during the course of
play, and chant like a soccer crowd.
	   The final on slow clay indoors at the Assago Forum opens Friday.
Sweden captain Carl-Axel Hageskog dropped his highest ranked
player, Thomas Johansson, right before Thursday's draw.
	   Magnus Norman steps in and will face Gaudenzi in the opening
singles, followed by Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson vs. Davide
Sanguinetti.
	   Johansson is No. 17 in the ATP rankings, but has been battling a
sore knee.
	   ``The thing is, Norman likes to play on clay,'' said former
doubles specialist Anders Jarryd, now Hageskog's assistant.
``Johansson still doesn't feel as good there as he does on other
surfaces.''
	   Guadenzi will pair with lefthander Diego Nardiso in Saturday's
doubles. Jonas Bjorkman and Niklas Kulti are expected to form the
Swedish doubles team.
	   The Davis Cup has never had a final without any singles players
ranked in the world's top 30.
	   Until now.
	   Gustafsson is No. 31, Gaudenzi No. 44, Norman No. 52 and
Sanguinetti No. 47.
	   Gaudenzi has not played a match since helping Italy shock an
understrength U.S. squad 4-1 in September. He has been sidelined
with a sore right shoulder.
	   Only in the rah-rah atmosphere of Davis Cup does Gaudenzi
approach the promise he showed as a teenager. Gaudenzi is 16-8
overall in Davis Cup play.
	   Predictions are tough, since neither of the Swedes has ever
faced either of the Italians.
	   Norman, who had heart surgery a year ago, is new to tennis' top
team event, playing previously only against first-round foe
Slovakia. He did not advance past the second round at any of the
year's four Grand Slam tournaments.
	   While Sweden is after its seventh Davis Cup title, Italy's lone
triumph came in 1976. The Italians have lost in five other finals
appearances _ but this is their first chance to play at home.
	   Bjorkman played down the fans' potential impact.
	   ``We have too much experience,'' Bjorkman insisted, ``to get
into a situation where it bothers us.''
	   But plenty of players, including Sweden's own best ever, have
been undone.
	   The most infamous examples come from former Italy Davis Cup
captain Adriano Panatta's run to the final at the 1978 Italian Open
in Rome.
	   During the semifinal, spectators launched coins and batteries at
opponent Jose Higueras of Spain and the umpire. Both fled the
court, allowing Panatta to advance by default.
	   Swedish great Bjorn Borg, who defeated Panatta that year for his
second Italian title, also was hit by debris tossed from the
stands. After winning the five-set final, Borg vowed he'd never
return _ and didn't.

Germany to use G7 chair to seek money to close last Chernobyl
</HEADLINE>
reactor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer pledged
Thursday to secure funds to close the last working nuclear reactor
at Ukraine's Chernobyl plant while Germany holds the rotating chair
of the G-7 nations next year.
	   Fischer made the pledge after meeting with his Ukranian Foreign
Minister Boris Tarasiuk, who said Ukraine doesn't have the money to
keep its 1995 agreement with the G-7 to close all of Chernobyl's
reactors by 2000.
	   The G-7 group of industrialized nations said it would help with
the costs. Ukraine wants dlrs 3 billion to replace the plant.
	   Concern is growing about the safety of the final reactor after
Ukraine nuclear regulatory officials ordered it shut down on Dec.
1. An inspection showed some of its safety equipment was close to
the end of its operational life.
	   But Ukraine energy officials have refused to shut it down,
saying the reactor is needed to get the country through the winter.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, when its other unit was shut down in compliance with the
Ukrainian government's pledge to fully close the plant.
	   There have been frequent malfunctions at the reactor recently
despite lengthy repairs between July, 1997 and May, 1998.
	   One Chernobyl reactor was destroyed in the 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident, while another was stopped
after a 1991 fire.

 &UR; European defense identity on agenda at Anglo-French summit
 &UR; Eds: LEDES with arrival of leaders, changes dateline and byline &QL;

 &UR; By THIBAULT LEROUX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-MALO, France (AP) _ French and British leaders opened a
two-day summit Thursday evening, seeking to make progress in
forging a new defense identity for the European Union.
	   The EU is sensitive to criticism that it reacts too slowly and
in disjointed fashion to crises such as Kosovo, forcing the United
States to take the lead in resolving continental conflicts.
	   France is pushing for an independent European defense, starting
with a European pillar within NATO. But Britain insists NATO must
remain the cornerstone of defense and security.
	   ``At stake is the European Union's ability to have the political
and strategic leadership necessary to conduct military operations,
including with NATO,'' said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   ``So it must have a framework to help it make decisions, and the
capacity for action.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were to attend the summit,
which began Thursday evening and was to last until noon on Friday,
in the Britanny port town of Saint Malo.
	   Topics to be discussed include EU tax levels, small business,
and cooperation in Africa, where both countries have former
colonies.
	   Defense and security were expected to dominate the meeting.
	   Blair is being accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott, Chancellor Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and
Defense Secretary George Robertson.
	   France will be also be represented by Defense Minister Alain
Richard and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Officials met in Paris on Wednesday for three hours to discuss
defense.
	   Britain's Defense Ministry said Thursday that Robertson and
Richard will sign an agreement Friday allowing for better
cooperation in crisis management and military operations.
	   ``This agreement is a major and practical step towards
strengthening Europe's defense capability,'' Robertson said.
	   Britain and France, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security
Council members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of
the European Union.
	   But both now recognize the need for Europe to cope militarily
when the United States does not get involved in crises.
	   Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish
the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to
merge it into the European Union.
	   The summit comes on the heels of a Franco-German summit earlier
this week in Potsdam.
	   French officials say the summit, unprecedented in terms of the
number of officials attending, is the result of a change in British
policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor Party took over from the
Conservative Party in May 1997.
	   On Thursday, the newspaper Ouest-France published a special
supplement on the summit in both French and English and headlined:
``Welcome to Saint-Malo.''

Israeli jets raid guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon on Thursday after attacks on
Israeli outposts.
	   An Israeli jet fired two missiles at targets between the
villages of Siddiqine and Jebal al-Butom, 18 kilometers (11 miles)
southeast of the port of Tyre, Lebanese security officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. A second Israeli jet
provided cover.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6:50 p.m.
(16:50 GMT) raid.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said warplanes
attacked ``terrorist targets '' in southwest Lebanon.
	   The targeted area is believed to be used by guerrillas as a base
to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese
militiamen in the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   The air strike came about an hour after guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group claimed responsibility for mortar
and rocket attacks on Israeli positions in the occupied zone.
	   No casualties were reported in those attacks.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8. There have been no reports of
casualties from the raids.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in bomb attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas last month.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has been waging a guerrilla war
to oust an estimated 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied
militiamen from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its
northern territory from guerrilla attacks.

Manchester United reportedly seeking Japanese forward
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Manchester United repeatedly has bid for
Perugia's Japanese forward Hidetoshi Nakata in the past few weeks,
but has been turned down including its latest offer of 28 billion
lire (dlrs 16.6 million), Italy's largest sports daily reported
Thursday.
	   Milan's Gazzetta dello Sport wrote that Perugia has rejected
every offer from the English Premier League club/
	   Nakata has attracted a lot of attention in the Italian Serie A
by scoring six goals in 10 league games in his first season with
Perugia.
	   His spectacular overhead kick in last Sunday's match against
Piacenza _ the first of two goals _ repeatedly was shown by Italian
television networks.
	   Perugia officials said several clubs have been seeking Nakata
recently, but declined to comment on Manchester United's reported
bid.
	   Gazzetta also reported that negotiations for the transfer of
Internazionale's Nigerian star Nwankwo Kanu to Arsenal have
collapsed.

Russia's state bank begins repaying frozen accounts

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's giant state savings bank on Thursday
finally freed up some individual accounts transferred months ago
from six huge ailing private banks, news reports said.
	   The economic crisis that hit in August crippled the country's
six largest commercial banks. They reacted by freezing private
accounts, saying they had no money to repay depositors, prompting
public outrage and massive crowds at the few banks that were
releasing money.
	   The government in September offered the depositors to transfer
their accounts from the troubled banks to the state Sberbank,
saying all deposits would be guaranteed.
	   However, all foreign-currency deposits were to be paid out in
rubles _ and at about half the current exchange rate. Many Russians
keep their money in dollars because of its relative stability.
	   Many holders of ruble accounts took the offer, and a few of the
holders of foreign-currency accounts. Some have kept their money in
commercial banks, which are still struggling to survive.
	   Sberbank has taken over between 6 billion and 9 billion rubles
(dlrs 300 million-450 million) of deposit liabilities from the
ailing banks.
	   It promised to start paying out the deposits on Nov. 30, but
missed its own deadline by three days.
	   On Thursday, Sberbank reopened access to deposits transferred
from four of the commercial banks _ Menatep, Most Bank,
Mosbiznesbank, and Promstroibank. Deposits moved from Inkombank and
SBS-Agro remained frozen.
	   ``Regarding SBS-Agro, we've carried out our talks with them and
we will make a joint announcement, but no date has been set yet,''
Sberbank spokesman Alexander Torkonov said Thursday.
	   Many Russians, scarred by the banking crisis, have gone back to
keeping cash at home, in jars or under mattresses.

U.S. envoy presents Serbs with new Kosovo peace plan draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds UPDATES with more incidents reported; statement from
Milutinovic, Hill and KLA; no pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav border guards killed eight
ethnic Albanian rebels Thursday in the worst violation of a Kosovo
cease-fire reached in October under threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   Several other armed incidents were reported Thursday as U.S.
envoy for Kosovo presented Serb leaders with a revised draft plan
for the future of the troubled province. The envoy, Christopher
Hill, said slow progress was being made toward a permanent peace.
	   But Hill also warned that time was at a premium because of fears
that fighting, now at a relative lull, could resume with the onset
of warmer weather in the spring.
	   ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' Hill said.
	   The eight armed ethnic Albanians were killed near the town of
Prizren when nine of them reportedly opened fire on Yugoslav
soldiers guarding the border with Albania.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Kosovo's capital Pristina, which
reflects government views, said there were no injuries among the
Yugoslav troops. Kosovo Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for
Kosovo's independence, have frequently used illegal border routes
to arm themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   Yugoslavia's army command later confirmed the incident and said
the ethnic Albanians were trying to cross the border into Kosovo
``illegally.''
	   The border clash took place one day after three ethnic Albanians
were gunned down in their car in Kosovo's capital Pristina. Serbian
police said they found three automatic weapons and two hand
grenades in the car, which was raked by machine-gun fire.
	   Rebel spokesman Adem Demaci blamed the killings on Serbia's
secret police, saying one of the victims was a leading member of
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army while the two others were
civilians: a journalist of the main Albanian language newspaper
Bujku and a university student.
	   The journalist, Afrim Malici, had complained that he had been
followed by Serbia's secret service, colleagues said.
	   Prior to the meeting with Serbian President Milan Milutinovic in
Belgrade, Hill said the new draft reflects previous comments by
rival Serb and ethnic Albanian officials on how to achieve a
settlement for the Serbian province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own peace deal for Kosovo,
defying an earlier U.S. plan and warning that anything beyond some
sort of self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war.
	   Secessionist ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian
proposal. They have called for independence from Serbia but are
willing to settle for full autonomy as a first step.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless in the Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
that started in February. Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke on Oct. 12 to end the Kosovo campaign and begin
political negotiations on the province's future.
	   In a statement after meeting Hill, Milutinovic said he would
``carefully study'' the new U.S. proposal, but added that the
Serbian plan should be ``the main basis for the political
solution'' of the Kosovo crisis.
	   Serbia and the Serb leaders of Yugoslavia are strongly opposed
to any plan on Kosovo that would sidestep Serbia.
	   Hill did not elaborate on the plan, but said it doesn't
explicitly specify whether Kosovo will become the third Yugoslav
republic or would remain a Serb province. Republic status for
Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   The Oct. 12 agreement was reached as NATO was preparing an
airstrike campaign to force an end to the bloodshed.
	   While Hill said that the plan was still not in its final stage,
he said he would like to have a settlement by spring because of
fears that warmer weather could bring a resumption of fighting.
	   ``Spring should be the time for plowing and not for fighting,''
he added.
	   In separate incidents Thursday, a Serb man was injured on the
main Pristina-Pec road when ethnic Albanian rebels shot at his car
when he refused their order to stop, the Serb media center
reported.
	   It also said that an ethnic Albanian was killed ``by a masked
gunman'' with Kosovo Liberation Army markings while traveling on
the same road Wednesday.

Brian Kidd takes Blackburn manager's job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes, background

<TEXT>
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ After eight years as Alex Ferguson's
assistant at Manchester United, Brian Kidd on Thursday became the
manager of his own Premier League club.
	   Kidd, who helped United win four league titles in five years,
took over at last place Blackburn Rovers, signing a contract that
runs until June 2002.
	   He succeeds Roy Hodgson, who was fired last month after
Blackburn's 2-0 defeat to Southampton.
	   ``Brian was always our first choice, and I am delighted he has
accepted,'' said Blackburn owner Jack Walker, who has made his
third change in three years since the club won the Premier League
title in 1995.
	   While Kidd was No. 2 to Ferguson, United finished in the top two
in the league seven years in a row, four times as champion, and
twice won the FA Cup.
	   His decision to leave Old Trafford couldn't have come at a
busier time for United. On Saturday, Ferguson's team visits Premier
League leader Aston Villa with the chance to go top and, on
Wednesday, it hosts Bayern Munich with a European Champions Cup
quarterfinal place at stake.
	   ``While I have only been here three months he has been my mentor
around the place,'' said United's Tobagan striker Dwight Yorke, who
moved to the club in August from Aston Villa for a 12.6 million
pound (dlrs 20.9 million) transfer fee.
	   ``He will certainly be a massive loss. Manchester United has
been part of his life for a long time and he has been part of the
players' lives for a long time.
	   ``To have such an influential person leaving the camp is always
going to be a big loss, but such is life and such is football,''
Yorke said.
	   ``Good things come to an end, people come and go and what can we
say but good luck to him.''
	   United had agreed reluctantly to let Kidd talk with last-place
Rovers about filling their managerial vacancy.
	   ``He wants to progress his career and he wants to have the
chance of being a No. 1,'' chief executive Martin Edwards said.
``He wants that opportunity to speak to them and so reluctantly we
have agreed to that.''
	   Only last week Edwards claimed the only way Kidd would leave
United would be ``over my dead body.''
	   Rovers' dismal season continued Wednesday night with a 1-0 loss
to Leicester in the quarterfinals of the League Cup.
	   Blackburn is now bottom of the table with only two victories in
15 games.
	   Kidd has been associated with Manchester United throughout his
career. As a 19-year-old, he scored a goal in the club's European
Cup victory over Benfica in 1968.
	   He managed Preston for three months in 1986 before moving to
United as a junior coach. He became Ferguson's No. 2 in 1991,
replacing Archie Knox.

Official: Russia to keep close control over food aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 7-10 with Russia-EU agreement on food
distribution. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia intends to keep tight control over food aid
being shipped from the United States and the European Union, a top
agriculture official said Thursday.
	   Past aid deals have been tainted by corruption, and U.S.
officials have said they stressed in their negotiations with Russia
that they wanted to avoid any hint of scandal in the aid program
this winter.
	   In an interview with the Interfax news agency, First Deputy Food
and Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev said strict guidelines
have been drafted for the companies allowed to bid on contracts to
deliver the aid.
	   Wholly state-owned companies will be given preference, he said,
and other companies must be at least 20 percent state-held and have
at least one government representative on their board of directors.
	   The bidders also must not have any debts to the government, and
must have at least three years' experience in buying and supplying
food, Gordeyev said.
	   A government commission will send tender offers to more than 10
Russian companies considered to be potential distributors of the
aid.
	   The European Union on Thursday released an agreement it signed
with Russia spelling out procedures for food aid deliveries.
	   The aid will arrive in relatively small batches for the first
half of 1999, with Russian authorities and EU auditors supervising
the distribution, according to the memorandum, signed in Moscow on
Wednesday.
	   Russia may not re-export the food, and if it tries, the aid will
stop, the memorandum said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Most of the food will go to Russia's central and northern
regions _ the most troubled areas _ and none to Moscow and St.
Petersburg.
	   The Russian government has tentatively agreed to food aid deals
with the United States and the European Union valued at at a total
of roughly dlrs 1 billion. There have been concerns that some
Russians could go hungry this winter as a result of a poor grain
harvest and the country's economic crisis.

Arrest warrant issued for communist-era prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Warsaw military court issued an arrest
warrant Thursday for a communist-era prosecutor accused of
fabricating the evidence used to convict and hang a World War II
resistance hero in 1953.
	   By ruling the allegations were justified and accepting a motion
for the arrest of Helena Wolinska, the Warsaw Military District
Court took the first step toward extraditing the 79-year old from
Britain, where she has lived for over two decades.
	   Wolinska called the move to arrest her ``a political case'' but
refused to discuss the allegations Thursday, the PAP state news
agency reported. Last week, Wolinska said she feared she would not
get a fair trial in Poland.
	   Wolinska is accused of being responsible for the wrongful arrest
and subsequent execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf.
	   Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground
Home Army that fought the Nazis during World War II. After the war,
he refused to collaborate with the secret service of the new
communist regime.
	   He was charged in 1952 with killing Soviet soldiers and leftist
resisters during the war, and was hanged in 1953. Historians say
Wolinska fabricated the charges.
	   Wolinska had been summoned to testify at the investigation on
Oct. 15, but she failed to show up, prompting the military
prosecutor to seek the arrest warrant, which allows the government
to prepare an extradition motion.
	   Wolinska, who is married to Wlodzimierz Brus, emeritus professor
of modern Russian and East European studies at Oxford University,
has lived in Britain since 1972.
	   If convicted of denying Fieldorf his freedom, Wolinska could be
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

Alarm in the cockpit nixes shuttle launch at last minute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Launch scheduled for around 3:36 a.m. EST Friday. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ A loud, flashing alarm went off in
the cockpit of space shuttle Endeavour with just 4{ minutes to go
in the countdown Thursday, forcing the postponement of NASA's first
space station construction flight.
	   NASA said it would try again early Friday, though the weather
outlook was unfavorable.
	   The master alarm blared and red lights flashed just before the
shuttle was to lift off around 4 a.m. Thursday. By the time
controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic
pressure and decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had
missed the cutoff by a second or two.
	   ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill Readdy, shuttle program
director and a veteran shuttle commander. ``But we do things right.
We do things by the book, and we're not going to cut any corners
even if it means just shaving a second or two.''
	   The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up
their hands. Commander Robert Cabana held up his thumb and index
finger a half-inch apart: ``We were that close.''
	   NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour
in order to meet up with the first space station part, which was
put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians.
	   The problem was confined to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic
pressure units. The pressure dropped just long enough to trigger
the alarm, then returned to normal. NASA engineers were examining
the problem but were confident it would not reoccur.
	   Endeavour's flight is already a year late because of a cash
crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in building the
international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA about
$600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay.
	   Aboard Endeavour is the second station component, an
American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronauts
will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian piece and
attach it to Unity. Then, two spacewalkers will hook up all the
electrical connections and cables between the two cylinders, and
attach handrails and tools for future crews.
	   Until the alarm sounded, it looked as though the weather would
be the only problem. Rain and clouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{
hours before liftoff, but drifted away with minutes to spare.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from
around the world had gathered in the drizzle to see Endeavour and
its crew off.
	   ``Here we have 16 countries cooperating on a venture to the
future,'' said Albright, who couldn't stay for Friday's attempt.
``This is a good investment.''

Russia's state bank begins repaying frozen accounts

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's giant state savings bank on Thursday
finally freed up some individual accounts transferred months ago
from six huge ailing private banks, news reports said.
	   The economic crisis that hit in August crippled the country's
six largest commercial banks. They reacted by freezing private
accounts, saying they had no money to repay depositors, prompting
public outrage and massive crowds at the few banks that were
releasing money.
	   The government in September offered the depositors to transfer
their accounts from the troubled banks to the state Sberbank,
saying all deposits would be guaranteed.
	   However, all foreign-currency deposits were to be paid out in
rubles _ and at about half the current exchange rate. Many Russians
keep their money in dollars because of its relative stability.
	   Many holders of ruble accounts took the offer, and a few of the
holders of foreign-currency accounts. Some have kept their money in
commercial banks, which are still struggling to survive.
	   Sberbank has taken over between 6 billion and 9 billion rubles
(dlrs 300 million-450 million) of deposit liabilities from the
ailing banks.
	   It promised to start paying out the deposits on Nov. 30, but
missed its own deadline by three days.
	   On Thursday, Sberbank reopened access to deposits transferred
from four of the commercial banks _ Menatep, Most Bank,
Mosbiznesbank, and Promstroibank. Deposits moved from Inkombank and
SBS-Agro remained frozen.
	   ``Regarding SBS-Agro, we've carried out our talks with them and
we will make a joint announcement, but no date has been set yet,''
Sberbank spokesman Alexander Torkonov said Thursday.
	   Many Russians, scarred by the banking crisis, have gone back to
keeping cash at home, in jars or under mattresses.

U.S. envoy presents Serbs with new Kosovo peace plan draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds UPDATES with more incidents reported; statement from
Milutinovic, Hill and KLA; no pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav border guards killed eight
ethnic Albanian rebels Thursday in the worst violation of a Kosovo
cease-fire reached in October under threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   Several other armed incidents were reported Thursday as U.S.
envoy for Kosovo presented Serb leaders with a revised draft plan
for the future of the troubled province. The envoy, Christopher
Hill, said slow progress was being made toward a permanent peace.
	   But Hill also warned that time was at a premium because of fears
that fighting, now at a relative lull, could resume with the onset
of warmer weather in the spring.
	   ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' Hill said.
	   The eight armed ethnic Albanians were killed near the town of
Prizren when nine of them reportedly opened fire on Yugoslav
soldiers guarding the border with Albania.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Kosovo's capital Pristina, which
reflects government views, said there were no injuries among the
Yugoslav troops. Kosovo Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for
Kosovo's independence, have frequently used illegal border routes
to arm themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   Yugoslavia's army command later confirmed the incident and said
the ethnic Albanians were trying to cross the border into Kosovo
``illegally.''
	   The border clash took place one day after three ethnic Albanians
were gunned down in their car in Kosovo's capital Pristina. Serbian
police said they found three automatic weapons and two hand
grenades in the car, which was raked by machine-gun fire.
	   Rebel spokesman Adem Demaci blamed the killings on Serbia's
secret police, saying one of the victims was a leading member of
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army while the two others were
civilians: a journalist of the main Albanian language newspaper
Bujku and a university student.
	   The journalist, Afrim Malici, had complained that he had been
followed by Serbia's secret service, colleagues said.
	   Prior to the meeting with Serbian President Milan Milutinovic in
Belgrade, Hill said the new draft reflects previous comments by
rival Serb and ethnic Albanian officials on how to achieve a
settlement for the Serbian province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own peace deal for Kosovo,
defying an earlier U.S. plan and warning that anything beyond some
sort of self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war.
	   Secessionist ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian
proposal. They have called for independence from Serbia but are
willing to settle for full autonomy as a first step.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless in the Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists
that started in February. Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke on Oct. 12 to end the Kosovo campaign and begin
political negotiations on the province's future.
	   In a statement after meeting Hill, Milutinovic said he would
``carefully study'' the new U.S. proposal, but added that the
Serbian plan should be ``the main basis for the political
solution'' of the Kosovo crisis.
	   Serbia and the Serb leaders of Yugoslavia are strongly opposed
to any plan on Kosovo that would sidestep Serbia.
	   Hill did not elaborate on the plan, but said it doesn't
explicitly specify whether Kosovo will become the third Yugoslav
republic or would remain a Serb province. Republic status for
Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   The Oct. 12 agreement was reached as NATO was preparing an
airstrike campaign to force an end to the bloodshed.
	   While Hill said that the plan was still not in its final stage,
he said he would like to have a settlement by spring because of
fears that warmer weather could bring a resumption of fighting.
	   ``Spring should be the time for plowing and not for fighting,''
he added.
	   In separate incidents Thursday, a Serb man was injured on the
main Pristina-Pec road when ethnic Albanian rebels shot at his car
when he refused their order to stop, the Serb media center
reported.
	   It also said that an ethnic Albanian was killed ``by a masked
gunman'' with Kosovo Liberation Army markings while traveling on
the same road Wednesday.

Official: Russia to keep close control over food aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 7-10 with Russia-EU agreement on food
distribution. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia intends to keep tight control over food aid
being shipped from the United States and the European Union, a top
agriculture official said Thursday.
	   Past aid deals have been tainted by corruption, and U.S.
officials have said they stressed in their negotiations with Russia
that they wanted to avoid any hint of scandal in the aid program
this winter.
	   In an interview with the Interfax news agency, First Deputy Food
and Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev said strict guidelines
have been drafted for the companies allowed to bid on contracts to
deliver the aid.
	   Wholly state-owned companies will be given preference, he said,
and other companies must be at least 20 percent state-held and have
at least one government representative on their board of directors.
	   The bidders also must not have any debts to the government, and
must have at least three years' experience in buying and supplying
food, Gordeyev said.
	   A government commission will send tender offers to more than 10
Russian companies considered to be potential distributors of the
aid.
	   The European Union on Thursday released an agreement it signed
with Russia spelling out procedures for food aid deliveries.
	   The aid will arrive in relatively small batches for the first
half of 1999, with Russian authorities and EU auditors supervising
the distribution, according to the memorandum, signed in Moscow on
Wednesday.
	   Russia may not re-export the food, and if it tries, the aid will
stop, the memorandum said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Most of the food will go to Russia's central and northern
regions _ the most troubled areas _ and none to Moscow and St.
Petersburg.
	   The Russian government has tentatively agreed to food aid deals
with the United States and the European Union valued at at a total
of roughly dlrs 1 billion. There have been concerns that some
Russians could go hungry this winter as a result of a poor grain
harvest and the country's economic crisis.

Arrest warrant issued for communist-era prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Warsaw military court issued an arrest
warrant Thursday for a communist-era prosecutor accused of
fabricating the evidence used to convict and hang a World War II
resistance hero in 1953.
	   By ruling the allegations were justified and accepting a motion
for the arrest of Helena Wolinska, the Warsaw Military District
Court took the first step toward extraditing the 79-year old from
Britain, where she has lived for over two decades.
	   Wolinska called the move to arrest her ``a political case'' but
refused to discuss the allegations Thursday, the PAP state news
agency reported. Last week, Wolinska said she feared she would not
get a fair trial in Poland.
	   Wolinska is accused of being responsible for the wrongful arrest
and subsequent execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf.
	   Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground
Home Army that fought the Nazis during World War II. After the war,
he refused to collaborate with the secret service of the new
communist regime.
	   He was charged in 1952 with killing Soviet soldiers and leftist
resisters during the war, and was hanged in 1953. Historians say
Wolinska fabricated the charges.
	   Wolinska had been summoned to testify at the investigation on
Oct. 15, but she failed to show up, prompting the military
prosecutor to seek the arrest warrant, which allows the government
to prepare an extradition motion.
	   Wolinska, who is married to Wlodzimierz Brus, emeritus professor
of modern Russian and East European studies at Oxford University,
has lived in Britain since 1972.
	   If convicted of denying Fieldorf his freedom, Wolinska could be
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A cadet from a military college in central Siberia
stole a rifle and tried to flee, but was shot to death by a sentry,
a news report said Thursday.
	   Dmitry Filyagin, a third-year cadet in the city of Novosibirsk,
walked into the college's storage area on Wednesday and seized a
rifle from the guard, a fellow cadet, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Filyagin then tried to flee, but was stopped by a sentry, who
shot after Filyagin pulled the rifle's breach block, Interfax said.
	   Military officials said the incident may have been a result of
Filyagin's family troubles, Interfax reported. It did not
elaborate.
	   Prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against the sentry,
who is accused of ``exceeding the limits of necessary defense when
detaining a person who has committed a crime,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported, citing the region's deputy military prosecutor,
Lt. Col. Ivan Parnikov.
	   A severe lack of funding and miserable living conditions in the
Russian army have driven scores of servicemen to attack their own
comrades or commit suicide.

Israel suspends troop withdrawal after attack on Israeli soldier

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In defiance of the United States, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday he will not back down
from a decision to suspend the Wye River peace agreement over what
he says are a series of Palestinian violations.
	   ``We are not to be made fools,'' said an angry Netanyahu who won
unanimous backing from his Cabinet ministers after they viewed
footage of an attack on an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian mob.
	   Ministers assembled around a TV set and watched a video of
Wednesday's brutal attack. When the tape stopped, the decision was
unanimous: Israel would suspend its West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Holding Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority responsible for
the attack, Netanyahu said: ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli
citizens being lynched, or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that
received incitement from Palestinian officials.''
	   The latest crisis to plague the Mideast peace accord cast a pall
over the upcoming visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton, just days
before he was to arrive in the region to oversee implementation of
the second phase of the deal he helped broker.
	   ``Who would have expected that Clinton would arrive while the
agreement was frozen,'' said Emmanuel Rosen, chief diplomatic
correspondent for Israel's Channel 2 TV.
	   The Israeli decision appeased hard-liners in Netanyahu's
coalition whose support for the premier since he signed the latest
accord to cede more war-captured land, had been waning.
	   Ahead of a crucial parliament vote Monday over whether to call
early elections, the decision to freeze the peace process has
brought right-wingers back into Netanyahu's fold. Members of the
National Religious Party said they would now vote with Netanyahu
and block attempts to end his administration prematurely.
	   Supporters of the bill said they might delay the vote because
they no longer have a majority.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation once
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce
a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Israel has said it will not free those involved in attacks that
resulted in death or injury. The Palestinians demand that Israel
free prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The Palestinians appealed to the United States for help and
Arafat said Thursday that Netanyahu is ``violating completely'' the
Wye agreement.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin rejected the Israeli
conditions, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   Meanwhile, violence erupted for a second straight day in three
Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem following the stabbing death of a
Palestinian man in the city.
	   Palestinian rioters threw stones at police and Israeli
motorists. Six Israeli police officers and three Israeli civilians
were injured by rocks, one Palestinian was struck by a rubber
bullet fired by police to disperse stone throwers on the Mount of
Olives, and 19 stone-throwers were arrested.
	   In Tel Aviv, a shack housing five Palestinian laborers from the
Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they were investigating
whether the arsonists had political motives. The laborers escaped
unharmed.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   Hours later, an Israeli soldier and civilian were attacked by a
Palestinian mob, fresh from an anti-Israel demonstration near the
West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Netanyahu convened his so-called security Cabinet and played a
videotape of the incident. Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the
atmosphere in the Cabinet room was tense during the screening and
that those present decided unanimously afterward to hold up the
accord.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials argued over whether the attack
on the soldier was orchestrated or spontaneous.
	   The incident began when about 150 Palestinian university
students, many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march
in Ramallah to press for Israel to release Palestinian prisoners in
its jails.
	   The group then headed to the outskirts of town to throw stones
at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier was riding in.
	   Netanyahu said the incident was ``organized, orchestrated,
planned in advance and fomented by the Palestinian Authority.''
	   However, Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank,
said the incident was triggered by growing anger over Israel's
handling of the prisoner issue.
	   ``In clashes, rocks are thrown,'' Barghouti said. ``This car
stopped with the soldier and they took his weapon. It was later
returned. They did not use it to kill.''
	   Palestinian security forces have not arrested any of the rioters
involved in the attack, a senior official said. On Wednesday
evening, the soldier's M-16 assault rifle was handed to the
governor of Ramallah, but none of those making the delivery were
questioned or detained.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA's executive committee on
Thursday confirmed Michel Zen-Ruffinen of Switzerland as the world
governing body's new general secretary.
	   He had been acting general secretary since April. His
predecessor, Sepp Blatter, was elected as president of FIFA in
June.
	   Zen-Ruffinen, 39, had been Blatter's deputy since early 1995.
The former international referee and lawyer joined FIFA in 1986,
taking charge of refereeing matters.
	   He also took over responsibility for legal affairs within FIFA.
	   Zen-Ruffinen, like Blatter, comes from the southern Swiss state
of Valais.

Human Rights group crusades against deadliness of rubber bullets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A leading Israeli human rights group said
Thursday that at least 57 Palestinians have been killed by the
rubber-coated steal bullets the Israel army says they use in an
effort to prevent unnecessary deaths.
	   The so-called rubber bullets are routinely used by Israeli
troops as a method of dispersing Palestinian street demonstrations.
	   According to a report released by the Betselem group, since the
outbreak of the six-year Palestinian uprising against Israel which
began in 1987, over half of the 57 killed were minors.
	   An statement from the army spokesman responding to the report
did not dispute the numbers of those killed but defended use of the
bullets. The spokesman said troops only fired the bullets in
dangerous situations after other methods of crowd dispersal had
been exhausted and on instructions from commanding officers in the
field.
	   The statement criticized the Betselem report for not taking the
context of the shootings into consideration.
	   ``The Betselem report describes soldiers using rubber bullets
while ignoring the types of violent incidents that troops and
citizens are involved in that require the army to use this
method,'' the statement said.
	   Betselem also criticized the army for disciplining soldiers
involved in only three of the 57 cases. Betselem said the lack of
punitive actions revealed the army's ``shameful disregard for the
lives of Palestinians.''
	   The group urged the army to consider rubber-coated bullets
lethal ammunition whose use should be restricted to
life-threatening situations alone.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Survivors of the Bosnian war's
worst massacre expressed joy Thursday that a top Serb military
leader charged with orchestrating the killings would soon stand
trial for genocide.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in Bosnia Wednesday by U.S.
members of the NATO peacekeeping force there. He is the most senior
Serb military officer seized so far in the effort to bring to trial
Bosnians accused of war crimes.
	   He arrived late Thursday in The Hague, where the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal has indicted him on charges of genocide, war
crimes, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions. An arraignment date has not been set.
	   His indictment _ unsealed Thursday _ alleges the offenses
occurred following the Serb takeover of the U.N. ``safe haven'' of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most of the members of the Bosnian Muslim population of
the Srebrenica enclave, using automatic weapons, hand grenades and
other weaponry.
	   In Sarajevo, survivors of the Srebrenica massacre applauded
Krstic's arrest.
	   ``Since July 13, 1995, I've never felt happiness in my heart,''
Kada Hotic said in an interview, referring to the date the Serbs
overran the town. ``Last night when I heard he was arrested, I felt
happy.''
	   Another survivor, Munira Subasic, said she hoped Krstic ``will
give answers to where are our relatives, our children.''
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October. It had been kept secret so he wouldn't be prompted to
flee.
 &UR; The killings, described, pick up 8th graf pvs.

adoptions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's attorney general said Thursday
that he wants to suspend all adoptions by foreigners after
complaints that unscrupulous lawyers were taking advantage of poor
women.
	   Attorney General Carlos Garcia Regas urged the public magistrate
and the Supreme Court to suspend foreign adoptions of Guatemalan
children while new regulations are drafted to better regulated the
process.
	   Human rights groups have denounced what they say is the
widespread practice of lawyers coercing women into giving up their
babies so they can collect a high adoption fee, usually about dlrs
15,000.
	   Ricardo Alvarado, president of the Guatemalan Lawyers
Association, said his group doesn't oppose the suspension of
foreign adoptions, adding that only a small group of bad lawyers
are to blame for the abuses.
	   In a nation of 10 million people, the attorney general's office
reviews between 170 and 200 adoption cases a month, almost all
involving foreigners. This year, the U.S. Embassy expects 1,000
children to be adopted by U.S. citizens alone.

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Defending champions New
Zealand, Fiji and Australia showed their class on the opening day
of the dlrs 50,000 Dubai International Rugby Sevens on Thursday to
cruise into the quarter-final.
	   The three southern hemisphere teams finished their league
matches unbeaten with New Zealand and Fiji easily looking the best
equipped to win the dlrs 25,000 first prize on Friday.
	   New Zealand, led by 35-year-old Dallas Seymour, began their
defense with a 43-0 drubbing of former winners, Scotland, before
swamping Chinese Taipei 57-0 in Group W. South African side, Natal,
stretched the New Zealanders in the final league match before going
down 15-0.
	   The New Zealanders and Natal were involved in a scuffle at the
end of their bruising encounter, which also saw Seymour serve out a
two-minute sin bin penalty for a rough tackle.
	   ``This is the first time some of the players are playing
together in the tournament but we are pleased with our performance
as there have been no injuries,' said New Zealand coach Gordan
Tietjens.
	   Fiji, the world sevens champions, were also among the high try
scorers as they strolled over England Select 35-5, the United
States 36-7 and Warblers International from New Zealand 34-12.
	   Australia, who made heavy work of beating Canada 31-21 in their
first match, began to find their feet as the tournament progressed,
beating Hong Kong 33-7 and Tonga 29-12.
	   The Canadians proved the surprise team, qualifying for the
quarter-finals behind Australia after beating Hong Kong 14-12 in a
thriller to take the second spot in the group.
	   The top two teams from the four groups qualified for the
quarter-finals. Australian coach Mark Ella tipped New Zealand and
Fiji to make it to the final.
	   ``Both teams are a cut above the rest and should battle it out
for the title,'' said the former Australian great. ``I am not
satisfied with our performance so far.''

Bosnian Serb officials protest arrest of Gen. Krstic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian Serb president
and army leaders Thursday blasted the arrest of a Serb general
accused of war crimes, calling it a ``terrorist act.''
	   Nikola Poplasen, president of Serb-run half of Bosnia, lodged a
protest over the arrest of Gen. Radislav Krstic by NATO-led troops
with the Office of High Representative, the top international body
in Bosnia.
	   After meeting members of Bosnian Serb army headquarters,
Poplasen said the arrest of Gen. Krstic presented ``a sadistic act
typical of highwayman banditry.'' Poplasen said Bosnian Serb
sub-state with do all in its power to defend Krstic.
	   The Bosnian Serb army headquarters praised Gen. Krstic as ``an
honorable man of high moral values.'' It said Krstic was
``kidnapped'' by masked people and harassed as he was dragged out
of his car toward a helicopter.
	   Bosnian Serbs decided Wednesday to reduce contact with NATO-led
Stabilization Force in Bosnia to the minimum. Poplasen said the
peace troops had overstepped their authority by snatching Gen.
Krstic. He said the Serb general, as an active duty officer, had
cooperated closely with the peace troops in the past three years.

London share prices rise after European rate cuts

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Coordinated interest rate cuts in 11 European
countries produced a late rally on the London Stock Exchange on
Thursday.
	   Ten of the 11 countries that will adopt Europe's new single
currency next year_ including Germany, France, and the Netherlands
_ dropped their interest rate to 3 percent. Italy dropped to 3.5
percent from 4 percent. Britain is not part of the European
currency.
	   ``The market's taken heart from the surprise rate cuts in
continental Europe, which make a U.K. cut more likely,'' said Andy
Hartwill, U.K. strategist at SG Securities.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed up 58.9 points, or 1.07 percent, at 5,566.1, and the
provisional volume for the entire market was 966.8 million shares
compared with 1.04 billion on Wednesday.

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	   Il Manifesto, Rome, on Chilean Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
extradition:
	   Some say Pinochet's possible extradition to Madrid could
jeopardize Chile's transition to democracy. The question is: Is it
at risk from Pinochet's arrest and possible trial or from his
shameless impunity which makes any reconciliation theories
impossible?
	   Others say extradition would be a dangerous precedent
irresponsibly set by Spanish judge (Baltasar) Garzon and Britain's
House of Lords. Though still unknown, the effects will surely be
devastating ... The question is: Is this more dangerous than
Pinochet's consecrated immunity and impunity?
	   The Chilean right, left and center have to settle costly and
dangerous accounts with the past. Accounts which this decade's
democratic transition left open and suspended. The right time and
opportunity have come to close them. ...
	   Pinochet's extradition and trial might be a much-needed push to
complete this (so far) imperfect transition.

AIDS virus, 95 percent live in developing countries. And the worst
is to come. ...
	   A dramatic paradox underlies this situation: As the pandemic
loses force in industrialized countries, doctors, researchers and
associations the disease receive fewer means to combat the virus.
	   It's as if, yet again, an unwritten rule is applied: What
determines the priority of research is not the number of patients
concerned, but rather the creditworthiness of patients who are or
will be affected.
	   The international community must beware of such reasoning. In
too often considering the profitability of research programs, we
forget that this pandemic will have economic and financial
repercussions for creditor countries. It is not the moment for
eloquent speeches and superficial initiatives: We must have real
mobilization.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Bradenton Herald, Bradenton, Florida, on AIDS:
	   In the near future, we hope we can write an editorial for World
AIDS Day that begins: ``Thanks to an effective education campaign,
research that led to a vaccine against AIDS and cure for those
infected with the disease, the deadly HIV virus has been
defeated.''
	   Unfortunately, it's far too soon to write those words, primarily
because politics, prejudice and bigotry continue to influence how
our society responds to this disease. ...
	   Indeed, the threat is as serious as ever, even though AIDS
dropped off the list of the top 10 causes of death in the United
States this year. ...
	   Convinced that AIDS is on the decline, some political leaders
may be less willing to provide the money for continued research and
desperately needed outreach to minority communities where the virus
is gaining ground.
	   Convinced that AIDS is no longer a threat, people of all
backgrounds ... may turn a deaf ear to education efforts. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Independent, London, on the awarding of a prestigious arts
award to a painter who incorporates elephant dung into his works:
	   Yes, the Turner Prize's entries include, and have included,
everything from dung and bricks to preserved sheep. And yes, it has
seemed more concerned with video performances and bits and pieces
tied together than we art as the man in the street, or the visitor
to the nation's galleries, would recognize it.
	   Nonetheless, the fact is that the Turner Prize has added to the
gaiety of the nation in one of the areas of culture where Britain
is now paramount: contemporary visual arts. ... What the Turner
Prize has succeeded in doing is to show where some of the action in
modern art is taking place, and to display what at least a few
artists are up to as they challenge past conventions and redefine,
as every generation must do, the terms of their craft. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on India:
	   Bad students get bad marks: In India on Sunday, Prime Minister
(Atal Bihari) Vajpayee and his Hindu nationalist coalition had to
take note of this simple equation.
	   The devastating defeat in parliamentary elections in the
politically important states of Delhi, Rajastan and Madhya Pradesh
... amounts to a withdrawal of confidence from voters from the BJP
and its fragile alliance, in power for just eight months.
	   In contrast, the Congress party under its new leader, Sonia
Gandhi ... has made an impressive return to the political stage.
	   The effect of the outcome on national politics is unclear. The
premier should try immediately to win back voters' trust through
new reforms.
	   For its part, Congress ... will not for now try for power,
although it appears to be within reach.

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Israel and the West Bank:
	   ``A sampling of yesterday's headlines that traveled around the
world on international news wire services included: ``Israel takes
delivery of first Arrow missile;'' ``Prisoner issue sparks new
crisis in Wye River accord;'' ``Palestinian protesters clash with
Israeli police in Jerusalem''....
	   The repetition of such news headlines day after day, month after
month, and year after year is no surprise, since nothing seems to
be changing for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The recent news that Israel has agreed to several measures that
would facilitate Jordan's economic relations with the West Bank are
encouraging, but these measures are only a small part of a
comprehensive package. Israel must recognize that restoring the
Palestinians' national rights are equally vital to Jordanians'
confidence in the peace process, but Israel seems to have failed to
acknowledge that by undermining peace with the Palestinians, it is
also pulling the rug from under its treaty with Jordan.
	   Forty-five countries (met Monday) in Washington for a
Palestinian donors conference. Hopefully, they remember that peace
takes more than money; it needs political will, not the least of
which should come from Israel.

	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on the spreading
economic crisis:
	   ``I have no hesitation in asserting that the global capitalist
system will succumb to its defects, if not on this occasion then on
the next one _ unless we recognize that it is defective and act in
time to correct the deficiencies.''
	   This warning comes from George Soros, in his latest book, ``The
Crisis of Global Capitalism.'' ...
	   It is a warning worth heeding not because Soros is a renowned
economist or an eminent political theorist. He is neither of these.
But he is a major international financier and as such much closer
to the action than many intellectuals writing about the state of
the international economy at the moment. ...
	   First and most importantly, he sees capitalism as a victim of
its own success. Social, political and legal institutions have not
kept pace with the globalization of the economy. ... What is
needed, he argues, is a capacity to regulate the excesses of the
financial markets, but this cannot be done at the level of the
nation-state because the problem is bigger than individual states
and because national politics have failed in the task up to now.
...
	   Second, Soros argues that a fundamentalist approach has come to
dominate economic thinking. The approach is one in which ``monetary
values and transactional markets do not provide an adequate basis
for social cohesion.''
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times, London, on Quebec elections:
	   The solid victory by the secessionist Parti Quebecois in the
province's general elections is a personal triumph for Lucien
Bouchard, the former federal minister who took over the embattled
party's leadership in the wake of the bitter fallout from the
failed referendum on independence in 1995 ... But the victory is by
no means the landslide his supporters had hoped, and leaves a
bitter taste in the mouths of those ready to proclaim the immediate
holding of a new referendum on separation from Canada.
	   Mr. Bouchard now faces a dilemma. He can not afford another
failed referendum. He would be better advised to wait until he is
assured of victory before going to the polls. The risk here,
however, is not just the disappointment of the party faithful. Time
is not necessarily on the separatists' side. The federal government
has made enormous efforts to woo Quebec.
	   Little by little Quebeckers may be persuaded that the fight for
`sovereignty' is hardly worth the bitterness ... The polls show
that support for independence is falling. Mr. Bouchard is an astute
and popular leader. He should use his victory to ensure that
Quebec's pragmatic relationship with Ottawa yields benefits for all
Canada.
	    &UR; ___
	   South County Journal of Kent, Washington, on Jack Kevorkian:
	   The decision by ``60 Minutes'' to air a videotape of a
terminally ill man being euthanized by Dr. Jack Kevorkian was a
shabby excuse for television. It's galling enough when TV parades
Jerry Springer and Jenny Jones before our eyes. Now CBS, the
network of Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite, is down there,
too.
	   The death of David Youk, terminally ill from Lou Gehrig's
disease, was not ``news'' in the commonly understood sense of that
word. He had died more than nine weeks earlier, on Sept. 17. Nor is
Kevorkian, a tireless advocate of assisted suicide, particularly
news.
	   But November is a sweeps month, when ratings, which determine
how much programs can charge advertisers, are measured, and
Kevorkian had this self-made videotape _ and an agenda. ...
	   Kevorkian's actions, particularly the way they were staged,
threaten to turn that serious debate into a sideshow.
	    &UR; ___
	   Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, on the Starovoitova
slaying:
	   They have sent one woman to her final rest, but they may have
awakened a slumbering giant.
	   The slaying of Galina Starovoitova, an outspoken liberal member
of the Russian Parliament, obviously was intended to frighten other
advocates of democracy and reform into submission. But those who
ordered the atrocity in St. Petersburg may have miscalculated
greatly.
	   Those who gunned Starovoitova down on the staircase to her
apartment transformed her into an instant martyr who may serve the
cause of Russian freedom better in death than she did as a living
advocate of it.
	   Already that staircase has blossomed into an impromptu shrine.
Hundreds of mourners have visited it, probed with their fingers the
bullet holes left in the concrete walls by the assassins' rifles,
and obscured the bloodstains with flowers and candle wax.
	   Because of Russia's economic woes and the leadership vacuum
caused by President Boris Yeltsin's declining health, the liberal
and reform forces have fallen into ... disarray, leaving the field
to the gangsters, communists and authoritarian nationalists.

European central banks cuts key interest rate for euro launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for Ams &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Making their first collective decision
about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common
currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move
that won market confidence.
	   Ten of the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped
their key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most
significant plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest
cut, from 3.2 percent.
	   The exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. It is
expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is
launched.
	   Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the
groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected
rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent
before the cut, now 3 percent.
	   However, interest rate levels had become a contentious political
issue with center-left governments in Germany and France pushing
for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment, stuck at
10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro.
	   The head of the European Central Bank that will set monetary
policy for the euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday
suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets to create
jobs, and not pressure him to cut rates.
	   The remarks in Brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave no
hint that a rate drop was imminent, but made clear his resistance
to political pressure was as strong as ever.
	   Hans Tietmeyer, who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB
is modeled, hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in
the new currency, dampened by global economic crises and Europe's
worsening outlook.
	   ``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the
current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,''
Tietmeyer said.
	   The cuts seemed to have the desired impact. Frankfurt's main
index closed up 2.1 percent, while France's was up 1.8 percent. The
cuts also boosted markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even
Britain, which is not among the nations launching the euro.
	   ``The reaction is, `Oh good, they're doing a little bit to prop
up the euro economy.' But confidence has taken quite a hit across
Europe recently, and I think further action from the ECB will be
needed next year, maybe down to 2.5 percent,'' James Mitchell,
senior London-based strategist with Nomura.
	   An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de
Craen, said the cuts were timely. ``We are clearly headed for a
slowdown,'' she said.
	   Until recently, Europe's economies had held out relatively well
against damage from Asia and Russia's economic crises and unstable
financial markets.
	   But just two days ago, Duisenberg painted the bleakest picture
yet of Europe's economies, warning growth will likely slow to 2.5
percent next year from earlier expectations of 3 percent.
	   The rate cuts may help. By making it cheaper to borrow money,
rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses, making it
less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend. That expands
the economy.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

 &UR; Ukraine's government moves to satisfy striking miners' demands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ About 40,000 miners across Ukraine
continued their strike Thursday, pushing the government and the
legislature to take steps to meet their demands.
	   Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a resolution
ordering the Cabinet to speed up repayment of mounting wage arrears
to coal workers by Dec. 15.
	   Twenty of Ukraine's 276 mines were on indefinite strike for a
second day Thursday, demanding more state support for their
deteriorating industry and payment of back wages, the Independent
Miners' Union said.
	   The miners want budget allocations for their industry to be
nearly doubled to 5.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.6 billion) next year,
and also demand the payment of back wages that already have topped
2.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 730 million), according to government
figures.
	   The government, meanwhile, began to respond to miners' appeals,
ordering mines to give payment of salaries a top priority, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Cabinet also granted mines land tax breaks for 1999 and put
next year's expenditures for the coal sector on the list of budget
items banned from subsequent reduction.
	   The miners' walkout is the latest in a series of strikes, which
idled dozens of mines in Ukraine last spring and summer.
	   Despite frequent protest actions, the government has so far
failed to improve the situation in the mining industry. It has been
slow in closing loss-making mines and lacks the money to modernize
equipment and make management more efficient.
	   As a result, Ukraine's coal industry has been increasingly
plagued by accidents that have already claimed more than 340 lives
so far this year, about 100 more than in 1997.

Namibia's ruling party sweeps National Council elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN GROBLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia's ruling party won a majority
in 11 of 13 regional councils in elections with the lowest turnout
since Independence in 1990, officials announced Thursday.
	   The win by the South West Africa People's Organization, or
SWAPO, increases its control in the lower house of Parliament,
called the National Council, from 19 to 22 seats.
	   Each regional council sends two representatives to the National
Council.
	   Until the elections earlier this week, SWAPO controlled only 9
regional councils and half of a tenth council _ or 19 delegates in
the National Council.
	   The low turnout _ only 30 percent of the electorate _ indicated
increasing disillusionment with the country's political leadership
and involvement in a foreign war, and a feeling there was no
political choice, observers said.
	   ``People are (also) losing interest in participative
democracy,'' said a ruling party official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``The results are more important in terms
of what it doesn't say.''
	   This week's voting was rescheduled from 1997, when the
government halted regional elections midstream, citing low voter
turnout. Only 20 percent of voters turned out in some of its
strongest constituencies.
	   The 30 percent turnout earlier this week was calculated from
preliminary results, said Joram Rukambe, Director of Elections. In
1992, similar regional elections drew an 81 percent voter turnout.
	   SWAPO campaigned on the basis of continuity and political
stability.
	   The main opposition party, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
hoped to tap voter anger over a SWAPO-supported constitutional
amendment passed earlier this year that allows President Sam Nujoma
to stand for a third term.
	   Presidential elections and voting for Parliament's upper house,
the National Assembly, will be held at the end of 1999.
	   One of the two councils won by the opposition is in the Kunene
region, where Nujoma plans to build a controversial dam that
threatens the traditional life style of the Herero ethnic group.
	   SWAPO won the Caprivi region, where opposition politicians who
advocate secession from Namibia fled the country over past months
to Botswana. The voter turnout was less than 10 percent in some key
constituencies.
	   Party officials from both sides in the southwest African nation
of 1.7 million said they would withhold comment until final results
are announced on Friday.
	   Namibia has sent troops to back Congolese President Laurent
Kabila in his four-month-old fight against rebels _ a conflict that
has drawn at least five African countries into the fray.

Former Olympic champion dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DEGERFORS, Sweden (AP) _ Bertil Nordahl, the oldest of three
Swedish brothers who starred on the 1948 Olympic champion team in
London, has died. He was 81.
	   One year after winning the Olympic gold, Nordahl signed a
professional contract with Atalanta in Italy. He played in Italy
three years before returning home to the Swedish league. Later, he
became a coach and had stints with Orebro, Brage and Degerfors.
	   Gunnar Nordahl, a powerful high-scoring center-forward for AC
Milan in the 1950s, was the most famous of the three brothers. He
won five season scoring titles with Milan and holds the all-time
record among foreigners with 225 goals.
	   Gunnar Nordahl and Knut Nordahl, the third brother who starred
on the 1948 Olympic team and also later played in Italy, passed
away earlier this decade.

Thursday reconfirmed plans to travel to Libya this weekend. A U.N.
official said Annan has received clearance to fly in, bypassing
U.N. sanctions.
	   Annan told reporters he hoped to resolve differences with Libya
about putting on trial two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing.
	   ``Yes, I will travel to Libya on Saturday to discuss the
Lockerbie affair,'' Annan told reporters in Tunis.
	   ``We will try to resolve some problems and to find solutions
together,'' he said, answering questions.
	   Asked if he would meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi,
Anna replied ``Yes, I think so.''
	   There was no official word on where the meeting would take
place. A diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it will be held in Sirte, a town east of Tripoli.
	   Annan has received clearance to bypass U.N. sanctions banning
flights in and out of Libya, said Deputy U.N. spokesman Manoel de
Almeida E Silva, speaking at the United Nations in New York.
	   The dispensation on U.N. sanctions came from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee.
	   The sanctions have been in place since 1992 to try to force
Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland, which killed 270 people.
	   Annan's remarks Thursday expanded upon comments a day earlier in
Algiers before leaving for Tunisia, the last scheduled stop on a
swing through North Africa aimed at unblocking plans for a
U.S.-sponsored referendum on the fate of the disputed Western
Sahara territory.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   In New York, the deputy U.N. spokesman said Annan's efforts ``to
work out the details for the transfer'' of the two suspects to the
Netherlands was among issues discussed with Tunisian officials.
	   A deputy U.S. representative at the United Nations, Nancy
Soderberg, said any meeting between Annan and the Libyans should
yield results.
	   ``We would expect a meeting between the secretary-general and
Libyan officials to produce the hand over of the suspects,'' she
told The Associated Press.
	   ``The U.S. and Britain have gone the extra mile and Libya has
been given every opportunity to comply with the U.N. Security
Council resolutions,'' she said.
	   Annan said last week he had hoped for a breakthrough in the case
by the end of November. He said then a trip to Libya ``to bring the
issue finally to closure ... has not been excluded.''

 &UR; Ukraine's government moves to satisfy striking miners' demands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ About 40,000 miners across Ukraine
continued their strike Thursday, pushing the government and the
legislature to take steps to meet their demands.
	   Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a resolution
ordering the Cabinet to speed up repayment of mounting wage arrears
to coal workers by Dec. 15.
	   Twenty of Ukraine's 276 mines were on indefinite strike for a
second day Thursday, demanding more state support for their
deteriorating industry and payment of back wages, the Independent
Miners' Union said.
	   The miners want budget allocations for their industry to be
nearly doubled to 5.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.6 billion) next year,
and also demand the payment of back wages that already have topped
2.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 730 million), according to government
figures.
	   The government, meanwhile, began to respond to miners' appeals,
ordering mines to give payment of salaries a top priority, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Cabinet also granted mines land tax breaks for 1999 and put
next year's expenditures for the coal sector on the list of budget
items banned from subsequent reduction.
	   The miners' walkout is the latest in a series of strikes, which
idled dozens of mines in Ukraine last spring and summer.
	   Despite frequent protest actions, the government has so far
failed to improve the situation in the mining industry. It has been
slow in closing loss-making mines and lacks the money to modernize
equipment and make management more efficient.
	   As a result, Ukraine's coal industry has been increasingly
plagued by accidents that have already claimed more than 340 lives
so far this year, about 100 more than in 1997.

	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ The United States is deciding whether
President Bill Clinton will land at the newly opened Palestinian
airport amid Israeli concerns that doing so would boost Palestinian
sovereignty claims, a U.S. official said Thursday.
	   Clinton is to arrive in Israel in the evening of Dec. 12 and on
Dec. 14 is to fly to the Gaza Strip to usher in the second stage of
the Wye River land-for-peace agreement he helped negotiate.
	   A possible Clinton landing at Gaza International, which opened
last week as part of the agreement, had been considered by the
White House.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said earlier Thursday that the Israeli government felt a
presidential landing in Gaza ``was tantamount to recognizing
(Palestinian) sovereignty,'' something Israel rejects.
	   However, Bar-Illan said later that Israel had not officially
requested that Clinton refrain from using the airstrip.
	   The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Clinton's final travel plans had not yet been finalized. The
official said the administration was considering the Israeli
concerns.

South Africa withdraws more troops from Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa would withdraw
another 650 peacekeeping troops from the tiny mountain kingdom of
Lesotho, the country's top military commander said Thursday.
	   The troops were among the 3,500 South African and Botswanan
troops that entered Lesotho in September to quell an army mutiny
and unrest linked to a May election.
	   The ruling party won by a landslide but opposition parties
claimed the election was rigged. Lesotho's bickering opposition
parties have since agreed to a proposed interim committee that will
prepare for new elections.
	   The arrival of the troops triggered widescale rioting and
firebombing in the capital of Maseru, and scores of South Africans
and Lesotho citizens died.
	   The 650 troops would be withdrawn starting Sunday, the National
Defense Force Chief Siphiwe Nyanda said. The step is part of a
gradual withdrawal that began last month.
	   After the withdrawal, 750 South African and 350 Botswanan troops
will be left in the country.
	   Nyanda said the decision to withdraw more troops resulted from
the restoration of normalcy to Lesotho.
	   The Southern African Development Community, a regional
organization of 14 countries, made the original decision to help
the Lesotho government restore order.
	   ``This further down-scaling of the force is a clear indication
of the success of the efforts by the SADC soldiers,'' Nyanda said.
	   Lesotho, which has a population of 2 million, is a poor,
mountainous country within South Africa's borders.

Council blames renewed crisis in Angola on UNITA opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday
blamed the renewed crisis in Angola on the former rebel group UNITA
and demanded that it disarm and adhere to a 1994 peace accord.
	   A council resolution expressed dismay that Angola appears headed
back to civil war, which has ravaged the southern African nation
for most of its nearly quarter-century of independence.
	   There have been increasing clashes between government troops and
opposition UNITA forces, and diplomats have been unable to get both
sides together to try to patch up the peace accord.
	   The resolution, approved by a 15-0 vote, extended the mission of
a U.N. observer force monitoring the peace agreement until Feb. 26.
It called on the government and especially UNITA to ensure the
safety of the observers.
	   Blaming UNITA's leadership for the current impasse in the peace
process, the council demanded that UNITA immediately withdraw from
territories it has reoccupied and comply with its obligations to
completely disarm and allow the government to operate throughout
the country.
	   The council stressed that there can be no military solution to
the conflict in Angola, and called on the government and UNITA to
cooperate fully with Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special
representative ``to seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis.''
	   Renewed fighting has chased 331,300 people from their homes
since April, bringing the total displaced population to over 1.3
million, according to U.N. officials.
	   There is no access to about 50 percent of the country, so it is
difficult to help those in need. And U.N. officials have expressed
alarm that mines are being used in the latest fighting.
	   The Security Council called on the government and especially
UNITA to cooperate with humanitarian organizations delivering
emergency relief assistance, to stop laying new mines, ``and to
respect international humanitarian, refugee and human rights law.''

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Sabine Egger of Austria,
taking advantage of an early start number, held a lead of .09
seconds over Australia's Zali Steggall after the first run of a
women's World Cup slalom on Thursday.
	   On a cold, windy day on a course that rutted early, only those
with low start numbers had a chance. Egger, who started seventh,
skied well on the steep and carried speed across the flats to
finish in 50.18 seconds.
	   Steggall, who started second, was timed in 50.27 and Urska
Hrovat of Slovenia, the third starter, was third in 50.76.
	   American Kristina Koznick was fourth as the No. 5 starter, .04
seconds back of Hrovat, who won the season-opening slalom two weeks
ago at Park City, Utah.
	   The slalom was rescheduled from Friday to Thursday by the race
jury because of an approaching storm. It proved to be a wise move,
because the fog and wind on the course would have made it
impossible to stage a super-giant slalom. Instead, that speed event
was set back to Friday, when conditions were expected to improve.

Study suggests pesticides linked to breast cancer
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A new study suggests that a long-banned pesticide
increases the risk of breast cancer, reviving a debate over the
potential hazards of chemicals that mimic the hormone estrogen.
	   In the study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a
British medical journal, researchers found that women with the
highest traces of the pesticide Dieldrin in their blood were twice
as likely as women with the lowest levels to develop breast cancer.
	   Chemicals such as Dieldrin are thought to mimic the effects of
estrogen, which promotes tumor growth in breast cancer, and some
scientists suspect the chemicals might be linked to the disease.
But the evidence is mixed.
	   ``This is very interesting new data. It reopens the door to this
field,'' said Dr. Mary S. Wolff of Mount Sinai Medical Center in
New York, commenting on the study by scientists in Denmark. ``We
had so many negative studies (that did not show a link) that people
put this issue to rest.''
	   Although Dieldrin and other persistent chemicals of its type,
such as DDT and PCBs, have been banned in the United States and
Europe for several years, they endure in the environment and
accumulate in the body.
	   Some small studies have shown an association between breast
cancer and these types of pesticides, while about as many other
studies _ including two large ones, have shown no correlation.
	   The latest study from the Center for Preventive Medicine in
Glostrup, Denmark, is as large as the biggest studies to date,
involving 7,712 women followed for 19 years.
	   Blood samples were taken from the women in 1976 to check for
levels of 48 pesticides and in 1996 the scientists retested the
blood of 240 women who had developed breast cancer and 477 women
who had not.
	   The study found no correlation between breast cancer and DDT or
PCBs, both pesticides banned decades ago in the United States and
Europe. That result was consistent with the preponderance of
evidence from recent studies on those chemicals.
	   Dieldrin, a popular pesticide for agricultural crops such as
corn and cotton from the 1950s until the 1970s, was the only
pesticide associated with breast cancer.
	   ``These findings support the hypothesis that exposure to
(manmade) estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer,'' the
study said.
	   ``The more exposure, the more the risk,'' said Dr. Annette
Hoyer, the lead researcher in the Danish study.
	   But Stephen Safe, a professor of toxicology at Texas A and M
University in the United States said that while he does not dismiss
the results correlating Dieldrin with breast cancer, he is not
convinced the chemical is necessarily a breast cancer trigger
because it is too weak an imitator of estrogen and is no longer
widespread.
	   He said the study on the whole lends more evidence to scientists
who believe such banned pesticides are not linked, because it found
no association with DDT and PCBs. Some scientists have found those
to be linked in earlier studies, while others have shown the
opposite.
	   But that doesn't mean that other so-called environmental
estrogens are not linked to breast cancer, he said, adding that
each compound must be considered individually and that the
hypothesis still stands that newer chemicals suspected of estrogen
action might play a role in breast cancer.

Turkmenistan suspends death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Turkmenistan has become the latest former Soviet
republic to declare a moratorium on the death penalty, its foreign
minister said Thursday.
	   Boris Shikhmuradov was speaking at a conference of Europe's
security and human rights watchdog, the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, in Oslo, Norway, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Turkmenistan may still hand down death sentences until the death
penalty is formally repealed, Shikhmuradov said. In the meantime,
no prisoners will be executed in this impoverished central Asian
nation.
	   Russia also declared a moratorium on the death penalty in 1996,
but its efforts to formally outlaw it have been stymied by the
opposition-dominated parliament. Ukraine, Azerbaijan and other
ex-Soviet states have also suspended it.
	   The OSCE is opening an office in Turkmenistan early next year.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Labor unrest mounted across France on Thursday,
with rail workers still on strike, jobless protesters holding
sit-ins to demand a year-end bonus and school monitors walking off
the job.
	   The rail strike, which began last Friday, hit most of the
country's 23 regions, with services severely disrupted. The strike
was set to continue Friday in 18 regions.
	   Rail workers say there is insufficient staff to counter growing
crime on trains and worry about how the government will implement a
plan to cut the working week from 39 to 35 hours.
	   Many workers fear a 35-hour week, aimed at spreading jobs around
and cutting unemployment, will lead to salary cuts.
	   Staff say a lack of employees has created a safety problem for
workers and travelers. The SNCF plans to hold a national meeting
next week to address train workers' concerns.
	   A spate of physical attacks on transit workers has sparked
several strikes in recent months, and ticket-sellers in the
southwest city of Lyon walked off the job Thursday after a
colleague was held at gunpoint during a holdup.
	   Elsewhere, in Canebiere in the center of the southern port of
Marseille, police said 10,000 jobless protesters took to the
streets to demand a 3,000 franc (dlrs 526) year-end bonus.
	   Organizers said there were up to 20,000 people at the rally.
	   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Charles Hoareau, an official of
the CGT union grouping.
	   The protesters marched to police headquarters for the
Bouches-du-Rhone region, of which Marseille is the capital, where
they were joined by several hundred striking postal workers who are
demanding a shorter working week and more staff.
	   Guy Hermier, a Communist Party deputy for Bouches-du-Rhone, said
the plea for a year-end payment was justified.
	   ``This bonus would allow thousands of workers who have no jobs
to spend the New Year in decent conditions,'' he said.
	   In Lille, northern France, about 60 unemployed protesters
occupied government labor offices to demand more jobs and higher
benefits.
	   About half of the school monitors in junior high schools and
high schools stayed off the job Thursday to protest reforms that
they say downgrades the status of their work.
	   Several thousand bank employees demonstrated in Paris to protest
measures that would lead to salary cuts.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ With multicultural pomp, the World
Council of Churches launched its fiftieth anniversary assembly
Thursday at a worship service that Orthodox church delegates from
Russia and Greece refused to attend.
	   The festivities opened with a drum and a trumpet heralding a
biblical reading from Leviticus 25 to announce the assembly's
theme: ``You shall hallow the fiftieth year and you shall proclaim
liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants...''
	   But delegations from the Russian and Greek Orthodox churches _
angered over the increasingly liberal stand of some Protestant
delegations on homosexuality and other church issues _ boycotted
the ceremony.
	   A recent WCC decision would allow presentations by gay rights
advocates during the assembly's open forum.
	   Although other Orthodox delegations attended the opening
festivities, in protest they said they would send fewer
participants to the worship and business parts of the assembly.
	   The Orthodox dispute is expected to hang over the conference of
the pioneering ecumenical organization. But past and future debates
were sidelined temporarily as worshippers from every continent
gathered for the ceremonial opening in a huge open-air tent.
	   Befitting one of the most variegated Christian gatherings ever
held, the worshippers joined in chants and songs from Argentina,
India, Jamaica, Mozambique, Nigeria, Russia, Sweden, Syria,
Pakistan, Taiwan, the United States and the assembly's host nation
of Zimbabwe.
	   The 960 delegates at the assembly, which meets through December
14, come from 330 denominations on all continents, representing a
constituency of 350 million to 450 million Christians.
	   The biggest nonmember, by far, is the Roman Catholic Church. The
assembly is also being attended by 3,500 visitors.
	   Along with internal church matters the delegates are likely to
pronounce on world economic and political problems.
	   Zimbabwe's Vice President Simon Muzenda has already appealed to
the assembly for moral support in the regime's policy of
nationalizing white-owned farmlands and seeking cancellation of
international debts.
	   Muzenda is Zimbabwe's acting president while President Robert
Mugabe visits the Vatican and other centers in Europe. Mugabe, a
sharp critic of homosexuality, was openly opposed to the WCC
decision to allow gay rights advocates to speak.
	   The Orthodox delegations to the WCC have been unable to come up
with a common strategy of protest.
	   The Orthodox Bulgarian and Georgian delegations have quit the
WCC altogether.
	   Istanbul's Ecumenical Patriarchate, the symbolic center of
Eastern Orthodoxy, has decided to attend sessions without playing a
leading role.
	   The Oriental Orthodox of Africa and the Mideast will participate
in full. The Russians may vote on key matters, but symbolically
sent a radically downgraded delegation.
	   The Very Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky of the United States, one of
four Orthodox members of the WCC executive committee, said the
Russians' stand in particular ``underscores the serious challenge
faced by the ecumenical movement as a whole and the World Council
of Churches in particular.''
	   Sexual morality is not the only problem the Orthodox have with
the WCC's liberal Protestant members from Europe and North America.
	   At a crisis meeting in Thessaloniki, Greece, seven months ago,
Eastern Orthodox leaders complained that they are constantly cast
in a minority role and unable to influence ``the general trend and
ethos of the WCC.''
	   They cited inclusive language in worship, ordination of women
and ``tendencies relating to religious syncretism'' (the mingling
of Christianity with other religions).
	   The issue of homosexuality also divides the western liberals
from many rapidly growing Protestant churches in the Southern
Hemisphere.
	   Contrary to pre-assembly indications the problem seems certain
to reach the floor, at least obliquely. A message from a
pre-assembly women's festival will refer to ``human sexuality in
all its diversity.''
	   Aruna Gnanadason, who runs WCC women's programs, apologized that
``our lesbian sisters'' had been left off the festival program.

	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ U.S. rapper Coolio was found guilty
Thursday of charges stemming from a confrontation with a boutique
owner who said the star punched her when she tried to stop him from
taking merchandise without paying.
	   A court in Stuttgart sentenced Coolio to six months probation
and fined him 30,000 marks (dlrs 17,000) after convicting him of
being an accessory to robbery and causing bodily injury.
	   The Grammy-award winning artist and six members of his band, the
40 Thievs, are accused of leaving the boutique in the Stuttgart
suburb last Nov. 20 with clothing worth 1,500 marks (dlrs 940).
	   Coolio, 35, has denied punching the woman and said the incident
was a misunderstanding. He says he signed autographs in the
boutique, and that in exchange a clothing company had promised him
and his group free outfits.
	   A dozen German and foreign news cameras trailed the court to the
boutique Thursday, where the owner walked through the incident.
	   Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., has already paid
the boutique owner 5,000 marks (dlrs 3,000) damages. He faced a
maximum sentence of four years.
	   Four members of Coolio's group also were charged, but did not
show up for trial. The judge has issued warrants for their arrest.
	   The rapper won a Grammy for best rap solo in 1996 for
``Gangsta's Paradise,'' which was featured in the film ``Dangerous
Minds.'' He is scheduled to tour Germany in January.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Police arrested three men late
Thursday suspected of involvement in a bank heist in Lower Saxony
during which two bank employees were taken hostage but later freed
in a Frankfurt suburb.
	   Two men, armed with automatic pistols, had earlier fled toward
Frankfurt in a car belonging to one of the bank employees after
bursting into the bank in the town of Bad Pyrmont shortly after it
opened.
	   It wasn't immediately clear what role police believe the third
man may have played in the robbery.
	   Police said the men abandoned the car after freeing the
hostages, and fled on foot. Neither hostage was injured.
	   The armed men had threatened to shoot the hostages if they saw
any police vehicles along the road, and demanded that a police
helicopter trailing them be pulled back, police said.
	   It was not immediately clear how much, if any, money they took.
	   Police were talking with the men by mobile telephone for much of
the journey, but lost contact around midday.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fears that Russia has started printing money,
having been left without foreign aid, drove the ruble down to its
lowest point in months Thursday despite the Central Bank's attempts
to support it.
	   The currency had been relatively stable for weeks.
	   When the ruble slides, the Central Bank usually begins spending
its hard-currency reserves to buy rubles on the currency market _
increasing demand for the ruble and driving its rate back up.
	   But while the bank was actively trying to support the ruble
Thursday, traders said, the currency still fell to 20 to the
dollar, from 19.1 on Wednesday. Its lowest rate to date was about
20, which it hit briefly in September.
	   The ruble's fall came a day after International Monetary Fund
chief Michel Camdessus left Moscow without promising to free up
frozen loans that Russia badly wants to dig itself out of its
latest economic crisis.
	   Without that money, dealers warned Thursday, Russia's government
has run out of alternatives to printing rubles. Some reported signs
that the money-printing has already begun.
	   Printing money can cause high inflation. But Russia owes
billions of dollars to workers, pensioners and foreign creditors
and has warned repeatedly that it would resort to printing money
unless it gets more foreign loans.
	   While Camdessus showed no sign of releasing the IMF money, he
praised Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis,
and said an IMF team would return to Russia next month for further
negotiations. A World Bank delegation is due in Moscow next week.
	   The IMF, World Bank and other lenders froze a dlrs 22.6 billion
aid package to Russia after the government defaulted on its
treasury debts and devalued the ruble in August.
	   The speaker of the lower house of parliament called Thursday for
breaking with the IMF and cranking up the money-printing presses.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print money to pay off its debts
and then refuse to take any more loans.
	   ``It's high time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he
told reporters.
	   The leader of the reformist party Our Home is Russia ridiculed
Seleznyov's proposal. ``If the IMF accepted rubles for debt
payments, it would be a brilliant method,'' Alexander Shokhin said
on the ``Hero of the Day'' television program.
	   Russia has also asked foreign creditors to restructure payments
of dlrs 9 million in Soviet-era debts due next year, former deputy
Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Thursday.
	   ``We cannot repay this money,'' Nemtsov was quoted as saying by
the Interfax news agency.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September,
and stood at 5.7 percent in November, the State Statistics
Committee said Thursday. But inflation is up about 70 percent since
last December.
	   Officials have said that international loans would help it keep
inflation under 30 percent in 1999.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, apparently still hopeful about
IMF money, said Thursday the government needs to come up with a
more detailed plan for economic recovery.
	   Primakov's government has produced a general anti-crisis
program, but the measures have not reversed the country's economic
slide, nor have they found favor with the IMF.
	   Also Thursday, the giant state-savings bank, Sberbank freed up
individual accounts that were transferred to the bank months ago
from six commercial banks crippled by the crisis.

European central banks cuts key interest rate for euro launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: for AMs. UPDATES with Dutch central banker saying cut made
despite political pressure, grafs 8-9 &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Making their first collective decision
about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common
currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move
that won market confidence.
	   Ten of the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped
their key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most
significant plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest
cut, from 3.2 percent.
	   The exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. It is
expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is
launched.
	   Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the
groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected
rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent
before the cut, now 3 percent.
	   However, interest rate levels had become a contentious political
issue with center-left governments in Germany and France pushing
for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment, stuck at
10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro.
	   The head of the European Central Bank that will set monetary
policy for the euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday
suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets to create
jobs, and not pressure him to cut rates.
	   The remarks in Brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave no
hint that a rate drop was imminent, but made clear his resistance
to political pressure was as strong as ever.
	   So strong, in fact, that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said
he had feared the bank would delay the decision.
	   ``What had been feared was that, in order to prove its
independence, the ECB would go against its own analysis and would
wait longer, which would have been nonsensical,'' Zalm said.
	   Hans Tietmeyer, who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB
is modeled, hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in
the new currency, dampened by global economic crises and Europe's
worsening outlook.
	   ``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the
current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,''
Tietmeyer said.
	   The cuts seemed to have the desired impact. Frankfurt's main
index closed up 2.1 percent, while France's was up 1.8 percent. The
cuts also boosted markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even
Britain, which is not among the nations launching the euro.
	   ``The reaction is, `Oh good, they're doing a little bit to prop
up the euro economy.' But confidence has taken quite a hit across
Europe recently, and I think further action from the ECB will be
needed next year, maybe down to 2.5 percent,'' James Mitchell,
senior London-based strategist with Nomura.
	   An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de
Craen, said the cuts were timely. ``We are clearly headed for a
slowdown,'' she said.
	   Until recently, Europe's economies had held out relatively well
against damage from Asia and Russia's economic crises and unstable
financial markets.
	   But just two days ago, Duisenberg painted the bleakest picture
yet of Europe's economies, warning growth will likely slow to 2.5
percent next year from earlier expectations of 3 percent.
	   The rate cuts may help. By making it cheaper to borrow money,
rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses, making it
less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend. That expands
the economy.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Yugoslav parliament denounces U.S. pressure on Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a show of defiance, the Yugoslav
parliament on Thursday denounced U.S. pressure on President
Slobodan Milosevic and declared support for his policy.
	   The state-run Tanjug news agency said parliament passed a
declaration ``which resolutely rejects and denounces all pressure,
threats and gross interference of the United States in the internal
matters of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   ``The parliament fully supports Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in his efforts to defend vital national and state
interests ...'' the declaration said.
	   The show of support for Milosevic followed intense U.S.
diplomatic activities over Kosovo and a reported change in American
policies toward Milosevic. State Department spokesman James Rubin
blamed Milosevic earlier this week for much of the Balkan troubles,
adding that the Serb leaders' grip on power was weakening.
	   Tanjug said the declaration was prompted by ``attacks of the
American administration against our country and its interests.''
Pro-Western deputies from Montenegro, the smaller republic which
forms Yugoslavia together with Serbia, did not attend the session.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria's ruling coalition, the National
Progressive Front, as expected won the majority of seats in the
250-member Parliament, the government announced Thursday.
	   The front, led by the Baath Party of President Hafez Assad, can
win up to 167 seats in the Parliament, and Interior Minister
Mohammed Harba announced it won its full allotment.
	   He said 7.1 million people, or nearly 82 per cent of the more
than 8 million eligible voters, cast ballots Monday and Tuesday. He
said the elections took place in a ``quiet ... and democratic
atmosphere.''
	   Voting was repeated in one polling station at Deir al-Zour in
eastern Syria after a ballot box was found to contain more votes
than registered voters, Harba told a news conference.
	   The National Assembly, or parliament, has limited legislative
power, with effective control held by Assad, who came to power in a
bloodless coup in 1970.
	   Five of Syria's most powerful businessmen won seats running as
independents. The private sector hopes to gain more say in the new
parliament, following government efforts to encourage more private
investment.
	   Twenty-six women were among winning candidates, compared to 24
who held seats in the last parliament, Harba said.
	   The control of seats was the same in the previous four-year
term, which ended in September. The Baath got 135 seats, and 32
went to the six allied parties. Independents make up the remaining
83 seats.
	   Among seats held by the National Progressive Front, 51 percent
are controlled by workers and peasants, who form the backbone of
the Baath party, in power since 1963.
	   Some 7,350 candidates ran in the elections.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fears that Russia has started printing money,
having been left without foreign aid, drove the ruble down to its
lowest point in months Thursday despite the Central Bank's attempts
to support it.
	   The currency had been relatively stable for weeks.
	   When the ruble slides, the Central Bank usually begins spending
its hard-currency reserves to buy rubles on the currency market _
increasing demand for the ruble and driving its rate back up.
	   But while the bank was actively trying to support the ruble
Thursday, traders said, the currency still fell to 20 to the
dollar, from 19.1 on Wednesday. Its lowest rate to date was about
20, which it hit briefly in September.
	   The ruble's fall came a day after International Monetary Fund
chief Michel Camdessus left Moscow without promising to free up
frozen loans that Russia badly wants to dig itself out of its
latest economic crisis.
	   Without that money, dealers warned Thursday, Russia's government
has run out of alternatives to printing rubles. Some reported signs
that the money-printing has already begun.
	   Printing money can cause high inflation. But Russia owes
billions of dollars to workers, pensioners and foreign creditors
and has warned repeatedly that it would resort to printing money
unless it gets more foreign loans.
	   While Camdessus showed no sign of releasing the IMF money, he
praised Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis,
and said an IMF team would return to Russia next month for further
negotiations. A World Bank delegation is due in Moscow next week.
	   The IMF, World Bank and other lenders froze a dlrs 22.6 billion
aid package to Russia after the government defaulted on its
treasury debts and devalued the ruble in August.
	   The speaker of the lower house of parliament called Thursday for
breaking with the IMF and cranking up the money-printing presses.
	   ``Look how they are mocking our government, sending one group
after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist. ``Now
Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.''
	   Seleznyov suggested that Russia print money to pay off its debts
and then refuse to take any more loans.
	   ``It's high time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he
told reporters.
	   The leader of the reformist party Our Home is Russia ridiculed
Seleznyov's proposal. ``If the IMF accepted rubles for debt
payments, it would be a brilliant method,'' Alexander Shokhin said
on the ``Hero of the Day'' television program.
	   Russia has also asked foreign creditors to restructure payments
of dlrs 9 million in Soviet-era debts due next year, former deputy
Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Thursday.
	   ``We cannot repay this money,'' Nemtsov was quoted as saying by
the Interfax news agency.
	   Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and September,
and stood at 5.7 percent in November, the State Statistics
Committee said Thursday. But inflation is up about 70 percent since
last December.
	   Officials have said that international loans would help it keep
inflation under 30 percent in 1999.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, apparently still hopeful about
IMF money, said Thursday the government needs to come up with a
more detailed plan for economic recovery.
	   Primakov's government has produced a general anti-crisis
program, but the measures have not reversed the country's economic
slide, nor have they found favor with the IMF.
	   Also Thursday, the giant state-savings bank, Sberbank freed up
individual accounts that were transferred to the bank months ago
from six commercial banks crippled by the crisis.

Russian mafia operated in U.S. cities, ex-FBI agent tells Swiss

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Assassins of the Russian mafia escaped to the
beaches of Miami after their hits and ran operations in New York,
Los Angeles and Houston, a former FBI agent testified Thursday.
	   Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, testifying in the trial of
reputed mafia boss Sergei Mikhailov, said Mikhailov controlled two
of the so-called ``combat brigades,'' as the assassination squads
were known.
	   ``They would commit murders in Russia and other countries in
Europe and then come to Miami ... where they would stay by the
beach and wait for the heat to cool off,'' Levinson said.
	   Mikhailov, 40, is on trial in Switzerland for membership in the
Moscow-based Solntsevskaya criminal organization and for breaking
Swiss property laws in acquiring a villa near Geneva. He faces a
maximum 7{ years in prison if convicted.
	   He has denied any connection to the crime group. The trial,
which began Monday, is expected to hear evidence from more than 90
witnesses.
	   Levinson, who spent four years investigating the Russian mafia,
told the court Thursday that Solntsevskaya took over nightclubs in
New York's Brighton Beach area and in Los Angeles, and invested
several hundred thousand dollars in a Houston car dealership.
	   ``They became a center for drugs and a meeting place for
racketeers,'' he said of the New York and Los Angeles clubs.
	   Levinson also worked on the case of Russian mafia godfather
Vyacheslav Ivankov, imprisoned for nearly 10 years in New York last
year.
	   He said Ivankov, Mikhailov and other Solntsevskaya leaders would
hold meetings in Miami to discuss ``the takeover and control of
several Moscow hotels'' and other criminal operations.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's currency slid to its lowest point in
months Thursday amid fears that the nation has started printing
money to make up for a loss in foreign aid.
	   The ruble's fall came a day after International Monetary Fund
chief Michel Camdessus left Moscow without promising to free up
frozen loans that Russia badly wants to dig itself out of its
latest economic crisis.
	   Without the money, dealers warned Thursday, Russia's government

European central banks cuts key interest rate for euro launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: for AMs. CORRECTs Eds note to Dutch finance minister, grafs
8-9 &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Making their first collective decision
about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common
currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move
that won market confidence.
	   Ten of the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped
their key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most
significant plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest
cut, from 3.2 percent.
	   The exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. It is
expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is
launched.
	   Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the
groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected
rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent
before the cut, now 3 percent.
	   However, interest rate levels had become a contentious political
issue with center-left governments in Germany and France pushing
for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment, stuck at
10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro.
	   The head of the European Central Bank that will set monetary
policy for the euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday
suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets to create
jobs, and not pressure him to cut rates.
	   The remarks in Brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave no
hint that a rate drop was imminent, but made clear his resistance
to political pressure was as strong as ever.
	   So strong, in fact, that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said
he had feared the bank would delay the decision.
	   ``What had been feared was that, in order to prove its
independence, the ECB would go against its own analysis and would
wait longer, which would have been nonsensical,'' Zalm said.
	   Hans Tietmeyer, who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB
is modeled, hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in
the new currency, dampened by global economic crises and Europe's
worsening outlook.
	   ``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the
current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,''
Tietmeyer said.
	   The cuts seemed to have the desired impact. Frankfurt's main
index closed up 2.1 percent, while France's was up 1.8 percent. The
cuts also boosted markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even
Britain, which is not among the nations launching the euro.
	   ``The reaction is, `Oh good, they're doing a little bit to prop
up the euro economy.' But confidence has taken quite a hit across
Europe recently, and I think further action from the ECB will be
needed next year, maybe down to 2.5 percent,'' James Mitchell,
senior London-based strategist with Nomura.
	   An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de
Craen, said the cuts were timely. ``We are clearly headed for a
slowdown,'' she said.
	   Until recently, Europe's economies had held out relatively well
against damage from Asia and Russia's economic crises and unstable
financial markets.
	   But just two days ago, Duisenberg painted the bleakest picture
yet of Europe's economies, warning growth will likely slow to 2.5
percent next year from earlier expectations of 3 percent.
	   The rate cuts may help. By making it cheaper to borrow money,
rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses, making it
less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend. That expands
the economy.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

War in Congo continues, Rwandan president says

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ On his return from the latest round of
talks to end Congo's civil war, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu
said on Thursday that a solution to a four-month conflict was as
remote as ever.
	   ``At the end, everybody agreed that all of us are committed to
the peace process, but not everybody agreed how to go about it,''
Bizimungu said en route from an African summit that concluded in
Paris last week. ``Since there is no cease-fire, if provoked, our
troops will answer back.''
	   Rwanda and Uganda have sent troops and arms to the insurgents
fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Zimbabwe,
Angola, Chad and Namibia have sent soldiers and equipment in
support of the government.
	   Despite international pressure, Kabila has refused to negotiate
with a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected soldiers and
opposition leaders who took up arms Aug. 2.
	   Instead he has demanded that Rwanda and Uganda end their support
for the insurgents and leave Congo. Both countries have said they
will stay as long as Congo remains unstable.
	   In Paris, Bizimungu agreed in principle to consider a cease-fire
with the leaders of Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo at another round of
peace talks starting in Lusaka, Zambia next week.
	   ``I think the position of Kabila is as rigid as it was from the
day one. I don't think, judging from what I heard from him, that we
are near any solution at all,'' Bizimungu said.
	   Rwanda accuses Kabila of failing to rid the common border of
Hutu rebels, and drafting at least 10,000 former Hutu soldiers and
militiamen responsible for a 1994 genocide in the country in
fighting the rebels in eastern Congo.
	   ``Our presence in Congo has nothing to do with an adventure,''
Bizimungu said. ``We're there seeking the same solution as in 1996
_ preventing the genocide and securing our borders.''
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda played a crucial role in ousting longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in what was then Zaire and installing
Kabila in power in May 1997.
	   Bizimungu also dismissed reports of a rift with his Ugandan
allies on the tactics and strategy in Congo, saying both countries
shared the same objectives.

St. Vincent marijuana farmers complain to President Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUGGIE JOSEPH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Marijuana farmers in St. Vincent
sent a letter to President Clinton on Thursday complaining a
planned U.S. military operation to destroy their crops will cause
hardship.
	   ``To take this out of our economy overnight would bring hardship
and endless misery on our people,'' said Junior Cottle, president
of the Concerned Citizens, Marijuana Farmers and Supporters.
	   The group delivered the letter to the U.S. Embassy in Barbados.
	   Cottle said some 8,000 of the islands' 119,000 people depend on
marijuana for their livelihoods. The crop was a ``political
stabilizer'' as important to the economy as the banana industry,
Cottle said.
	   ``There is a significant portion of our people who detest your
intrusion and demand compensation for your action,'' the group
wrote.
	   Marijuana farmers staged a demonstration against the crackdown
in downtown Kingstown last week, and picketed Prime Minister James
Mitchell's office.
	   Mitchell has said he fears U.S. officials would retaliate by
banning Vincentians from entering the United States if the country
cuts back on eradication efforts.
	   St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the largest marijuana exporter
in the Eastern Caribbean, according to the U.N. International Drug
Control Program.
	   St. Vincent police, U.S. troops and the Regional Security
System, a cooperative of Eastern Caribbean police forces, plan to
use U.S. helicopters in an operation to destroy hundreds of
marijuana plots in the country next week.
	   Since 1994, police have destroyed more than 8.2 million
marijuana plants here.
	   Marijuana is illegal in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, but the
plant has been cultivated for years in remote forests and dozens of
isolated cays.
	   Popularly called ``ganja,'' it is the most popular drug in the
Caribbean and the only one cultivated in the region, according to
the U.N. anti-drug program.
	   In February, the prime minister of nearby Grenada rejected calls
by Rastafarians to legalize marijuana in that country. Followers of
Rastafarianism smoke marijuana as a religious rite.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Tens of thousands of workers took part in
demonstrations across Spain on Thursday to demand a 35-hour week
and protest both low unemployment benefit levels and a government
tax reform.
	   The demonstrations were called by the country's two main labor
federations _ the General Workers Union (UGT) and the Workers
Commissions (CCOO).
	   In Madrid, some 10,000 demonstrators were led by UGT chief
Candido Mendez and CCOO head Antonio Gutierrez as well as
opposition Socialist party leader Josep Borrell and representatives
of the United Left party.
	   A similar number turned out in Barcelona while smaller
demonstrations took place in some 50 other cities and towns,
according to unions.
	   ``We're not going to let the business sector get the lion's
share,'' Mendez told a rally to wrap up the Madrid demonstration.
``We're going to have to work hard to get this government to change
its unjust and mistaken economic policies.''
	   In a statement released earlier in the day, the unions said they
were demanding reduction of the working week to 35 hours without
pay cuts ``as an efficient way of creating more and better jobs.''
	   The government has made much of recent reductions in
unemployment, but Spanish jobless figures remain far higher than
the European average, with over 19 percent of people eligible to
work out of a job.
	   The protest marches were also called to demand improved benefits
for the unemployed, particularly the long-term jobless with few
chances of finding new employment.
	   In the statement, the unions claimed that half of those without
a job do not receive economic benefits.
	   A tax reform promising rate cuts to come into effect in 1999 is
perceived by the unions as a ``present for the rich,'' and
constitutes a third reason to march ,according to their statement.
	   They reject government claims that the reform, predicted to
reduce tax revenue by 600 billion pesetas (dlrs 4.3 billion), will
benefit low income families most and promote economic growth by
encouraging people to spend, save and invest.
	   Instead the unions point out that basic tax for people in the
top tax bracket falls from 56 percent to 48 percent, the minimum
tax level only drops from 20 percent to 18 percent. They say that
economic growth would be far better served by government spending
on social projects and job creation.
	   Thursday's marches marked a move away from the relatively
cordial relations so far between the unions and the two-year-old
conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.

Minister says Pakistani sugar imports hurt Indian producers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A Cabinet minister told Parliament
Thursday that sugar imports from neighbor and longtime rival
Pakistan should be stopped because they hurt domestic producers.
	   Replying to questions from lawmakers, Parliamentary Affairs
Minister M.L. Khurana was quoted by Dow Jones News Service as
saying ``some steps should be undertaken to stop (imports from
Pakistan) .... Some will be taken very soon in a day or two. Some
final decision will be taken.''
	   ``The government of India agrees with the view that Indian sugar
should be protected because it is suffering due to imports from
Pakistan,'' he said in Hindi.
	   India allowed zero-duty sugar imports until April 28 this year
when it imposed a 5 percent import duty plus an 850 rupees (dlrs
20) a ton countervailing duty.
	   Domestic producers have long been demanding higher duties to
protect them from cheap imports from neighboring Pakistan.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Senior Russian lawmakers voiced hopes Thursday
that parliament would soon ratify the START II arms reduction
treaty with the United States.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, agreed to finish its
work by next Tuesday on a measure that outlines Russia's nuclear
weapons program, said Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov. The bill will
then be sent to President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``It will spell out Russia's military doctrine and guidelines
for developing new weapons that would ensure Russia's security,''
Seleznyov told reporters.
	   Some Duma members in the past have talked about setting
conditions for ratification _ a move that might require the U.S.
Senate to review the treaty again. However, Seleznyov didn't
mention any proposals that would make ratification conditional on
additional actions by the United States.
	   Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Duma's foreign affairs
committee, said he expected the president to return the bill to the
Duma without any major alterations. That could set the stage for
approval of the START II treaty.
	   Yeltsin previously submitted the START II treaty to the Duma for
ratification.
	   But Russian lawmakers wanted to outline priorities for
developing the country's nuclear arsenal before approving the
treaty.
	   START II, which the two countries signed in 1993, would halve
Russian and American nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led
opposition in the Russian parliament has balked, claiming that
dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's security and be
too expensive.
	   The Russian government and military leaders have strongly pushed
for ratification, saying that Russia will have to soon decommission
its aging missiles anyway.
	   There's been some progress in recent weeks, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov has made a renewed push to convince lawmakers to
ratify the document.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev met with a visiting U.S.
congressional delegation Thursday and discussed Russia's progress
on the treaty.
	   U.S. Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio, called
the discussion ``sincere'' but said there was still much work to be
done before ratification, the Interfax news agency reported.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A single photograph _ that of a young
Israeli soldier cowering under the blows of a Palestinian mob _
ignited a fierce nationwide debate Thursday over whether Israel has
lost its military nerve.
	   The photo was splashed across the front pages of every newspaper
in Israel.
	   While the prime minister and others wondered out loud why the
soldier never opened fire with his M-16 rifle Wednesday, other
Israelis insisted the new recruit would not be alive today if he
had acted otherwise.
	   ``What has happened to us, for God's sake? Are we a country with
a strong defense force or have we turned into a country of wimps?''
wrote Yaacov Erez, the editor-in-chief of the Maariv newspaper.
	   His words struck deeply into the psyche of Israel, a country
founded on the ashes of the Holocaust and whose aim was to never
allow Jews to be vulnerable again.
	   Assaf Meyara, 19, was recovering Thursday from multiple injuries
inflicted by a dozen Palestinians who smashed the windows of the
car he was sitting in, dragged him out and struck him repeatedly
with chunks of concrete.
	   The mob, fresh from an anti-Israel demonstration, also stole
Meyara's rifle as he ran to safety, then set his car on fire.
	   The ambush prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to freeze
troop withdrawals from the West Bank and suspend implementing the
latest U.S.-brokered Mideast peace accord.
	   Netanyahu suggested Thursday that Meyara should have followed
open-fire procedures and should have been more prepared.
	   ``If a soldier or civilian is caught in a life-threatening
situation, it is his right and even his obligation to save himself
in accordance with the law,'' he told reporters.
	   Defenders of Meyara, including President Ezer Weizman, said it
was a mistake to judge a young soldier newly assigned to the often
violent West Bank. On radio talk shows, many Israelis said Meyara
escaped alive because he didn't open fire and risk the chance of
having his gun grabbed and turned against him.
	   ``Assaf was in (the West Bank) for all of three weeks, without a
full briefing, without experience, he was alone without other
soldiers and he acted like any officer, general or even the army's
chief-of-staff would have to save his life,'' said Meyara's mother,
Lisa.
	   In a military-minded country where a majority of its citizens
are drafted for lengthy army service, many questions regarding
standard training and procedures were raised as a result of
Wednesday's attack.
	   Meyara's rifle was not loaded, and some reports suggested it was
in the back seat of the car instead of in Meyara's possession at
the time _ both serious violations of army regulations.
	   Moments before the car Meyara was riding in was attacked, an
Israeli army jeep drove through the same intersection on the
outskirts of the Palestinian-controlled city of Ramallah. The jeep
was pelted with chunks of rock by the same group of Palestinians
and then drove off, rather than remain on the scene, clear the
junction and help protect other Israeli cars.
	   Veteran Israeli defense correspondent Ronnie Shaked said the
images of both Israeli soldiers and civilians fleeing from
Palestinians has crushed Israel's deterrent image of strength _ and
will encourage Palestinians to further test Israeli troops.
	   An unnamed army official quoted by Maariv said the army may
issue charges against Meyara for not using his weapon. An army
spokesman said any possible discipline would only come after an
investigation.
	   Meyara's mother, an immigrant from England, told Israel radio
her son was not sure he was permitted to shoot at the crowd. She
also said she would leave the country with her son if the army
tried to punish him.
	   ``We could have been on the way to a funeral today,'' she
declared.

Court delays removal of tributes from killer's tombstone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Supreme Court issued a temporary
injunction against a government decision Thursday to remove the
words `holy' and `martyr' from the tombstone of a Jewish settler
who massacred 29 Muslim worshipers.
	   The gunman, New York-born Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on the
Palestinian worshipers in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the West
Bank town of Hebron in February 1994, and was killed by survivors
of the attack.
	   Goldstein was called a hero by fellow settlers and was buried in
the center of the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. The
Israeli army, which is responsible for administering the West Bank,
decided two months ago to delete the words of praise from the
inscription on the tombstone in an effort to discourage Jewish
extremists from making pilgrimages to the site.
	   In its decision the army invoked a new law making it illegal to
erect monuments to militants.
	   However, Goldstein's father Israel Goldstein petitioned the
Supreme Court to prevent any changes at the tomb, which includes
elaborate lighting, benches, a glass cabinet for prayer books, a
limestone plaza and rose bushes.
	   The Supreme Court Thursday issued a temporary injunction against
the changes and ordered the government to show cause within 45 days
why the words of praise should be deleted.
	   Goldstein said Thursday at the court that his son really was a
saint. ``People came to us with tears in their eyes when we were
sitting shiva (in mourning) saying: your son saved us. We would
have been there later on. They found weapons there.''
	   The court's decision on whether the army may delete the words
from the tombstone will be given at a later date.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In defiance of the United States, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday he will not back down
from a decision to suspend the Wye River peace agreement over what
he says are Palestinian violations.
	   ``We are not to be made fools,'' said an angry Netanyahu, who
won unanimous backing from his Cabinet ministers after they watched
footage of an attack on an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian mob.
	   Ministers watched a video of Wednesday's brutal attack. When the
tape ended, the decision was unanimous: Israel would suspend its
West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Holding Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority responsible for
the attack, Netanyahu said: ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli
citizens being lynched, or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that
received incitement from Palestinian officials.''
	   The latest crisis to plague the Mideast peace accord cast a pall
over the upcoming visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton, just days
before he was to arrive in the region to oversee implementation of
the second phase of the deal he helped broker.
	   The Israeli decision appeased hard-liners in Netanyahu's
coalition whose support for the premier had been waning since he
signed the latest accord to cede more war-captured land.
	   Ahead of a crucial parliament vote Monday over whether to call
early elections, the decision to freeze the peace process has
brought right-wingers back into Netanyahu's fold.
	   Members of the National Religious Party said they would now vote
with Netanyahu and block attempts to end his administration
prematurely.
	   Supporters of the bill said they might delay the vote because
they no longer have a majority.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation once
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce
a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin rejected the Israeli
conditions, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   Meanwhile, violence erupted for a second straight day in three
Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem following the stabbing death of a
Palestinian man in the city.
	   Palestinian rioters threw stones at police and Israeli
motorists.
	   Six Israeli police officers and three Israeli civilians were
injured by rocks. One Palestinian was struck by a rubber bullet
fired by police to disperse stone throwers on the Mount of Olives,
and 19 stone-throwers were arrested.
	   In Tel Aviv, a shack housing five Palestinian laborers from the
Gaza Strip was set on fire, and police said they were investigating
whether the arsonists had political motives. The laborers escaped
unharmed.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   Hours later, an Israeli soldier and civilian were attacked by a
Palestinian mob, fresh from an anti-Israel demonstration near the
West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   When Netanyahu convened his so-called security Cabinet to play a
videotape of the incident, the atmosphere in the room was tense,
Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials argued over whether the attack
on the soldier was orchestrated or spontaneous.
	   The incident began when about 150 Palestinian university
students, many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march
in Ramallah to press for Israel to release Palestinian prisoners in
its jails.
	   The group then headed to the outskirts of town to throw stones
at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier was riding in.

Border guard killings reported as U.S. envoy meets Serbian
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the worst breach of the Kosovo
cease-fire, Yugoslav border guards killed eight ethnic Albanians on
Thursday, adding new urgency to the efforts of the U.S. envoy who
is trying to negotiate a permanent peace.
	   Several other armed incidents were reported as envoy Christopher
Hill presented Serbian President Milan Milutinovic with a revised
plan for the future of the Serb province.
	   Hill said some progress was being made, but warned that time was
at a premium because of fears that fighting, which had been at a
lull as winter approached, could resume by spring.
	   ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' Hill said. ``Spring should be the
time for plowing and not for fighting.''
	   The eight armed ethnic Albanians were killed near the town of
Prizren when nine of them fired on Yugoslav soldiers guarding the
border with Albania, the pro-government Serbian Media Center said.
Yugoslav troops were not injured, the center said
	   Yugoslavia's army command confirmed the deaths and said the
ethnic Albanians were trying to cross the border into Kosovo
illegally.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   The clash came a day after three ethnic Albanians were gunned
down in their car in Kosovo's capital Pristina. A woman pedestrian
was injured. Serbian police said they found three automatic weapons
and two hand grenades in the car, which was raked by machine-gun
fire.
	   On Thursday, rebel spokesman Adem Demaci blamed the killings on
Serbia's secret police, saying one of the victims was a leading
member of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army while the two others
were civilians: a journalist of the main Albanian language
newspaper Bujku and a university student.
	   The journalist, Afrim Malici, had complained he was being
followed by Serbia's secret service, his colleagues said.
	   Before meeting with Milutinovic, Hill said the new draft
reflects previous comments by rival Serb and ethnic Albanian
officials on how to achieve a settlement for the ethnic
Albanian-majority province in southern Serbia.
	   Kosovo's Albanian leadership wants independence from Serbia but
is willing to settle for full autonomy as a first step. Serbia and
the Serb leaders of Yugoslavia are strongly opposed to any plan on
Kosovo that would sidestep Serbia.
	   Hill did not elaborate, but said the new plan does not
explicitly specify whether Kosovo will become the third Yugoslav
republic or would remain a Serb province. Republic status for
Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   Hill planned to present the plan to ethnic Albanian officials on
Friday.
	   In a statement after meeting Hill, Milutinovic said he would
``carefully study'' the new U.S. proposal, but added the Serbian
position should be ``the main basis for the political solution'' of
the Kosovo crisis.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against Kosovo separatists in February.
	   Bloodshed abated after Milosevic promised U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke on Oct. 12 to end the Kosovo campaign and begin political
negotiations on the province's future. The cease-fire was reached
under threat of NATO airstrikes.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The major Protestant and
Catholic parties in Northern Ireland clashed bitterly Thursday,
hours after they apparently had agreed on the next key steps
forward in making April's peace agreement a reality.
	   The rival wings of Irish Catholic opinion, the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party and militant Sinn Fein, both accused the
major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, of retreating
from commitments made early Thursday as British Prime Minister Tony
Blair oversaw negotiations.
	   The prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said Blair
was ``disappointed that the parties had not been able to build on
the progress made last night and that a number of different
interpretations had arisen.''
	   When Blair left early Thursday, Catholic politicians were openly
confident they and the Ulster Unionists would announce within hours
two key planks of Northern Ireland's new government _ a 10-post
Executive administration that would work alongside the Irish
government in seven policy-making committees.
	   The Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, had planned to travel to
Belfast to demonstrate support for the package.
	   But in an Ulster Unionist meeting, members complained to leader
David Trimble that the package conceded too much at a time when the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, linked with Sinn Fein, was refusing
to disarm.
	   Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor said the members were
supporting only three of the proposed cross-border committees _ an
essential part of the agreement for Catholics, who think the
committees will promote eventual unification.
	   He said Trimble was leaving Friday for Washington, where the
eight party leaders who supported April's agreement will receive an
award, and would then go to Norway where he and SDLP leader John
Hume will receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Serious deliberations
probably wouldn't resume until Dec. 14, Taylor said.
	   Seamus Mallon, the SDLP deputy leader elected alongside Trimble
to oversee formation of the administration, talked to reporters an
hour later.
	   The agreement, a fuming Mallon said, ``has been done and I stand
by it. It is now for the other parties to confirm their commitment
and participation in the agreement brokered by the prime
minister.''
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who met Trimble in the afternoon,
said Trimble had confirmed ``his agreement in principle on 10
departments. Clearly the unionists are clawing back from that.''
	   Ahern, who spoke by phone with Blair, said they both were ``very
disappointed that the progress that appeared to have been made last
night has evaporated during the course of the day.''

 &UR; Yugoslav parliament denounces U.S. pressure on Milosevic &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a show of defiance, the Yugoslav
parliament Thursday denounced America's ``destructive'' policies in
the Balkans and declared support for President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   A declaration, approved by the assembly, accused the United
States of ``directly supporting separatism and terrorism and
financing the adversaries'' of Yugoslavia, according to a text
distributed by the state-run Tanjug news agency.
	   The strongly-worded declaration followed intensified U.S.
diplomatic efforts over Kosovo and a reported change of American
policies toward Milosevic.
	   Washington has always blamed Milosevic for instigating ethnic
conflict in the Balkans and imposed diplomatic and economic
sanctions against his government.
	   Nevertheless, the Clinton administration has been working
closely with Milosevic since 1995 in efforts to ensure a lasting
peace in Bosnia, formerly a Yugoslav republic.
	   This week, however, State Department spokesman James Rubin
claimed Milosevic's grip on power was weakening. Some media reports
suggested the Clinton Administration was prepared to support
Milosevic's opponents inside Yugoslavia with an aim to topple the
Balkan leader.
	   The parliamentary declaration noted that ``in the past several
days there have been several gross attacks by representatives of
American administration against Yugoslavia, its vital state and
national interests ...''
	   ``Election will of the people is the sovereign will ...
Constitutional bodies of Serbia and Yugoslavia cannot be replaced
according to the will of a foreign factor ...'' it added.
	   The declaration further said American pressure ``presents
support for separatism and terrorism in Kosovo, causing
destabilization of the region.''
	   It added that the United States were aiding ethnic Albanian
separatists in their aim to secede Kosovo from Serbia and
Yugoslavia, which also includes Montenegro.
	   ``The parliament fully supports Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in his efforts to defend vital national and state
interests ...'' added the declaration calling U.S. policies in the
Balkans ``destructive'' and against international standards.
	   Apparently counting on traditional Serb mistrust toward Western
politicians, the parliament further said that American pressure on
Milosevic only served as a ``recognition'' that his policies were
in the interest of the country.
	   Reformist deputies from Montenegro, who enjoy U.S. support, did
not attend the session as well as some opposition deputies from
Serbia. The republics of Montenegro and Serbia form what is left of
Yugoslavia.

Prime Minister says French economy will grow 2.7 percent in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Thursday that
the French economy would grow 2.7 percent in 1999, a day after his
Finance Minister said the country couldn't meet that target.
	   Jospin told the French parliament that growth would be achieved
if consumption were to hold up and if there was a pickup in
investment as a result of consumer spending.
	   On Wednesday, Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said
France could not meet the 2.7 percent growth target because of the
international financial crisis.
	   Jospin's comments came as 11 European central bank in their
first coordinated move ahead of the introduction of Europe's new
single currency cut interest rates to 3.0 percent, except Italy,
which cut its rate to 3.5 percent.
	   Following the announcement of the rate cut, Bank of France
Governor Jean-Claude Trichet would not comment on his expectations
for 1999 French growth, saying the international environment
remains uncertain.

<TEXT>
	   SABANETA, Venezuela (AP) _ When he was arrested for trying to
overthrow Venezuela's government in a bloody coup attempt six years
ago, Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez announced to the world his struggle was
just beginning.
	   ``New and better opportunities will emerge for us in the
future,'' he said on national television before being hauled off to
jail.
	   Those words sound like an understatement with presidential
elections just five days away.
	   The 44-year-old former coup leader has capitalized on public
disgust over corruption and declining living standards to become
the presidential front-runner.
	   His candidacy is seen as a bright red warning sign for Latin
America and a likely blow to conventional wisdom that claims
democracy and free markets are inescapable.
	   Chavez insists he is ``a democrat from head to toe'' but
Venezuelan elites are terrified he will impose a dictatorship if
elected.
	   No one knows for sure what a Chavez presidency would be like.
But there is nothing vague about the anti-establishment,
anti-corruption credo he has preached since being pardoned four
years ago by President Rafael Caldera.
	   Recent polls have shown Chavez about 10 points ahead of his
closest rival, Yale-educated former governor Henrique Salas Romer.
	   Despite having toned down his populist rhetoric, Chavez still
wants to dissolve Congress and trash the current constitution in
favor of a new one.
	   To wealthy Venezuelans and the U.S. government, which has denied
Chavez a tourist visa, his attempted coup was unforgivable. But
Chavez insists it was a just reaction to a fraudulent democracy
that has excluded most Venezuelans from the bounty of the world's
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East.
	   Clues about why so many Venezuelans see Chavez as a hero can be
found in the western farming town of Sabaneta, where the candidate
grew up poor, dreaming of becoming a professional baseball player.
	   Unemployment in the town is rampant, government services are nil
and most children are malnourished. Chavez's cousin, 31-year-old
grade school teacher Euclides Quinones Chavez, says he sometimes
has to stop class to buy food because the kids are too hungry to
concentrate.
	   Chavez, who likes to paint landscapes, write poetry and quote
South American liberator Simon Bolivar, speaks constantly of giving
a ``human face'' to capitalism.
	   Most of his life has been defined by rebellion. After graduating
from Venezuela's Military Academy in 1975, he spent years building
an underground organization inside the army to oppose military
corruption.
	   ``I realized we had to organize ourselves to defend our
dignity,'' he says.
	   As a young officer in the late 1980s, Chavez was assigned to the
presidential palace to help guard then-President Carlos Andres
Perez. The two men passed each other in the palace halls and
greeted each other respectfully. At the time, Perez had no idea
this obscure soldier was already plotting to overthrow him.
	   Eventually, military commanders got word of Chavez's
machinations and banished him to an isolated outpost near the
Colombian border. But Chavez*s tirades against corruption also
earned him friends in high places.
	   At midnight on Feb. 3, 1992, Chavez and three other mid-level
officers led some 15,000 rebel soldiers intent on imposing a
``progressive'' civilian-military junta.
	   By noon the next day, dozens of people lay dead and the
government had the upper hand.
	   A month after the failed coup, Caracas residents staged a
raucous demonstration against Perez, banging their pots and pans
together and shouting, ``Viva Chavez!'' A second coup attempt by
Chavez loyalists on Nov. 27, 1992 also failed, but within a year
President Perez was forced from office on corruption charges.
	   For the past four years, Chavez has crisscrossed Venezuela in a
grassroots campaign to build support for his Fifth Republic
Movement, the successor to the Bolivarian group that staged the
coup attempts.
	   ``The hour of reckoning has come for the corrupt,'' shouted a
supporter last weekend as Chavez rode in an open jeep through the
colonial streets of Carora in western Venezuela, his wife and
one-year-old daughter by his side.
	   Half-naked children in white-stucco houses peered through
windows as the caravan passed. A beaming Chavez reached out to
hundreds of clamoring hands.
	   ``We're going to build a true democracy,'' he vowed.

Italy, Lazio star defender returns from World Cup injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy defender Alessandro Nesta played Thursday for
the first time since tearing knee ligaments at the World Cup,
entering his club Lazio of Rome's Italian Cup game as a substitute.
	   Nesta, 22, joined Lazio's lineup at the start of the second half
against Internazionale of Milan.
	   The center back had been sidelined since June, when he injured
his right knee four minutes into Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria
in first-round play at France '98.
	   Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti caused an uproar in September when
he announced plans to petition the national soccer federation to
pay compensation for lost services of the player.

Police patrol, Hindu fundamentalists pray

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of minor stone throwing incident. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGALORE, India (AP) _ Hundreds of police officers patrolled a
southern Indian shrine where Hindus and Muslims have traditionally
worshipped together in peace, fearing violence as Hindu
fundamentalists held a rally.
	   A gathering held by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu
Council, started with prayers and was fairly peaceful, except for
stone-throwing by a few young men that was quickly quelled, United
News of India said.
	   The council, known as the VHP, says the Muslim family that has
traditionally maintained the site, located in the southern Indian
city of Chikamagalur, should hand it over to Hindus.
	   The VHP, a sister organization of the Bharatiya Janata Party
that leads India's national governing coalition, initially
threatened to take over the site by force, but later said it only
planned to hold a rally.
	   Muslims believe a Sufi holy man is buried in a cave. Hindus say
one of their gods entered the cave in ancient times and
disappeared, but will one day re-emerge at the site 300 kilometers
(190 miles) south of the Karnataka state capital of Bangalore.
	   A top security official, Phillipose Matthai, said some VHP
activists hurled rocks at a restaurant that served fish, which
protesters said violated the custom of local Hindus to eat only
vegetarian food on important days of the religious calendar.
	   Police quickly restored peace in the area and no arrests were
made, Matthai said.
	   Some 10,000 people, mostly VHP activists, took part in the
rally, he said. However, Matthai said most of the local residents
stayed away.
	   More than 2,000 police officers were deployed at barricades
erected to control crowds.
	   The tussle over the shrine comes just days before the sixth
anniversary of the day a Hindu mob tore down a mosque at Ayodhya in
northern India.
	   The campaign to raze the mosque _ believed by some Hindus to be
located at the birthplace of their god Ram _ was spearheaded by the
VHP.
	   The Ayodhya issue helped bring the BJP to political prominence,
while the mosque's destruction sparked a wave of deadly religious
rioting across India.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A key Bosnian Serb general
arrested by NATO troops on genocide charges commanded the soldiers
who executed thousands of Muslims and dumped them in mass graves,
his U.N. indictment revealed Thursday.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic, seized by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force on Wednesday, is the most senior Serb military
officer arrested so far in the effort to bring to trial Bosnians
accused of war crimes.
	   Krstic arrived late Thursday in The Hague, where the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal will try him for genocide, war crimes, crimes
against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   An arraignment date has not been set.
	   Details of his indictment _ unsealed and made public Thursday _
allege that troops under his command committed offenses after the
rebel Serb takeover of the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern
Bosnia in July 1995.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most of the members of the Bosnian Muslim population of
the Srebrenica enclave, using automatic weapons, hand grenades and
other weaponry.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October. It had been kept secret so he wouldn't be prompted to
flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   In Sarajevo, survivors of the Srebrenica massacre applauded
Krstic's arrest.
	   ``Since July 13, 1995, I've never felt happiness in my heart,''
Kada Hotic told The Associated Press, referring to the date the
Serbs overran the town. ``Last night when I heard he was arrested,
I felt happy.''
	   Another survivor, Munira Subasic, said she hoped Krstic ``will
give answers to where are our relatives, our children.''
	   But the Bosnian Serb president and army leaders Thursday blasted
Krstic's arrest, calling it a ``terrorist act.''
	   Nikola Poplasen, president of Serb-run half of Bosnia, lodged a
protest over the arrest with the Office of High Representative, the
top international body in Bosnia.
	   After meeting members of Bosnian Serb army headquarters,
Poplasen said the arrest presented ``a sadistic act typical of
highwayman banditry.'' Poplasen said Bosnian Serb substate with do
all in its power to defend Krstic.
	   Krstic, who held the rank of general-major during the Srebrenica
operation, is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic _ the tribunal's top two suspects _
also have been indicted on genocide charges for allegedly
orchestrating the massacres at Srebrenica. Both remain at large.
	   Krstic was the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) _ Georg Hackl, the three-time Olympic
luge champion, and Katja Seizinger, the two-time Olympic downhill
champion, were crowned Germany's athletes of the year Thursday.
	   In the traditional year-end poll of Germany's sports
journalists, the Bundesliga champion Kaiserslautern won the title
of the Team of the Year.
	   Hackl, 32, won his third consecutive Olympic gold medal at the
Winter Games in Nagano in February.
	   He collected 3,444 votes to beat Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour de
France winner and second in this year's race, who got 1,879 votes.
Discus thrower Lars Riedel, who added the European title this year
to his Olympic and world titles, got 1,717 votes to take third
place.
	   Seizinger, 26, became the first woman to retain the Olympic
downhill title. She won another gold medal in Nagano and also
clinched the World Cup title.
	   After winning the Athlete of the Year poll also in 1994 and
1996, Seizinger earned her third honor by receiving 3,751 votes.
Seizinger has been out of action this season after knee surgery.
	   Sprinter Grit Breuer, the European 400-meter champion, finished
second with 2,192 and Olympic speedskating champion Gunda
Niemann-Stirnemann was third with 2,138 votes.

Tory leader faces rebellion in House of Lords
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Updates in graf 8 with two peers quit party &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unwilling to shed blue blood in a hopeless cause,
Britain's hereditary nobles were ready to go quietly from the House
of Lords _ only to get into a fight with the commoner who leads
their party.
	   Conservative Party leader William Hague was caught by surprise
when the Tory leader in the Lords accepted a compromise with Prime
Minister Tony Blair's government to retain some hereditary nobles
in the house during a transition period.
	   ``It was a deal which, if accepted, would mean that the
Conservative party would support the government's changes to the
House of Lords lock, stock and barrel,'' Hague said Thursday.
	   Hague said he cannot support the abolition of the voting rights
of 759 Lords with inherited titles until the government spells out
how it will choose members in the future. At present, the
aristocrats sit alongside some 500 peers with lifetime titles,
mostly former politicians, in the unelected upper chamber.
	   Blair plans to refer that issue to a commission, while going
ahead with the eviction of most of the hereditary members.
	   Given the government's large majority in the House of Commons,
Hague conceded he was bound to lose the fight. ``But that does not
mean that the Conservative Party has to withdraw its objections,''
Hague said in a radio interview Thursday.
	   A day earlier he had dismissed Lord Cranborne as Conservative
leader in the Lords. Cranborne, one of the Cecil family who have
been politically prominent since the Elizabethan age, confessed
that he had behaved ``like an ill-trained spaniel'' by going behind
Hague's back.
	   Cranborne's deputy, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, resigned on
Thursday _ ``disgusted and appalled'' that Hague had sacked
Cranborne. Three more Conservative leaders in the Lords _ Lord
Bowness, Lord Pilkington and the Earl of Home _ resigned later in
the day. Baroness Strange and Baroness Flather withdrew from the
party and moved to the ``cross benches'' for peers who vote
independently.

Lyon upsets leader Bordeaux; Marseille concedes late equalizer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Lyon scored a 2-1 win over league leader Bordeaux
on Thursday, but second-placed Marseille failed to take the chance
to regain top spot, conceding a late penalty to draw 1-1 at
Auxerre.
	   After an even first half, Lyon outclassed Bordeaux, which had a
one point lead over Marseille at the start of play.
	   Steed Malbranque, the 18-year-old midfielder reported to be a
target for English champion Arsenal, created both goals.
	   In the 51st minute, Malbranque played a one-two to break through
the Bordeaux defense. His first shot was saved by goalkeeper Ulrich
Rame and his follow up struck the post, but Alain Caveglia buried
the rebound.
	   Vikash Dhorasoo scored the second after Malbranque had stormed
down the right and again had his shot stopped by Rame.
	   Sylvain Wiltord pulled one back for the league leader in the
82nd minute, his 11th goal of the season.
	   Lyon, which beat Marseille in its last home match, moved up to
fourth with the win.
	   At Auxerre, Laurent Blanc put Marseille in the lead with a
classy 60th minute goal against his former team.
	   But seven minutes from time, Daniel Bravo, standing on his goal
line, handled a goal-bound Auxerre shot.
	   Stephane Carnot scored from the penalty spot.
	   Bravo was also shown the red card for the infringement.
	   Earlier, Auxerre's Steve Marlet hit post with a sharp 15 yard
(meter) shot.
	   Monaco, returning to full strength after an early-season injury
crisis, easily beat Nancy 3-0 to move into third place, 11 points
behind Bordeaux, and keep alive its slim championship hopes.
	   David Trezeguet scored a pair, bringing his season's total to
eight. Victor Ikpeba also got on the scoresheet.

Salas' double leads Lazio past Ronaldo-less Inter 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Chile's Marcelo Salas struck early in each half
Thursday to give defending Italian Cup titlist Lazio of Rome a 2-1
win over Internazionale of Milan and new coach Mircea Lucescu in a
first-leg quarterfinal.
	   Salas connected on a penalty kick 13 minutes into the game and
then was left completely alone to slot in a left-wing cross from
steps away in the 46th.
	   In between, French striker Youri Djorkaeff scored for Inter in
the 30th with a beautifully lofted 18-meter (yard) free kick that
tucked under the crossbar.
	   Lazio has now defeated Inter two straight times since losing to
the Milan club in last season's UEFA Cup final.
	   Inter was without two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo, who
told the Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper for Thursday's editions
that his return to full health will take time.
	   ``At this point, we have decided to go forward day by day,
without making plans,'' the Brazilian was quoted as saying. ``When
I am completely healed, I will say so and I will play.''
	   Hampered by knee tendinitis, the striker has missed two-thirds
of the club's matches this season.
	   Fellow forwards Roberto Baggio and Nicola Ventola also missed
the game for Inter.
	   But Lazio had good news on the injury front, as national team
defender Alessandro Nesta played for the first time since he tore
right knee ligaments at the World Cup.
	   He came off the substitutes bench at the start of the second
half.
	   Lucescu, a Romanian, joined Inter on Tuesday, the day after
predecessor Luigi Simoni was fired.
	   Three players who received yellow cards will miss the second
leg, slated for Jan. 26: Inter defender Fabio Galante and Lazio
midfielders Dejan Stankovic of Yugoslavia and Pavel Nedved of the
Czech Republic.
	   In earlier quarterfinals, Atalanta of Bergamo, the only
second-division club left in the competition, rallied for a 3-2
upset of Serie A leader Fiorentina on Wednesday, and Udinese beat
AC Parma 3-2 Tuesday.
	   Juventus plays Bologna Jan. 13 in a match postponed when UEFA
moved the Turin club's political charged Champions League match at
Turkey's Galatasaray to this week.

 &UR; Yugoslav parliament denounces U.S. pressure on Milosevic &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a show of defiance, the Yugoslav
parliament on Thursday denounced ``destructive'' U.S. policies in
the Balkans and declared support for President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   A declaration, approved by the assembly, accused the United
States of ``directly supporting separatism and terrorism and
financing the adversaries'' of Yugoslavia, according to a text
distributed by the state-run Tanjug news agency.
	   The strongly-worded declaration followed intensified U.S.
diplomatic efforts over Kosovo and a reported change of American
policies toward Milosevic.
	   Washington has blamed Milosevic for instigating ethnic conflict
in the Balkans and imposed diplomatic and economic sanctions
against his government. But since 1995 it has also worked closely
with the Yugoslav leader in efforts to ensure a lasting peace in
Bosnia.
	   This week, however, State Department spokesman James Rubin
claimed the Milosevic's grip on power was weakening. Some media
reports suggested the Clinton administration was prepared to
opponents of the regime inside Yugoslavia itself.
	   The U.S. ``presents support for separatism and terrorism in
Kosovo, causing destabilization of the region,'' the declaration
said.
	   ``The parliament fully supports Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in his efforts to defend vital national and state
interests ...,'' it said.
	   Reformist deputies from Montenegro, who enjoy U.S. support, did
not attend the session, not did some opposition deputies from
Serbia. The republics of Montenegro and Serbia make up the
Yugoslavia federation.

Weather improving for shuttle launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with vastly improved weather
forecast, start of fueling; Pickup 7th graf pvs. `The mission ...'.
Launch scheduled for about 4 a.m. EST Thursday; launch window lasts
just 10 minutes. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ With the weather on both sides of
the Atlantic vastly improving, a buoyant NASA pressed ahead for a
Thursday liftoff of the first space station construction flight.
	   All week, forecasters feared clouds and rain might delay space
shuttle Endeavour's predawn launch with the first American-built
piece of the international space station.
	   But by Wednesday night, the rain had stopped and the full moon
could be seen peeking from behind scattering clouds as NASA began
fueling the shuttle.
	   Better weather also was expected at the prime emergency landing
site in Spain. NASA will not launch unless at least one site in
Spain or Morocco is available.
	   Dignitaries from around the world gathered to see Endeavour and
its crew of six off following a year's delay caused by a cash crush
in Russia, NASA's chief partner in the space station project. Most
were representatives of the 16 countries participating in the space
station effort. The guest list included Secretary of State Madeline
Albright.
	   The mission promises to be one of the most difficult in space
shuttle history. And the entire space station project promises to
be the most difficult undertaking since the Apollo moon landings
nearly 30 years ago.
	   ``We're not testing just hardware as part of this program,''
said Mikhail Sinelschikov, a Russian space official. ``We're
testing our relationship very much and our mutual trust and our
confidence in each other.''
	   Two weeks ago, the Russians put the first piece of the space
station into orbit.
	   During Endeavour's 12-day flight, the astronauts will use the
shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian piece and attach it to the
American component. Then, two astronauts will perform three
spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders.
	   The U.S. piece, named Unity, is a connecting passageway. It is
essentially an aluminum can with big holes where other chambers
eventually will attach. It contains six miles of wiring and more
than 50,000 mechanical pieces.
	   The Russian component, named Zarya, which means sunrise,
contains the power and propulsion systems that will keep the
station aloft until the Russians can launch a permanent control
module.
	   In all, more than 100 components weighing 1 million pounds are
to be launched over the next five years, requiring 45 U.S. and
Russian flights.
	   ``It's going to start out kind of small, but it's going to grow
to the size of a football field,'' said Endeavour's commander,
Robert Cabana.
	   Unity should have been put in orbit last December. But station
assembly was put on hold because of Russia's economic crisis, which
prevented the country's space agency from completing the permanent
control module. NASA has since bailed out the Russian Space Agency.

Vandals destroy gravestones in Jewish cemetery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Vandals knocked over and shattered more
than 50 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in the Georgian capital
today, authorities said.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Georgia's chief rabbi, Ariel Levin, denounced the vandalism as a
``barbarous act'' and said it was carried out by someone ``with
provocative goals.''
	   He added: ``Nobody will be able to cast a pall over good ...
relations between Georgians and Jews, which have existed for more
than 26 centuries.''

	   The powerful blast in the Ural Mountains city of Perm took place
late Wednesday night when the plant was empty, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   The small plant was located in a forest area and did not

Russian parliament inches its way toward decision on START II
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Senior Russian lawmakers voiced hopes Thursday
that parliament would soon ratify the START II arms reduction
treaty with the United States.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, agreed to finish its
work by next Tuesday on a measure that outlines Russia's nuclear
weapons program, said Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov. The bill will
then be sent to President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``It will spell out Russia's military doctrine and guidelines
for developing new weapons that would ensure Russia's security,''
Seleznyov told reporters.
	   Some Duma members in the past have talked about setting
conditions for ratification _ a move that might require the U.S.
Senate to review the treaty again. However, Seleznyov didn't
mention any proposals that would make ratification conditional on
additional actions by the United States.
	   Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Duma's foreign affairs
committee, said he expected the president to return the bill to the
Duma without any major alterations. That could set the stage for
approval of the START II treaty.
	   Yeltsin previously submitted the START II treaty to the Duma for
ratification.
	   But Russian lawmakers wanted to outline priorities for
developing the country's nuclear arsenal before approving the
treaty.
	   START II, which the two countries signed in 1993, would halve
Russian and American nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led
opposition in the Russian parliament has balked, claiming that
dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's security and be
too expensive.
	   The Russian government and military leaders have strongly pushed
for ratification, saying that Russia will have to soon decommission
its aging missiles anyway.
	   There's been some progress in recent weeks, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov has made a renewed push to convince lawmakers to
ratify the document.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy defender Alessandro Nesta played Thursday for
the first time since tearing knee ligaments at the World Cup,
entering his club Lazio of Rome's Italian Cup game as a substitute.
	   Nesta, 22, joined Lazio's lineup at the start of the second half
in the 2-1 victory over Internazionale of Milan.
	   Asked if he felt pain Wednesday, Nesta shook his head. ``No,
no,'' he said, ``everything was fine.''
	   The center back had been sidelined since June, when he injured
his right knee four minutes into Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria
in first-round play at France '98.
	   Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti caused an uproar in September when
he announced plans to petition the national soccer federation to
pay compensation for lost services of the player.

Paraguay's Oviedo still heads Copa America despite legal troubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ A former general will remain the chief
organizer of the 1999 Copa America tournament despite his mounting
legal troubles, Paraguayan league officials said Thursday.
	   Paraguay's Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered that former Gen.
Lino Cesar Oviedo return to jail to finish serving out his 10-year
sentence for rebellion.
	   However his layers argue the ruling doesn't mean a return to
prison for Oviedo, because a military tribunal organized by
President Raul Cubas had already overturned the previous military
court ruling.
	   But congressional critics are pressing for his return to jail.
	   Oviedo was convicted in March by an armed forces' court for
refusing an order by then-President Juan Carlos Wasmosy to resign
as army chief-of-staff in April 1996, setting off a crisis that
tested Paraguay's young democracy.
	   He was released from prison in August by a presidential decree
from Cubas, who later named him head of Paraguay's effort to host
the South American championship.
	   ``Oviedo is not going to prison according to his lawyers...and
he will continue as the head coordinator of the Copa America,''
said Jose Medina, a Paraguayan Football Federation official.
	   Medina added that Oviedo had already resumed working to improve
the country's highly underdeveloped infrastructure which still
remain a huge obstacle in pulling off next year's tournament.
	   Copa America is scheduled for July 1-18.

Fears rise over Congress' refusal to approve austerity measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS to tighten. RECASTS. New to some points. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Lawmakers' failure to pass a key
measure in the government's austerity package signals growing
public discontent with the belt-tightening needed to shore up
Brazil's ailing economy, analysts said Thursday.
	   Congress voted Wednesday to block a proposal to raise the
monthly social security contributions of public workers and, for
the first time, collect them from retired civil servants.
	   The measure's defeat hit financial markets hard on Thursday. The
Sao Paulo stock exchange's Bovespa Index closed down 8.8 percent
after plunging 5 percent within the first five minutes of trading.
Rio de Janeiro's smaller stock exchange closed down 8.9 percent.
	   ``It was a negative surprise for the market, as everything
indicated the government would win this vote,'' said Jorge Simino,
a director with Unibanco Asset Management.
	   The proposal turned down by Congress was part of Brazil's Fiscal
Stability Plan, the basis of a dlrs 41.5 billion international aid
package announced by the International Monetary Fund on Nov. 13.
	   In late October, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and
spending cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and
dlrs 80 billion by 2002.
	   ``With recession and unemployment looming, there is a growing
uneasiness among the population,'' said Alexandre Barros, a
Brasilia-based consultant.
	   ``In rejecting the proposal, congressmen reflected their
constituencies' anxiety and discontent.''
	   He said the government has no one to blame but itself.
	   ``The government has not done enough to stitch together the
political and popular support needed for the approval of the highly
unpopular measures contained in the austerity package,'' he said.
	   In turning down the proposal, lawmakers signaled to the
government that ``it will have to negotiate approval of the
measures,'' possibly weakening the overall package, Barros said.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral said Wednesday's defeat
will require extra cuts in public works and will deprive states of
some federal funding.
	   It will also delay a reduction in interest rates, he said. Rates
were increased to 50 percent in August to stop a rapid outflow of
dollars and have been lowered slowly since then.
	   Analyst Carlos Lopes of the Santa Fe Institute for Political
Research in Brasilia said the government was ``overconfident''
about the support it commands in Congress.
	   ``They seem to have a blind faith that anything they propose
will be approved automatically,'' he said. ``Wednesday's vote has
shown that's not the case.''

Iraq accuses inspectors of giving its enemies intelligence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq accused U.N. weapons inspectors
Thursday of providing enemy intelligence agencies with information
obtained from its searches for weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called on U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to take ``urgent measures'' to stop
contacts between the inspectors and the intelligence organs of
countries, especially those that follow ``anti-Iraqi policies.''
	   ``These contacts are more dangerous than has been known
before,'' Aziz said in a letter to Annan. ``These contacts include
supply and exchange of sensitive information about Iraq and its
national security.''
	   For years, Iraq has accused inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM, of aggressive, offensive behavior.
Baghdad also suggested that American and British nationals working
for UNSCOM passed information about Iraq back to their capitals.
	   But Aziz said the extent of contacts between UNSCOM and
``foreign intelligence parties enemy to Iraq'' has only now become
public.
	   He cited revelations by Scott Ritter, a former U.S. Marine who
resigned in August as head of UNSCOM's Concealment Investigation
Unit and disclosed that he sought and received Israel's help in
tracking down Iraqi weapons.
	   Aziz also cited a Nov. 10 report in the International Herald
Tribune that the United States planned to use information about
Iraqi military organizations gathered during inspections in a
military attack. The United States called off airstrikes on Nov. 14
after Iraq agreed to resume full cooperation with the weapons
inspectors.
	   ``This means that the information on Iraq which the Special
Commission gets under the cover of the Security Council's
resolutions is being turned over to the Pentagon, and the American
military plans depend on them,'' Aziz said.
	   The Iraqi minister also accused UNSCOM Deputy Chairman Charles
Duelfer of passing information gathered in weapons inspections to
Iraqi opposition groups that met in London last week.
	   Duelfer said he was in London for a meeting at the Foreign
Office and didn't meet any Iraqi opposition groups.
	   He stressed, however, that UNSCOM is permitted to seek
information on Iraq's banned weapons programs from any source _ and
uses governments and even the Internet.
	   Aziz also repeated Iraq's demand for an investigation into
UNSCOM's ``behavior and its contacts'' and for a restructuring of
UNSCOM which he said now had ``great importance.''
	   Baghdad wants the commission staff to be more diverse, its
headquarters moved from New York to Europe, and its executive
director, Richard Butler, replaced.
	   The weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq's biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons and long-range missiles have been
eliminated before the Security Council can lift sweeping sanctions
imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.

Swedish teen wins first World Cup race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with second run. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Anja Paerson of Sweden, a
17-year-old circuit rookie, stunned a veteran field by coming from
15th place to win a women's World Cup slalom by .01 seconds over
Australia's Zali Steggall.
	   Paerson, as the 15th-place finisher in the first run, had the
advantage of starting first in the afternoon session, and
capitalized, recording a time of 48.82 seconds that was 1.08
seconds faster than anyone else.
	   She completed two runs in a combined 1 minute, 40.84 seconds on
a gray, windy, icy cold day at this resort in the Sierra.
	   ``I just wanted to come down and make points. Winning, I can't
believe it,'' Paerson said. ``I know I was fast but not that fast.
They were two seconds before me.''
	   Steggall, the Olympic slalom bronze medalist last year, held a
1.75-second lead over Paerson after the first run, but even that
huge margin wasn't enough to get her past the Swedish teen.
	   ``It's tough, but it's the way racing goes,'' Steggall said.
``You never know when maybe it'll be your day and you'll be on top.
I had two good runs in really tough conditions, with the wind and
the ruts.''
	   Ingrid Salvenmoser of Austria, seventh after the first run,
claimed third on the day in 1:41.29. She had the second-fastest
afternoon run, but at 49.90 seconds it was over a second slower
than Paerson.
	   Paerson's eyes grew wide when Pernilla Wiberg, a former World
Cup overall champion and the top star of the Swedish team, came in
1.05 seconds behind. As succeeding racers tried and failed to
overcome her time, Paerson stood with Wiberg, shaking her head and
grinning.
	   ``Pernilla told me, `You're going to win,' but I said, `No
way,''' Paerson said. ``I mean, I was two seconds back of the
leaders!''
	   When first-run leader Sabine Egger of Austria finished in
1:41.49, the other Swedish racers cheered and crowded around their
newest star, slapping her on the back.
	   Paerson became the third racer from her little village of
Tarnaby to win a World Cup race. The first and most famous was
Ingemar Stenmark, whose 86 victories still ranks tops among all
racers in World Cup history. Stig Strand, who grew up next door to
Stenmark and just a few blocks from Paerson, won two races and
shared the 1983 World Cup slalom title with Stenmark.
	   Paerson said she has skied many times with Stenmark while
growing up, absorbing little racing tips from him. Her first
victory mirrored that of her skiing partner, who came from 17th
place for his first slalom victory back in 1974.
	   After Egger in fourth, Wiberg and Norway's Trine Bakke tied for
fifth. Slovenia's Urska Hrovat, winner of the season-opening slalom
at Park City, Utah two weeks ago, was seventh, followed by
Germany's Martina Ertl and the Swiss duo of Sonja nef and Karin
Roten.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The major Protestant and
Catholic parties in Northern Ireland clashed bitterly Thursday,
hours after they apparently had agreed on the next key steps
forward in making April's peace agreement a reality.
	   The rival wings of Irish Catholic opinion, the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party and militant Sinn Fein, both accused the
major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, of retreating
from commitments made early Thursday as British Prime Minister Tony
Blair oversaw negotiations.
	   The prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said Blair
was ``disappointed that the parties had not been able to build on
the progress made last night and that a number of different
interpretations had arisen.''
	   When Blair left early Thursday, Catholic politicians were openly
confident they and the Ulster Unionists would announce within hours
two key planks of Northern Ireland's new government: forming a
10-post Executive administration, and seven policy making
committees to work with the Irish Republic.

Canadian lawmakers propose tax breaks for pro sports teams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Seeking to prevent more Canadian teams from
leaving for the United States, a parliamentary subcommittee
Thursday recommended federal tax breaks for professional franchises
and athletes.
	   But opposition lawmakers objected to the plan, saying it would
be politically unacceptable to help out millionaire owners and
players at a time when many other Canadians face hard times.
	   The committee's report was compiled after months of public
hearings that included testimony from the owners of Canada's six
National Hockey League teams.
	   Noting that NHL teams from Quebec City and Winnipeg had moved to
the United States, the owners said it was difficult to compete with
U.S. franchises which paid less taxes and used publicly financed
arenas.
	   Under the subcommittee proposal, a franchise would be eligible
for a dlrs 5-million (dlrs 3.3-million U.S.) tax credit on its
first dlrs 50 million (dlrs 33 million) in revenues. Teams with
greater revenues would get a lower rate of tax break and those with
revenues over dlrs 80 million (dlrs 52 million U.S.) would not
qualify.
	   To qualify for the breaks, teams would have to boost their
support of local amateur sports, making their arenas available on a
regular basis and encouraging community involvement by players.
	   The report also recommends a lower tax burden for pro athletes.
	   The entire subcommittee backed most of the recommendations in
the report, which dealt largely with amateur sport. But the four
opposition parties refused to join the governing Liberal Party in
endorsing tax breaks.
	   ``We have a health care system in dire straights, we have a
country that pays too much tax. At the same time, we're talking
about giving rebates to millionaire hockey teams,'' said Inky Mark
of the right-wing Reform Party. ``It just wouldn't fly.''
	   Dennis Mills, the Liberal legislator who chaired the
subcommittee, said pro sports owners had a duty to address the
issue of skyrocketing player salaries. But he said it would be
foolish for Canada to make no policy changes, and risk losing three
or four more NHL teams.
	   ``The easy way out, but I think somewhat irresponsible, would be
to just say, `Let them all go,''' he said.
	   Among other recommendations in the report:
	   _Canadian TV networks should concentrate on more home-grown
events, and perhaps be restricted in how many U.S. sport programs
they can show.
	   _The justice minister should consider legalizing sports
wagering.
	   _Families with children competing in amateur sports should be
eligible for tax credits to compensate for the costs of
registration and equipment.
	   The fate of the recommendations probably depends on which
receive backing over the coming months from Prime Minister Jean
Chretien and his Cabinet.

Sampras: Six straight No. 1 years won't be broken
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras is sure that his record of six
consecutive years as the world's No. 1 player will never be broken.
	   ``I know what it takes to do it and I don't see anyone in
today's game having the consistency, having the durability that it
takes to be No. 1, not only for one or two years, but for six
years,'' Sampras said in a teleconference Thursday from Los
Angeles.
	   Sampras had shared the mark of five successive years at No. 1
with Jimmy Connors, who did it from 1974-78. Sampras needed a
closing surge, playing six consecutive weeks in Europe this fall,
to hold off the challenge of Chilean Marcelo Rios.
	   ``You need the game, you need the heart, you need the mind,''
Sampras said. ``Some guys have two of three. Some guys have a
little of the three, but in order to do it for six years, you need
everything.''
	   Despite his record-breaking year, this season was a bit of a
disappointment for Sampras. He won only four titles, his fewest in
a single season since 1991. After winning a record-tying fifth
Wimbledon, he remains one away from tying Roy Emerson's all-time
mark of 12 Grand Slam singles titles.
	   ``This year was a a little inconsistent,'' said Sampras, whose
record in the majors _ U.S. Open semifinals, Australian Open
quarterfinals, French Open second round _ reflected his uneven
season.
	   The season also ended on a bittersweet note for Sampras when,
after clinching the No. 1 ranking, he lost in the semifinals of the
ATP World Championships to Alex Corretja of Spain.
	   ``I had mixed emotions when I left there ,'' said Sampras, who
intends to rest until around Christmas before beginning
preparations for next month's Australian Open. ``I did what I
wanted to do, but it was not the way I wanted to end the year.''

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ D.C. United has reached an agreement to send
Mario Gori to the Miami Fusion, a Major League Soccer source said
Thursday.
	   United will likely receive draft picks for the 25-year-old
Argentine defender, according to the source. The trade must be
approved by the league before it is finalized.
	   D.C. United officials did not immediately return phone calls for
comment. The team is in Fort Lauderdale, Florida preparing for
Saturday's Interamerican Cup second-leg match against Brazil's
Vasco da Gama.
	   The deal is the first of many United needs to make stay within
the league's salary cap. Cap restraints also prompted United's
trade of popular forward Raul Diaz Arce to New England earlier this
year.
	   Gori has been with two-time MLS champion United since the team's
inaugural season in 1996, although he has been used sparingly the
last two seasons. This year, he played in 17 games and started nine
with no goals or assists.
	   Gori will remain with United through Saturday's match, the
team's last under coach Bruce Arena. Arena was named coach of the
U.S. national team in October and will be replaced next season by
former Tampa Bay and New England coach Thomas Rongen.
	   Vasco da Gama won the first leg 1-0.

Probation report could lead to jail for Tyson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN KUSMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Mike Tyson's probation officer will file
court papers by Monday that could lead to the former heavyweight
champion returning to prison.
	   George Walker, the chief probation officer for Marion Superior
Court, said Thursday it appears Tyson violated terms of his
probation as a result of his no-contest plea to misdemeanor assault
charges in Maryland on Tuesday.
	   Tyson served three years on a 10-year sentence in Indiana for
raping a beauty pageant contestant. He was convicted in 1992, and
his probation expires in March.
	   Judge Patricia Gifford, who presided at Tyson's trial and will
decide if Tyson violated his probation, was out of her office
Thursday and unavailable for comment.
	   ``The judge can do everything from nothing all the way to
imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in
between,'' Walker said. The judge also could modify the sentence or
place new conditions on Tyson's probation.
	   The prospect of Tyson going to prison again comes as he nears a
return to the ring. He has a fight planned for Jan. 16 against
Francois Botha in Las Vegas, his first bout since his boxing
license was revoked for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a
1997 title fight. He was reinstated by Nevada authorities in
October.
	   Walker said his petition would not be a recommendation regarding
possible prison time for Tyson.
	   ``What we actually say on the petition is to give the facts, the
facts we all read in the paper,'' Walker said. ``We want to go
ahead and get this on the record. ... We bring it to the court's
attention, and then all the legal stuff kicks in.''
	   Tyson's probation was reviewed last year after the Holyfield
bout, but no action was taken.
	   Tyson is undergoing psychiatric treatment, one of the conditions
that led to reinstatement of his license by the Nevada Athletic
Commission.
	   The two men Tyson scuffled with in Maryland already have reached
a settlement with the boxer to avoid a civil suit. However, the
Montgomery County, Md., prosecutor wants jail time on the criminal
charges. Sentencing is to come early next year but an exact date
has not been set.
	   Walker and Beverly Phillips, a spokeswoman for the Marion County
Prosecutor's Office, said the probation question was complicated by
Tyson's no-contest plea in Maryland. Indiana has no provision for
such a plea.
	   ``There are legal issues to research, and we think it would be
wise to wait and see what happens with his sentencing in
Maryland,'' Phillips said Thursday.
	   Although the no-contest plea was not an admission of guilt,
Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count.
He also could be fined up to dlrs 5,000.
	   Tyson told the judge he didn't expect leniency or a lighter
sentence in return for the no-contest plea, and he was aware it
could affect his probation.
	   Steve Johnson, executive director of the Indiana Prosecuting
Attorneys Council, said probation could be revoked even if Tyson
has not been convicted in Maryland.
	   ``Good behavior is always a condition of probation,'' Johnson
said. ``A no-contest plea would not necessarily preclude a
revocation of probation if evidence were brought to Judge Gifford
that a criminal act had occurred.''
	   Johnson said judges routinely warn offenders that they need not
be convicted of another offense to risk being sent back to jail.

Tory leader faces rebellion in House of Lords
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS in graf 8 that two peers left Tory benches, not
party &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unwilling to shed blue blood in a hopeless cause,
Britain's hereditary nobles were ready to go quietly from the House
of Lords _ only to get into a fight with the commoner who leads
their party.
	   Conservative Party leader William Hague was caught by surprise
when the Tory leader in the Lords accepted a compromise with Prime
Minister Tony Blair's government to retain some hereditary nobles
in the house during a transition period.
	   ``It was a deal which, if accepted, would mean that the
Conservative party would support the government's changes to the
House of Lords lock, stock and barrel,'' Hague said Thursday.
	   Hague said he cannot support the abolition of the voting rights
of 759 Lords with inherited titles until the government spells out
how it will choose members in the future. At present, the
aristocrats sit alongside some 500 peers with lifetime titles,
mostly former politicians, in the unelected upper chamber.
	   Blair plans to refer that issue to a commission, while going
ahead with the eviction of most of the hereditary members.
	   Given the government's large majority in the House of Commons,
Hague conceded he was bound to lose the fight. ``But that does not
mean that the Conservative Party has to withdraw its objections,''
Hague said in a radio interview Thursday.
	   A day earlier he had dismissed Lord Cranborne as Conservative
leader in the Lords. Cranborne, one of the Cecil family who have
been politically prominent since the Elizabethan age, confessed
that he had behaved ``like an ill-trained spaniel'' by going behind
Hague's back.
	   Cranborne's deputy, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, resigned on
Thursday _ ``disgusted and appalled'' that Hague had sacked
Cranborne. Three more Conservative leaders in the Lords _ Lord
Bowness, Lord Pilkington and the Earl of Home _ resigned later in
the day. Baroness Strange and Baroness Flather expressed their
displeasure by moving from the party benches to the ``cross
benches'' for peers who vote independently of the party line.

Johnny Tapia's only losses have all been outside the ring

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ To unbeaten bantamweight Johnny
Tapia, there's no time like the present. With a past like his, who
can blame him?
	   ``I forgot yesterday, 'cause it's gone. And I don't think about
tomorrow, because it may never come,'' he says.
	   His father was murdered when he was still in his mother's womb.
When he was 8, his mother was murdered. Tapia, meanwhile, survived
a bus crash, a long battle with cocaine addiction, a series of jail
terms and a 3 1/2-year ban from fighting.
	   ``Sometimes I ask, `Why did I have to go through so many
obstacle courses to get where I am?' But I'm still here,'' he said
Thursday.
	   Tapia, 31, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, puts his 44-0-2 record on
the line Saturday against WBA bantamweight champion Nana Konadu in
the main event of a Don King fight card at the Atlantic City
Convention Center.
	   In the co-feature, WBA welterweight champion James Page takes on
No. 1 contender Jose Luis Lopez.
	   Tapia's career got a boost last year, when he won a 12-round
decision over Albuquerque arch rival Danny Romero. In his last
outing Aug. 29, he posted a 10-round decision over Carlos
Hernandez.
	   But he says he isn't taking the champion Konadu lightly.
	   ``He's no pushover. He's the best and the strongest at 118,''
Tapia said.
	   Konadu, 33, of Sunyani, Ghana, won his title in 1996, lost it
nine months later to Daorung Chuwatana and then won it back in a
1997 rematch with Chuwatana. This year, he has won both of his
fights.
	   ``I'll go in and fight my 12 rounds. That's all,'' was all
Konadu had to say at a news conference Thursday.
	   The fight card is the first in Atlantic City promoted by Don
King since 1990.
	   King was barred from doing business with casinos in 1994 because
of a an indictment in New York state, but the ban was lifted this
year when he was cleared of the charge.
	   He missed Thursday's news conference, however. He was in Los
Angeles promoting the March 13 heavyweight championship fight
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, a spokesman said.

DiMaggio improving, makes feisty request
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) _ In the first words he's been able to
speak since his serious setback after lung cancer surgery, Joe
DiMaggio delivered a spirited message to his doctors.
	   ``I want to get the hell out of here and go home,'' the
84-year-old Hall of Famer said Thursday after his doctor
temporarily adjusted the breathing tube in his throat.
	   The remark drew a smile from Dr. Earl Barron, a cardiologist who
heads a team of doctors treating DiMaggio at Memorial Regional
Hospital.
	   DiMaggio continued to show improvement from his latest lung
infection, which developed Friday, Barron said.
	   ``Thing are looking up today, but who knows what will happen
tomorrow,'' Barron told The Associated Press, adding that the
former New York Yankees center fielder had no fever and his white
blood cell count was normal.
	   DiMaggio, who made his last public appearance at Yankee Stadium
on Sept. 27, underwent surgery Oct. 14 to remove a cancerous tumor
from his right lung.
	   A series of setbacks have kept him in the intensive care unit
since the operation.
	   DiMaggio, unable to speak because of the tube in his trachea,
had been indicating with hand gestures for days that he wanted to
talk, Barron said.
	   The doctor agreed, and had the tube capped temporarily, allowing
DiMaggio to make his comment.

Standard and Poor's and TSE in talks to create new stock indexes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: `Standard and Poor's' and `S and P' both take ampersands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Standard and Poor's said it is in talks with the
Tokyo Stock Exchange about a possible tie-up to create new indexes
based on Japanese and Asian stock markets.
	   New York-based Standard and Poor's, the creator of the widely
used U.S. stock index the S and P 500, said in a statement Thursday
that the two sides hoped to reach an agreement next year.
	   They will also consider developing futures, options and other
securities based on the new indexes, the statement said.
	   While the statement didn't go into detail, it suggested these
securities would be created for Japanese investors and possibly
traded in Japan.
	   ``The objective is to provide ... investable equity indices, as
well as index related products, that would give Japanese companies
greater exposure to global investors,'' the statement said.
	   An official for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a company that runs
Japan's largest stock exchange, confirmed that discussions were
under way but said no decisions have been reached.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange compiles Japan's version of the S and P
500: the Tokyo Stock Price Index, or TOPIX, which gives an average
price of the country's 1,300 largest listed companies.

86-year-old man questioned over 1970 child murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ An 86-year-old man will appear in
court Friday charged with one of Australia's most infamous crimes
-- the abduction and sex murder of two young sisters in north
Queensland almost 30 years ago, police said.
	   Sisters Judith Mackay, 7, and Susan Mackay, 5, were raped,
strangled and stabbed after they were abducted from a bus stop only
1,000 feet (300 meters) from their family home in Aitkenvale in
August 1970.
	   Their naked bodies were found in a dry creek bed south of
Townsville two days later, sparking one of the biggest manhunts in
Australian history.
	   Police questioned a man Thursday for several hours before
arresting him.
	   He is also expected to be questioned over the disappearance of
14-year-old Marilyn Wallman who vanished while cycling to school in
Mackay, 205 miles (330 km) south of Townsville, in March 1972.
	   Her body has never been found.
	   The elderly man is believed to have worked as a
government-employed carpenter in schools in the Townsville area,
including the Mackay sisters' Aitkenvale school.
	   It is understood a breakthrough in the investigation occurred
when the man's granddaughters supplied information to police.
	   Police yesterday successfully applied to the Townsville
Magistrates Court to take a DNA sample from the man.

Jordan rejoins labor talks with season in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no new proposals made after six hours &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Late in the lockout game, Michael Jordan checked
back in.
	   Jordan made a surprise appearance at the National Basketball
Association labor talks Thursday, but whether his magic touch can
save the season remains to be seen.
	   His presence was promising, however, since his agent had said he
wouldn't get involved again until discussions got serious.
	   ``His understanding was that a new proposal was going to be made
(by the owners), and he wanted to be there to listen to it,'' agent
David Falk said. ``You can read into it that he's continuing to be
involved and supportive of the union leadership.''
	   After about six hours of talks, however, neither side had put
anything new on the table.
	   Jordan left early in the evening, and it was unclear if he would
return. He did not comment as he entered a hotel across from NBA
headquarters, where the league and union were huddled in a
conference room trying to end the five-month dispute that threatens
to wipe out the entire season.
	   The sides spent the first two hours merely ``feeling each other
out,'' commissioner David Stern said, then went back to work after
breaking for lunch. The bargaining session was the first in 13 days
with both full negotiating committees in attendance.
	   If the owners and players can't come up with a solution in the
next couple of weeks, the entire 1998-99 season will be canceled.
Stern has steadfastly refused to reveal on what date it will be too
late to save the season.
	   Jordan's arrival marked the first time he had joined the talks
since Oct. 28, when he spent about 8 1/2 hours at the bargaining
table and helped try to broker a deal.
	   The sides met one other time since then, on Nov. 20, and called
it their most productive session to date.
	   In the next couple of days, however, things unraveled. The union
said proposed changes to free agency timing rules were a
``deal-killer,'' and the owners then said the union reneged on its
acceptance of a complicated tax formula.
	   Pressure for a settlement and panic over the fate of the season
increased in recent days, with former union president Isiah Thomas
going so far as to suggest that the union could replace Billy
Hunter and Patrick Ewing as its lead negotiators.
	   ``The one message I know he (Jordan) is delivering emphatically
is that people like Isiah can sit on the sidelines and criticize,
but when you are in the game it's harder,'' Falk said.
	   The first order of major business Thursday was to decide whether
to continue negotiating under the framework that the sides had
discussed in two previous sessions _ a six- or seven-year agreement
with a complicated ``escrow tax'' system in the final three or four
years.
	   The proposals put on the table Nov. 20 would include players
having 10 or 15 percent of their paychecks withheld if spending on
overall player salaries exceeded a targeted percentage of revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent. The owners
moved to 52 and 53 percent on Nov. 20 and the players dropped to 57
percent, but those concessions became void under the ground rules
that have been set for the new talks.

Swedish teen wins first World Cup race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to reflect Hrovat disqualification; Koznick finish &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Anja Paerson of Sweden, a
17-year-old World Cup rookie, stunned a veteran field by coming
from 15th place to win a women's World Cup slalom by .01 seconds
over Australia's Zali Steggall.
	   Paerson, as the 15th-place finisher in the first run, had the
advantage of starting first in the afternoon session, and she took
full advantage, putting down a time of 48.82 seconds that was 1.08
seconds faster than anyone else.
	   She completed two runs in a combined 1 minute, 40.84 seconds on
a gray, windy, icy cold day at this resort in the Sierra.
	   ``I just wanted to come down and make points. Winning, I can't
believe it,'' Paerson said. ``I know I was fast but not that fast.
They were two seconds before me.''
	   Steggall, the Olympic slalom bronze medalist last year, held a
1.75-second lead over Paerson after the first run, but even that
huge margin wasn't enough to get her past the Swedish teen.
	   ``It's tough, but it's the way racing goes,'' Steggall said.
``You never know when maybe it'll be your day and you'll be on top.
I had two good runs in really tough conditions, with the wind and
the ruts.''
	   Ingrid Salvenmoser of Austria, seventh after the first run,
claimed third on the day in 1:41.29. She had the second-fastest
afternoon run, but at 49.90 seconds it was over a second slower
than Paerson.
	   Paerson's eyes grew wide when Pernilla Wiberg, a former World
Cup overall champion and the top star of the Swedish team, came in
1.05 seconds behind. As succeeding racers tried and failed to
overcome her time, Paerson stood with Wiberg, shaking her head and
grinning.
	   ``Pernilla told me, `You're going to win,' but I said, `No
way,''' Paerson said. ``I mean, I was two seconds back of the
leaders!''
	   When first-run leader Sabine Egger of Austria finished in
1:41.49, the other Swedish racers cheered and crowded around their
newest star, slapping her on the back.
	   Paerson became the third racer from her little village of
Tarnaby to win a World Cup race. The first and most famous was
Ingemar Stenmark, whose 86 victories still ranks tops among all
racers in World Cup history. Stig Strand, who grew up next door to
Stenmark and just a few blocks from Paerson, won two races and
shared the 1983 World Cup slalom title with Stenmark.
	   Paerson said she has skied many times with Stenmark while
growing up, absorbing little racing tips from him. Her first
victory mirrored that of her skiing partner, who came from 17th
place for his first slalom victory back in 1974.
	   After Egger in fourth, Wiberg and Norway's Trine Bakke tied for
fifth. Slovenia's Urska Hrovat, winner of the season-opening slalom
at Park City, Utah two weeks ago, was seventh but was later
disqualified for missing a gate despite a protest lodged by her
coaches. That pushed Germany's Martina Ertl into seventh followed
by the Swiss duo of Sonja Nef and Karin Roten and Austria's Karin
Kollerer.
	   American Kristina Koznick, fourth in the morning run, dropped to
27th after a disastrous second run. It appeared she missed a gate
but the gate judge ruled she made it and thus her time of 1:46.99
stood.

Doctors warned about asthma drug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Doctors should carefully watch asthma patients
who take the drug Singulair for signs of a rare but serious
complication called Churg-Strauss syndrome, manufacturer
Merck-and-Co. warned Thursday.
	   Churg-Strauss syndrome is a tissue disorder that sometimes
strikes adult asthma patients and, if untreated, can destroy
organs.
	   Merck said Thursday that it has received fewer than 20 reports
of Singulair patients developing symptoms of Churg-Strauss, out of
600,000 people worldwide who have tried the drug.
	   Merck wrote 165,000 doctors and pharmacists Thursday to alert
them to signs of the condition, including flu-like symptoms, rash,
tingling or numbness of the arms and legs, or severe sinusitis.
Some asthmatics experience worsening lung symptoms as pulmonary
blood vessels become inflamed.
	   Merck also revised the drug's labeling to include the caution
and to tell patients to alert their doctors to such symptoms.
	   There is no proof Singulair was to blame, Merck said. But many
of the patients had been weaning themselves from other asthma
medications called corticosteroids, which is a risk factor for the
condition.
	   A competing asthma drug, Accolate, also warns about the rare
complication.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky has agreed to do an interview with
a British television network for broadcast in Britain in February,
Channel 4 announced Thursday.
	   Channel 4 said its interview, to be taped in the United States,
will be transmitted ``within a few hours'' of the ABC interview Ms.
Lewinsky has already agreed to for North American television, and
before publication of the book on which she is collaborating.
	   The network said Ms lewinsky had agreed to talk about ``her life
and the events of the past year, including her relationship with
President Clinton.
	   Channel 4 did not announce what it was paying for the interview,
but the British national news agency Press Association reported the
sum was 400,000 pounds (dlrs 664,000). ABC's interview is free, as
major U.S. networks don't pay for interviews.
	   Channel 4 will be able to sell the rights for the interview to
all countries outside North America.

Council blames renewed crisis in Angola on UNITA opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Angolan envoy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday
blamed the renewed crisis in Angola on the former rebel group UNITA
and demanded that it disarm and adhere to a 1994 peace accord.
	   A council resolution expressed dismay that Angola appears headed
back to civil war, which has ravaged the southern African nation
for most of its nearly quarter-century of independence.
	   There have been increasing clashes between government troops and
opposition UNITA forces, and diplomats have been unable to get both
sides together to try to patch up the peace accord.
	   Angolan envoy Josefa Guilhermina Coehlo Da Cruz called UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi ``a desperate man who refuses to operate
within the bounds of the peace accord.'' She reiterated her
government's decision to have no further contact with him.
	   To compel Savimbi to halt his warlike behavior, she urged the
United Nations to redouble efforts to enforce sanctions against
UNITA and to cut its communications links and freeze its assets.
	   The resolution, approved by a 15-0 vote, extended the mission of
a U.N. observer force monitoring the peace agreement until Feb. 26.
It called on the government and especially UNITA to ensure the
safety of the observers.
	   Coehlo Da Cruz noted that UNITA recently took 15 members of the
observer mission hostage and refused to allow U.N. planes to
evacuate them.
	   Blaming UNITA's leadership for the current impasse in the peace
process, the council demanded that UNITA immediately withdraw from
territories it has reoccupied and comply with its obligations to
completely disarm and allow the government to operate throughout
the country.
	   The council stressed that there can be no military solution to
the conflict in Angola, and called on the government and UNITA to
cooperate fully with Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special
representative ``to seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis.''
	   Since Savimbi had chosen to remove himself from the peace
process, Coehlo Da Cruz said a new UNITA leadership had taken his
place. Angola's government welcomed the new leadership and urged
the international community to do likewise, she said.
	   Renewed fighting has chased 331,300 people from their homes
since April, bringing the total displaced population to over 1.3
million, according to U.N. officials.
	   There is no access to about 50 percent of the country, so it is
difficult to help those in need. And U.N. officials have expressed
alarm that mines are being used in the latest fighting.
	   The Security Council called on the government and especially
UNITA to cooperate with humanitarian organizations delivering
emergency relief assistance, to stop laying new mines, ``and to
respect international humanitarian, refugee and human rights law.''

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Paul Molitor refused to use the word
retirement, but all indications are his 21-year baseball career is
over.
	   The Minnesota Twins star said Thursday he has decided to end his
playing career.
	   ``My heart tells me I'm done,'' he said at a news conference.
	   In the next breath, Molitor said he wants to look at other
opportunities and refused to call his announcement a retirement.
	   But Molitor, 42, said he will not accept offers from the
Milwaukee Brewers or Toronto Blue Jays.
	   The Brewers had been talking to Molitor about a front-office
job. Molitor said earlier this month he had been contacted by
several teams, both about playing and off-field possibilities.
	   Molitor played his first 15 seasons in Milwaukee, three with
Toronto and his last three with Minnesota. He's eighth on the
career hits list after 21 seasons.

Mallon-Pate, McCurdy-Cochran post 10-under-pars to lead tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALM HARBOR, Florida (AP) _ Golfers needed shopping carts to
haul away all their birdies Thursday in the first round of the
JCPenney Classic.
	   They came, they played, they scored like never before in the
event that pairs LPGA and PGA Tour pros in team competition. The
Meg Mallon-Steve Pate and Cindy McCurdy-Russ Cochran teams posted
tournament record-tying 10-under-par best-ball 61s to share the
first-round lead at Innisbrook.
	   In the JCPenney Classic's 22-year history, only three previous
times had 61 appeared on a scorecard.
	   ``It was a perfect day,'' Pate said. ``There was virtually no
wind, the greens were soft and this format is a lot easier than the
alternate shot.''
	   Everybody agreed. Just one shot behind the co-leaders are Vickie
Odegard-Jim Carter and Tracy Hanson-Doug Barron. Two shots back are
Susie Redman-Ted Tryba, Cartrin Nilsmark-Chris Perry, Rachel
Hetherington-Rocco Mediate, Catriona Matthew-Dan Forsman and Beth
Daniel-Doug Martin.
	   Fifty-one of the 52 teams broke par. LPGA player of the year
Annika Sorenstam and husband David Esch -- a controversial pairing
in that Esch turned pro to compete in the event with his wife --
finished at 70 and were the only team to make a double-bogey.
	   ``We teed off late and saw people were going low,'' Mallon said.
``Our whole group was playing well, making some birdies, and we
just made them right along.''
	   Mallon-Pate made it look easy with a steady 31-30 that featured
seven birdies by Mallon and three by Pate.
	   ``We had a nice aggressive run at every putt because we were
both there close,'' Pate said. ``You knew one or both of us were
going to make it.
	   ``We never had to play a hole by ourselves all day. I don't
think we were ever in jeopardy of making a bogey.''

Noah edges Forget, McEnroe beats Vilas

 &UR; Eds: Recasts, UPDATES with later matches

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John McEnroe underlined his mastery of seniors
tennis with a 6-1, 6-4 beating of Guillermo Vilas Thursday in the
opening round of the ATP Seniors competition at Olympia.
	   Winner of four events in a row, McEnroe breezed through the
first set in 25 minutes and was 3-1 up in the second before Vilas,
winner of four Grand Slam events in his career, fought back.
	   The 46-year-old Argentine won four games in a row to lead 4-3
before McEnroe responded with three to take the match.
	   ``I wasn't that happy with my game,'' McEnroe said.
	   ``I started to fiddle around a bit in the second set to give the
crowd something to shout about but I couldn't afford to do that on
the main tour.''
	   Yannick Noah saved four match points before beating fellow
Frenchman Guy Forget 6-7 (7-2), 6-4, 13-11 in the opening match.
	   The one hour, 25-minute match went into a tie-break third set,
which lasts a minimum 10 points but went to 24.
	   Noah saved two match points at 9-7 down, one more at 10-9 and
another at 11-10 before winning on his first match point at 12-11
with a smash.
	   The eight-man competition is split into two groups.
	   McEnroe is grouped with Vilas, Henri Leconte and Mansour
Bahrami, while Noah and Forget are in with Pat Cash and John Lloyd.
	   Bahrami beat Leconte 7-5, 6-7 (7-5), 10-6 and Cash downed Lloyd
6-1, 7-5 in other matches played Thursday..
	   Five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg was scheduled to play
but pulled out last week through injury.
	   McEnroe has won four consecutive events, putting him ahead of
Jimmy Connors at the top of the senior rankings. Connors has not
played in the European events.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   JERUSALEM_ In defiance of the United States, Israel's prime
minister said Thursday he will not back down from a decision to
suspend the Wye River peace agreement over what called Palestinian
violations. ``We are not to be made fools,'' said an angry Benjamin
Netanyahu, who won unanimous backing from his Cabinet ministers
after they watched footage of an attack on an Israeli soldier by a
Palestinian mob. Ministers watched a video of Wednesday's brutal
attack. When the tape ended, the decision was unanimous: Israel
would suspend its West Bank troop withdrawal. The latest crisis to
plague the Mideast peace accord cast a pall over the upcoming visit
of U.S. President Bill Clinton, just days before he was to arrive
in the region to oversee implementation of the second phase of the
deal he helped broker. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria _ A homemade bomb exploded Thursday at a market
in western Algeria, killing 14 people and injuring 23 others, local
police said. The bomb went off in the morning in the Ain Defla
area, about 125 kilometers (80 miles) west of Algiers, police said.
It was the sixth violent attack in a week, and came the day that
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met Algeria's president to try to
end the conflict in the Western Sahara. The Muslim holy month of
Ramadan, which begins this year on Dec. 20, has been marred by
waves of violence since the insurgency began. Twelve villagers were
slaughtered in their sleep early Wednesday in the Sidi Rached
region about 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of Algiers. (ALGERIA)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ A key Bosnian Serb general arrested by
NATO troops on genocide charges commanded the soldiers who executed
thousands of Muslims fleeing the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica, his
U.N. indictment revealed Thursday. Gen. Radislav Krstic, seized by
U.S. members of the NATO peacekeeping force on Wednesday, is the
most senior Serb military officer arrested so far in the effort to
bring to trial Bosnians accused of war crimes. Krstic arrived late
Thursday in The Hague, where the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal will
try him for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and grave
breaches of the Geneva Conventions. An arraignment date has not
been set. Details of his indictment _ unsealed and made public
Thursday _ allege that troops under his command committed offenses
after the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica
in eastern Bosnia in July 1995. (BOSNIA-WAR CRIMES)
	   WASHINGTON _ Paintings by old masters such as Picasso and
Cezanne that were confiscated from Jews by Nazi Germany could be
returned to prewar owners or their heirs or sold to benefit
Holocaust survivors under guidelines endorsed Thursday by 44
countries at a conference in Washington. The international meeting,
designed to get nations, museums, galleries and individuals to
reexamine collections and archives in an unprecedented post-World
War II search, produced an immediate breakthrough: The Russian
delegation delivered documents on art looted from Austrian Jews
including one that listed 700 pieces the Nazis confiscated in
Vienna before World War II. (HOLOCAUST-CONFERENCE)
	   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Republicans jettisoned campaign fund raising
from their impeachment inquiry on Thursday, likely clearing the way
for a vote next week on President Bill Clinton's relationship with
a White House intern and his effort to cover it up. At the same
time, incoming Speaker Bob Livingston signaled his desire for the
full House to meet before Christmas to vote on any articles of
impeachment the committee approves. ``If the Judiciary Committee
could complete its work next week, it would be my expectation that
we could have a vote on the following week,'' the Republican leader
said. (CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials plunged back below 9,000
Thursday, nearly posting its second 200-point loss of the week, as
a fourth straight day of profit-taking finally seeped into the
technology sector. Extending a rapid retreat from the new high set
just last week, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 184.86
points _ or by 2 percent _ to 8,879.68, about 500 points below the
record of 9,374.27 set Nov. 23. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Making their first collective decision
about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common
currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move
that won market confidence. Ten of the 11 countries joining
European economic union dropped their key interest rate to 3
percent, with Portugal making the most significant plunge, from
3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 percent. The
exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. It is
expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is
launched. Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying
the groundwork for monetary union. (EUROPE-INTEREST RATES)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg on Thursday suggested governments reform rigid labor
markets to create jobs rather than pressure him to cut interest
rates. ``The high unemployment rate in Europe is far more the
consequence of structural rigidities within the European labor and
product markets than a result of adverse cyclical developments,''
Duisenberg said in a speech. Duisenberg has been under pressure
from the left-leaning French and German governments to lower rates
when his bank takes over monetary policy for the 11 nations that
adopt the euro currency on Jan. 1. With inflation in the euro-zone
nations at just 1 percent, and unemployment stubbornly high at 10.9
percent, governments are urging Duisenberg to boost business by
setting lower rates. (EU-CENTRAL BANK)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The productivity of U.S. workers grew at a
healthy 3 percent annual rate over the summer even as manufacturers
struggled with sales lost to the Asian economic slump. The increase
in the productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers in the
July-September quarter _ measured as output per hour of work _ was
even better than the 2.3 percent seasonally adjusted rate reported
in an initial estimate last month. Economists said Thursday's
report from the Labor Department shows that businesses, especially
manufacturers, have been quick to economize to preserve profit
margins threatened by the loss of export sales to Asia and other
economically troubled parts of the world. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's giant state savings bank on Thursday
finally freed up some individual accounts transferred months ago
from six huge ailing private banks, news reports said. The economic
crisis that hit in August crippled the country's six largest
commercial banks. They reacted by freezing private accounts, saying
they had no money to repay depositors, prompting public outrage and
massive crowds at the few banks that were releasing money. The
government in September offered the depositors to transfer their
accounts from the troubled banks to the state Sberbank, saying all
deposits would be guaranteed. However, all foreign-currency
deposits were to be paid out in rubles _ and at about half the
current exchange rate. (RUSSIA-BANKS)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Labor unrest escalated across France on Thursday,
with rail workers on strike, jobless protesters marching to demand
a year-end government bonus, and school monitors walking off the
job. The rail strike, which began last Friday, hit 20 out of 23
regions, with services severely disrupted. The strike was set to
continue Friday. Rail workers say there is insufficient staff and
are concerned about how the government will implement a plan to cut
the work week from 39 to 35 hours. Many workers fear a 35-hour
week, aimed at spreading jobs around and cutting unemployment, will
lead to salary cuts. (FRANCE-STRIKES)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Transatlantic trade relations took a
turn for the worse Thursday with the European Union calling U.S.
demands over a banana dispute ``ridiculous,'' and warning
Washington's threat of sanctions bodes ill for next year's world
trade negotiations. Chief EU trade negotiator Leon Brittan appealed
to U.S. authorities to reconsider a European proposal to settle the
banana dispute at a special panel at the World Trade Organization
instead of threatening sanctions. Washington alleges the new EU
banana import regime is unfair to South American distributors, most
of which are owned by U.S. companies. The WTO had already condemned
an earlier EU banana import system, but Brittan said the new regime
met all the WTO concerns. (EU-US-BANANAS)

Michael, Joe DiMaggio, Robert Altman, Sylvester Stallone. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Ruben Blades says he'll continue to
pursue a double career: Panamanian politics, and the singing and
acting that have made him an international star.
	   Blades on Thursday responded to critics of his political
aspirations, who say he spends too much time in California acting
and recording music to be a political leader in Panama.
	   ``Work takes me out of the country ... and nobody can prohibit
me from working,'' Blades told The Associated Press.
	   Last week, the party Blades helped found, Papa Egoro, elected
him as its president. Blades ran for the Panamanian presidency in
1994 and finished third. He says he no longer has presidential
ambitions but wants to remain active in politics.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ George Michael doesn't feel in the least
contrite about his arrest for a lewd act in a park bathroom.
	   ``Contrite for what?'' the British-born pop singer said in
Thursday's USA Today. ``Everyone expected me to be devastated
because I've been such a private person. I wasn't.''
	   Michael, who acknowledged he was gay after the incident, said he
was entrapped by overzealous police April 7 and wants to tell his
side of the story:
	   He said he was in his car when ``I saw this guy cruising, an
undercover cop who was basically pretending to cruise. He was very
cute; he wasn't Karl Malden. I didn't get out of my car until
everyone left the park. Then I followed him in. I don't want to go
into details.''
	   Michael pleaded no contest to lewd conduct, paid a dlrs 810 fine
and was ordered to perform 80 hours of community service.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio drew a smile from his
doctor Thursday with a feisty request.
	   ``I want to get the hell out of here and go home,'' the former
star baseball player for the New York Yankees said.
	   The 84-year-old DiMaggio continued to show improvement after
developing a lung infection as he battles lung cancer.
	   ``Thing are looking up today, but who knows what will happen
tomorrow,'' said Dr. Earl Barron, DiMaggio's cardiologist.
	   DiMaggio had no fever and his white blood cell count was normal.
He had been unable to speak because of a tube in his trachea but
indicated with hand gestures that he wanted to talk, Barron said.
	   He had the tube capped temporarily, allowing DiMaggio to make
his comment.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIAMI BEACH, Florida (AP) _ About dlrs 250,000 in antique
watches were stolen from the home of Gloria Estefan and husband
Emilio while they were on vacation.
	   While police didn't specify what was stolen, a Florida
television station reported the watches were taken from a locked
bedroom closet.
	   There was no apparent sign of forced entry to the couple's
palatial gated estate on Miami's Star Island, police said Thursday.
Nor was there evidence the closet had been broken into, WSVN-TV
said.
	   ``At this time we're interviewing anybody who had knowledge of
Mr. Estefan's personal property which will include employees of the
Estefan organization,'' said Al Boza, a police spokesman.
	   The Cuban-born singer reported the theft after the Thanksgiving
holiday.
	   ``It's a private matter,'' Estefan said through a spokesman.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Robert Altman's murder-mystery comedy
``Cookie's Fortune'' will open next year's Sundance Film Festival.
	   The film starring Laura Dern, Glenn Close and others will be
shown Jan. 21 at Abravanel Hall, organizers said Wednesday
	   In the 10 days following opening night, 12,000 people are
expected to see 114 feature films.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Moving trucks rolled up to Sylvester Stallone's
estate to haul away exercise equipment, paintings and other
belongings as he awaits completion of a deal to sell the mansion.
	   The U.S. actor is living in a hotel room in Los Angeles, where
his new movie ``Detox'' is being filmed, said his spokeswoman,
Rosario Kennedy.
	   He isn't getting out of South Florida for good, she said.
	   ``He still plans to make Miami his permanent home,'' Ms. Kennedy
said.
	   Stallone put his bayfront mansion on the market in August 1997,
asking dlrs 27.5 million. London's Orient-Express Hotels Inc. has
made a dlrs 24.7 million offer to build 200 villa-style rooms on
the property. The deal hinges on whether the hotelier can get
zoning approval.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's bomb scare continued to
terrorize the nation Friday as police found a 27th letter bomb in a
Sydney post office and a train in Sydney was halted and evacuated
for a search.
	   The bomb at the Darlinghurst, Sydney post office was detonated
safely by police shortly after it was discovered at 8:15 a.m. The
Sydney train continued its journey when no suspicious package was
found aboard.
	   Police, ambulance and fire crews were also called to the Penrith
branch of the Australian Taxation Office in western Sydney after
the discovery of another suspicious package.
	   Government and business offices as far apart as Melbourne, on
Australia's southeast coast and its northernmost capital of Darwin,
as well as the Centrepoint Tower shopping center and office tower
in Sydney were evacuated Thursday in a series of false alarms.
	   ``It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I suppose,
is a modern day reality in every society,'' Prime Minister John
Howard said on radio Friday.
	   ``We've been refreshingly freer of it than most other societies
and I hope that continues to be the case.
	   ``But unhinged human nature can become a very lethal weapon if
it's triggered off by particular events,'' he said.
	   Twenty-seven potentially lethal parcel bombs have been found at
addresses in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and the Gold Coast over
the past 48 hours.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   Police have named Colin George Dunstan, 43, a suspended tax
officer who got embroiled in an affair with a woman at his office,
as the prime suspect and have launched a nationwide hunt for him.
	   Dunstan has been involved in a sexual harassment case at the tax
office in Canberra involving the woman he had the relationship
with.
	   Only the first of the letter bombs has caused any injury.
	   Two postal workers, at the Canberra mail sorting center were
slightly injured, after one of them threw one of the letter bombs
into a mail bag early Wednesday morning.
	   Police say they cannot be sure that there are no more letter
bombs in Australia's mail system, which is presently overflowing
with Christmas parcels.
	   They have urged people throughout Australia to be cautious if
they see suspicious parcels in their mail.

Jamaican judges to rule on death row case by January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CARROLL ORR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A panel of judges will rule before
January on the fate of death row inmate Neville Lewis, condemned to
hang earlier this year.
	   The Constitutional Court ruling will probably also decide
whether three prisoners scheduled for the gallows last week can be
executed. Jamaica's supreme court stayed the executions of the
convicted murderers _ Dalton Daley, Peter Blaine and Milton
Montague _ until the Constitutional Court decision.
	   In court on Thursday, lawyers representing Lewis asked the
Constitutional Court to commute his death sentence to life
imprisonment because of ``inhuman and degrading'' prison conditions
he has suffered.
	   They claimed there are flies and cockroaches in his cell, and
that there is not enough light for reading.
	   Government lawyers called the claims untrue and presented public
health inspectors, a medical doctor and a prison supervisor to
refute the complaints.
	   They also argued that a six-month limit on death-row appeals
imposed by the government does not conflict with the Inter American
Convention on Human Rights, which Jamaica has signed but plans to
abandon.
	   Some Caribbean countries accuse the Interamerican Human Rights
Commission, which was created by the convention, of deliberately
delaying its appeals from prisoners in member nations to prevent
hangings.
	   On Oct. 15, the Bahamas ignored a last-minute protest by the
commission and hanged two convicted killers.
	   Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad and other Caribbean countries say the
death penalty deters crime linked to drug trafficking in the
region. Together, they have resisted pressure from Britain to
eliminate executions in its former colonies.

Italy's No. 2 player could be key to Davis Cup final

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After a rough start, Davide Sanguinetti is
on a Davis Cup hot streak.
	   Italy's No. 2 singles player debuted in tennis' team competition
with a straight-set first-round loss against India in April. Since
then, though, he's undefeated in Davis Cup matches that count.
	   And Sanguinetti may be the key player in the best-of-5 final
against defending champion Sweden, which opened Friday.
	   ``Playing at home and on clay could give us an extra kick,''
said Sanguinetti, an UCLA student in economics who turned pro in
1993.
	   The 26-year-old was scheduled to take on Sweden's Magnus
Gustafsson in the second singles match Friday, following the match
between Italy's No. 1 Andrea Gaudenzi and Magnus Norman.
	   ``It brings me good luck to play after Andrea in Davis Cup
action. I hope to keep up the tradition in the final,'' said
Sanguinetti, a very consistent baseline player with a punishing
backhand passing shot.
	   He won his second match against India, both outings against
Zimbabwe in the quarterfinals, and beat favored Todd Martin in
Italy's 4-1 semifinal rout of the United States.
	   The Italian broke through with a quarterfinal run at Wimbledon
this summer and won one ATP challenger circuit title this year.
	   ``He's a player of great class, with an iron will,'' said
Italy's non-playing captain Paolo Bertolucci, who played doubles in
1976 as Italy captured its only Davis Cup title.
	   Sanguinetti had never faced Gustafsson before Friday, and had
Gaudenzi, who has been nursing a sore shoulder, had never played
Norman.
	   Sanguinetti is currently 47th in the ATP lists, three places
behind Gaudenzi.
	   Gustafsson is ranked 31st and Norman 52nd, meaning there is no
one in the ATP's top 30 playing singles in the final for the first
time in Davis Cup history.
	   Thomas Johansson, Sweden's highest-ranked player at No. 17, was
dropped from the team at the last minute because of a sore right
knee and his inconsistency on clay.
	   Jonas Bjorkman, who is ranked 24th, will only play Saturday's
doubles for Sweden, teaming with Nicklas Kulti.

	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ He's five strokes off the lead and
far from the betting favorite. But the Tiger phenomenom has
definitely come to South Africa.
	   Organizers of the Million Dollar Challenge here say attendance
was up 30 percent on Thursday's opening round, which saw American
star Tiger Woods hit a level 72, in back of leader and defending
champion Nick Price, who shot a five-under 67.
	   Woods was trailed by the usual crowds as he made his way along
the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club course. Black
kids mobbed him during practice.
	   He said he missed ``a lot of opportunities ... and made a few
mistakes'' during his first round of African golf. He birdied on
the 2nd, 10th, 12th, 16th and 17th holes, but lost three strokes on
two consecutive holes -- a bogey on the 7th and double bogey on the
8th.
	   But he called his form ``not too bad. Obviously, it's a little
better than two months ago. I'm very pleased with the way I'm
striking the ball,'' he said. ``It feels like I'm making
progress.''
	   Price of Zimbabwe, the defending champion, was two shots up on a
three-way logjam of double Major winner Mark O'Meara, Justin
Leonard and Germany's Bernhard Langer. South African hometown hero
Ernie Els _ a seven-time veteran of the challenge and seeking his
first win _ was a shot back at 70.
	   Price had six birdies in his round, picking up shots at the
par-5 2nd, the short 7th, par-5 10th and 14th before finishing
back-to-back birdies on No. 17 and 18, both par 4.
	   ``This course likes me,'' said Price, also winner in 1993 with a
record 24-under par. ``It makes me focus a lot more than I do
normally.''
	   Unusually strong, shifting winds, more Scottish style than
African, caused some of the players to guess on the right club, he
said.
	   Price is coming off his third win at the Zimbabwe Open in four
years, closing with a Royal Harare-record 9-under-par 63 for a
five-stroke victory.
	   ``This is a game of momentum. No doubt about it,'' he said.
	   O'Meara, named U.S. player of the year last week and holder of
the U.S. Masters and British Open titles, reached 4-under to share
the lead on the 14th in the pairing ahead of Price. He surrendered
the spot when Price birdied No. 14 and O'Meara made his second
bogey of a five-birdie round on No. 15.
	   Play begins at 11:40 a.m. (0940 gmt) Friday when Jim Furyk of
the United States tees off, paired with Sweden's Jesper Parnevik.

Spain's top investigative judge has become a silent celebrity

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The judge who wants to put former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet on trial is a quiet but relentless
sleuth.
	   Working out of drab offices at the National Court, Baltasar
Garzon, Spain's top investigative magistrate, has spent more than a
decade tackling drug lords and death squads.
	   At 43, he has established himself as the wunderkind of the legal
world _ but has done it in such a tight-lipped fashion that many
Spaniards probably have never heard his voice.
	   Now Garzon has embarked on his biggest case yet, one sure to
have current and former despots everywhere looking over their
shoulders _ a bid to extradite Pinochet from Britain for trial in
Spain over human rights crimes committed during his reign in Chile.
	   Garzon, who issued a warrant that led to Pinochet's arrest in
London on Oct. 16, is not without critics. Government officials and
prosecutors at his own court challenged his case against Pinochet,
arguing in vain that he lacked jurisdiction.
	   Detractors also point to high-profile drug and
weapons-trafficking cases in which suspects fingered by Garzon
ultimately got off. Some say he botched those investigations.
	   But whether they are for or against him, Spaniards can't ignore
the dapper judge with the steely gaze who has come very far, very
fast.
	   Born in the olive-growing heartland of Andalusia, Garzon pulled
night shifts at the gas station where his father worked in order to
get through law school.
	   He got a position as a provincial judge at the age of 23. Like
all Spanish judges, he won it by passing an examination rather than
through experience. He quickly worked his way up, passing another
grueling test to become a National Court judge at age 32.
	   There, Garzon is one of six examining magistrates who conduct
investigations, issue search warrants and order suspects detained
but do not try cases.
	   Under Spain's legal system, any private party can seek to bring
criminal charges against another. The National Court assigns these
cases to judges like Garzon who decide whether to open a formal
investigation.
	   By all accounts, Garzon has the biggest caseload at the National
Court. Court sources said this is because he is a dogged
investigator who shies from dumping cases.
	   The Pinochet affair began two years ago when, at the request of
a communist-led party called United Left and lawyers representing
victims, Garzon agreed to probe human rights abuses committed by
military juntas that ruled Argentina in the 1970s and '80s.
	   The probe spilled over into Chile because of Operation Condor, a
scheme by Pinochet and other South American despots to crush a
perceived communist threat through cross-border cooperation among
their secret police.
	   Garzon has charged Pinochet with genocide, torture and terrorism
in what Garzon says was a systematic effort to snuff out dissent
during 17 years in power. A Chilean government report puts the
number of dead and missing under Pinochet's regime at 3,197.
	   Pinochet stepped down in 1990, but first granted himself legal
immunity from prosecution.
	   Lawyers who have presented Garzon with thousands of pages of
testimony in the Pinochet case say he has displayed a dazzling
command of facts even while juggling other big cases.
	   ``He strives for efficiency,'' says Juan Garces, a lawyer for
victims of the Pinochet regime.
	   Until now, Garzon's highest-profile case was a probe into a
bungled effort by Spain's then-Socialist government to kill Basque
separatist hitmen during the 1980s. That investigation led to the
conviction and jailing of a former interior minister and 11 other
former officials, police officers or politicians.
	   Garzon also crushed a financial network funneling money to
Basque separatists and closed down a radical Basque newspaper.
	   The Garzon that most Spaniards see is a well-groomed man with a
stern face and combed-back, salt-and-pepper hair. He rarely smiles
in public, not even to celebrate a court victory, and never talks
to reporters.
	   But lawyers and human rights activists who have dealt with
Garzon paint a picture of a soft-spoken, fun-loving man with a
weakness for flamenco dancing and bullfights. His office is
decorated with pictures of both, they say. Underneath a coffee
table lies a papier-mache clown, reportedly an old good-luck charm.
	   They also say Garzon, who is married and has three children,
knows how to put people at ease when they testify about painful
experiences under military rule.
	   ``All the victims agree on one thing,'' said Francisco Perez, a
United Left human rights activist who has sat in on testimony in
Garzon's chambers. ``Everyone, especially the Argentines and
Chileans who are used to judges who are conceited, vain and stuffy,
says this is a man who listens. His attitude is very human and
understanding.''

Guatemalan prosecutor resigns from case of slain bishop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The public prosecutor investigating the
bludgeoning death of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi has said he
will resign his post and leave the case. He didn't say why.
	   The church's Human Rights Office of the Archbishop had called on
Otto Ardon Medina to step down, accusing him of wrongly accusing a
priest in the April 26 slaying.
	   Attorney General Adolfo Gonzalez Rodas will designate Ardon's
replacement. On Thursday, he said the resignation, which takes
effect Dec. 15, ``has no effect'' on the prosecution of the case.
	   The 75-year-old Gerardi was beaten to death in the garage of his
home two days after he presented a report blaming the Guatemalan
military and pro-military death squads for most of the human rights
violations committed during the country's 36-year civil war.
	   Suspicion quickly fell on soldiers or death squad members, and
church officials were shocked when the Rev. Mario Orantes Najera
was arrested July 22.
	   Monsignor Victor Martinez, president of the Episcopal Conference
of Guatemala, welcomed Ardon's resignation.
	   ``There was a public clamor for the departure of Otto Ardon. His
work was very bad,'' Martinez said.
	   A researcher with the Complutense University in Madrid had
suggested that apparent bite marks on Gerardi's body could have
been caused by a German shepherd belonging to Orantes.
	   Investigators exhumed Gerardi's body on Sept. 17 and presented a
report to Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina, who has yet to decide
whether to start judicial proceedings against Orantes as Ardon
requested in October.

 &UR; Eds: SUBS item on George Michael to DELETE reference to Karl
Malden. Contains items on Ruben Blades, Gloria Estefan, George
Michael, Joe DiMaggio, Robert Altman, Sylvester Stallone. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Ruben Blades says he'll continue to
pursue a double career: Panamanian politics, and the singing and
acting that have made him an international star.
	   Blades on Thursday responded to critics of his political
aspirations, who say he spends too much time in California acting
and recording music to be a political leader in Panama.
	   ``Work takes me out of the country ... and nobody can prohibit
me from working,'' Blades told The Associated Press.
	   Last week, the party Blades helped found, Papa Egoro, elected
him as its president. Blades ran for the Panamanian presidency in
1994 and finished third. He says he no longer has presidential
ambitions but wants to remain active in politics.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ George Michael doesn't feel in the least
contrite about his arrest for a lewd act in a park bathroom.
	   ``Contrite for what?'' the British-born pop singer said in
Thursday's USA Today. ``Everyone expected me to be devastated
because I've been such a private person. I wasn't.''
	   Michael, who acknowledged he was gay after the incident, said he
was entrapped by overzealous police April 7 and wants to tell his
side of the story:
	   He said he was in his car when ``I saw this guy cruising, an
undercover cop who was basically pretending to cruise. He was very
cute.''
	   ``I didn't get out of my car until everyone left the park. Then
I followed him in. I don't want to go into details,'' he said.
	   Michael pleaded no contest to lewd conduct, paid a dlrs 810 fine
and was ordered to perform 80 hours of community service.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio drew a smile from his
doctor Thursday with a feisty request.
	   ``I want to get the hell out of here and go home,'' the former
star baseball player for the New York Yankees said.
	   The 84-year-old DiMaggio continued to show improvement after
developing a lung infection as he battles lung cancer.
	   ``Thing are looking up today, but who knows what will happen
tomorrow,'' said Dr. Earl Barron, DiMaggio's cardiologist.
	   DiMaggio had no fever and his white blood cell count was normal.
He had been unable to speak because of a tube in his trachea but
indicated with hand gestures that he wanted to talk, Barron said.
	   He had the tube capped temporarily, allowing DiMaggio to make
his comment.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIAMI BEACH, Florida (AP) _ About dlrs 250,000 in antique
watches were stolen from the home of Gloria Estefan and husband
Emilio while they were on vacation.
	   While police didn't specify what was stolen, a Florida
television station reported the watches were taken from a locked
bedroom closet.
	   There was no apparent sign of forced entry to the couple's
palatial gated estate on Miami's Star Island, police said Thursday.
Nor was there evidence the closet had been broken into, WSVN-TV
said.
	   ``At this time we're interviewing anybody who had knowledge of
Mr. Estefan's personal property which will include employees of the
Estefan organization,'' said Al Boza, a police spokesman.
	   The Cuban-born singer reported the theft after the Thanksgiving
holiday.
	   ``It's a private matter,'' Estefan said through a spokesman.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Robert Altman's murder-mystery comedy
``Cookie's Fortune'' will open next year's Sundance Film Festival.
	   The film starring Laura Dern, Glenn Close and others will be
shown Jan. 21 at Abravanel Hall, organizers said Wednesday
	   In the 10 days following opening night, 12,000 people are
expected to see 114 feature films.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Moving trucks rolled up to Sylvester Stallone's
estate to haul away exercise equipment, paintings and other
belongings as he awaits completion of a deal to sell the mansion.
	   The U.S. actor is living in a hotel room in Los Angeles, where
his new movie ``Detox'' is being filmed, said his spokeswoman,
Rosario Kennedy.
	   He isn't getting out of South Florida for good, she said.
	   ``He still plans to make Miami his permanent home,'' Ms. Kennedy
said.
	   Stallone put his bayfront mansion on the market in August 1997,
asking dlrs 27.5 million. London's Orient-Express Hotels Inc. has
made a dlrs 24.7 million offer to build 200 villa-style rooms on
the property. The deal hinges on whether the hotelier can get
zoning approval.

Italian president begins visit to Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's one-million strong
Italian community will be out in force from Saturday when Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro begins a seven-day official visit to
Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney.
	   Australia's Italian community is second in numbers only to those
of British descent.
	   Federal and state political leaders on both sides are keen to be
seen with the first Italian head of state to visit Australia since
the Bicentenary in 1978.
	   Scalfaro arrives in Melbourne on Saturday. Over the next two
days will be feted at a state reception thrown by Victoria state
Premier Jeff Kennett, open a new Italian education center and meet
the local Italian community.
	   In Canberra early next week, Parliament will hold an official
luncheon in his honor. President Scalfaro will talk with Prime
Minister John Howard, opposition leader Kim Beazley, the
Governor-General and will meet Canberra's Italian community.
	   A similar itinerary is scheduled for Sydney at the end of the
week with another state reception, this time thrown by New South
Wales Premier Bob Carr, and meetings with the local Italian
community.
	   Italy's ambassador to Australia Giovanni Castellaneta, said the
visit was formal recognition of the importance of Australia's
Italian community, and the relationship between Australia and
Italy.
	   ``The cultural link which unites the Italo-Australian community
to Italy and which allows second and third generations of Italians
to rediscover the authentic Italy -- does not diminish the interest
of the sons and daughters of Italians in the Australian way of life
and politics,'' he said.
	   ``On the contrary, it provides a store of knowledge without
equal and inspirational examples in areas such as industrial
innovation, family values etc., on which to base their own lives
and, by doing so, contributing to the Australian society.''
	   Italy is now Australia's 13th biggest trading partner and third
biggest in Europe with two way trade worth 3.5 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.2 billion) a year and growing strongly.

Report: Thailand to set rice export record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Natural disasters in many producing
countries will help Thailand set a record this year in the export
of rice, a newspaper said Friday.
	   Exports are predicted to hit 6.2 million tons, breaking the
previous record of 6.03 million tons in 1989, the Bangkok Post
quoted Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi as saying.
	   Thailand exported 5.73 million tons up to the end of last month,
earning 77.6 billion baht (dlrs 1.85 billion).
	   Supachai said natural disasters in countries like Indonesia as
well as a favorable exchange rate for the country's baht currency
had helped increase exports.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Ten civilians seized at a guerrilla
roadblock were freed Thursday during clashes between rebels and
government troops in northern Colombia, the army said.
	   Five hostages remained in the hands of the rebel National
Liberation Army, which funds its operations largely through
kidnappings.
	   No deaths or injuries were reported in the fighting in rural La
Gloria, 300 miles north of the capital, Bogota.
	   Troops intercepted the rebels while they were transporting 15
people seized Wednesday, said army spokesman Luis Enrique
Hernandez. Ten of the hostages, including three children, were left
behind when the 150-rebel unit retreated. Authorities did not
identify the remaining hostages.
	   The rebels often set up random roadblocks, hoping to catch rich
Colombians or foreigners who may garner large ransoms.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Authorities are trying a new
weapon in their crackdown on prostitution in one Brazilian town:
shame.
	   Police officers in Novo Hamburgo, 1,000 miles southwest of Rio,
will tell the families of brothel users about their loved one's
illicit activities, according to the O Jornal do Brasil daily
newspaper.
	   ``Families should know what these individuals are doing,'' local
police chief Flavio Agenor Ferraz de Amorim was quoted as saying.
	   The police policy in Novo Hamburgo, which took effect Thursday,
has upset prostitutes who say most of their customers are married
men who will now stay away, the newspaper said.
	   A local human rights group was quoted as saying the policy
violates privacy rights.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's attorney general wants to
suspend all foreign adoptions of Guatemalan children after
complaints that unscrupulous lawyers are taking advantage of poor
women.
	   Carlos Garcia Regas urged the public magistrate and the Supreme
Court on Thursday to suspend adoptions while new regulations are
drafted to better protect birth parents.
	   Human rights groups have denounced widespread abuses in
adoptions in Guatemala, saying lawyers coerce women into giving up
babies in return for fees that average dlrs 15,000.
	   In a nation of 10 million people, the attorney general's office
reviews between 170 and 200 adoption cases a month, almost all
involving foreigners. This year, the U.S. Embassy expects Americans
alone to adopt 1,000 Guatemalan children.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Logging has seriously damaged 13 butterfly
sanctuaries in central Mexico and could lead to the deaths of many
of the Monarchs that migrate each fall from Canada, an
environmental group warned Thursday.
	   The Group of 100 urged the Mexican government to halt the
logging of Mexican fir trees in the Michoacan state sanctuaries.
	   It said local authorities reported that five to 10 logging
trucks carried lumber each day from the area near El Rosario
sanctuary. The tree loss leaves the Monarchs vulnerable to sunlight
and cold, the group said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OAXACA CITY, Mexico (AP) _ A land dispute in the southern state
of Oaxaca this week left at least nine people dead, local
authorities said Thursday.
	   Justino Diaz Perez, mayor of Santo Domingo Teojomulco, said
three men from his town were killed in the gun battle Tuesday.
Eight were wounded and five were missing, the mayor said.
	   In neighboring San Lorenzo Texmelucan, 50 miles southwest of
Oaxaca, the president of communal property, Felix Martinez, said
six villagers had died, four were hurt and two were missing.
	   The two villages have fought for 60 years over 40 acres of land.
In the past 30 years, about 130 people have been killed in the
dispute.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ More than 300 people remain missing three
months after floods devastated the southern state of Chiapas'
coast, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The government's official death count relating to the week of
rain and flooding in Chiapas is 177, although estimates vary
widely. Chiapas state Secretary Rodolfo Soto Monzon said another
331 were missing, the Mexico City daily La Jornada reported.
	   The state government was planning to place newspaper ads to try
to contact those still believed missing, Soto Monzon was quoted as
saying.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Carlos Alvarez, a leading
opposition politician, will be tapped as the vice-presidential
candidate for the Alliance coalition's 1999 ticket, local media
reported Thursday.
	   The official announcement is expected on Monday, leading daily
Clarin said, after a series of meetings between high-ranking
members of the Radical Civic Union and Frepaso parties which form
Argentina's largest opposition group, known as the Alliance.
	   Alavarez is one of the principal directors of the center-left
Frepaso party, made up of former Peronists, socialists and
Christian democrats.
	   Buenos Aires mayor Fernando De la Rua won Sunday's primary
elections to become the coalition's presidential candidate and is
widely-regarded as the early favorite in the 1999 race.
	   The Peronist party of President Carlos Menem's is scheduled to
chose its candidate in primaries scheduled for April. Buenos Aires
governor Eduardo Duahlde is largely considered as the front-runner.

Cutting costs rather than euro give impetus to Europe's merger wave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Forget the euro, Europe's flurry of
billion-dollar mergers owes less to the upcoming common currency
than to old-fashioned concerns about cutting costs, reviving
flagging profits and muscling into foreign markets.
	   After a lull over the summer, European merger fever came back
with a vengeance over the past few days with a spate of
cross-border link-ups in banking, oil, pharmaceuticals and metals.
	   The imminent launch of the euro as the shared currency of 11
European nations has been seen as the catalyst for such mergers as
companies seek to combine forces to take advantage of a unified
euro-zone market of 270 million consumers.
	   But take the latest batch one-by-one, and economists say there
are more basic reasons behind them than grasping benefits of the
euro, or tackling the increased competition that comes in its wake.
	   France's Total SA grabbed Belgium's Petrofina SA for dlrs 11.76
billion on Tuesday and formed the world's 5th largest oil company.
The deal was sandwiched between British Petroleum PLC's link up
with Amoco Corp and Tuesday's huge Exxon-Mobil merger and was done
for much the same reason - staying afloat in the face of deflated
crude prices.
	   ``Oil prices have practically been cut in half over the past
year. All companies are seeking to survive in this new situation,''
said Total Chairman Thierry Desmarest. ``The business environment
will be tougher than in the past years.''
	   Traders seemed to agree, sending Total shares downward on the
deal. ``The market sees it as a merger out of desperation,'' says
Sharon Coombs, European strategist at the London office of the
investment bank HSBC James Capel.
	   Coombs sees similar doubts about the planned fusion of Germany's
Hoechst AG and Rhone-Poulenc SA of France to create one of the
world's biggest pharmaceutical concerns with a sales potential of
dlrs 20 billion.
	   ``The two companies are merging to get out of difficult
circumstances, rather than because its the right thing to do,'' she
said.
	   The companies hope the merger will save them dlrs 1.2 billion a
year. But there too investors expressed dissatisfaction.
Rhone-Poulenc stock fell 7 percent in Paris trading after the deal
was announced Monday.
	   In other deals in the last few days, Deutsche Bank took over
Bankers Trust of the United States for dlrs 10 billion to expand in
North America as the world's largest financial institution. Then it
snapped up Credit Lyonnais Belgium for dlrs 590 million.
	   Viag AG, a German industrial conglomerate, merged with the Swiss
metal maker Alusuisse Lonza Group Ltd will have a market value of
40 billion marks (dlrs 23.5 billion).
	   Although the motivation behind the megadeals differs, analysts
say the timing is linked to the rebound of stock markets after the
summer's slump. The revival makes it easier for companies to raise
cash for acquisitions.
	   ``Economic conditions have not turned out as bad as expected ...
it's refocused companies' interest,'' says Elisabeth
Waelbroeck-Rocha, European economist at the Standards and Poor
ratings agency.
	   And the euro? It may not have been spark for the latest mergers,
but it is seen encouraging more, especially in the banking,
transport and retail sector after its launch on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   ``The euro will create a real open market,'' says Betty
Pestiaux, senior researcher at Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.
``I'm sure we're just at the beginning of the merger mania.''

86-year-old man questioned over 1970 child murders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with man claiming innocence. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ An 86-year-old man on Friday denied
he committed one of Australia's most infamous crimes -- the
abduction and sex murder of two young sisters in north Queensland
almost 30 years ago.
	   Sisters Judith Mackay, 7, and Susan Mackay, 5, were raped,
strangled and stabbed after they were abducted from a bus stop only
1,000 feet (300 meters) from their family home in Aitkenvale in
August 1970.
	   Their naked bodies were found in a dry creek bed south of
Townsville two days later, sparking one of the biggest manhunts in
Australian history.
	   Arthur Stanley Brown, 86, was charged with the murders. A frail
old man, he sat quietly in court as his defense lawyer said he
would strenuously and unequivocally deny the charge.
	   A committal hearing was set for February 10 next year.
	   Brown is also expected to be questioned over the disappearance
of 14-year-old Marilyn Wallman who vanished while cycling to school
in Mackay, 205 miles (330 km) south of Townsville, in March 1972.
	   Her body has never been found.
	   Brown is believed to have worked as a government-employed
carpenter in schools in the Townsville area, including the Mackay
sisters' Aitkenvale school.
	   It is understood a breakthrough in the investigation occurred
when the man's granddaughters supplied information to police.
	   Police on Thursday successfully applied to the Townsville
Magistrates Court to take a DNA sample from Brown.

Swedish teen wins first World Cup race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to udpate with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Anja Paerson, as befits a
kid whose parents are teachers, has shown herself to be a quick
study in ski racing.
	   In only her fifth World Cup start, the 17-year-old rookie from
Sweden stunned a veteran field by coming from 15th place to win a
women's World Cup slalom on Thursday. The margin was a mere .01
seconds over Australia's Zali Steggall.
	   ``My father is a coach and he's been my coach all my life,''
Paerson said. ``My mother is a teacher, so she was my teacher when
I was growing up. Everybody in my life have been teachers or
coaches.''
	   Paerson, a former world junior champion, made her first World
Cup start last March, earning a spot in that season-ending event by
virtue of winning the giant slalom title in the Europa Cup, the
training series for future World Cup racers.
	   ``My coaches told me this year they'd have me start a few World
Cup races,'' said Paerson, who responded with finishes of 13th and
sixth in her first two giant slalom starts this season and 11th in
her previous slalom race.
	   Paerson, as the 15th-place finisher in the first run, had the
advantage of starting first in the afternoon session, and she made
the most of it, putting down a time of 48.82 seconds that was 1.08
seconds faster than anyone else.
	   She completed two runs in a combined 1 minute, 40.84 seconds on
a gray, windy, icy cold day at this resort in the Sierra.
	   ``I just wanted to come down and make points. Winning, I can't
believe it,'' Paerson said. ``I know I was fast but not that fast.
They were two seconds before me.''
	   Steggall, the Olympic slalom bronze medalist last year, held a
1.75-second lead over Paerson after the first run, but even that
huge margin wasn't enough to get her past the Swedish teen.
	   ``It's tough, but it's the way racing goes,'' Steggall said.
``You never know when maybe it'll be your day and you'll be on top.
I had two good runs in really tough conditions, with the wind and
the ruts.''
	   Ingrid Salvenmoser of Austria, seventh after the first run,
claimed third on the day in 1:41.29. She had the second-fastest
afternoon run, but at 49.90 seconds it was over a second slower
than Paerson.
	   Paerson's eyes grew wide when Pernilla Wiberg, a former World
Cup overall champion and the top star of the Swedish team, came in
1.05 seconds behind. As succeeding racers tried and failed to
overcome her time, Paerson stood with Wiberg, shaking her head and
grinning.
	   ``Pernilla told me, `You're going to win,' but I said, `No
way,''' Paerson related. ``I mean, I was two seconds back of the
leaders!''
	   When first-run leader Sabine Egger of Austria finished in
1:41.49, the other Swedish racers cheered and crowded around their
newest star, slapping her on the back.
	   Paerson became the third racer from her little village of
Tarnaby to win a World Cup race. The first and most famous was
Ingemar Stenmark, whose 86 victories still tops all racers in World
Cup history. Stig Strand, who grew up next door to Stenmark and
just a few blocks from Paerson, won two races and shared the 1983
World Cup slalom title with Stenmark.
	   Paerson said she has skied many times with Stenmark while
growing up, absorbing little racing tips from him. Her first
victory mirrored that of her skiing partner, who came from 17th
place for his first slalom victory back in 1974.
	   ``I've skied with Ingemar many times but I've never raced him,''
she said. ``And I don't want to race him. He's still so fast'' 10
years after retiring from the World Cup.
	   After Egger in fourth, Wiberg and Norway's Trine Bakke tied for
fifth. Slovenia's Urska Hrovat, winner of the season-opening slalom
at Park City, Utah two weeks ago, was seventh but was later
disqualified for missing a gate despite a protest lodged by her
coaches. That pushed Germany's Martina Ertl into seventh followed
by the Swiss duo of Sonja Nef and Karin Roten and Austria's Karin
Kollerer.
	   American Kristina Koznick, fourth in the morning run, dropped to
27th after a disastrous second run. It appeared she missed a gate
but the gate judge ruled she made it and thus her time of 1:46.99
stood.

Dollar lower against yen, stocks slip in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the yen
in early trading Friday following an overnight decline on Wall
Street. Japanese stocks fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 117.84 yen in early trading, down 1.39 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 118.60 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency weakened as investors were discouraged by the
continuing decline in U.S. stocks and concerns over the Brazilian
economy, traders said.
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
184.86 points to 8,879.68.
	   The decline also pushed down Japanese stocks with traders saying
Friday's early trading was thin ahead of the weekend.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 83.92 points,
or 0.57 percent, to 14,613.16 in the first 30 minutes of morning
trading. On Thursday, the index had shed 289.54 points, or 1.93
percent.
	   Traders said the largely expected drop in Japan's third quarter
gross domestic product data released Thursday had little impact on
Friday's trading.
	   The Economic Planning Agency said GDP contracted 0.7 percent in
the July-September quarter from the previous quarter for an
annualized drop of 2.6 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 5.21 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,123.68. The
TOPIX fell 18.26 points, or 1.59 percent, the previous day.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
1.070 percent from Thursday's close of 1.090 percent, driving its
price up to 106.31 yen from the previous day's finish of 106.13
yen.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Jakarta's gritty sidewalks are hardly
a place to linger. Yet, thanks to economic hardship, street cafes
are flourishing in the tropical, pollution-soaked capital of 10
million people.
	   Stripped of their jobs by the worst financial crisis in decades,
bank clerks, actors and real estate developers have opened up
dozens of makeshift eateries around the Indonesian capital.
	   Flickering candles or gas lamps beckon from the patios of
private homes or at streetside tarpaulins where menus list oxtail
soup and other Indonesian specialties.
	   Even here the crisis intrudes. Many of the outdoor restaurants
had to shut temporarily during a recent wave of mob rioting and
deadly fighting between antigovernment student protesters and
security forces.
	   Catering to white-collar workers who can no longer afford to eat
at regular restaurants, many simple cafes also offer steaks,
lasagna, milk shakes and cappuccino. The quality, and profits,
vary.
	   ``In a hotel, if you order a steak, you have to pay 85,000
rupiah (dlrs 10). Here, in our cafe, it's only 12,000 (dlrs 1.40)
or 15,000 rupiah (dlrs 1.75),'' said Rudy Salam, a sometime soap
opera actor and former cruise ship steward who runs a cafe named
after himself.
	   Indonesia is one of the Asian countries hardest hit by economic
turmoil, with millions of people sliding into poverty despite huge
injections of international aid. In Jakarta, many restaurants have
been forced to close their doors.
	   Salam's place is one of dozens of outdoor restaurants that
opened in a huge plaza near the city's national monument, a tall
spire of marble topped by a gold-leaf sculpture in the shape of a
flame.
	   During the unrest in early November, soldiers under the tents
put up by the fledgling restaurateurs.
	   Eager to generate jobs in a city where hundreds of thousands of
workers are idle, the local government encouraged the cafe owners
to do business and collects 12 percent of their revenues.
	   The name of one restaurant, the Reform Cafe, recalls the riots
and pro-democracy protests that preceded the May downfall of
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Diners lounge beneath wicker lampshades in a stall lined with
red and white bunting, the colors of the Indonesian flag. The menu
offers ``Riot Juice'' and ``Grilled Democracy Banana.''
	   The work is easy for waiter Roni Zulkifli, an out-of-work truck
driver. As a driver for students who occupied Parliament in the
last days of Suharto's rule, he delivered truckloads of rice and
water to the activists.
	   Near Jakarta's gleaming stock exchange, four unemployed friends
opened the Inside cafe on a house patio beside a traffic-choked
street.
	   It's one more middle-class spinoff on an old tradition in the
archipelago nation of 200 million people: the ``warung,'' or food
stall.
	   ``There's a lot of competition,'' said Tetty Sitindaon, a
waitress who lost her job in the credit department at HongkongBank.
``But I want to make this big.''

Israel sticks to suspension of troop withdrawal after attack on

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In defiance of the United States, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to stick to a decision to
suspend the Wye River peace agreement over what he says are
Palestinian violations.
	   ``We are not to be made fools,'' said an angry Netanyahu, who
won unanimous backing from his Cabinet ministers after they watched
footage of an attack on an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian mob.
	   Ministers watched a video of Wednesday's brutal attack. When the
tape ended, the decision was unanimous: Israel would suspend its
West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Holding Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority responsible for
the attack, on Thursday Netanyahu said: ``I cannot allow myself to
see Israeli citizens being lynched, or about to be lynched by a
crazed mob that received incitement from Palestinian officials.''
	   The latest crisis to plague the Mideast peace accord cast a pall
over the upcoming visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton, just days
before he was to arrive in the region to oversee implementation of
the second phase of the deal he helped broker.
	   The Israeli decision appeased hard-liners in Netanyahu's
coalition whose support for the premier had been waning since he
signed the latest accord to cede more war-captured land.
	   Ahead of a crucial parliament vote Monday over whether to call
early elections, the decision to freeze the peace process has
brought right-wingers back into Netanyahu's fold.
	   Members of the National Religious Party said they would now vote
with Netanyahu and block attempts to end his administration
prematurely.
	   Supporters of the bill said they might delay the vote because
they no longer have a majority.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation once
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce
a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin rejected the Israeli
conditions, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   Meanwhile, violence erupted for a second straight day in three
Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem following the stabbing death of a
Palestinian man in the city.
	   Palestinian rioters threw stones at police and Israeli
motorists.
	   Six Israeli police officers and three Israeli civilians were
injured by rocks. One Palestinian was struck by a rubber bullet
fired by police to disperse stone throwers on the Mount of Olives,
and 19 stone-throwers were arrested.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   Hours later, an Israeli soldier and civilian were attacked by a
Palestinian mob, fresh from an anti-Israel demonstration near the
West Bank town of Ramallah.

Mexicans can call a bribe by any name, so long as they pay up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIKO PRICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ They call it ``the little coffee,'' ``the
stuffing,'' ``the bite.'' Policemen ask for their ``soda,''
journalists for their ``squash'' and politicians for their
``bone.''
	   There are plenty of words in Mexico's lexicon for the corruption
that runs through its society from top to bottom.
	   No one has a real estimate of how much money changes hands. Drug
dealers pay billions to keep their operations running smoothly.
Pretty much anyone who has driven a car in Mexico has been hit up
for a bribe by a cop, and anyone needing government paperwork has
been offered two ways to do it: the easy way or the slow way.
	   Corruption is so rooted and pervasive that many people see
nothing wrong with it. A continuum runs from tipping a waiter to
bribing a politician, with no clear line separating what's
acceptable and what's not.
	   That's slowly starting to change. With a political opening that
has let opposition parties govern on the local and state levels for
the first time in 70 years, abuse of power is being placed on the
political agenda.
	   On Monday, 44 police officers were arrested in a sting in Mexico
City on warrants that dated back as far as 1991. The charges
included rape, robbery, murder and abuse of authority.
	   City attorney general Samuel del Villar credited Mayor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas with the first serious attempt to clean up
Mexico's police. Cardenas belongs to the center-left opposition,
the Democratic revolution party.
	   But even leaders of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party are becoming more serious about corruption.
	   ``I share the indignation of all Mexicans at the inefficiency
and the corruption which all too frequently exist in our security
forces,'' President Ernesto Zedillo said in August, his voice
choking with anger as he announced a ``national crusade'' against
crime and corruption.
	   In many cities, new leaders with few ties to the old ones are
discovering age-old practices so brazen that they marvel they
weren't noticed before, and they are beginning to tackle the graft
that bites deep into the Mexican economy.
	   But on most levels, corruption continues as before. Police take
bribes rather than write tickets, journalists accept money for
writing favorable articles, and government purchasers pocket a
percentage of any contract.
	   And many believe that will never change.
	   It's rush hour in Mexico City, and a bus spreads a cloud of
exhaust over the seafood tacos and cocktails at Hildaro Vazquez's
food stand. With a tarp covering two plastic tables, it isn't much
of a restaurant, but it's the kind of business that keeps millions
employed in what may be the world's largest city.
	   Every Sunday, Vazquez pays 100 pesos, or dlrs 10, to the local
``leader,'' a woman who collects bribes from 300 such stands in the
neighborhood of La Viga. She relays part of her take to government
officials and police commanders, who in turn look the other way.
	   For Vazquez, it's a good arrangement.
	   ``She goes to the borough hall to pay them off,'' he said. ``I
don't know how much; maybe half? I don't know how she works it, but
I've never had any problem.''
	   Asked how much it would cost to register his stall legally,
Vazquez stared back in silence. To him it was a stupid question.
Pressed for an answer, he finally grinned, revealing two
gold-capped teeth. ``You can't,'' he said. ``There are no
permits.''
	   Still the signs of change are evident. Last December, Cardenas
took office as elected mayor of Mexico City after 70 years of
regents appointed by the ruling party. For the first time, someone
other than the person who kept the books was reviewing them. What
they are finding isn't pretty.
	   City purchasing contracts are signed at unbelievably high
prices; presumably the excess is split between buyer and seller.
City revenues are minuscule because people bribe officials rather
than pay fees and fines. Protection rackets are city-sponsored,
with enforcers on the street _ cops, inspectors _ giving a cut to
their superiors, who in turn give their superiors a cut.
	   One of the city's 16 boroughs did away with construction
inspectors' graft by writing clearer specifications and making
builders apply for permits at the borough office instead of having
inspectors visit the sites.
	   The result: In the first five months of the year, revenues for
that division rose to 6.2 million pesos (dlrs 620,000) from 2.9
million pesos (dlrs 290,000) for the first five months of 1997.
	   ``All that money went into the pockets of corrupt officials,''
borough head Jorge Legorreta said.
	   He said many of the crooked inspectors were fired, but some of
them went on collecting bribes from builders who were unaware that
the inspectors had been dismissed.
	   Overall, about 2,000 government workers were punished for
corruption in the first 10 months of the Cardenas administration,
according to city comptroller Gaston Luken Garza. They paid fines
totaling 380 million pesos (dlrs 38 million). In the comparable
period last year, Luken said, about 1,140 people were punished,
generating fines totaling 5.6 million pesos (dlrs 560,000).
	   That's a 75 percent increase in punishments _ and a 6,700
percent increase in fines.

	   Still, even Luken acknowledges that most graft goes unpunished.
When a cop is caught taking a bribe, in many cases he gets off with
a warning if he gives the money back, said Lourdes Solano, a lawyer
in a city office that takes complaints against police officers.
	   ``If he's willing to pay back the money, that minimizes his
degree of responsibility,'' she said.
	   Her bosses refused to let a journalist sit in on a confrontation
with a corrupt officer, saying that would discourage an amicable
arrangement.
	   Paco Ignacio Taibo II, a prominent writer, makes what for a
Mexican is an extraordinary claim: He has never paid a bribe.
	   It hasn't been easy. He has been dragged into police stations at
least five times, has waited two months for paperwork he could have
had in two hours.
	   ``I've invested a lot of time and effort,'' he said. ``It isn't
easy to be honest in this country.''
	   But Taibo, a close ally of Cardenas, said that's starting to
change in Mexico City.
	   He pointed to a diseased tree on the sidewalk outside his
apartment. He said he called the city to cut it down last year.
When the workers who showed up demanded 300 pesos (dlrs 30), he
refused to pay.
	   A few months ago, he called again, and the workers silently
dealt with the tree.
	   ``They were the same men who had come before,'' he said. ``I
just stood there smiling at them.''
	   If it's hard to live in Mexico without paying a bribe, it's even
harder to do business without at least a little dirty business.
	   Most stores will ask customers if they need a receipt. If so,
they add 15 percent sales tax. If not, no tax is paid and the
government is none the wiser.
	   On a larger scale, the graft is more complex, as shown in the
bidding for a typical construction project, according to two
distributors who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The company opens the bidding and competing suppliers turn over
their bids to the purchasing agent. The agent talks to the
suppliers and asks by how much _ 5 percent, 10 percent _ they are
willing to inflate their bid and give him in cash.
	   The bidders, meanwhile, pay bribes to find out the amount of the
other bids, and make theirs a smidgen lower.
	   The agent picks the supplier, has the supplier raise his bid to
cover his take, then fakes the other bids to seem higher. He makes
the purchase and pockets his percentage.
	   Often, the company then rewrites the contract, putting down a
lower cost to pay less tax.
	   That process is repeated both in private and government
contracts, the suppliers said. Military purchasers almost always
require a 10 percent payoff.
	   At the high end, in October Swiss investigators seized more than
dlrs 100 million in accounts owned by Raul Salinas, brother of
Mexico's former president. They said the money was drug bribes he
collected during his brother's administration, when he worked at a
government food agency.
	   Raul Salinas, who is imprisoned in Mexico, denies the charges.
	   Despite the attacks on corruption, Mexico continues to function
with a mentality that bypasses the government while bribing
government officials to look the other way.
	   The government estimates that 45 percent of Mexico's workers are
unregistered, making up what is known as the informal economy.
	   Mexico City has 3.2 million cars but only 2 million people have
drivers' licenses, according to city officials. The others slip a
little money to police officers who stop them.
	   According to Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the interior secretary
and overseer of national security, only 2.5 percent of all crimes
lead to an arrest _ and no one knows how many lead to conviction.
Much of the problem, many believe, is that police are slow to
investigate cases unless they stand to profit.
	   It is estimated that only half of all crimes are reported, which
Labastida blames on ``a lack of credibility of the justice
system.'' He acknowledges that there are police who collude with
criminals and commit crimes themselves.
	   On Monday, police had to use a trick _ inviting officers to a
training course at the police academy _ to serve arrest warrants on
at least 44 officers. Authorities acknowledged it was just the
beginning of what would be a major, long-term crackdown.
	   For many police officers, graft is an important part of their
income. Mexico City cops make an average of 3,500 pesos (dlrs 350)
a month; officers elsewhere often make less.
	   ``We are coming into the Christmas season, a traditional time
for the police to increase street extortion,'' Mexico City security
consulting firm Problem Solvers wrote in a newsletter dated late
November.
	   ``Accordingly, it behooves all of us to exercise more prudence
in the street. ... Do not give the police the opportunity to take
advantage of you.''

American running in Thailand against child prostitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Hoping to heighten awareness about the
problem of child prostitution, a 46-year-old American is attempting
to be the first person to run Thailand north to south, a newspaper
said Friday.
	   Butch Colvin, an ex-U.S. navy officer from Oklahoma, set off
from the town of Mai Sai along the border with Myanmar on Nov. 22.
He plans to reach the southernmost point in Thailand, on the border
with Malaysia, by February.
	   The Bangkok Post says Colvin has been rising before sunset and
running around 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) each day, stopping when
the temperatures begin to soar.
	   The newspaper says drivers sound their horns and police stop
traffic and wave as Colvin runs by.
	   ``People are asking what I'm doing. When I tell them I'm trying
to heighten awareness of child prostitution worldwide they shake my
hand,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Thailand attracts large numbers of foreign men seeking sex with
children. A number have been arrested in recent years.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ An 86-year-old man on Friday denied
he committed one of Australia's most infamous crimes _ the
abduction and sex murder of two young sisters in north Queensland
almost 30 years ago.
	   Sisters Judith Mackay, 7, and Susan Mackay, 5, were raped,
strangled and stabbed after they were abducted from a bus stop only
1,000 feet (300 meters) from their family home in Aitkenvale in
August 1970.
	   Their naked bodies were found in a dry creek bed south of
Townsville two days later, sparking one of the biggest manhunts in
Australian history.
	   Arthur Stanley Brown, 86, was charged with the murders. A frail
old man, he sat quietly in court as his defense lawyer said he
would strenuously and unequivocally deny the charge.
	   A committal hearing was set for February 10 next year.
	   Brown is also expected to be questioned over the disappearance
of 14-year-old Marilyn Wallman who vanished while cycling to school
in Mackay, 205 miles (330 km) south of Townsville, in March 1972.
	   Her body has never been found.
	   Brown is believed to have worked as a government-employed
carpenter in schools in the Townsville area, including the Mackay
sisters' Aitkenvale school.
	   It is understood a breakthrough in the investigation occurred
when the man's granddaughters supplied information to police.
	   Police on Thursday successfully applied to the Townsville
Magistrates Court to take a DNA sample from Brown.

Legionnaires' disease bacteria found in Buckingham Palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Traces of the potentially fatal Legionnaires'
disease bacteria were found in the Buckingham Palace water supply,
The Sun reported on Friday.
	   The bacteria, which causes pneumonia-like symptoms, was
discovered during routine checks of Queen Elizabeth II's London
residence on Oct. 13, a palace spokesman said, confirming The Sun's
story.
	   ''It was dealt with immediately in the normal way by flushing
out the system,'' the spokesman said, speaking with customary
anonymity. ``Another sample was taken and 10 days later the
all-clear was given.''
	   He said the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, remained at
the palace throughout the scare because the bacteria was only found
in an isolated section of the water system. The palace, built in
1705 and bought by King George III in 1762, has 78 bathrooms and
miles of water pipes.
	   ''Nobody had to flee Buckingham Palace and there were no
reported cases of the disease,'' the spokesman said.
	   Legionnaires' disease is caused by inhaling a common bacteria,
Legionella, often found in moist environments such as
air-conditioning cooling towers, hot water tanks, whirlpool spas
and humidifiers.
	   The pneumonia-like symptoms include fever, headache, shortness
of breath and chest pain. Most at risk are heavy smokers, the
elderly and those with weakened immune systems.
	   The illness was first documented at an American Legion
convention in Philadelphia in July 1976, when 34 died and 221
became sick.
	   During the scare, all 335 palace staff were put on alert to
check with doctors immediately if they came down with any symptoms,
The Sun reported.
	   ''We were all scared,'' The Sun, Britain's largest selling daily
tabloid, quoted an unnamed palace source as saying. ''Any one of us
from the queen down could have been breathing in those bugs.''
	   In February 1997, parts of the palace became infested with mice
and beetles and the palace had to call in a commercial pest control
company.

European central banks cuts key interest rate for euro launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Making their first collective decision
about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common
currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates in a surprise move that won
market confidence.
	   Ten of the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped
their key interest rate to 3 percent on Thursday, with Portugal
making the most significant plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made
the smallest cut, from 3.2 percent.
	   The exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. It is
expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is
launched.
	   Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the
groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected
rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent
before the cut, now 3 percent.
	   However, interest rate levels had become an issue with
center-left governments in Germany and France pushing for cuts to
spur growth and combat unemployment, stuck at 10.9 percent in the
nations adopting the euro.
	   The head of the European Central Bank that will set monetary
policy for the euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday
suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets to create
jobs, and not pressure him to cut rates.
	   The remarks in Brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave no
hint that a rate drop was imminent, but made clear his resistance
to political pressure was as strong as ever.
	   So strong, in fact, that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said
he had feared the bank would delay the decision.
	   ``What had been feared was that, in order to prove its
independence, the ECB would go against its own analysis and would
wait longer, which would have been nonsensical,'' Zalm said.
	   Hans Tietmeyer, who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB
is modeled, hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in
the new currency, dampened by global economic crises and Europe's
worsening outlook.
	   ``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the
current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,''
Tietmeyer said.
	   The cuts seemed to have the desired impact. Frankfurt's main
index closed up 2.1 percent, while France's was up 1.8 percent. The
cuts also boosted markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even
Britain, which is not among the nations launching the euro.
	   By making it cheaper to borrow money, rate cuts can lead to more
investment and new businesses, making it less worthwhile to save
and inducing people to spend. That expands the economy.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Kitt injured in spill

<TEXT>
	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ Former World Championship medalist AJ
Kitt underwent surgery Thursday evening after breaking his right
wrist during a training run in the first leg of the Ford Downhill
Series.
	   Kitt had surgery at the Aspen Valley Hospital. He was expected
to be sidelined for six to eight weeks, said Henry Schneidman,
president of Eclipse Television and Sports Marketing, which
established the downhill series.
	   ``From what we understand, he also possibly has a dislocated rib
and lacerations on his leg,'' Schneidman said.
	   Kitt injured himself in ``a bad crash'' early Thursday
afternoon, Schneidman said. ``He flew about 75 yards.''
	   He said Kitt's wife was flying to Aspen from their home in
Jacksonville, Fla.
	   Schneidman said two-time World Champion Kyle Rassmussen from
California will take Kitt's place as Tommy Moe's teammate on the
U.S. team.
	   More training was scheduled Friday, with the race starting
Saturday.
	   Kitt, 30, the downhill bronze medalist in the 1993 World
Championships, resigned in June from World Cup skiing. He is the
only American Alpine skier to compete in four Olympics.
	   He and Moe, the 1994 Olympic downhill champion and silver
medalist in super-G, left the U.S. Ski Team to turn professional,
Schneidman said. The Ford Downhill Series was to be Kitt's first
competition.

Jordan rejoins labor talks with season in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; sides still meeting as of 8:45 p.m. EST &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Jordan was at the bargaining table
Thursday when National Basketball Association labor talks resumed.
Whether his magic touch can save the season remains to be seen.
	   His presence was promising, however, since his agent said he
wouldn't get involved again until discussions got serious.
	   ``His understanding was that a new proposal was going to be
made'' by the owners, agent David Falk said, ``and he wanted to be
there to listen to it. You can read into it that he's continuing to
be involved and supportive of the union leadership.''
	   During the first few hours of one of the longest sessions yet,
commissioner David Stern made another plea to save the season.
	   Also, according to a player who was in the meeting, Madison
Square Garden president David Checketts sparred with union lawyers,
and Jordan did not get as involved as he did when he attended Oct.
28.
	   The sides were still meeting in mid-evening, but no formal
proposals were being put forward.
	   Jordan left early in the evening, and returned about three hours
later. He did not comment as he entered a hotel across from NBA
headquarters, where the league and union were working to end the
five-month dispute that threatens to wipe out the entire season.
	   The sides spent the first two hours merely ``feeling each other
out,'' Stern said, then went back to work after a lunch break. The
bargaining session was the first in 13 days with both full
negotiating committees in attendance.
	   If the owners and players can't come up with a solution in the
next few weeks, the entire 1998-99 season likely will be canceled.
	   Jordan's arrival marked the first time he had joined the talks
since Oct. 28, when he spent about 8 1/2 hours at the bargaining
table and tried to help broker a deal.
	   The sides met one other time since then, on Nov. 20, and called
it their most productive session to date. But things quickly
unraveled.
	   Pressure for a settlement and panic over the fate of the season
increased in recent days, with former union president Isiah Thomas
suggesting that Billy Hunter and Patrick Ewing be replaced as the
union's lead negotiators.
	   ``The one message I know he (Jordan) is delivering emphatically
is that people like Isiah can sit on the sidelines and criticize,
but when you are in the game it's harder,'' Falk said.
	   The first order of major business was to decide whether to
continue negotiating under the framework that the sides had
discussed in two previous sessions _ a six- or seven-year agreement
with a complicated ``escrow tax'' system in the final three or four
years.
	   The proposals put on the table Nov. 20 would include players
having 10 or 15 percent of their paychecks withheld if spending on
overall player salaries exceeded a targeted percentage of revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John McEnroe underlined his mastery of seniors
tennis with a 6-1, 6-4 beating of Guillermo Vilas Thursday in the
opening round of the ATP Seniors competition at Olympia.
	   Winner of four events in a row, McEnroe breezed through the
first set in 25 minutes and was 3-1 up in the second before Vilas,
winner of four Grand Slam events in his career, fought back.
	   The 46-year-old Argentine won four games in a row to lead 4-3
before McEnroe responded with three to take the match.
	   ``I wasn't that happy with my game,'' McEnroe said.
	   ``I started to fiddle around a bit in the second set to give the
crowd something to shout about but I couldn't afford to do that on
the main tour.''
	   Yannick Noah saved four match points before beating fellow
Frenchman Guy Forget 6-7 (7-2), 6-4, 13-11 in the opening match.
	   The one hour, 25-minute match went into a tie-break third set,
which lasts a minimum 10 points but went to 24.
	   Noah saved two match points at 9-7 down, one more at 10-9 and
another at 11-10 before winning on his first match point at 12-11
with a smash.
	   The eight-man competition is split into two groups.
	   McEnroe is grouped with Vilas, Henri Leconte and Mansour
Bahrami, while Noah and Forget are in with Pat Cash and John Lloyd.
	   Bahrami beat Leconte 7-5, 6-7 (7-5), 10-6 and Cash downed Lloyd
6-1, 7-5 in other matches played Thursday..
	   Five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg was scheduled to play
but pulled out last week through injury.
	   McEnroe has won four consecutive events, putting him ahead of
Jimmy Connors at the top of the senior rankings. Connors has not
played in the European events.

Italian president begins visit to Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's one-million strong
Italian community will be out in force from Saturday when Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro begins a seven-day official visit to
Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney.
	   Australia's Italian community is second in numbers only to those
of British descent.
	   Federal and state political leaders on both sides are keen to be
seen with the first Italian head of state to visit Australia since
the Bicentenary in 1978.
	   Scalfaro arrives in Melbourne on Saturday. Over the next two
days he will be feted at a state reception thrown by Victoria state
Premier Jeff Kennett, open a new Italian education center and meet
the local Italian community.
	   In Canberra early next week, Parliament will hold an official
luncheon in his honor. President Scalfaro will talk with Prime
Minister John Howard, opposition leader Kim Beazley, the
Governor-General and will meet Canberra's Italian community.
	   A similar itinerary is scheduled for Sydney at the end of the
week with another state reception, this time thrown by New South
Wales Premier Bob Carr, and meetings with the local Italian
community.
	   Italy's ambassador to Australia Giovanni Castellaneta, said the
visit was formal recognition of the importance of Australia's
Italian community, and the relationship between Australia and
Italy.
	   ``The cultural link which unites the Italo-Australian community
to Italy and which allows second and third generations of Italians
to rediscover the authentic Italy _ does not diminish the interest
of the sons and daughters of Italians in the Australian way of life
and politics,'' he said.
	   ``On the contrary, it provides a store of knowledge without
equal and inspirational examples in areas such as industrial
innovation, family values etc., on which to base their own lives
and, by doing so, contributing to the Australian society.''
	   Italy is now Australia's 13th biggest trading partner and third
biggest in Europe with two way trade worth 3.5 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.2 billion) a year and growing strongly.

	   BORSIPPA, Iraq (AP) _ After 20 years of digging, Austrian
archaeologists say they've determined the layout of a Mesopotamian
ziggurat built by King Nebuchadnezzar about 2,500 years ago _ and
believe it is modeled on the Tower of Babel.
	   Archaeologists say that the Temple of Borsippa, 120 kilometers
(75 miles) south of Baghdad, was a center of learning in ancient
Mesopotamia. The 70-meter (230-foot) temple tower was dedicated to
Nabu, the god of science and learning and the king's protector.
	   ``It must have looked really fantastic,'' said Helga
Trenkwalder, leader of the seven-member Austrian team excavating
the site, which contains remnants of blue-glazed brick, black
layers made of bitumen and millions of mud bricks.
	   The seven-story temple was probably the best preserved of many
ziggurats built by Nebuchadnezzar, said Wilfrid Allinger-Csollich
of the University of Innsbruck. The king is perhaps best remembered
for ordering the destruction of the ancient Jewish temple in
Jerusalem during his 40-year rule.
	   The team found several tablets and a foundation stone that say
the king modeled the Borsippa tower after the Tower of Babel _
whose foundation is 12 kilometers (7 miles) to the north.
	   One text quotes Nebuchadnezzar saying Nabu's tower should reach
the skies and be no less grand than Babel, which was dedicated to
the god Marduk.
	   For 20 years, the archaeological team has shoveled thousands of
tons of debris to uncover most of the 52-meter-tall (172-foot-tall)
remains of the ziggurat.
	   They used equally basic means to determine the original height
of the tower constructed atop a 90-by-90-meter (297-by-297 foot)
foundation.
	   ``We just counted the number of bricks,'' said
Allinger-Csollich.
	   The tower's square bricks were 33 centimeters (13 1/4 inches) on
each side and 8 centimeters (3 1/4 inches) deep.
	   More than 1 million fired bricks were used for the first level's
meter-tall (3-foot-tall) outer wall, Allinger-Csollich said. Each
level was filled with tens of millions of unfired bricks held in
place with beams of cedar from Lebanon.
	   Their picture of the temple's exterior is almost complete. The
first two levels were covered with bitumen and were black. The
third, fourth and fifth were decorated with blue-glazed bricks and
possibly adorned with bulls and lions.
	   The sixth and seventh level, close to the sanctuary, were wholly
made of mud brick.
	   ``For cultic purposes, the Mesopotamians thought mud to be the
purest of substances,'' Trenkwalder said.
	   She said that Nabu's residence was on top and had rooms for
servants and priests ``and wings for his wife, Tachmitum, his
children and daughters.''
	   Allinger-Csollich said texts and detail from the excavations
indicate that a tower of ``greater dimensions than ours existed in
Babylon.''
	   Iraq has another impressive ziggurat in Ur, which was built in
about 2500 B.C. But Nawal al-Mutawali of the Iraq Museum said
Borsippa's remains are ``greater, higher and more elegant.''
	   Dony Youkhanna, assistant director of Iraq's Antiquities
Department, said the government is trying to persuade the United
Nations to declare Borsippa a world heritage site to give it
international protection.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Ten civilians seized at a guerrilla
roadblock were freed Thursday during clashes between rebels and
government troops in northern Colombia, the army said.
	   Five hostages remained in the hands of the rebel National
Liberation Army, which funds its operations largely through
kidnappings.
	   No deaths or injuries were reported in the fighting in rural La
Gloria, 300 miles (500 kilometers) north of the capital, Bogota.
	   Troops intercepted the rebels while they were transporting 15
people seized Wednesday, said army spokesman Luis Enrique
Hernandez. Ten of the hostages, including three children, were left
behind when the 150-rebel unit retreated. Authorities did not
identify the remaining hostages.
	   The rebels often set up random roadblocks, hoping to catch rich
Colombians or foreigners who may garner large ransoms.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Authorities are trying a new
weapon in their crackdown on prostitution in one Brazilian town:
shame.
	   Police officers in Novo Hamburgo, 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers)
southwest of Rio, will tell the families of brothel users about
their loved one's illicit activities, according to the O Jornal do
Brasil daily newspaper.
	   ``Families should know what these individuals are doing,'' local
police chief Flavio Agenor Ferraz de Amorim was quoted as saying.
	   The police policy in Novo Hamburgo, which took effect Thursday,
has upset prostitutes who say most of their customers are married
men who will now stay away, the newspaper said.
	   A local human rights group was quoted as saying the policy
violates privacy rights.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's attorney general wants to
suspend all foreign adoptions of Guatemalan children after
complaints that unscrupulous lawyers are taking advantage of poor
women.
	   Carlos Garcia Regas urged the public magistrate and the Supreme
Court on Thursday to suspend adoptions while new regulations are
drafted to better protect birth parents.
	   Human rights groups have denounced widespread abuses in
adoptions in Guatemala, saying lawyers coerce women into giving up
babies in return for fees that average dlrs 15,000.
	   In a nation of 10 million people, the attorney general's office
reviews between 170 and 200 adoption cases a month, almost all
involving foreigners. This year, the U.S. Embassy expects Americans
alone to adopt 1,000 Guatemalan children.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Logging has seriously damaged 13 butterfly
sanctuaries in central Mexico and could lead to the deaths of many
of the Monarchs that migrate each fall from Canada, an
environmental group warned Thursday.
	   The Group of 100 urged the Mexican government to halt the
logging of Mexican fir trees in the Michoacan state sanctuaries.
	   It said local authorities reported that five to 10 logging
trucks carried lumber each day from the area near El Rosario
sanctuary. The tree loss leaves the Monarchs vulnerable to sunlight
and cold, the group said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OAXACA CITY, Mexico (AP) _ A land dispute in the southern state
of Oaxaca this week left at least nine people dead, local
authorities said Thursday.
	   Justino Diaz Perez, mayor of Santo Domingo Teojomulco, said
three men from his town were killed in the gun battle Tuesday.
Eight were wounded and five were missing, the mayor said.
	   In neighboring San Lorenzo Texmelucan, 50 miles (80 kilometers)
southwest of Oaxaca, the president of communal property, Felix
Martinez, said six villagers had died, four were hurt and two were
missing.
	   The two villages have fought for 60 years over 40 acres (16
hectares) of land. In the past 30 years, about 130 people have been

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ More than 300 people remain missing three
months after floods devastated the southern state of Chiapas'
coast, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The government's official death count relating to the week of
rain and flooding in Chiapas is 177, although estimates vary
widely. Chiapas state Secretary Rodolfo Soto Monzon said another
331 were missing, the Mexico City daily La Jornada reported.
	   The state government was planning to place newspaper ads to try
to contact those still believed missing, Soto Monzon was quoted as
saying.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Carlos Alvarez, a leading
opposition politician, will be tapped as the vice-presidential
candidate for the Alliance coalition's 1999 ticket, local media
reported Thursday.
	   The official announcement is expected on Monday, leading daily
Clarin said, after a series of meetings between high-ranking
members of the Radical Civic Union and Frepaso parties which form
Argentina's largest opposition group, known as the Alliance.
	   Alavarez is one of the principal directors of the center-left
Frepaso party, made up of former Peronists, socialists and
Christian democrats.
	   Buenos Aires mayor Fernando De la Rua won Sunday's primary
elections to become the coalition's presidential candidate and is
widely-regarded as the early favorite in the 1999 race.
	   The Peronist party of President Carlos Menem's is scheduled to
chose its candidate in primaries scheduled for April. Buenos Aires
governor Eduardo Duahlde is largely considered as the front-runner.

 &UR; Faldo gets timely advice from golf legend &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Englishman Nick Faldo, taking advice
from an Australian golf legend, overcame his first-round troubles
to shoot a 3-under-par 69 Friday at the Australian Open.
	   Faldo, following up a disappointing 77 on Thursday, was 2-under
after the front nine that included a run of consecutive birdies on
the sixth, seventh and eighth holes.
	   After his Thursday round, Faldo said he was given some advice by
Norman Von Nida, who won the Australian Open in 1950, 1952 and 1953
and finished second three other times.
	   ``He said the grip pressure in my left hand was too tight, and
gave me a little putting lesson as well,'' Faldo said. ``He told me
to put my right hand stronger to get my right elbow and right
shoulder in the right place.''
	   ``I practiced last night and it was like a new day today.''
	   Faldo bogeyed the toughest hole at Royal Adelaide _ the par-4
15th _ for his only blemish on the back nine, then finished with
birdies on 17 and 18.
	   American Fred Couples, who will play for the U.S. team in next
week's Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne, double-bogeyed the 14th
and 15th holes Friday en route to his second consecutive 76, giving
him a two-round total of 152, a stroke higher than the projected
cut of 7-over 151.
	   Australian Anthony Edwards shot a 2-under 70 to be among the
first finishers of the day in blustery conditions and under cloudy
skies.
	   Australian Stuart Appleby, the overnight leader by a stroke over
a fivesome that included Greg Norman, had just begun his round
Friday, while Norman had three early bogeys after a 70 Thursday.
	   Norman is playing in his first 72-hole event since coming back
from shoulder surgery.
	   England's Justin Rose, bidding to make his first cut in his
ninth attempt at a professional tournament, was also a late starter
after shooting an opening-round 72. As an amateur, Rose finished
tied for fourth in this year's British Open.
	   On Thursday over the 6,565-meter (7,178-yard) par-72 course,
only 13 players in the 126-man field broke par.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia on Friday welcomed the
embattled Indonesian government's decision to hold elections next
year and promised to help computerize the electoral rolls to ensure
fair and democratic balloting.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said here he hoped the
election would settle a country facing mounting social unrest.
	   ``We welcome the news of an election in Indonesia which we hope
will create a degree of certainty and predictability,'' Downer
said.
	   Indonesian parliamentary elections will be held June 7 and the
nation's highest legislative assembly, the People's Consultative
Assembly, will elect a new president Aug. 29.
	   Downer said Australia will assist with the implementation of a
computerized system of electoral rolls to ensure Indonesia's 202
million people voted in a fair and democratic election.
	   ``This election is likely to be the most democratic Indonesia
has had since the mid-1950s so we very much welcome the advent of
genuine democracy there,'' he said.
	   A democratic government would make Indonesia an ``easier
neighbor to deal with'' than under former President Suharto's
32-year authoritarian rule.
	   There were no immediate plans to evacuate Australians from
Jakarta despite reports of increasing violence, he said.
	   ``We have contingency plans in place should this be the case but
we are monitoring the situation and the plans have not been
upgraded or changed since May when we evacuated Australians,''
Downer said.

Finance chief casts doubt on Japan achieving economic target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Amid more gloomy news on the economy, Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed doubt Friday that Japan will
achieve its economic target for this fiscal year.
	   The comments came a day after the government announced the
Japanese economy had shrunk at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent in
the July-September quarter.
	   Miyazawa told reporters ``it will be a bit difficult'' to
achieve the government's target for a contraction of 1.8 percent
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.
	   In order to achieve that target, Japan's real gross domestic
product would have to expand by 0.7 percent in both the
October-December and January-March quarters, Miyazawa said.
	   Thursday's quarterly growth announcement marked the first time
the economy has contracted for four consecutive quarters since the
government started compiling growth statistics in 1955.
	   Miyazawa also ruled out more steps to boost Japan's economy in
response to the decision Thursday by European Union governments to
slash interest rates.
	   All countries adopting a single European currency next year cut
their key official interest rates to 3.0 percent, except for Italy,
whose discount rate remained at 3.50 percent.
	   Japan's government recently implemented a record 24 trillion yen
(dlrs 201 billion) economic stimulus package in an attempt to lift
the country out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   The troubles afflicting the world's second-largest economy have
stifled domestic demand, and many business are being starved for
cash as debt-ridden banks scale back on lending.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A bomb scare further terrorized
Australia on Friday as police found a 27th letter bomb in a Sydney
post office and a train was halted and evacuated for a search.
	   The bomb at the Darlinghurst post office in Sydney was detonated
safely by police shortly after it was discovered at 8:15 a.m. The
train, also in Sydney, continued its journey when no suspicious
package was found aboard.
	   Police, ambulance and fire crews were also called to the Penrith
branch of the Australian Taxation Office in western Sydney after
the discovery of another suspicious package.
	   Government and business offices as far apart as Melbourne, on
Australia's southeast coast and its northernmost capital of Darwin,
as well as the Centrepoint Tower shopping center and office tower
in Sydney were evacuated Thursday in a series of false alarms.
	   ``It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I suppose,
is a modern day reality in every society,'' Prime Minister John
Howard said Friday on radio.
	   ``We've been refreshingly freer of it than most other societies
and I hope that continues to be the case.
	   ``But unhinged human nature can become a very lethal weapon if
it's triggered off by particular events,'' he said.
	   Twenty-seven potentially lethal parcel bombs have been found at
addresses in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and the Gold Coast over
the past 48 hours.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also were targeted.
	   Police have named Colin George Dunstan, 43, a suspended tax
officer who allegedly got embroiled in an affair with a woman at
the tax office in Canberra and has been involved in a sexual
harassment case involving her, as the prime suspect and have
launched a nationwide hunt for him.
	   Only the first of the letter bombs has caused any injury.
	   Two postal workers, at the Canberra mail sorting center were
slightly injured, after one of them threw one of the letter bombs
into a mail bag early Wednesday morning.
	   Police say they cannot be sure there are no more letter bombs in
Australia's mail system, which is presently overflowing with
Christmas parcels.
	   They have urged people throughout Australia to be cautious if
they see suspicious parcels in their mail.

Israel sticks to suspension of troop withdrawal after attack on

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In defiance of the United States, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised the Wye River peace
agreement will remain suspended for now, after what he said were
Palestinian violations.
	   ``We are not to be made fools,'' said an angry Netanyahu, who
won unanimous backing from his Cabinet ministers after they watched
footage of an attack on an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian mob.
	   Ministers watched a video of Wednesday's brutal attack. When the
tape ended, the decision was unanimous: Israel would suspend its
West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Holding Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority responsible for
the attack, on Thursday Netanyahu said: ``I cannot allow myself to
see Israeli citizens being lynched, or about to be lynched by a
crazed mob that received incitement from Palestinian officials.''
	   The latest crisis to plague the Mideast peace accord cast a pall
over the upcoming visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton, just days
before he was to arrive in the region to oversee implementation of
the second phase of the deal he helped broker.
	   The Israeli decision appeased hard-liners in Netanyahu's
coalition whose support for the premier had been waning since he
signed the latest accord to cede more war-captured land.
	   Ahead of a crucial parliament vote Monday over whether to call
early elections, the decision to freeze the peace process has
brought right-wingers back into Netanyahu's fold.
	   Members of the National Religious Party said they would now vote
with Netanyahu and block attempts to end his administration
prematurely.
	   Supporters of the bill said they might delay the vote because
they no longer have a majority.
	   Netanyahu said he would only resume implementation once
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce
a state in May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin rejected the Israeli
conditions, saying the Wye River peace agreement ``should be
implemented as signed.''
	   Meanwhile, violence erupted for a second straight day in three
Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem following the stabbing death of a
Palestinian man in the city.
	   Palestinian rioters threw stones at police and Israeli
motorists.
	   Six Israeli police officers and three Israeli civilians were
injured by rocks. One Palestinian was struck by a rubber bullet
fired by police to disperse stone throwers on the Mount of Olives,
and 19 stone-throwers were arrested.
	   The latest cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an
Arab street cleaner was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish
extremist, in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   Hours later, an Israeli soldier and civilian were attacked by a
Palestinian mob, fresh from an anti-Israel demonstration near the
West Bank town of Ramallah.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks fall at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday
morning, pressured by concern over Brazil's economy and an
overnight decline on Wall Street. Japanese stocks continued to lose
ground.
	   The dollar bought 118.37 yen at late morning, down 0.86 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
118.60 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 159.87 points,
or 1.09 percent, to 14,537.21 points at the end of the morning
session. On Thursday, the index had shed 289.54 points, or 1.93
percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar weakened as investors were
discouraged by the continuing decline in U.S. stocks and
Wednesday's defeat in the Brazilian Congress of an important
government austerity measure, traders said.
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
184.86 points to 8,879.68, largely affected by the Brazilian stock
market's plunge following the move by Congress.
	   On the stock market, share prices were lower as selling was led
by international blue chip shares in line with an overnight fall on
Wall Street.
	   Trading remained quiet as investors retreated to the sidelines
to watch what impact a coordinated rate cut by major European
central banks Thursday will have on the global economy, traders
said.
	   ``Trade is thin because there are many factors in Japan and
overseas working to keep investors out of the market,'' said
Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor information group at
Kankaku Securities.
	   On the domestic front, market players were monitoring policy
coordination between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
opposition Liberal Party, traders said.
	   On Thursday, the Economic Planning Agency said Japan's gross
domestic product contracted 0.7 percent in the July-September
quarter from the previous quarter for an annualized drop of 2.6
percent.
	   The latest GDP, which measures all goods and services produced
in a given period, showed Japan remains mired in its worst
recession since World War II.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 10.87 points, or 0.96 percent, to 1,118.02. The
TOPIX fell 18.26 points, or 1.59 percent, the previous day.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
1.060 percent from Thursday's close of 1.090 percent, driving its
price up to 106.40 yen from the previous day's finish of 106.13
yen.

Jordan rejoins labor talks with season in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting lasting into late evening, adds detail on
Kissinger &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Jordan was back at the bargaining table
Thursday as National Basketball Association labor talks resumed.
Whether his magic touch could save the season remained to be seen.
	   Jordan's presence was promising, however, since his agent said
he wouldn't get involved again until discussions got serious.
	   ``His understanding was that a new proposal was going to be
made'' by the owners, agent David Falk said, ``and he wanted to be
there to listen to it. You can read into it that he's continuing to
be involved and supportive of the union leadership.''
	   During the first few hours of one of the longest sessions yet,
commissioner David Stern made another plea to save the season.
	   Also, according to a player who was in the meeting, Madison
Square Garden president David Checketts sparred with union lawyers,
and Jordan did not get as involved as he did when he attended Oct.
28.
	   No new formal proposals were put forward in the first several
hours of talks, but the sides kept meeting late into the evening _
matching their longest session of the five-month lockout.
	   Jordan left early in the evening, and returned about three hours
later to the glee of a small crowd gathered outside a hotel across
from NBA headquarters.
	   Just a few hours earlier, strangely enough, hardly noticed when
one of the greatest peacemakers in American history _ former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger _ walked across the very same
stretch of sidewalk.
	   Trying to end the dispute that threatens to wipe out the entire
season, the sides spent the first two hours merely ``feeling each
other out,'' Stern said, then went back to work after a lunch
break. The bargaining session was the first in 13 days with both
full negotiating committees in attendance.
	   If the owners and players can't come up with a solution in the
next few weeks, the entire 1998-99 season likely will be canceled.
	   Jordan's arrival marked the first time he had joined the talks
since Oct. 28, when he spent about 8 1/2 hours at the bargaining
table and tried to help broker a deal.
	   The sides met one other time since then, on Nov. 20, and called
it their most productive session to date. But things quickly
unraveled.
	   Pressure for a settlement and panic over the fate of the season
increased in recent days, with former union president Isiah Thomas
suggesting that Billy Hunter and Patrick Ewing be replaced as the
union's lead negotiators.
	   ``The one message I know he (Jordan) is delivering emphatically
is that people like Isiah can sit on the sidelines and criticize,
but when you are in the game it's harder,'' Falk said.
	   The first order of major business was to decide whether to
continue negotiating under the framework that the sides had
discussed in two previous sessions _ a six- or seven-year agreement
with a complicated ``escrow tax'' system in the final three or four
years.
	   The proposals put on the table Nov. 20 would include players
having 10 or 15 percent of their paychecks withheld if spending on
overall player salaries exceeded a targeted percentage of revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.
	   The owners moved to 53 percent on Nov. 20 and the players
dropped to 57 percent, but those concessions became void under the
ground rules that have been set for the new talks. That is,
everything discussed at the Nov. 20 meeting is disregarded.
	   So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped
while the sides tried to decide how to divide about dlrs 2 billion
in projected annual revenues.

Thai police want liquor sales banned at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Some members of Thailand's police force
want liquor sales banned at Asian Games venues following arrests of
drunken fans at a soccer match, the Bangkok Post reported on
Friday.
	   The proposal was denounced by the Thai distributor of Carlsberg,
a Danish brewer which has sponsored the games to the tune of dlrs
10 million and has set up beer stalls at all the stadiums, the Post
said.
	   ``It will be difficult to maintain law and order at sports
complexes if alcoholic drinks are sold there,'' Gen. Ukrit
Patchimsawat, assistant Bangkok police chief, was quoted as saying
by the paper.
	   Ukrit said the proposal will be discussed with Pracha Promnok,
chief of the national police.
	   Police decided to ask for the ban after arresting several
intoxicated fans who threw water bottles on the field during a
Thailand-Hong Kong soccer match on Wednesday.
	   A spokesman for Carlsberg told the Post that the incident may
have been contrived by a rival brewer to discredit Carlsberg. He
said that Carlsberg had sold alcohol at the Southeast Asian Games
in Chiang Mai in 1995 without any negative incidents.

Fighter jet crashes, killing two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Taiwanese fighter jet crashed during a
training flight, killing its two crewmen, the air force said
Friday.
	   The F-5F double-seater went down as the pilot was practicing an
emergency procedure at the Taitung Chih-hang Air Base in
southeastern Taiwan on Thursday, according to a military statement.
	   The jet hit a bunker next to the runway and exploded, officials
said. The cause of the crash was being investigated.
	   The jet was among some 300 F-5 fighters assembled in Taiwan in
the 1980s, using mainly U.S. parts.

Bills, Lions owners fined dlrs 50,000 for criticizing officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF GOODMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson ripped
into National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue on
Thursday for ``pompous lectures'' and a dlrs 50,000 fine for
complaints that bad officiating cost his team a game against the
New England Patriots.
	   Wilson wasn't alone in his criticism of officials. William Clay
Ford Sr., whose Detroit Lions benefited from the coin toss fiasco,
will be similarly punished for his remarks.
	   ``The commissioner, lecturing to me as if I were a novice
instead of one who has been involved in football infinitely longer
than he has, contends that criticizing a call has `destructive and
corrosive effects on the game,' '' the 80-year-old Wilson said in a
written statement.
	   ``What is more destructive and corrosive _ errant calls in front
of millions of viewers, or my statements of opinion? People all
over the country registered shock at the way the officials, however
honorable their purpose, took the game away from us. Even the
league has admitted to us that the calls near the conclusion of the
game were incorrect.''
	   The NFL does not comment on disputes involving officiating, but
spokesman Greg Aiello said Wilson has not been fined yet.
	   He said Tagliabue sent Wilson a letter on Wednesday saying it
was his ``intention'' to fine the owner dlrs 50,000, but that he
wanted to discuss the matter further.
	   Said Wilson: ``I do know I don't need pompous lectures from the
commissioner and I feel that the dlrs 50,000 is not only
unwarranted, but punitive in nature. The next time he may ask me to
sit in the corner.''
	   Ford was faxed a letter Wednesday notifying him of the NFL's
intention to fine his club dlrs 50,000 for his comments after
officials apparently botched a coin toss before the overtime period
in the Lions' 19-16 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on
Thanksgiving Day.
	   The Bills were penalized for a questionable pass interference
call that set up the winning touchdown with no time left in a 25-21
loss on Sunday. Wilson called the officiating ``embarrassing to the
league'' and the ``worst.''
	   He was also referring to a fourth-and-9 play just prior to the
pass interference call in which New England receiver Shawn
Jefferson was awarded a first down on a catch in which replays
clearly showed his feet landing out of bounds.

Asian Games ticket sales meet with serious hitches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Ticket sales for the 13th Asian Games
which begin Sunday are a huge mess, disappointing sports fans and
volunteer sales agents alike, say the sellers.
	   Some who booked tickets for the expensive opening ceremony,
paying cash up front, have not received their tickets and have been
abruptly told they will have to pick them up at the stadium on
Sunday.
	   The ticket branch of the games' organizing committee said
Thursday that the more than 38,000 seats available to the general
public were sold out, but outlet operators interviewed by The
Associated Press said they doubted that was true.
	   Most ticket outlets on Thursday were told to stop taking
bookings for the opening.
	   Opening day seats sell for between 1,000 and 5,000 baht (dlrs
27.80 and 139.00).
	   Kanit Isadul, a ticket branch official, said all opening day
ceremony tickets have been sold, but was unable to give a breakdown
by price category, saying the computer system had failed.
	   He claimed 65 million baht (dlrs 1.8 million) in sales for the
opening ceremony, the same amount for the closing ceremony, and 70
million baht (dlrs 1.9 million) so far for all the sporting events
in between, for which ticket prices are considerably lower.
	   Almost half of the 60,000 stadium seats for the opening are
being given away to VIP guests, sports officials and athletes'
families.
	   Some ticket sellers outside Bangkok have not yet received any
tickets for any events, and are adding slight surcharges or paying
out of their own pockets for expenses such as calling in booking to
the head office.
	   The sellers are volunteers working on a not-for-profit basis.
	   At a ticket sales outlet in the northern city of Chiang Mai, a
worker said they haven't received any tickets even though booking
reports and money were sent to the distribution agent in Bangkok
weeks ago.
	   ``Everyday, upset fans call in and ask for the tickets,'' the
worker, who asked not to named, said in a telephone interview.
``They need to see if they have tickets for sure before making
flight and hotel reservations.''
	   Asked about ticket distribution outside Bangkok, Kanit said
sellers were supposed to travel to the capital to collect the
tickets for which they had sold bookings.
	   In the southern city of Hat Yai, a government official selling
tickets at a teachers' college, said he had no such problems.
	   No tickets had been sold there.
	   ``I have not received any calls for ticket bookings,'' said the
	   official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It could be
either they do not know where to book or they cannot afford it.''
	   An operator of a ticket outlet in Bangkok said she was puzzled
and uncomfortable when the distributor informed her bookings had
been stopped and fans would be required to pick up their tickets in
front of the stadium at Sunday's opening.
	   ``I have made more than 200 bookings and could deliver only
about half to fans,'' she said. ``I have no idea what is going
on.''
	   She said she has been flooded with complaints.
	   Many of the problems are undoubtedly attributable to budget
constraints caused by Thailand's economic crisis, forcing the
organizers to rely on volunteer labor and barter deals.
	   Many sellers are civil servants called upon to volunteer their
labor. They receive a per diem payment which hardly covers their
transport and meal costs.
	   The high-tech tickets sold for the opening ceremony are touted
as ``smart cards'' containing a microchip which allows them to be
used as electronic cash cards.
	   A private company, Power Telecom, agreed to handle production of
the cards in exchange for the right to print its name on them and
have its technology publicized.
	   Games officials said Thursday that tickets for the opening
ceremony can still be purchased directly from the company. But
phone calls to Power Telecom went unanswered all Thursday
afternoon.

Reports: China protests flying of Taiwanese flags
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China has protested the flying of
Taiwanese flags at five venues of the upcoming 13th Asian Games,
newspapers said Friday.
	   The protest was reportedly lodged with the Thai Foreign
Ministry, which later asked organizers of the Games to haul the
flags down.
	   The Nation said the Chinese Embassy had spotted the flags at
several sites including the main stadium for the event, the
athletes village and Bangkok's International Airport.
	   Under an earlier compromise, Taiwan can compete at the Games but
cannot fly its national flag or play its national anthem. Its team
uses a special flag.
	   China is again expected to emerge as Asia's top sports power at
the Games, which begin Sunday.

Goals galore, but for Asian soccer it happens at home only
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Goals are coming dime a dozen in at the
Asian Games.
	   But the international record of Asia's soccer playing nations
shows that Asian strikers can have a ball with the ball only at
home.
	   Four Asian nations _ Iran, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia _
were among the 32 countries that took part in the 1998 World Cup in
France.
	   The four played a total of 12 games in group competition.
Together they scored a total of only seven goals and conceded 24.
Their performance record was one win _ Iran over the United States
in an emotion-charged match _ two draws and nine losses.
	   In the three days of preliminary matches at the 13th Asian
Games, a goalfeast has produced a total of 60 goals.
	   The South Koreans are at the top of any single highest goal
scoring match with their 11-0 defeat of Mongolia which equaled
Seoul's similar feat at the last games in Hiroshima four years ago.
	   The Mongolians were so upset that at one stage of the match they
placed a defender at the goal line to help out the hapless keeper.
	   The high scoring matches in Thailand do not signify any sudden
change in Asian soccer potential. Instead, the feat is produced by
weaker countries taking beatings.
	   The Nepal team, for example, is fielding a team of mostly
16-year old players. It conceded five goals against the Japanese.
	   Although football is highly popular in each of the more than 40
affiliated members of the Asian Games domain, participation has
been lackluster. In Hiroshima, only 18 countries took part.
	   Twenty-three teams have come to Bangkok, but a strong Saudi
Arabian team pulled out along with its entire national squad.
	   The current tournament has added significance because the 2002
World Cup will be jointly staged by South Korea and Japan.
	   Iran is seen as Asia's best team and favorite at the Games with
Japan having strong potential, fielding some top talents like Naoki
Soma.
	   However, Japan is looking more to the 2000 Olympics and 2002
World Cup and is fielding a team of mostly 20-year-olds.
	   South Korea has the most experienced players and has won three
Asian Games golds.
	   India, with 980 million people and Asia's second most populous
country after China, is unlikely to win any medals.
	   India's Asian Games soccer record lives in history, with a gold
medal in the Game's inaugural tournament in 1951 and a second gold
a decade later at Jakarta.

Mexican volcano spits ash, red-hot rock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Popocatepetl volcano near Mexico City has
spit a column of ash 2 1/2 miles (4 kms) into the air and showered
red-hot rock onto the flanks of the peak.
	   The brief eruption Thursday, which lasted about one minute, was
expected to cause ash showers in some towns at the foot of the
18,000-foot (5,490-meter) volcano located just 50 miles (80 kms)
southeast of Mexico City, the National Center for Disaster
Prevention reported.
	   The volcano _ whose name means `Smoking Mountain' in the Aztec
Indian language _ had been relatively quiet for several days after
staging similar eruptions last week.
	   Authorities said there was no immediate risk to the 300,000
people who live on the mountain's slopes. About 15 million people
live within a 50-mile (80-km) radius of the volcano, which has been
active since 1994 and regularly emits gas and steam.

Japan to sign protocol for stricter nuclear safeguards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will sign a nuclear safeguard protocol
designed to give the international nuclear watchdog greater
inspection access amid concerns in Iraq and North Korea, the
government said Friday.
	   The signing was scheduled to take place at the International
Atomic Energy Agency headquarters in Vienna, Austria, later Friday,
making Japan the 34th country to join the new protocol, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kunio Nakamura.
	   Japan will also join other signatory countries in urging North
Korea and Iraq to sign the protocol.
	   The document allows IAEA to inspect undeclared nuclear
facilities within 24 hours of the scheduled inspection. The member
countries also will have to declare a wider range of nuclear
facilities and materials.
	   Currently, agency inspectors only have access to facilities
already declared by a member nation.
	   The protocol is expected to give the international nuclear
watchdog a better chance to detect suspicious nuclear facilities
and materials.
	   IAEA approved the new protocol in May 1997 following
international calls for tighter surveillance after inspectors
discovered undeclared nuclear facilities in Iraq and had difficulty
verifying facilities in North Korea.
	   Japan's Cabinet will seek parliamentary approval for
ratification during its next regular session beginning January.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Jakarta's gritty sidewalks are hardly
a place to linger. Yet, thanks to economic hardship, street cafes
are flourishing in the tropical, pollution-soaked capital of 10
million people.
	   Stripped of their jobs by the worst financial crisis in decades,
bank clerks, actors and real estate developers have opened up
dozens of makeshift eateries around the Indonesian capital.
	   Flickering candles or gas lamps beckon from the patios of
private homes or at streetside tarpaulins where menus list oxtail
soup and other Indonesian specialties.
	   Even here the crisis intrudes. Many of the outdoor restaurants
had to shut temporarily during a recent wave of mob rioting and
deadly fighting between antigovernment student protesters and
security forces.
	   Catering to white-collar workers who can no longer afford to eat
at regular restaurants, many simple cafes also offer steaks,
lasagna, milk shakes and cappuccino. The quality, and profits,
vary.
	   ``In a hotel, if you order a steak, you have to pay 85,000
rupiah (dlrs 10). Here, in our cafe, it's only 12,000 (dlrs 1.40)
or 15,000 rupiah (dlrs 1.75),'' said Rudy Salam, a sometime soap
opera actor and former cruise ship steward who runs a cafe named
after himself.
	   Indonesia is one of the Asian countries hardest hit by economic
turmoil, with millions of people sliding into poverty despite huge
injections of international aid. In Jakarta, many restaurants have
been forced to close their doors.
	   Salam's place is one of dozens of outdoor restaurants that
opened in a huge plaza near the city's national monument, a tall
spire of marble topped by a gold-leaf sculpture in the shape of a
flame.
	   During the unrest in early November, soldiers slept under the
tents put up by the fledgling restaurateurs.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The man police believe terrorized
Australia with a letter-bombing campaign against tax officials and
human rights officials was detained Friday in a hospital in
Canberra.
	   Australian Federal Police launched a nationwide manhunt on
Wednesday for 43-year-old Colin George Dunstan, a former Australian
Tax Office employee, after 22 parcel bombs were discovered at the
Canberra mail center, addressed mainly to tax office staff.
	   Police spokesman Daryl Webb said police are looking forward to
speaking to Dunstan.
	   A further five potentially lethal bombs have been found in
Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast.
	   It is not clear yet how Dunstan came to be in the hospital or
how police learned of his whereabouts.
	   On Friday police found a 27th letter bomb in a Sydney post
office and a train was halted and evacuated for a search.
	   The bomb at the Darlinghurst post office in Sydney was detonated
safely by police shortly after it was discovered at 8:15 a.m. The
train, also in Sydney, continued its journey when no suspicious
package was found aboard.
	   Police, ambulance and fire crews were also called to the Penrith
branch of the Australian Taxation Office in western Sydney after
the discovery of another suspicious package.
	   Government and business offices as far apart as Melbourne, on
Australia's southeast coast and its northernmost capital of Darwin,
as well as the Centrepoint Tower shopping center and office tower
in Sydney were evacuated Thursday in a series of false alarms.
	   ``It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I suppose,
is a modern day reality in every society,'' Prime Minister John
Howard said Friday on radio.
	   ``We've been refreshingly freer of it than most other societies
and I hope that continues to be the case.
	   ``But unhinged human nature can become a very lethal weapon if
it's triggered off by particular events,'' he said.
	   Twenty-seven potentially lethal parcel bombs have been found at
addresses in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and the Gold Coast over
the past 48 hours.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also were targeted.
	   Police have named as the sole suspect Dunstan, a suspended tax
officer who got embroiled in an affair with a woman at his office.
	   Dunstan has been involved in a sexual harassment case at the tax
office in Canberra involving the woman he had the relationship
with, and was appealing his dismissal to the Federal Court.
	   Only the first of the letter bombs has caused any injury.
	   Two postal workers, at the Canberra mail sorting center were
slightly injured, after one of them threw one of the letter bombs
into a mail bag early Wednesday morning.
	   Police say they cannot be sure there are no more letter bombs in
Australia's mail system, which is presently overflowing with
Christmas parcels.
	   They have urged people throughout Australia to be cautious if
they see suspicious parcels in their mail.

Police seize three-ton cocaine shipment in Caribbean port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Police on Thursday seized at least three
tons of cocaine in a maritime warehouse in the Caribbean port city
of Cartagena.
	   The cocaine was hidden in a shipment of paint destined for the
United States, police spokesman Col. Bejamin Munoz said in a radio
interview. Police were continuing their search and believed they
might find more cocaine, he said.
	   Cartagena was the location this week of a conference of the
hemisphere's defense ministers at which military leaders from
around the Americas pledged greater cooperation in the fight
against illegal narcotics.
	   The seizure Thursday was the second major cocaine discovery this
year in Cartagena, a popular tourist destination 400 miles (650
kilometers) north of Bogota.
	   In July, authorities seized seven tons of cocaine hidden in
metal containers marked as containing nylon. The shipment was
headed for the United States by way of Mexico.

Yasuda Fire and Marine, Cigna International to form joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co., a major
Japanese non-life insurer, and U.S.-based Cigna International
Holdings Ltd. have agreed to set up a joint venture brokerage, a
Yasuda official said Friday.
	   The two companies will set up an equally owned joint venture in
April 1999 to enter the defined contribution-type pension business
in Japan, said Yasuda spokesman Shin Toyofuku.
	   Other details, including the name of the new venture and its
working capital, have yet to be decided, he said.
	   The agreement between Yasuda and Cigna comes as Japan implements
its ``Big Bang'' financial deregulation measures aimed at
invigorating the economy by opening up markets to greater
competition.
	   Earlier this week, Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co., a major
Japanese insurer, said it is looking into a possible joint venture
in Japan with U.S. discount brokerage Charles Schwab and Co.
	   Yasuda Fire and Marine and the Philadelphia, Pa.-based Cigna,
have maintained a close business relationship since 1972. Yasuda
Fire has a 10 percent stake in Cigna's Japanese unit, INA Himawari
Life Insurance.
	   Cigna International is a unit of Cigna Corp., which provides
insurance, health care and financial services.

Police, protesters clash in Panama over privatization plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Police used tear gas Thursday to turn back a
demonstration by anti-privatization union members in Panama who
attempted to storm the Congress building.
	   About 6,000 demonstrators, some armed with sticks and stones,
attempted to tear down gates leading into the building before being
driven away by riot police. The protesters are against
privatization of the country's state-owned water system.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the
clash.
	   The government has already privatized half of the state-owned
telecommunication and electricity companies, and argues it needs to
privatize water service to attract private investment and improve
service.
	   Construction union leader Saul Mendez, a protest organizer, said
those demonstrating fear rates will increase if the water utility
is privatized.

Chinese courts put 22 to death in two cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A brother-and-sister team of bank robbers and a
factory worker who raped 11 school girls were among 22 people put
to death in two Chinese cities, state media reported Friday.
	   Courts in Beijing and Urumqi, capital of China's
northwesternmost region of Xinjiang, ordered the executions
Thursday after appeals courts upheld the previously issued death
sentences, the reports said.
	   In Urumqi, all 15 convicted criminals ordered put to death were
taken out and shot, the Legal Daily reported. The Beijing Daily did
not say how the seven were executed, although firing squad is the
usual method.
	   The Legal Daily said Zou Lilun and his sister Zou Liqun were
executed for robbing an Urumqi bank of 693,000 yuan (dlrs 84,000)
on Sept. 11. Zou Lilun and his older brother, whose case is being
handled separately, killed one person in the bank; she drove the
getaway car, the newspaper said.
	   Beijing's No. 2 Intermediate People's Court ordered Liu Gang, an
electronics factory worker, to pay 24,000 yuan (dlrs 2,900) in
compensation to the victims of his four-month raping and robbing
spree that started in Sept. 1997, the Beijing Daily reported.
	   Liu targeted 10- to 14-year-old girls; he followed them home
from school and then posed as someone delivering a letter to get
inside, the newspaper said.

Australia welcomes Indonesian election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia on Friday welcomed the
embattled Indonesian government's decision to hold elections next
year and promised to help computerize the electoral rolls to ensure
fair and democratic balloting.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said here he hoped the
election would settle a country facing mounting social unrest.
	   ``We welcome the news of an election in Indonesia which we hope
will create a degree of certainty and predictability,'' Downer
said.
	   Indonesian parliamentary elections will be held June 7 and the
nation's highest legislative assembly, the People's Consultative
Assembly, will elect a new president Aug. 29.
	   Downer said Australia will assist with the implementation of a
computerized system of electoral rolls to ensure Indonesia's 202
million people voted in a fair and democratic election.
	   ``This election is likely to be the most democratic Indonesia
has had since the mid-1950s so we very much welcome the advent of
genuine democracy there,'' he said.
	   A democratic government would make Indonesia an ``easier
neighbor to deal with'' than under former President Suharto's
32-year authoritarian rule.
	   There were no immediate plans to evacuate Australians from
Jakarta despite reports of increasing violence, he said.
	   ``We have contingency plans in place should this be the case but
we are monitoring the situation and the plans have not been
upgraded or changed since May when we evacuated Australians,''
Downer said.

Eagles 17, Rams 14
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Irving Fryar caught his first touchdown pass
in nearly a year, a 61-yarder from Koy Detmer in the third quarter
as the Philadelphia Eagles beat the St. Louis Rams 17-14 Thursday
night.
	   It was Dick Vermeil's first game at Veterans Stadium since he
last coached the Eagles in 1982. Like Vermeil's old Eagles teams,
the Rams didn't quit when Fryar's TD gave Philadelphia (3-10) a
17-6 lead with 7:18 left in the third.
	   Tony Banks hit J.T. Thomas _ one of a hodgepodge of receivers
carrying the load for injured Isaac Bruce _ for 41 yards to the
Eagles 10. June Henley scored from the 1, and Banks hit Ricky
Proehl for a 2-point conversion that cut it to 17-14 with 11:04
left.
	   After Philadelphia punted, Banks hit Thomas again with a 17-yard
completion on third-and-12. But the drive stalled, and Jeff
Wilkins' 52-yard field goal attempt was wide left with 4:15 to go.
	   Though most of the fans had left Veterans Stadium, the game
still meant something to Vermeil. The 62-year-old coach slapped his
clipboard against his legs when the ball fluttered wide.
	   In a final march, Banks hit Thomas for 17 yards to the
Philadelphia 35 on a fourth-and-2 play as time expired.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Alex Zhamnov and Chad Kilger scored two goals
each Thursday night and Chicago beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 4-1
for their second two-game winning streak this season.
	   Chicago, which managed a pair of shorthanded scores, also ended
a four-game skid against Anaheim, which included two losses this
season. The Mighty Ducks are winless in their last five games
(0-4-1).
	   It was the fifth game of a season-long six-game road trip for
the Mighty Ducks.
 &UR; Senators 3, Kings 1
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Alexei Yashin scored midway through the
third period and Ron Tugnutt made 31 saves to lead the Ottawa
Senators over the Los Angeles Kings.
	   The Kings, playing their third road game in four nights, lost
despite outshooting the Senators 32-18 _ including 13-4 in the
second period. But Tugnutt was spectacular, earning his first
career victory over the Kings in seven decisions.
	   Yashin broke a 1-1 tie when he picked up a loose puck behind the
net, fired a wrist shot from the side of the net which handcuffed
goalie Stephane Fiset and sent him to the ice. Yashin snapped the
rebound over Fiset's shoulder for the game winner.

	   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) _ In a poorly played game, Atletico
Nacional of Medellin took a giant step towards winning the Copa
Merconorte soccer cup with a 3-1 victory over Deportivo of Cali.
	   Cali's Martin Zapata tied the game at 1-1 with a penalty shot at

two-game series, however Cali can only take the cup if it wins by a
three goal margin.
	   Thursday's game was played before fewer than 3,000 spectators on
a rainy evening in Atanasio Girardot stadium.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The politicians who run Taiwan hope to
rebuild support and wipe away hints of corruption Saturday with a
candidate who calls himself squeaky clean _ though he freely admits
spending too much money on the campaign.
	   Ma Ying-jeou promises a full, honest accounting of his excesses
after voters make their choice in the Taipei mayoral race. The
contest is the focal point of elections seen as a barometer for the
bigger call Taiwanese must make 16 months later when they pick a
successor to President Lee Teng-hui.
	   ``The spending has become a joke,'' Ma said, adding that Taiwan
``cannot wait to form a democratic institution with substance _ we
need to clean up.''
	   The races are nasty on the surface _ plenty of ethnic
disparagement and allegations of whore-mongering _ but the broader
issue of Taiwan's delicate status vis-a-vis mainland China lingers
more quietly.
	   Taipei voters may back Ma, the Nationalist Party candidate, if
they're spooked by the idea that re-electing the opposition mayor,
Chen Shui-bian, could someday push Taiwan toward a deadly
confrontation with China.
	   The platform of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party calls for
Taiwan to formally state its independence. Many Taiwanese like the
idea in their hearts, but they can't forget the tense standoff
three years ago, when China demonstrated its views on Taiwanese
sovereignty by test-firing missiles off the coast.
	   If Chen hangs onto power, the DPP keeps the biggest plum it has
picked since martial law ended in 1987 _ which could help the
opposition's hopes of electing its first president in 2000.
	   If Ma and the Nationalists can reclaim Taipei, they could halt
the advance of the DPP and possibly restore a popularity that
crumbled amid perceptions of dirty dealing and embarrassing losses
in last year's local elections.
	   The Taipei mayoral race is too close to call, with a longshot
candidate from the tiny New Party _ Wang Chien-shien _ expected to
take more votes away from Ma than from Chen.
	   The governing Nationalist Party is likely to retain control of
the Legislature, which is being expanded to 225 seats. Voters also
will choose a Taipei city council and a mayor and council in the
big southern city, Kaohsiung.
	   Democracy, merely a decade-old phenomenon in Taiwan, has turned
into a raucous show. The campaigners were out early Friday,
parading in wildly decked out trucks and jeeps, pounding drums in a
tribal rhythm and blaring messages through megaphones.
	   Anybody in town who bought tissue paper this week paid too much:
Campaign workers are everywhere, handing out special packages that
have slogans and pictures of the politicians on them.
	   It's hard to distinguish Taipei's mayoral candidates by
listening to their speeches about making the capital a world-class
city and fixing routine urban problems.
	   The island's big issue _ China relations _ has been neutralized
to the point that no politician who favors reunification dares say
so, just as those who prefer a bold claim of independence keep
quiet for fear of provoking a military attack.
	   It would be hard to find a Taiwanese willing to trade the
island's prosperity for a life under Chinese communism.
	   But with a declaration of independence viewed as too risky, many
Taiwanese figure that 49 years after the island was politically
separated from the mainland in a civil war, they're already
standing alone in an economy that is the envy of many. Taiwan thus
far has largely escaped the ravages of Asia's crisis.
	   Chen refuses to tout his party's call for independence and has
reverted instead to questioning the loyalty of Ma _ who was born to
mainland parents but moved to Taiwan at age 1.
	   Such talk stirs ethnic emotions that previously had Taiwanese
voters fighting with their fists _ though violence is way down this
time and arrests for vote buying purportedly have been confined to
rural areas where people were offered cooking oil and a few dollars
for their support.
	   ``In election times, the ghosts come back to haunt all of
Taiwan,'' said Antonio Chiang, a journalist during martial law who
now publishes the Taiwan Daily. ``It's a ritual.''

Belgian swimmer sets breaststroke record in FINA World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) _ Frederik deBurghgraeve of Belgium
broke his own short-course world record in the 100-meter
breaststroke Thursday night in the FINA Swimming World Cup.
	   DeBurghgraeve considered not swimming in the 100 breaststroke
final to save his strength for other races.
	   ``Normally I would stretch and swim only the 50-meter freestyle
in the finals,'' deBurghgraeve said. ``But I had second thoughts
and decided to swim the 100-meter breaststroke.''
	   DeBurghgraeve broke Jeremy Linn's U.S. Open record of 1 minute,
.08 seconds, finishing in 58.79 seconds.
	   Josh Davis, Megan Quann, Natalie Coughlin set American and U.S.
Open records.
	   Davis of Texas Aquatics won the 200 individual medley in
1:56.66, breaking the American record of 1:57.47 set last year by
Ron Karnaugh, and Pablo Morales' 1987 U.S. Open record of 1:58.16.
	   Davis came back later in the competition and won the 200
backstroke in 1:54.55.
	   Quann, 14, of Puyallup Aquatics swam a 1:07.41 in the 100
breaststroke, breaking Tracy Caulkins 1981 records of 1:07.47.
	   Quann also recorded the American and U.S. Open records in the 50
breaststroke with a split of 31.86 in the 100 breast. The old
record was 31.88.
	   Coughlin, 16, of Terrapins Swim Club swam the 200 back in
2:07.46, breaking Lia Oberstar's time of 2:07.52.

	   Taiwan holds elections Saturday. Here are some facts and figures
about the island, its politics and people:
	   ELECTIONS _ Taiwanese are choosing a new Legislature that is
being expanded to 225 seats, and the mayors and city councils of
Taiwan's two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   Nearly 15 million people aged 20 or above can vote, with some
2.86 million eligible voters in the mayoral races.
	   BACKGROUND _ Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government
that fled the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949, and
calls itself the Republic of China. China regards the island as a
renegade province with no right to sovereignty. Taiwan's government
maintains both sides should recognize that China is divided and
strive for its reunification.
	   GOVERNMENT and POLITICS _ The Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang,
ruled China from 1911 to 1949, and Taiwan from 1949 until now. It
governed by martial law until 1987 when it began a process of
democratization. The Nationalist grip on power has loosened under a
multiparty system.
	   GEOGRAPHY and HISTORY _ Taiwan and its smaller islands have a
land area of 14,384 square miles (36,823 square kms) and a tropical
climate. Taiwan is separated from the Chinese mainland by the
Taiwan Strait, about 80 miles (130 kms) wide. Of the population of
21.8 million, 85 percent are native-born. Most of the rest are
Chinese who fled the mainland in 1949.
	   Japan ruled Taiwan as a colony from 1895 to 1945.
	   Taiwan shunned contact with the mainland from 1949 to the late
1980s, when a ban on trade and travel was lifted. Most nations,
including the United States, extend diplomatic recognition to
Beijing instead of Taiwan. Only 27 countries have diplomatic
relations with Taiwan.
	   ECONOMY _ Exports are Taiwan's economic backbone, with products
including foods, textiles, leather, machinery and electronics.
Chief markets are the United States, China and Europe. Taiwan has
one of the world's largest foreign currency reserves, totaling U.S.
dlrs 88 billion.

Horta on Friday labeled Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
``gutless'' for his soft stance over the 1975 killing of five
newsmen in East Timor.
	   He said he was astounded by Downer's reaction to news last week
that Indonesia would refuse former National Crime Authority
chairman Tom Sherman access to the country to investigate claims
the five were executed by Indonesian troops.
	   Downer said he never expected Indonesia to allow Sherman access,
but said ``We certainly thought it was worth a try.''
	   ``Is that the response from a foreign minister of a proud
country like Australia which gives billions of dollars in aid to
Indonesia?'' Ramos Horta said.
	   ``It escapes my limited intelligence to understand this kind of
behavior.''
	   The Nobel Peace laureate said Australia should follow the
example of Spain, which is attempting to extradite former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet from England to face genocide charges.
	   ``If Australia had any guts, any sense of national honor and
dignity they would do like the Spaniards have done with Pinochet,''
Ramos Horta said.
	   ``Pinochet murdered Spanish citizens, about 80 of them. It took
time but they slowly tracked him down.''
	   Sherman's original 1996 report found the five newsmen, who were
killed at Balibo during Indonesia's invasion of the former
Portuguese colony, probably died during a battle between
Indonesian-led troops and Timorese resistance fighters.
	   However, people claiming to be eyewitnesses have now come
forward alleging they were murdered by troops led by Yunus Yosfiah
-- now Indonesia's Information Minister.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie last week rejected a request
by Defense Minister John Moore for Sherman to be allowed to visit
Timor to investigate the new claims.
	   Ramos Horta said he was angry with the way Downer brushed aside
criticism of Indonesia's refusal.
	   ``It is gutless when Australia does not even bother about its
citizens,'' he said.
	   ``The question that arises is then: how can we East Timorese
have illusions that they will bother about East Timor when they
don't care, they don't have the guts to protect their own
citizens?''
