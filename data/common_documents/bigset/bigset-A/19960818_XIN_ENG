<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Confirms Escape of Russian Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taliban official named Wakeel Akhunzada told Xinhua on
telephone from Kandahar that the five Russians succeeded in
escaping from the Kandahar Airport where they flew a plane to
Sharja Airport in United Arab Emirates on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Seven Russian pilots were detained by the Taliban as hostages
last August when their plane was forcelanded at Kandahar. The
Taliban alleged that the plane was loaded with arms for Afghan
government led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Akhunzada said that since the arrest of the Russian pilots, the
Taliban have asked them to repair planes for the Militia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not unique to ask the Russian hostages to repair
aircraft," he said, adding," besides the Russians, the Taliban
have also utilized services of some engineers of a company based
in Sharja."
</P>
<P>
He said that on Friday afternoon, the five Russians were
shifted to the Kandahar Airport which is situated about 10
kilometers away from the city to fly a plane on experimental
grounds.
</P>
<P>
The pilots had flown the plane for ten minutes and after
landing, they asked for the second flying test, he said, adding
that the plane did not return after its second take-off.
</P>
<P>
Three Taliban soldiers including a commander were also on the
plane, he said, adding that later on they came to know about the
safelanding of the plane at the Sharja Airport.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian pilots and the three Taliban soldiers are now
under custody of the Sharja Police," he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Akhunzada said that the responsibility
regarding the escape has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
However, a four-member Taliban team has been set up to hold an
inquiry into the matter, he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to another question, Akhunzada said that only five
Russian pilots succeeded in the escape while the other two failed
to get on the plane.
</P>
<P>
However, some previous reports said that all the seven Russian
pilots escaped from Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
For the release of these Russian hostages, the UN, Russia, the
US, and several other countries have time and again made contacts
with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
But the Taliban has been urging the Russian government to
provide details of the 60,000 Afghans who disappeared during the
Soviet invasion in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also asked the Russian government to stop printing
Afghan currency for the Rabbani government.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Raise Oil Production to 3 Million BPD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait would be able to
produce 3 million barrels of oil per day in the beginning of next
century, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Abdelmohsen Al-Medej said today.
</P>
<P>
Opening an exhibition of the state economic arm Kuwait Oil
Company in the southern oil city of Ahmadi, the Oil Minister told
reporters that Kuwait now has a production capability of 2.5
million barrels per day but its quota assigned to it by OPEC, the
umbrela organization of oil exporting countries, is 2 million
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has demanded an increase in its production quota in
the past two years but the request is not yet heeded so far.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait has the capability of over-producing if allowed by the
OPEC," he said, adding that "Kuwait has always maintained its
production quota in the OPEC".
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "we have a strategy that was approved by the
corporation and the Petroleum Higher Council which stresses the
importance of finding marketing outlets in the east and west."
</P>
<P>
He critisized some OPEC countries for overproducing around 1.5
million BPD, calling on them to adhere to their production quotas
set by the OPEC for the benefit of all countries.
</P>
<P>
Regarding international oil prices, Al-Medej anticipated that
oil prices would remain steady till OPEC's next meeting in
November, describing these prices as satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope for a hike in prices during the next
period.

<HEADLINE> Aid Bodies Urged to Do More for Street Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Aid organizations working
to improve the plight of street children in ethiopia were today
urged to coordinate their activities for better results.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Bulti Gutema, head of the children's
right protection department of the children and youth affairs
organization, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Bulti said, the aid organizations working in ethiopia are not
having the desired effect because they do not coordinate their
activities.
</P>
<P>
+There are currently more than 50 non-governmental
organizations concerned about street children in the country, but
with minimal effect in the effort to solve the problem,+ he said.
</P>
<P>
Bulti stressed that it is necessary for the aid organizations
to coordinate their aid programs for a better result.
</P>
<P>
There are over 100,000 street children aged between 5 and 15
in Ethiopia, one-fifth of which are in Addis Ababa. The Ethiopian
government has designed a three-year rehabilitation project for
these homeless street children.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Chief Snubs Minister Over Chechnya Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) - The row between Russian security
chief Alexander Lebed and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov over
the war in Chechnya intensified today after Lebed refused to
attend a meeting of top ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
"Alexander Lebed of course will not be accepting this
invitation (by Kulikov) and has sent his representative, a general
by rank, in his place," his press spokesman Alexander Barkhatov
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sense in him going as there will be no serious
discussions about Chechnya. Kulikov's deputies will all be
there, trying to work out what tactics to use to save him."
</P>
<P>
Lebed was granted special powers by Yeltsin last week to
end the 20-month war in Chechnya after a spectacular rebel assault
on Russian troops in the Chechen capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
After returning from a peace mission to Chechnya on Friday,
Lebed demanded Kulikov's dismissal for mishandling the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He challenged President Yeltsin to choose between them.
</P>
<P>
"I publicly call on President (Boris) Yeltsin to choose between
Lebed and Kulikov. It is either Kulikov or Lebed who remains," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, his challenge to the president to sack the minister
met with muted response. A Kremlin spokesman, Andrei Biryukov,
said he knew nothing about the president's plans for Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Interafx news agency quoted well-informed Kremlin
sources as saying Yeltsin had a "short telephone conversation"
with Kulikov on Friday and told the minister, who was re-appointed
in this week's cabinet re-shuffle, to stay at his post.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov was instructed by Yeltsin at the end of last year to
disarm the Chechen separatists who had been fighting Russian
forces since December 1994 when the president launched his
campaign to crush the republic's bid for independence.
</P>
<P>
But fighting has continued and interior ministry troops have
suffered heavy casualities.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov was accused of "not fulfilling his duty before Russia,"
by Lebed, who was made secretary of the powerful Security Council
by Yeltsin after a strong performance in the first round of the
presidential election in June.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov has angrily rejected Lebed's allegations but said he
would offer his resignation if Lebed did not withdraw the charges.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who has not bothered to conceal the government's inner
wrangling over the Chechen crisis, said on Friday he had not yet
had a chance to inform Yeltsin of the results of his trip to
Chechnya. Yeltsin's spokesman could not say if the two men had
spoken on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov said rebel chief-of-staff Aslan
Maskhadov and Russia's acting commander in Chechnya, Konstantin
Pulikovsky, would hold talks later on Saturday in an attempt to
ink the fragile ceasefire enforced Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany to Discuss Army Helicopter Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany is likely to step up
pressure on France to agree to the manufacture of the NH90
transport helicopter at a meeting between the two countries'
defense ministers to be held in France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany have been discussing the joint program for
several years, but differences have emerged earlier this year when
French President Jacques Chriac decided to abolish conscription
and withdraw almost 90 percent of the 20,000 French troops still
stationed in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Military experts say that Germany needs the NH90 helicopter to
guarantee army mobility, but France wants the Tiger attack
helicopter, which is better suited to its more offensive
international operations.
</P>
<P>
Although a final decision about the NH90 is not expected to be
made until the biannual Franco-German summit in the Autumn, much
of Sunday's discussion between French Defense Minister Charles
Millon and his German counterpart Volker Ruhe is likely to focus
on reaching accord on this issue, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The two military chiefs will also discuss progress of two other
Franco-German joint defense projects, the Future Large Aircraft
and the Helios reconnaissance satellite.

<HEADLINE> Greek Premier Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Premier Costas Simitis
arrived here today for a visit to Cyprus amid tensions between
Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the wake of two days of clashes this
week in the east Mediterranean island country.
</P>
<P>
Simitis called on the international community to help reduce
the tension here and work for a lasting political solution of the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is time the international community at last fulfills its
responsibility and exerts the necessary pressures on Turkey," said
the Greek premier, adding that the Green Line dividing this
country into Turkish Cypriot north and Greek Cypriot south is a
"monument of shame."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of one third of the island's territory following an
abortive coup by the Greek Cypriots supporting union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared their independence in the
northern part of Cyprus in 1983. Their self-declared republic
is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The clashes that took place in the buffer zone separating the
country on Sunday and Wednesday left two Greek Cypriots killed and
50 others wounded. The violence was the worst of its kind in 22
years on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
The clashes have also increased tensions between Greece and
Turkey, two NATO members whose relations have long been strained
by friction over Cyprus and territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Acting Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
paid a lightning visit to northern Cyprus Thursday night, urging
the U.N. to gather the leaders of the Greek and Turkish
Cypriots immediately to work out a solution and ensure peace.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival here, Simitis held talks with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides to discuss the next steps in the
political efforts for finding a solution of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides called
on the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and
all other interested parties to create the momentum to end the
present explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. headquarters in Cyprus today strongly
protested the "totally unwarranted use of force by the Turkish or
Turkish Cypriot military personnel" during the clashes in the
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. statement said that Turkish or Turkish Cypriot
soldiers fired 25 to 50 rounds indiscriminately into the Greek
Cypriot demonstrators inside the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
However, Ciller's visit to northern Cyprus signified Ankara's
determination to stand firm in favor of the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Russian Interior Ministry Denies Lebed' Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Interior Ministry
today dismissed as groundless national security chief Alexander
Lebed's accusations against its head Anatoly Kulikov, according to
television reports here.
</P>
<P>
At today's session, the ministry's board voiced hope that after
examining the situation in Chechnya in detail and visiting Russian
interior troops and police stationed in Chechnya, Lebed will make
"a more adequate assessment" of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Lebed, Russia's Security Council Secretary
and President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya, blamed
the bloodshed in Chechnya for the Interior Ministry's leadership
and made it clear that Kulikov should leave his post.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Kulikov dismissed the charges against him and
said he would submit a report on resignation to the President on
his own.
</P>
<P>
When Kulikov submitted his report to Yeltsin on Friday, a brief
telephone conversation took place between them, a well-informed
source in the Kremlin said, adding that the President instructed
Kulikov to continue to lead the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry's leadership decided to hold a meeting
today and invited Lebed to attend.
</P>
<P>
However, early today, Lebed's spokesman Alexander Barkhatov
told reporters that Lebed would not attend the meeting, but would
send his representatives.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Lebed's assessment of Kulikov's
performance remained in force, adding that he was not going to
change it.
</P>
<P>
He noted that no one had consulted Lebed over the
re-appointment of Kulikov as the Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Yeltsin signed a decree giving vast powers to
Lebed in Chechen settlement. On Thursday, Lebed flew to Chechnya
to visit Russian troops operating there and meet Chechen rebel
leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Southern Jordan Worsens Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The unrest which broke out Friday
in the southern city of Karak, 150 kilometers southwest of Amman,
went into its second day, with the situation greatly worsened.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told Xinhua that thousands of protesters participated in the
unrest today.
</P>
<P>
The angry rioters who protest the government's last week
decision to raise the price of bread and animal feed, burned
today another three bank branches -- Islamic, Arab and Krindliz banks,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
A store owned by the Ministry of Education was "totally and
completely burned down " by the protesters, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The source added that a police car was also destroyed in the
riot.
</P>
<P>
The protesters in Karak "refused to negotiate with the
government before Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti forwards his
resignation to King Hussein and the government frees the
detainees held Friday," the source said.
</P>
<P>
He said the army began to enter the city of Karak at 1:00
p.m. and took control of the city center at 4:00 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
He said all the ways to the city of Karak were "totally closed"
and no one could enter the city.
</P>
<P>
The report of army intervention can not be independently
confirmed yet.
</P>
<P>
There is no report on casualties or injuries today.
</P>
<P>
The protesters in Karak Friday battled with security forces,
burned down government buildings and private banks and torched
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, police used tear-gas, rubber bullets and fired live
bullets in the air to disperse the protesters, who in turn pelted
policemen with stones and set fire to several buildings, among
them a branch of the Civil Consumers Corporation and the Arab Bank
and torched government and private cars.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein accused here early today "misled and misleading
elements that belong to outside parties and powers" of being
behind the riots that broke out Friday afternoon in southern towns
of Karak, Ma'an and Tafeleh.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address delivered this morning, the King
warned that the authorities "would strike with an iron fist"
against those who would foment unrest.
</P>
<P>
The King asked the security forces to be self-restraint in
maintaining order, solidarity and unity of the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The King also urged the protesters to stop violence, but
the rioters chose to ignore the call of the King, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister held a cabinet meeting today to review
efforts taken by various government departments and public
security to abort attempts to instigate violence in southern
cities.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the cabinet meeting, Information
Minister Marwan Muasher said the riots had involved few people.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation was quite all over the country and under
control.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there were information which pointed to
the involvement of some foreign parties that used to fiddle
with the country's security.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the capital of Amman is quite, but the
source said that "more people in Amman are sympathetic with the
protesters in the southern towns."
</P>
<P>
"No one can expect what will happen tomorrow," said the
source, noting that more than 30 percent of Jordan's 4.15 million
people live below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the unrest will have "very great negative"
influence on the economy of the Kingdom which depends on the
south to a "large extent."

<HEADLINE> U.S. not to Evacuate Families of Servicemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will not evacuate
families of the army forces stationed in Kuwait following new
developments unfavorable to the U.S. residents in the Gulf Region,
especially in the wake of a truck bomb explosion in Saudi
Arabia that killed 19 Americans and injuring 300 others in late
June.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador to Kuwait Ryan Crocker said in a statement
exclusive to the official Kuwait News Agency today that his
country was "not evacuating dependents, military or civilian
official American personnel in Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
"And we are not withdrawing the dependents and leaving
their sponsors here," Crocker said adding that "that is
because the situation we believe in Kuwait is different, and
it is an environment for Americans official and unofficial of
safety and security."
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to a recent Pentagon statement.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Den Bacon was reportedly saying last week
that the U.S. would reduce the number of its military dependents
in Kuwait as a security measure and details on the issue
were being worked out.
</P>
<P>
"Rotations will be adjusted in a way that will reduce the
number of families in Kuwait, but some military families will
remain there," he said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Crocker commented on the statement that "it needs to be
seen in the regional context and as part of an ongoing
review by the department of defense of what is the proper
posture and profile of what the American military throughout
the region and it is not something specific to Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
There are about 2000 American military and civilian personnel
in Kuwait. Since the 1991 Gulf War, Washington has expanded its
presence through a string of bases, military supply centers and
ports of call in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Oman.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials said around 20,000 U.S. military men
and women, 70 percent of them Navy personnel and Marines
aboard 22 ships, are deployed year-round in the region, about
four times more than before the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
It has been pressing ahead with overhauling security for
its soldiers, sailors and airmen throughout the Gulf in the
wake of a second deadly bombing in Saudi Arabia in less
then seven months.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Resolving Hanish Dispute through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today called for a solution
to the dispute between Yemen and Eritrea over three Red Sea
islands through an arbitration accord signed earlier this year by
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters in Egypt's
port city of Alexandria that nothing should be done to threaten or
abort the accord.
</P>
<P>
On May 21, Yemen and Eritrea signed the French-brokered
agreement, under which the two countries would settle their
dispute over the islands peacefully through international
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which covers the principles of that arbitration,
was reached following efforts by France, Egypt and Ethiopia to
mediate a solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last December when the two sides had a
fierce battle and Eritrean troops took over Greater Hanish, the
largest of the disputed islands, before a ceasefire took effect.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration agreement has so far failed to bring about a
peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has come to the fore again after Yemen accused
Eritrean troops of having taken over Lesser Hanish, another
disputed island, on August 10.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that France intends to send an envoy to the two
countries to mediate between them.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt is following with concern the development of
the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute, adding that any tension in the area
may threaten the stability of the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands sit astride major shipping lanes 160
kilometers north of the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb at the mouth of
the Red Sea. Yemen and Eritrea face each other across the strait.

ABU DHABI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain today denounced
Eritrea for using force again in settling its territorial dispute
with Yemen, a report reaching here from Manama, capital of
Bahrain, said.
</P>
<P>
A Bahraini Foreign Ministry official source said the occupation
by Eritrea of the Lesser Hanish island, one of the three Red Sea
islands both claimed by Yemen and Eritrea, poses a threat to
security and stability in the Red Sea region.

The source pointed out that, according to a statement by the
Yemeni Defense Ministry, Eritrean troops took over the Lesser
Hanish island on August 10.

fierce battle and Eritrean troops took control of the Greater
Hanish, the largest of the disputed islands, before a ceasefire

of adopting friendly and peaceful ways to settle territorial
disputes.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani today urged some 1,000 ultra-Orthodox Jewish
demonstrators who tried to block the disputed Bar-Ilan Street in
this city on Saturdays to exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
Shouting "Sabbath," the Jewish day of rest that starts sundown
Friday and ends sundown Saturday, the demonstrators threw stones,
bottles and dirty diapers at police and passing cars. The
windshields of two cars were smashed.
</P>
<P>
The security minister told reporters the Jewish demonstrators
can stay on the sidewalk and shout "Sabbath," but they should not
harm any policemen and should not try to close the road.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators dispersed after three hours, and no injuries
or arrests were reported
</P>
<P>
Ultra-Orthodox Jews demand the street, a major Jerusalem road
that borders the ultra-Orthodox Mea Shearim neighborhood, be
closed to traffic on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the street
must stay open to traffic until a committee examines the
government policy on road use on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
The battle to close the street has become a symbol of the
struggle over how much influence religion should have in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Among Israel's 4.6 million Jews, two-thirds identify themselves
as secular and one-third as observant. About half a million, 10
percent, are ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, about 30 percent of the city's over 400,000 Jews
are ultra-Orthodox.

<HEADLINE> Suburban Shanghai Farmers Becoming White-collar Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- There are now 5,000
foreign-funded enterprises in suburban Shanghai, employing 450,000
rural laborers, many of whom have become managers in the
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Shi Peimin, a farmer's daughter from Xinqiao Village, Songjiang
County, in suburban Shanghai, is one of them, and has become a
"bridge" between the Japanese general manager of a company and its
employees.
</P>
<P>
Shi was hired by the company for her good command of Japanese
and works as an interpreter in the Japanese-funded company, often
introducing her company to visiting Chinese or Japanese guests in
fluent Chinese or Japanese.
</P>
<P>
In a Japanese-funded fashion company in Jinqiao of the Pudong
new area, eight of the foremen are young women farmers who began
working first as laborers on the production line.
</P>
<P>
To enrich their knowledge and improve their management skills,
the company often invites experts to give lectures or even sends
them abroad for further training.
</P>
<P>
Continuing to study and to master more technical skills has
become popular among young farmers working in foreign-funded
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibari Opposition Suggests for Creation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 18 (Xinhua) --The Zanzibari opposition
Civic United Frount (CUF) has suggested for the creation of a
transitional government as one of the options to solve the
political crisis in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made yesteday by CUF's Vice-Chairman Seif
Shariff Hamad while addressing a mass rally held at Malindi
Grounds in the town of zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Hamad said the
transitional government should be headed by a neutral respected
Zanzibari acceptable by the ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) and
CUF, who will appoint ministers from both parties before calling
fresh elections within three months time.
</P>
<P>
To avoid more deteriorating political situation in the Isles,
the option for the transitional government would be suitable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The CUF vice-chairman, who has repeatedly said CUF would never
recognise the present Isles regime, insisted that they had
sufficient evidence to prove that they had won the presidential
elections held last October.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way at all to accept the results because they did
not reflect the wish of the Zanzibaris," he said, claiming that
the Isles Electoral Commission had favoured CCM's incumbent
President Salmin Amour.
</P>
<P>
Hamad said CUF was forced to look for the international
support after efforts to solve the political crisis locally
proved futile despite his party's move to convince the Union
Government of Tanzania for intervention.
</P>
<P>
It is reportedly that the Zanzibari government has insisted on CUF's
recognition of Amour as the President of Zanzibar and of the
present government for any talks toward a solution of the
political statemate in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
Local Press reports indicated that visit of the Commonwealth
Secretary General Chief Anyaoku to Zanzibar few days ago had
produced some results, saying that the CUF was prepared to talk
to the CCM-led government.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Hotels Looking For More Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The annual increase in the
number of overseas visitors to Guangdong has been about eight
percent in recent years, but the growth rate was still 6.5
percentage points on average lower than the number of hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
Even with the number reaching more than 6.1 million last year
and an annual increase of 30 million overseas guests in the coming
five years, it is still barely enough to "feed" the hotels in
Guangdong province, south China.
</P>
<P>
Hotel managers, however, are still making a great effort to
upgrade their business, even if it is only a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong now has more than 830 hotels.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 210 hotels the province had in 1985 could already
satisfy the demand, when the occupancy rate was 72.4 percent, a
very healthy level.
</P>
<P>
A problem now is that Guangdong's hotels are concentrated in
several cities of the Pearl River delta. Statistics show that the
combined number of hotel rooms in the cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai,
Shenzhen, Zhaoqing, and Jiangmen accounts for more than 70 percent
of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
"This means a further problem in the imbalance of supply and
demand," a hotel expert notes.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish hotel business has aroused great concern at the
Guangdong Provincial Tourism Administration, and the local
government is taking steps to deal with this, such as:
</P>
<P>
-- Lowering the prices of luxury hotels. The room price of four
or five-star hotels in Guangdong is now only half that of Beijing
and Shanghai;
</P>
<P>
-- Adding travel and other tourist services, and giving more
preferential treatment, in order to attract more tourists;
</P>
<P>
-- Limiting construction of new hotels. Only when its hotel
occupancy rate surpass 60 percent can a city apply for new hotels,
and;
</P>
<P>
-- If work on a hotel project does not start in two years, the
project will be cancelled.

<HEADLINE> EU To Help Zimbabwe Clear Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
pledged 10 million U.S. Dollars for the landmine clearance
program of Zimbabwe whhere a total of 1.5 million mines are
suspected to have been planted, Chief Executive of the Zimbabwean
Defence Industries Tshinga Dube said yesterday..
</P>
<P>
Dube said, ''Zimbabwe defence industries is now looking for
partners to carry out the demining when funds have been
released.''
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is among the countries worst affected by landmines
which include Angola which is estimated to have 10 million mines
and Mozambique which has about two million mines.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that clearing of a landmine may cost between
300 U.S.Dollars to 1,000 U.S. Dollars. ''To clear landmines in
Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique will require 13 billion
U.S.Dollars which is far more than the national budgets of all
the three countries put together,'' said Dube.
</P>
<P>
The EU proposed assistance comes in the wake of reports that
the national army had only managed to clear 10 percent of the
total mined area in the country due to the shortage of funds and
equipment.

NEW DELHI, August 18 (Xinhua) --Crime in urban India has shown
a consistent rise parallel to the population increase in the last
two decades, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan cities with a population of over one million had a
higher (four-fold) crime rate of 2,467.6 against the national
average of 614.8.
</P>
<P>
Unplanned growth of cities and large floating population are
the major contributory factors for urban crimes, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The commercial capital Bombay had a major share of urban crime
with 15.3 percent of cases under the Indian Penal Code reported
there. It was closely followed by New Delhi, capital of India,
with 14.5 percent and Bangalore, a new industrial city in the
country, with 11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Crime pattern also varied from city to city. While New Delhi
witnessed more incidents of murder, kidnapping, abduction,
criminal breach of trust and cheating than conventional crimes
like dacoity, robbery, Bombay saw more of offenses under the
Indian Passport Act and terrorist related crimes, the same sources
said.

TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran has reconstructed three
provinces destroyed during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war
(1980-1988), Mohammad Hashemi, Vice-President for Executive
Affairs was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Iran said today that the Islamic country has
spent about 1.09 billion U.S. dollars in the rehabilitation of the
war-stricken areas of Kurdestan, West Azarbaijan and Lorestan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction program would be completed by the end of
next Iranian calendar year (ending on March 20, 1997), he added.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi, who is Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani's brother
and the president's special representative in reconstruction
affairs, said a majority of the war-displaced population have
returned to their cities thanks to the renovation of devastated
regions.
</P>
<P>
At present, he added, only 40,000 families were still living in
114 townships and they would return to their home cities by early
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said job creation in war-affected areas was among the prime
objectives of the government, and the government will make
efforts to establish industrial townships, expand agricultural
activities and develop the handicrafts industry in the
regions.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Unemployment Rate Could Be 22 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's true unemployment
rate could be as high as 22.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
While revealing the figure the National Institute of Labor
Studies report said that when the hidden unemployed and
underemployed were taken into account, the country's labor force
underutilisation rate would range between 16.2 and 22.3 percent
with the most likely figure to be about 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The true labor underutilisation rate would take into account
the hidden unemployed not actively seeking work, and those
underemployed working far fewer hours than they wished.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the likely unemployment rate in 2000 would be
between 6.4 and 9.1 percent, depending on the assumed rate of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But the institute believed the most likely outcome was an
official jobless rate in 2000 of 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, prepared for her department,
Employment Minister Amanda Vanstone blamed the former Labor
government for the higher rate, and warned the official
unemployment rate would be harder to reduce as a result.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the report justified the government's
proposals for greater workplace flexibility, microeconomics reform
and balancing the budget.

SEOUL, August 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will hold a national
emergency drill from August 19 to 23 to test the nation's crisis
management readiness, said a government official today.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day contingency exercise, code-named "Ulchi
Exercise '96," a curfew will be imposed, night business will be
suspended and vehicular traffic be limited in specific areas.
</P>
<P>
The government offices across the country will hold emergency
meetings, trainings and other drills under mock crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
This year's war game will be a real-situation one, a shift from
the simulated-situation exercise on the map conducted over the
past years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During the exercise period, he said, power outages and other
mock-up contingencies will be staged area by area at night or
during time slots when inconveniences are least expected.
</P>
<P>
Tap water supply will be suspended for three to four hours in
one area after another in 34 regions.
</P>
<P>
"Sippuje," or an anti-traffic congestion formula that forces
private cars to remain parked once every 10 days, will be enforced
in 20 cities and areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, midnight curfews, abolished in early 1982, will be
briefly revived in 13 cities and regions, affecting the operating
hours of entertainment spots.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic element of the exercise is an unscheduled
anti-air attack drill that will be conducted nationwide at an
unfixed time on August 21, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Ulchi Exercise is designed to promote the people's sense of
national security and prepare them for any emergencies, such as
natural disasters, he added.

<HEADLINE> More Than Thousand Britons Jailed Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- More people from Britain are
jailed abroad for narcotics than from any other western European
nation, the British paper "Independent On Sunday" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Britons have been convicted in 71 countries. The charity
Prisoners Abroad, which traces British nationalists jailed
overseas, believes the total could be as high as 1,800.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners Abroad estimates a quarter are in custody on remand,
awaiting trial, while the rest have been convicted and are serving
their sentences.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said the high figure partly resulted
from some British people's lacking understanding of the border
restrictions between European countries and the consequences of
being caught trafficking drugs abroad.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out last year to test people's reactions to
publicity material on drug trafficking revealed that 70 percent of
those asked believed that British consuls in foreign cities could
automatically get people out of jail.
</P>
<P>
But the fact is that "if you break the law while abroad, you
are likely to end up in jail," said a senior official from the
Foreign Office.

<HEADLINE> APEC to Simplify Process of Food Products Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) is looking for ways to do away with the tedious
and expensive process of multiple testing of food products for
exports, which will result in better quality of food at cheaper
cost.
</P>
<P>
APEC exporters, who have been meeting in Davao city, southern
Philippines, since Thursday, are working on a region-wide mutual
recognition arrangements (MRA) for food products based on the
principle of "once tested, tested everywhere," said a statement
released here today by the APEC '96 news bureau.
</P>
<P>
"This will benefit our exporters because what happens is that
there will be no more multiple testing in case we export our
products within the APEC area," a Philippine trade representative
was quoted as saying by the news bureau.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Federico Macaranas said that
the Philippines has in its list to be included in the MRA fish
products like prawns and shellfish, and fresh fruits, particularly
mangoes and bananas.
</P>
<P>
The simplified testing process would lessen controls and
facilitate release at entry points, and minimize rejects, and
therefore result in fresher and cheaper food products for
consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China,
Hongkong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese
Taipei, Thailand and the united states.

<HEADLINE> More Cancer Cases Registered in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Ministry of Health has
announced that 1,017 new cancer cases, including 858 Jordanian
nationals, were registered in the country's National Cancer
Register (NCR) in the first half of this year, according to
today's Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
The NCR, which was established last year with the help of the
United States, is in charge of rendering information on the number
of cancer cases to help experts to cope with the killer disease,
Minister of Health Aref Batayneh said.
</P>
<P>
"The ratio of cancer cases in Jordan is estimated at 44 per
100,000 persons compared with 350 out of 100,000 inhabitants in
the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the main causes of the disease in Jordan, Samir Kayed,
chief of the NCR, said that "Smoking, bad nutrition and the
consumption of heavy additives, notably in canned food,
constitute a large margin of cancer cases in the kingdom."
</P>
<P>
"The number of cancer cases treated by government hospitals
in Jordan since 1970 is 15,689, of which 1,689 were reported
in 1995 alone," Kayed disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"But these figures reflect only 60 to 70 percent of the
actual cases since the rest were cases handled either by
private hospitals or went unreported," he added.
</P>
<P>
The cases reported consist mainly of breast and lung cancers.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 Join Quit-Smoking Contest in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Israeli
smokers have kicked the habit in order to compete in the "I quit,
I win" smoking cessation campaign sponsored by the Health
Ministry and the Israel Cancer Association.
</P>
<P>
According to English daily the Jerusalem Post today, three of the
smokers will receive airline tickets today for a trip abroad or
free vacations in Israel from Health Minister Tzachi Hanegbi in
his office.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which had been organized three years in
succession, was open to citizens aged 18 and over who had smoked
at least one cigarette a day for a year and who quit at least a month
before the lottery was held on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Each contestant had to provide the names of two witnesses,
who could testify to these qualifications, and be willing to
undergo a medical test to prove that he or she had not
smoked for the required period.
</P>
<P>
The first prize winner will get a ticket to North America on
Air Canada (a smoke-free airline), the second prize is a
tour package to Turkey, and the third is a vacation for two in
Eilat, a Red Sea resort in southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent Israeli health ministry survey, smokers
of the adult Jewish population account for 28 percent, those who
have quit 11 percent, and those who have never touched a
cigarette constitute 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that men (32 percent) are more likely to
smoke than women (25 percent), while the smoking rate is
especially high among men aged between 25 to 44 of Oriental
origin and with only a partial high-school education.
</P>
<P>
The average smoker lights up 18 cigarettes a day, a third
of the smokers smoke 10, another third between 10 to 20 and
the rest more than 21 every day.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons they give for their health-risking behavior
are habit, enjoyment, nervousness and tension.
</P>
<P>
This year, 57 percent of the Israeli smokers who tried to
quit smoking still want to try, among them men account for
60 percent, compared with 48 percent of women smokers.

PYONGYANG, Augest 18 (Xinhua) -- The Worker's Party of the

Japanese cabinet ministers' visit to the Yasukuni Shrine to mourn
Japan's military war dead.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in the party's organ, Rodong Sinmun, said, the
visit was a sign of the revival of militarism in Japan and also an
insult to the feelings of the Asian peoples -- victims of Japan's
aggression during the World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the aim of the visit was to glorify Japan's
aggression, to foster its militarism and to seek hegemony in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Japan should take action to abandon its militarism and make
sincere apologies and compensation to all its victims, the
commentary demanded.

KAMPALA,August 18 (Xinhua) -- The life expectancy of Ugandans
has shortened from 45 years in 1993 to 37 years at present

</P>
<P>
This is contained in a report by Sam Ruteikara, the Excutive
Director of Popcare which has joined in AIDS related projects.
</P>

Ministry and National Development" was made public at the first
national conference for clergy women held recently at Makerere
University.
</P>
<P>
Ruteikara said that because of the low average dying years and
the high number of children being born with the HIV, the life
expectancy in Uganda had been put at 37, one of the lowest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank put Uganda's life expectancy in 1993 at 45.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Zouebi has declared an opposition to the latest U.S. sanction on
Iran, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We declare our opposition to the irrational and aggressive
policies of Washington. We will prove this by signing major
agreements for cooperation and joint investments," Zouebi was
quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying Saturday
evening, when the visiting Syrian prime minister held his first
round of talk with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Habibi.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that Zouebi condemned the D'Amato bill and supported
Iran's principled stand in defiance of "the desire of the United
States and the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed various aspects of Tehran-Damascus
relations as well as the latest regional and international
developments.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's role in the region, Zouebi stated that
his country attaches great importance to its ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the close relations between the two countries could be
considered as a successful pattern of bilateral and multilateral
relations to be followed by other countries, with the Arab states
in particular.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Habibi strongly denounced claims made by the
United States and Israel accusing Iran of supporting international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Washington and Tel Aviv are on top of
the list of countries supporting state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Praising stance taken by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and
Syria's anti-Zionist campaign, the Iranian vice-president said
that the recent moves of the Israeli government proved to be
creating tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent visit to Tehran by Turkish Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan was fruitful.
</P>
<P>
He said that the contacts maintained by senior officials of
Iran, Syria and Turkey will pave way for establishing a common
Islamic market and joint projects, all of which will help promote
peace and stability in the region.
</P>

official visit under the company of a high-level delegation,

<HEADLINE> Solar-Energy Desert Greenhouse Developed In Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
developed a low-cost solar-energy desert greenhouse, The
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The greenhouse whose energy costs are significantly lower than
conventional systems was developed by Professor Dov Pastemak and
Doctor Eli Korin of Ben-Gurion University and engineer Uri Dror of
the Nifla Ltd. company.
</P>
<P>
They built a greenhouse with tunnel-like section covered with
plastic, screened windows and two solar cells containing a plastic
sleeve full of water. A mobile polythene screen allows maximum
penetration of sun during the day and thermal insulation at night.
</P>
<P>
The innovative system, recently displayed at the Agritech
exhibition in Tel Aviv, has a number of benefits: the operating
costs are a third of conventional greenhouses; no mist is created
inside, the leaves do not become wet. In addition it can be run
either automatically or manually in places lacking electricity.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Pastemak, the patented system is suited
especially to desert climates with strong sunlight. On clear
summer nights, the system raises the inside temperature by 9
degrees Celsius above the outside temperature. On a cloudy night
after a rainy day, inside temperatures are 6 degrees higher
than outside.

<HEADLINE> Iran Not to Cancel Massive Gas Deal with Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran today ruled out the
possibility of canceling or making any change in the 20 billion
dollar gas deal with Turkey despite U.S. opposition.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Turkey's national
 will and its energy requirements guaranteed Ankara's purchase of
Iranian gas.
</P>
<P>
"Any change in the government of that country would not
affect the gas deal," the Iranian minister was quoted by the
Persian daily "Iran" as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the draft agreement was prepared "at the time of
Tansu Ciller's government."
</P>
<P>
The statement by Aqazadeh could be interpreted as a defense by
the Iranian government to keep Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan from harm under the tremendous pressure by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh disclosed that during his visit last year to Turkey,
President Suleyman Demirel called for measures to speed up the
signing of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he stressed the political will of the Turkish
side led to the finalization of the agreement, which was
signed during the recent trip to Tehran of Turkish Prime
Minister Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey needed Iranian gas to meet its energy needs, he
said, noting the demand dated back to some 40 years ago and
the practical request was made in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh cited statistics showing that Turkey needed 41 billion
cubic meters of gas annually, only one-fourth of which is
being supplied by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ankara imports the remaining part of its gas requirements
from Russia and Algeria, and is seeking more imports from
Tehran as well.
</P>
<P>
On the payment procedure, Aqazadeh said, gas deliveries would
be paid in cash, with the value of purchases computed on
the basis of a formula wherein the annual change in the
price of gas would be calculated.
</P>
<P>
He said gas exports to Turkey were scheduled to begin in
1999, adding that in the initial stage, three billion cubic
meters of gas would be transferred annually.
</P>
<P>
This amount would increase to 10 billion cubic meters a
year according to an agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
A 260-kilometer pipeline will be installed from Tabriz to the
Iran-Turkish border, from where Turkey needs another 1,000-kilometer
pipeline to transport the gas to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The gas deal covers a period of 22 years, starting 1999,
and provides for the export of some 190 billion cubic meters
of Iranian natural gas worth 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the U.S. sanctions against companies
cooperating with Tehran in the oil sector were doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that such punitive measures would have no
impact on Iran's oil, gas and petrochemical industries, either
in the short run or over a longer period of time.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns the U.S. Power Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) condemned U.S. President Bill Clinton for
signing the D'amato Bill tightening sanctions against Libya and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the bill showed that "Washington's power
politics will get it nowhere," said Rodong Sinmun, DPRK's official
newspaper, in a commentary today.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the paper added, developments after the move showed
that the conflict of interests between the U.S. and its allies
were getting more serious.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the D'amato Bill on August 5 that punishes all
non-American companies investing 40 million U.S. dollars or more
annually in the energy projects of Libya or Iran.
</P>
<P>
The paper recalled, before the signing of the bill, "American
sanctions against Libya and Iran had failed to achieve the
expected results, and made Washington lose its leading role among
its allies."
</P>
<P>
Attempting to regain its influence over the oil-rich Middle
East region, Washington, on the pretext of "combating terrorism,"
passed the D'amato Bill, the paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, in the past two weeks since the bill was signed, the
U.S. had drawn wide spread condemnation and rejection from Libya,
Iran, the European Union countries and the international
community, the paper concluded.

<HEADLINE> From "Serial Sanctions" to "Serial Protests:" Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Placing its own law above international laws and practicing
extraterritoriality showed incisively the U.S. hegemonical
ideology of overweening arrogance, and that those who submitted
would prosper and those who resisted would perish, it said.
</P>
<P>
The law also showed that the U.S. ideology of power politics
had shifted from politics to economy, and its means of sanctions
from multilateral joint sanctions to unilateral sanctions, and
with its targets from rivals of ideology and geological politics
to its allies, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that "unilateralism" and "serial sanctions"
seemed truculent in appearance, but revealed the lack of
confidence and uneasiness of the U.S. over the centrifugal trend
among its allies, in a world where multi-polarization prevailed.
</P>
<P>
As the only superpower after the end of the Cold War, the U.S.,
"having the U.N. in its power and ordering other nations about in
its name," stubbornly practiced multilateral interventionism and
succeeded in certain cases, the article said.
</P>
<P>
However, more obstruction had emerged as its political and
economic clashes with its allies increased.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had repeatedly tried to persuade its allies into
accepting a joint sanction on Iran and Libya but failed. To rid
it of the predicament, it attempted to bind its alliances on its
chariot by imposing the "serial sanctions," so they could charge
forward to build a new international order "headed" by the U.S.,
said the article.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities had never expected that its "serial
sanctions" would arouse "serial" hissings, "serial" condemnations
and protests, and possibly "serial" countersanctions, it pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The d'Amato act and the Helms-Burton law violated politically
the U.N. principle of equality and sovereignty, and economically
it would destroy the agreed World Trade Organization regulations,
which might aggravate regional tensions and produce unfavorable
impacts on the security and development of world trade, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
An article in the U.S.A. Today newspaper said that the
U.S. government had imposed or threatened to impose sanctions on
almost any other nation, with all kinds of excuses, with none
producing effective results.
</P>
<P>
This was the truth, which showed that in a world where
multi-polarization prevailed, it went against the will of the
people to practice power politics, and it was in vain to impose
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Only through dialogue and consultations on the basis of
equality, and by developing mutually beneficial cooperation, could
regional and world peace, security, development and prosperity be
promoted, the article added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Wants to Resolve Water Issue with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is determined to
resolve the issue of sharing the Ganges water with India before
the next lean season begins in January, Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad told a press conference here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We must find a solution to this long-standing problem before
the next lean period ... We have no alternative," Azad said.
</P>
<P>
Sharing the Ganges water is one of the irritants in the
relations between the two neighboring countries. The last
bilateral agreement on the issue expired in 1989 and the two
countries have not reached any new one since then.
</P>
<P>
Azad said that a number of problems had cropped up between
India and Bangladesh over the last 21 years since India
constructed the Farakka barrage to control the Ganges flow in
1975. "Now the ice has started melting," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Foreign Secretary Farooq Sobhan, during his recent
visit to India, discussed with Indian leaders many outstanding
bilateral issues, such as the sharing of waters, the trade
imbalance, security problems on both sides of the Bangladesh-India
border and Bangladesh's purchase of electricity from India.
</P>
<P>
Azad said he hoped that the forthcoming three-day visit to
Bangladesh by his Indian counterpart I.K. Gujral beginning on
September 6 would help expedite the process of resolving those
issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Shandong, a leading agricultural
province in east China, has generated an extra 10 billion yuan
after a decade of a Harvest Program.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive Harvest Program is aimed at speeding
practical agro-science and techniques, and getting high yields of
main crops in large areas of farmland. Since it was organized by
the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Finance and was
put into practice in 1987, the program has covered 45 million
hectares of farmland across the country.
</P>
<P>
After Shandong Province implemented the "Harvest Programme" in
1987, it has adopted more than 1,000 items of agro-techniques, and
increased grain production by 3.8 million tons, peanuts by 200,000
tons, livestock by 700,000 tons and aquatic products by 200,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
And the time period to popularize agro-technology was shortened
from five to two years.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Orders Ugandan Rebels To Join LRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua)-- The Sudanese government has
ordered Ugandan rebel groups in Sudan to merge under the command
of Joseph Kony, leader of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA),
reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence sources in the Uganda People's Defence
Forces were quoted as saying that the rebel groups to be merged
are: the LRA, which is based in Aruu, southern Sudan and is
currently operating in northern Ugandan districts of Gulu and
Kitgum, the remnants of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF ) and the
recently formed Ugandan National Rescue Front led by Ali Bamuze.
</P>
<P>
The proposed headquarters of the merged group will be located
in Kajo-Keji in Sudan's Western Equatoria, the former base of the
Sudan People's Liberation Army which the Sudanese government
troops captured in 1994, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In an interveiw with the paper yesterday, Ugandan Minister of
State for Defence Amama Mbabazi yesterday said that it had been a
long-term strategy by Sudan to destablise northern Uganda, using
proxiies like WNBF and LRA before moving in by itself to capture
and occupy it.
</P>
<P>
The military intellegence sources said that Sudan intends to
form a strong single group by which it could launch a major
offensive against the Ugandan government troops in November this
year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Vows to Defend Thai Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Thailand
will not hesitate to enter the currency market to defend the Thai
baht if it is challenged by foreign speculators, Governor of the
bank Rerngchai Marakanond vowed at a Southeast Asian foreign
exchange forum.
</P>
<P>
His statement at the forum in Phuket, southern Thailand
Saturday served as a warning to currency speculators that they
could lose heavily if they apply pressure on the baht because the
Central Bank would play an active and stabilizing role in foreign
exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
Currency speculators have repeatedly bet on rumors that
Thailand will be forced to devalue the baht to jump-start exports
and tackle its current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Bank of Thailand, for the first time,
entered the forward currency swap market in Hong Kong and
Singapore to defend the baht after it had been heavily dumped on
rumors of a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
With international reserves of 39 billion U.S. dollars,
Thailand is financially capable of dealing with any foreign attack
on its currency, the governor was quoted as saying by reports from
Phuket.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai stressed that the Central Bank had no policy to
adjust the present exchange rate (about 25 baht to the U.S.
dollar) or the exchange rate arrangement, under which the baht is
fixed to a basket of currencies dominated by the U.S. dollar, the
Japanese yen and the German mark.

<HEADLINE> From "Serial Sanctions" to "Serial Protests:" Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been left
standing lonely and condemned worldwide for its d'Amato Act which
was aimed at toughing sanctions against Iran and Libya, an article
in the lastest issue of the Chinese news weekly, Outlook, says.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "From 'Serial Sanctions' to 'Serial Protests,'" the
article written by Chun Jiang said that even the Western allies of
the U.S., such as Germany, France and Britain, had protested
against the act, saying they would retaliate by adopting
countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
The d'Amato act, which U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into
law early this month, authorizes the U.S. to punish any foreign
oil company that invests more than 40 million U.S. dollars in Iran
and Libya, two countries accused by Washington of supporting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The uproar is similar to that over the U.S. anti-Cuba
Helms-Burton law, which the U.S. Congress passed in March in
retaliation for the shooting down in February of two
U.S.-registered aircraft by Cuban jet fighters, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Amid strong opposition, Clinton withdrew and declared
suspended implementation of the third article of the law for suing
foreign companies buying or selling Cuban assets once belonging to
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
In less than half a year, the U.S., time and again, brandished
its stick of sanctions and was repeatedly rebuffed, the first time
in its postwar history.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance caused by its sanctions reflects both the
hegemonical thinking of U.S. authorities and the
multi-polarization of the world after the end of the Cold War, the
article noted.
</P>
<P>
It also reflected the strong wishes of world people, including
people of Western countries, to oppose power politics, pursue
independence and self-determination, and to strive for peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed the d'Amato law with the excuse that Iran and
Libya "might" be linked respectively to the June 25 bombing of a
U.S. base in Saudi Arabia, and the explosion of a TWA jet plane on
July 17, despite the fact that it had so far found no evidence.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.S. had been considering the d'Amato law several
months before the two tragedies. And the proposal of the
anti-Cuba law was also made before the shooting down of the two
U.S. planes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was actually practicing interventionism to make itself
a dictator of international political and economic affairs, on the
pretext of "anti-terrorism", as the media in Western countries put
it, the article said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Something new about the d'Amato act was that it had the nature
of implicating others -- "serial sanctions." Both friends and
foes alike were subject to U.S. punishment so long as they did not

<HEADLINE> A Tibetan Father Of Four College Students  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Several years ago, a Tibetan
father vowed that no matter how difficult or expensive, he would
send his children to school.
</P>
<P>
"You should no longer be illiterate like me -- you should lead
a better life. A more-civilized Tibetan can only come from a
better educated generation," the father told his five children.
</P>
<P>
Today, the father's dream has almost come true: four of his
children have attended or graduated from college.
</P>
<P>
Gesong Dawa, the 60-year-old retired worker from a middle
school in Tibet's Xigaze prefecture, remembers clearly how he
watched his hopes become reality.
</P>
<P>
He recalls how he and his children walked more than ten
kilometers to and from school, and how he and his wife, a peasant
woman, borrowed money for their children's schooling from all of
their friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
He also remembers his sadness upon learning his oldest daughter
had dropped out of school without telling to him, in order to save
money for her younger brother and sisters' educations.
</P>
<P>
And he remembers how he stopped his second daughter from
dropping out like her elder sister.
</P>
<P>
But most unforgettable was the summer of 1986, when news
arrived that his daughter Ciren had been admitted to the Tibetan
Medicine Institute in Lhasa and another daughter, Yangzong, had
been accepted by the Tibetan Nationality College in Xianyang,
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Two years later, his only son, Qongda was accepted into Tibet
University.
</P>
<P>
At the time, a college education was free in Tibet, but
traveling and living expenses were still beyond his means.
</P>
<P>
During the last six years, Gesong Dawa spent anywhere from
50,000 yuan to 60,000 Yuan (about 6,630 US dollars) on his
children's education, most of which was loaned from his workplace,
friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of each school semester, after his children
were packed off to college with adequate funds, he and his wife
lived frugally, economizing on food and clothing, he said.

<P>
"In the most difficult two years, there was no money to buy
meat or vegetables, even during holidays and festivals," said his
oldest daughter, Chipu.
</P>
<P>
During a year especially marked with financial difficulty,
Gesong Dawa's youngest child, Lazhen, was accepted into Chongqing
Teacher's College in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Many people encouraged Gesong Dawa to let one of his children
drop out, and the master of a middle school even promised to
arrange a job for his son.
</P>
<P>
"The child had wished so long and worked so hard to pass the
college entrance exam, how could I open my mouth to stop his dream
and ask him to give up halfway?" Gesong Dawa asked.
</P>
<P>
Now, after years of financial strain, Gesong Dawa's situation
is improving: three of his children have graduated from college
and found jobs in the autonomous region. They send money to the
family, and to their younger sister who is still studying in
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
During holiday get-togethers, the family's spirits are high.
</P>
<P>
"Every time Father see us, the question he asks the most is how
our work and studies are going. He tells us to work hard and not
be unworthy of our education," said his children.

<HEADLINE> India to Launch New Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- India is making preparations
for the scheduled launch of the Indian Satellite-2D (INSAT-2D)
from Kourou in French Guiana either by the end of this year or
early next year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of the Indian Satellite Research
Organization (ISRO) Dr. Kasturirangan, the satellite, an identical
version of the INSAT-2C, would be able to provide additional
capacity for television transmission, mobile communication and
telecom network.
</P>
<P>
Another important program on the ISRO's agenda was the launch
of the Remote Sensing Satellite IRS-ID, the successor to the
IRS-IC, sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
The IRS-IC had already been catching up fast with its services
and providing necessary on-orbit back-up, said the ISRO chairman.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ISRO is developing the IRS-P4 satellite which
is due to be launched by the end of 1997 or early 1998, said Dr.
Kasturirangan.
</P>
<P>
He said the satellite, useful for the study of atmosphere and
ocean surface, would comprise an ocean sensor operating in visible
and nearly infra-red channel. It would also have a
multi-frequency radiometer operating at microwave length, he said.
</P>
<P>
The indigenously made cryogenic engine is targeted to become
fully operational by the end of the century and the ISRO
scientists are grappling with the working of its various
parameters, he added.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Elections Set for May 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Elections in liberia which might
have been held this month will be organised on or about May 30,
1997, Xinhua learned here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued at mid-night Saturday shortly
after the meeting of the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), modalities
for the organisation of the elections will be formulated, taking
into account the electoral laws of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The new schedule also provides for the dissolution of all
factions in war-torn Liberia by January 31, 1997, resignation by
february 28 of the country's Council of State and public office
holders who wish to run for election.
</P>
<P>
The new government is expected to be sworn in on June 15 next
year, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the situation in Liberia, heads of state and
government of the committee of nine re-affirmed that the Abuja
agreement remained the best and last framework for finding
durable peace in Liberia and should thus be retained in its
entirety.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Liberia's warring factions last
August in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, was designed to usher in
peace and lead to the organisation of free and democratic
elections on August 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Since it is already impossible to adhere to the original
implementation schedule, the meeting therefore approved that the
validity of the Abuja agreement be extended for another nine
months from August 21, 1996 to June 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the new implementation plan, disarmament and
demobilisation of Liberia's warring factions will be carried out
between November 22 this year and January 31 next year.
</P>
<P>
A number measures have also been decided to be invoked against
any defaulting party and ensure compliance with the peace plan,
according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
To improve the effectiveness and cohesives of the Liberia
Council of State, heads of state and government agreed to the
appointment of Ruth Perry, a former senator of the Republic of
Liberia, as the new chair person, replacing Professor Wilton
Sankawulo, the communique said, adding that if in the future any
council member who wants to be replaced would have it done.

<HEADLINE> From "Serial Sanctions" to "Serial Protests:" Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been left
standing lonely and condemned worldwide for its d'Amato Act which
was aimed at toughing sanctions against Iran and Libya, an article
in the lastest issue of the Chinese news weekly, Outlook, says.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "From 'Serial Sanctions' to 'Serial Protests,'" the
article written by Chun Jiang said that even the Western allies of
the U.S., such as Germany, France and Britain, had protested
against the act, saying they would retaliate by adopting
countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
The d'Amato act, which U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into
law early this month, authorizes the U.S. to punish any foreign
oil company that invests more than 40 million U.S. dollars in Iran
and Libya, two countries accused by Washington of supporting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The uproar is similar to that over the U.S. anti-Cuba
Helms-Burton law, which the U.S. Congress passed in March in
retaliation for the shooting down in February of two
U.S.-registered aircraft by Cuban jet fighters, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Amid strong opposition, Clinton withdrew and declared
suspended implementation of the third article of the law for suing
foreign companies buying or selling Cuban assets once belonging to
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
In less than half a year, the U.S., time and again, brandished
its stick of sanctions and was repeatedly rebuffed, the first time
in its postwar history.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance caused by its sanctions reflects both the
hegemonical thinking of U.S. authorities and the
multi-polarization of the world after the end of the Cold War, the
article noted.
</P>
<P>
It also reflected the strong wishes of world people, including
people of Western countries, to oppose power politics, pursue
independence and self-determination, and to strive for peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed the d'Amato law with the excuse that Iran and
Libya "might" be linked respectively to the June 25 bombing of a
U.S. base in Saudi Arabia, and the explosion of a TWA jet plane on
July 17, despite the fact that it had so far found no evidence.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.S. had been considering the d'Amato law several
months before the two tragedies. And the proposal of the
anti-Cuba law was also made before the shooting down of the two
U.S. planes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was actually practicing interventionism to make itself
a dictator of international political and economic affairs, on the
pretext of "anti-terrorism", as the media in Western countries put
it, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It said that to impose economic sanctions to contain its
political rivals and to protect its own interests was an important
means of the U.S. to seek hegemonism during the Cold War period.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the U.S. imposed sanctions against Iran and
Libya, with the conspicuous aim of safeguarding the economic
lifeline of the West -- oil supply, and to grab the strategic
initiative in the Gulf region and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
As early as the 1960s, the U.S. imposed sanctions and an
embargo against Cuba, both out of consideration over ideological
struggles and of maintaining order in its backyard -- the Central
and Latin Americas -- to keep its overlordship there.
</P>
<P>
Something new about the d'Amato act was that it had the nature
of implicating others -- "serial sanctions." Both friends and
foes alike were subject to U.S. punishment so long as they did not
behave in third countries in accordance with the U.S. law,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Placing its own law above international laws and practicing
extraterritoriality showed incisively the U.S. hegemonical
ideology of overweening arrogance, and that those who submitted
would prosper and those who resisted would perish, it said.
</P>
<P>
The law also showed that the U.S. ideology of power politics
had shifted from politics to economy, and its means of sanctions
from multilateral joint sanctions to unilateral sanctions, and
with its targets from rivals of ideology and geological politics
to its allies, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that "unilateralism" and "serial sanctions"
seemed truculent in appearance, but revealed the lack of
confidence and uneasiness of the U.S. over the centrifugal trend
among its allies, in a world where multi-polarization prevailed.
</P>
<P>
As the only superpower after the end of the Cold War, the U.S.,
"having the U.N. in its power and ordering other nations about in
its name," stubbornly practiced multilateral interventionism and
succeeded in certain cases, the article said.
</P>
<P>
However, more obstruction had emerged as its political and
economic clashes with its allies increased.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had repeatedly tried to persuade its allies into
accepting a joint sanction on Iran and Libya but failed. To rid
it of the predicament, it attempted to bind its alliances on its
chariot by imposing the "serial sanctions," so they could charge
forward to build a new international order "headed" by the U.S.,
said the article.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities had never expected that its "serial
sanctions" would arouse "serial" hissings, "serial" condemnations
and protests, and possibly "serial" countersanctions, it pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The d'Amato act and the Helms-Burton law violated politically
the U.N. principle of equality and sovereignty, and economically
it would destroy the agreed World Trade Organization regulations,
which might aggravate regional tensions and produce unfavorable
impacts on the security and development of world trade, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
An article in the U.S.A. Today newspaper said that the
U.S. government had imposed or threatened to impose sanctions on
almost any other nation, with all kinds of excuses, with none
producing effective results.
</P>
<P>
This was the truth, which showed that in a world where
multi-polarization prevailed, it went against the will of the
people to practice power politics, and it was in vain to impose
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Only through dialogue and consultations on the basis of
equality, and by developing mutually beneficial cooperation, could
regional and world peace, security, development and prosperity be
promoted, the article added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Warlord's Airline Starts Peshawar-Mazar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Balkh Airline run
by Junbush-i-Melli leader Rashid Dostum has started its regular
service between Pakistan's Peshawar and Afghanistan's
Mazar-i-Sharif where Junbush headquarters are located, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Russian-made aircraft 201-Balkh landed at the Peshawar
airport Saturday with 11 crew members and 35 passengers, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The passengers, who received a warm welcome from authorities of
Pakistan International Airline, presented special Afghan fruits to
staff working at the Peshawar airport.
</P>
<P>
The schedule of Balkh's air service between Peshawar and
Mazar-i-Sharif has yet to be finalized, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
For the initial operation, Thursday has been fixed for the
Balkh aircraft to fly back to Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan agreed in principle earlier this month to allow the
Balkh Airline to start its regular Peshawar-Mazar air service.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the air link would play a vital role in
strengthening trade ties between the two countries and in the
region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
After the Pakistani embassy in Kabul was gutted by thousands of
protesters in September last year, the Pakistani government cut
down the air link between Kabul and Peshawar, the only air bridge
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Mystery of Mass Mouse Suicide Solved (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Three years ago, a group of
Kazakh herdsmen in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region were astonished and stunned by an unusual sight: thousands
upon thousands of mice jumping into a lake, apparently to their
death.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists and scholars who studied the tragedy have
found more bizarre phenomena about the citellus cauricus, or
"yellow mouse."
</P>
<P>
The mice are between 16 and 26 cm long, and have a tail half
the length of their body. Researchers say the speed at which they
propagate and perish is rare.
</P>
<P>
During the March-July period in 1993, the number of the mice on
the Altae grassland soared from 40 to 1,600 per ha, but in
December, the figure plummeted to 280. By the next spring, they
had suddenly disappeared from the area.
</P>
<P>
Scholars hunted for two days without finding a single mouse. It
was estimated there were no more than ten mice per ha then.
</P>
<P>
The skyrocketing mouse population, their shrinking food
resources and increasingly worsening environment are thought to be
some of the causes of the mass suicide, according to Ni Yunhao, a
researcher from the Xinjiang office in charge of locust and mouse
control.

<HEADLINE> Mystery of Mass Mouse Suicide Solved  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Ni, the grown mice usually weigh between 50 and 70
grams.
</P>
<P>
Even in the peak period of a plague, young mice weighing only
17 grams are capable of multiplying, which leads to unhealthy baby
mice that are said to be hypersensitive and often deranged.
</P>
<P>
That is one of the causes of the mass suicide, Ni said.
</P>
<P>
The propagation of the mouse is determined by the amount of
food they eat and their sexual drive, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, he said, the mice can even sense how much grass
will grow in a year.
</P>
<P>
Ni Yunhao acknowledged that the yellow mice, known in some
places as "big-eyed devils" because of their protruding eyes, are
very common on the desert and grassland areas north of the
Tianshan Mountains.
</P>
<P>
One of the most hazardous rodents in those regions, they can
destroy entire patches of grassland during peak population periods.
</P>
<P>
To date, the autonomous region has made some progress in its
mouse control. The Xinjiang office in charge of locust and mice
control has studied the rodents' population fluctuation, species
and groups changes, dispersion and methods to control their high
numbers.
</P>
<P>
During his research on the mice, Ni set a record by autopsying
2,000 in one week.
</P>
<P>
The study of the mouse is a worldwide mystery, Ni added.
</P>
<P>
"We have merely opened the book on the subject," he said. "We
still have a lot of work to do. And we need more support and
cooperation."

<HEADLINE> China Lets More State-Owned Firms Go Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-eight major industrial
cities in China, which will pilot the central government's
restructuring of state-owned enterprises, have been accelerating
the pace of reform this year by allowing more firms to go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, 215 state companies, with
9.35 billion yuan worth of property and 172,000 employees, were
merged, and 131 state-owned firms were in the red, with 102,000
workers affected.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted its Bankruptcy Law in 1988, a number of its
money-losing state enterprises have been shut down under the
procedures set forth in the law. The reforms were slow and
cautious, however, because of fears of social instability and
other problems.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the State Economic
and Trade Commission, only 940 state-owned enterprises went
bankrupt between 1988 and 1993, less than 200 a year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national seminar in Taiyuan, capital city of
North China's Shanxi Province, recently, Chen noted that more and
more Chinese cities, especially the old industrial bases such as
Shanghai, Shenyang, and Harbin, have become bolder and more
experienced in carrying out the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Some cities have worked out local laws and regulations, trying
to link annexing and bankruptcies to taking care of employees, to
handle the matter more reasonably and smoothly, while at the same
time trying hard to safeguard the interests of those whose money
is at stake.

<P>
Chen praised the cities for efforts they have been making at
dealing with the matter in various ways, including some
experiments being tried to revive the bankrupt firms by setting up
a modern managerial mechanism or creating a joint venture between
the bankrupt firm and a buyer.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the pilot cities have stepped up their
reform experiments over the past two years. In Shanghai, the
country's largest metropolis and industrial base, 670 state-owned
enterprises have gone bankrupt so far. And many other cities
followed suit.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Chooses Perot as Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Reform Party, the newly
formed third party of the United States, selected Texas
billionaire Ross Perot as its first-ever presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Perot received 32,145 votes, or 65.2 percent, against his
challenger Richard Lamm's 17,121 votes, or 34.8 percent, the
party's chairman, Russ Verney, announced today at Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
Verney said 88 percent of the ballots were cast by mail, 8
percent by telephone and 4 percent on party members' personal
computers on the internet.
</P>
<P>
Perot, who has not yet announced a running mate, is expected to
give an acceptance speech on Sunday evening before some 2,000
party members in the second of a two-stage convention. The party
held its first stage convention on August 11 in Long Beach,
California.
</P>
<P>
Perot, who ran for the presidency as an independent in 1992 and
received 19 percent of the popular vote, will be facing an uphill
battle.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted by Newsweek following the Republican National
Convention showed that President Bill Clinton had 44 percent
support, Dole received 42 percent and the candidate nominated by
Perot's Reform Party received only 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Reform Party named its candidate three days after the
Republicans nominated Bob Dole at a traditional political
convention in San Diego. The Democrats were scheduled to hold
their convention in Chicago on August 26 to nominate President
Clinton for a second term.

<HEADLINE> Bhutan Deports Refugee Marchers to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bhutanese authorities have
deported to India 50 Bhutanese refugees who were arrested soon
after they marched into Bhutan via India on Thursday, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The refugees had been on a peace march from Nepal to Bhutan
appealing for the free repatriation of nearly 100,000 Bhutanese
refugees living in Nepal, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Bhutanese police dropped off all the 50 refugees on Friday
night at various places in east India's border district of
Jalpaiguli, according to a press release by a Bhutanese refugee
group in Nepal -- the Appeal Movement Coordination Council (AMCC)
-- which launched the peace march campaign.
</P>
<P>
A number of Similar marches have also failed before as Indian
police intercepted and arrested the marchers when they tried to
enter Bhutan through India.
</P>
<P>
The AMCC issued an appeal to Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda on Saturday for the immediate departure of Bhutanese
citizens in India for Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the Indian government to mediate between Bhutan
and Nepal to help resolve the lingering refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of bilateral talks between Bhutan and Nepal made
no progress in the issue as Bhutan refused to recognize these
refugees, who were forced to flee Bhutan six years ago, as genuine
Bhutanese citizens, the reports said.

NEW YORK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese living or studying in
the U.S. have launched a series of protests against NBC, a leading
television, for its irresponsible and hostile comments against
China and the Chinese team during the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 Chinese organizations representing 70,000 Chinese

While introducing the Chinese team, Costas said there are (in
China) "problems with human rights, copyright disputes, and the
threat posed to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The organizations demanded that Costas and NBC should "publicly
apologize for their ignominious prejudice and inhospitality."
</P>
<P>
Many other Chinese voiced their protest through telephone
calls, fax machines and electronic mails on the Internet.
</P>

BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 Vietnamese boat people
in a refugee camp in Thailand slashed themselves with knives and
scissors to escape being sent back to Vietnam on Saturday under
the Orderly Departure Program, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The self-inflicted wounds enabled the Vietnamese to go to
hospital for treatment instead of being put on board two flights
to Vietnam. The incident, however, did not stop the return of 170
economic refugees to Vietnam On Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Damri Wattanasing, deputy permanent secretary of the Thai
Interior Ministry, was quoted as saying that the Vietnamese
mutilated themselves when policemen entered the Sikhiu refugee
camp, northern Thailand, shortly before dawn to send home 200
Vietnamese refugees.
</P>

The Thai Interior Ministry began repatriating boat people from
the Sikhiu refugee camp on June 29 under the Orderly Departure
Program implemented by Thailand, Vietnam and the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4,000 boat people at the camp were screened by the
UNHCR and declared economic refugees, which makes them ineligible
for resettlement in third countries.
</P>
<P>
A total 87 boat people were sent home in the first batch of
returnees on June 29. The Thai Interior Ministry plans to clear
the camp of boat people by September when funding from the UNHCR

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Kidnappers Demands Firm Stop Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A gang who kidnapped 13 workers
of the timber company Pt. Kamundan Raya in Indonesia's easternmost
province of Irian Jaya has demanded the firm stop its logging
operations in exchange for the hostages' release, the Antara news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first of a set of prerequisites raised by M. Yogi,
leader of the local gang GPK, to regional military commander Maj.
Gen. Dunindja on Saturday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The GPK said the company's logging activities have caused
uncontrolled environmental damage in Fak-Fak regency.
</P>
<P>
The gang also demanded the appointment of Tom Beanal, leader of
the Amungme tribal group, as mediator for the hostage release, and
the involvement of a human rights organization in the process of
negotiations on the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Dunindja was quoted as saying that the military was still
considering the GPK's demands as it wants to use a more persuasive
way to secure the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the military would never be engaged
in whatever form of negotiations with "trouble-makers."
</P>
<P>
The security force was reported to have spotted the location of
the hostage-takers, which is not too far from Pt. Kamundan Raya's
logging area.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping, which occurred in the timber company's base
camp on Wednesday night, was the second in Irian Jaya this year.
</P>
<P>
A group of Indonesian and foreign scientists were kidnapped on
January 8 in Maphnduma, a small village in central Irian Jaya.
The kidnappers released some of the hostages and the rest were
rescued by the Indonesian armed forces in May after a military
operation.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai opposition party leaders
have decided to grill Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa as the
only target in a no-confidence debate expected early next month.
</P>
<P>
Opposition party leaders on Saturday signed a no-confidence
motion, which will be submitted to the speaker of the House of
Representatives as soon as the 1997 budget bill clears the House
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have repeatedly blamed the Banharn
government for economic problems and corruption which they said
for the most part stem from its partisan and personal profiteering
conduct and lack of credibility in the eyes of domestic and
foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The opposition believes that it is time the head of government
was changed and therefore it decided to take just the prime
minister to task.
</P>
<P>
Opposition sources said the prime minister will be grilled by
30 opposition MPs for three days on more than 10 issues.
</P>
<P>
Following the withdrawal of the Palang Dharma (Virtue Force)
Party from the seven-party coalition government last Wednesday,
the government now controls 209 seats in the 391-member House of
Representatives, only 13 seats more than the minimum number a
government needs to stay in office.

business daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total cost for the semiconductor manufacturing project is

U.S. dollars), of which 15 percent will be covered by Sharp, the
Nihon Deizai Shimbun said in a dispatch from Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and European companies will also participate in the
project at a joint venture to be set up with paid-up capital of
100 million ringgits, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
ASICs are microchips that can be customized to carry out
specific functions. They are resistant to wild fluctuations in
market prices for computer chips.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government plans to throw support behind the
Sarawak State-led project by granting a 10-year corporate tax
exemption to those that join it, the paper said.

such as information on wanted persons, arrested persons, modus
operandi, vehicle intelligence, maritime offenses, stolen
property, missing persons and organized crime syndicates.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Contracts Prioritized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai municipal government
encouraged more local firms to bid for overseas contracts and
invest abroad, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi told the Municipal Working Conference
on Foreign Economic Relations this week that the city government
has recognized contracting projects and making investment abroad
as an important way to push forward Shanghai's economy.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai started bidding to build factories and infrastructure
projects overseas a decade ago, marketing the skills of local
engineers and architect.
</P>
<P>
Xu said past experience has proven that such activities are an
efficient way to ratchet up foreign trade, adding that overseas
contracting and investment helps the city to explore the world
market.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that local firms need to do more homework
before engaging in contracting projects and making investment
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to establish an information network in
order to assist decision-making by local firms, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned at the conference that Shanghai plans to set up a
municipal task force to co-ordinate the development of the
sector.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Ties with India Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The high growth in China's
imports from India so far this year, one of the fastest growth
rates among China's major trading partners, illustrates the hugh
potential of Sino-India trade, an official from the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) has commented.
</P>
<P>
According to customs statistics, China imported 308 million US
dollars worth of products from India during January-June, leaping
83.3 percent of 1995. total bilateral trade reached 462 million,
up 15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liang Wentao, deputy division chief Moftec's Asian affairs
department, said "India has been our number-one trading partner in
South Asia for two year."
</P>
<P>
The dynamic development of Sino-Indian trade started in the
early 1990s, making last year's bilateral trade more than five
times that of 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, having started at a relatively low level, the two-way
trade is till far below its full potential. Trade with India
constitutes only 0.4 percent of China's total foreign trade and
2.3 percent of India's external trade.
</P>
<P>
Liang pointed to the huge potential still waiting to be tapped,
as the vast populations and industrial development of the two
countries make them big markets for each other. Their geographical
closeness is another important factor.
</P>
<P>
"The products of the two giants among developing countries are
extremely complementary," he said. Liang noted that Chinese
imports from India, mainly consisting of mineral resources and raw
materials, are meeting good market demand at home while Chinese
exports are welcomed by India.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Upsets Graf in Acura Classic Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Lindsay Davenport of the
United States upset world No. 1 Steffi Graf in straight sets to
enter the final of the Acura Classic tournament in Manhattan
Beach, the United States, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to AP reports, Davenport surprised the German great
6-3, 6-3 in the semifinals, handing Graf her first loss in the
United States since November 1994.
</P>
<P>
Anke Huber of Germany, the second seed, played Karina Habsudova
of Slovakia in the evening semifinal. The final is Sunday.
</P>
<P>
``I don't know if it's sunk in yet. It means so much to me that
I was able to really pull it out,'' Davenport said of her first
victory over Graf in five career meetings.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, Atlanta Olympic champion who ranked 10th in the
world, lost in three sets to Graf at Indian Wells, California, in
February and had match point against co-No. 1 Monica Seles earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
``I couldn't really get myself up to fight for every point
because I just kept missing them early,'' Graf said. ``I tried but
it felt like I had no timing.''
</P>
<P>
Graf lost for just the 44th time in 10 years. Her last previous
straight-set defeat was 6-4, 6-4 to Mary Pierce in the Virginia
Slims Championships in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
She hadn't dropped a set in three prior matches this week, her
first appearance at Manhattan Beach since winning here in
1987. That victory propelled Graf into the No. 1 spot for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
``I didn't have a lot of confidence in my shots and that's why
I'm frustrated,'' Graf said.
</P>
<P>
``When it happenend, I didn't quite think it happened. I was
like, `Oh my God, the ball went out,''' she said. ``I was kind of
in shock there for a couple moments.''

<HEADLINE> Shanghai-Based Bank to Pioneer Risk Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China has
chosen the recently formed Shanghai City United Bank to experiment
with a new system of risk management aimed at minimizing credit
arrangements which go sour, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures from the new pilot scheme are expected to
applied nationwide as big state banks are eager to reduce their
burden of bad loans, it said.
</P>
<P>
The system contains a series of quantitative criteria drawn up
by China's central bank to guide lending. Under the old planned
economy, banks acted as government cashiers, giving out money
without ever considering whether the borrower was able to repay
the loan.
</P>
<P>
Many banks lost money when state-run enterprises failed to
repay principal loans or meet interest payments.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai City United Bank, which was founded when an alliance
of urban credit co-operatives merged at the end of last year, is
testing the new guidelines in 26 of its branches.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the lending of the 26 stood at 3.87 billion
yuan (465.1 million US dollars), nearly 29 percent of the bank's
total loans.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said that the quality of the loans granted by branches
taking part in the trial has improved by nearly 12 percent since
the new system was implemented in March.

WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras
beat the Czech Republic's Bohdan Ulihrach 6-1, 6-4 to reach the
finals of the Indianapolis ATP tournament on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The semifinal was interrupted twice by drizzle which made the
court too slippery to play.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who lost to Ulihrach on clay at Dusseldorf in May,
jumped to a 4-1 lead against the 21-year-old from Prague, who had
beaten 11th seed Alex Corretja in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
After a delay of 30 minutes by the rain, Sampras served out the
final game to win the first set in 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Sampras, twice a winner here, saved a break
point to hold for 1-1 before another half hour long pause for the
drizzle.
</P>
<P>
After that, Sampras met little trouble to take the winning
set. He has won ATP tournaments this year in San Jose, Memphis,
Hong Kong and Tokyo.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Bank Deposits to Rise Despite Low Interest Rate: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's personal bank deposits
are expected to continue rising in the second half of this year,
despite cut in interest rate in May, according to today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
"The strong support to the increase of (personal bank deposits"
is the declining inflation rate," the paper quoted the findings of
a recent survey conducted by the Central Bank, the People's Bank
of China.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was a year-on-year 7,1 percent in the first half of
this year compared with a year-on-year 16 percent in the same
period last year. And it is expected that the annual inflation
rate will be successfully retained under 10 percent by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
There are also no new hot-selling items in the market at
present.
</P>
<P>
Individuals are still enthusiastic about deposits after the
cancellation of the inflation subsidy rate in April and the
interest rate cut in May earlier this year, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
"Individuals still have strong intention to put money in
banks," the daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The State Information Center also forecast that personal bank
deposits would increase 37.6 percent in the third quarter compared
with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Personal deposits in state banks would reach a total of 3.613
trillion yuan (435.3 billion US dollars) by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
China's personal bank deposits by the end of June rose a
year-on-year 38.7 percent to 3.546 trillion yuan, showing an
increase of 570 billion yuan from the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that there some factors which will
probably hinder the growth rate of deposits. They include slowed
rise of personal income, individuals' growing interests in other
financial products and possible further interest rate cut.

LIMA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Twelve mummies were already found
this week with many more expected in the city of La Huaca Pucllana

Lima culture, between the years 200 A.D. and 700 A.D., is the
most important one along the central coast of Peru during the
ancient development of this region.
</P>
<P>
The finding was owed to professional archeologists from two

<HEADLINE> Rising Wealth Promotes Safe-Deposit Boxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulging wallets, expensive
jewellery and growing savings have brought a new problem to
affluent Chinese people: how to take care of their valuables.
</P>
<P>
Some are busy installing safes in their houses, while others
take out insurance policies. But many choose to rent safe-deposit
boxes in financial institutions to store their treasure and their
important documents, and sometimes even their personal secrets.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Shijiu, an official with the Trust and Investment Corp of
the China Construction Bank, said about half of his company's
safe-deposit boxes are rented to ordinary individuals rather than
entrepreneurs or companies.
</P>
<P>
Pioneering the safe-deposit business in Beijing, the company
has rented out over 5,000 boxes, nearly half of its total supply,
since it started the business two years ago.
</P>
<P>
At first most of the customers were enterpreneurs or people
planning to go abroad. But now more salary earners, including
pensioners, civil servants, taxi driver and even college students
are using the boxes.
</P>
<P>
Most people store their wills, jewellery, securities, secret
recipes, contracts, personal letters, paintings and antiques.
</P>
<P>
Some institutions, organizations and enterprises rent
safe-deposit boxes to hold important files.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people have accepted the new concept of storing
valuables," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Prices are affordable for many people. Rents range from 180
yuan (21.7 US dollars) a year -- just 0.5 yuan a day -- to 600
yuan a year, depending on the size of the box.
</P>
<P>
"Now my family and I can finally set out minds at rest," said a
middle-aged man who was putting a painting into a box.
</P>
<P>
He said the painting had passed through several generations of
his family to him and that he had been worried about the safety of
the painting before he rented the box.
</P>
<P>
The safe-deposit business reappeared in Guangdong Province in
the early 1990s after a lapse of over 40 years. It is already
booming in coastal cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Opportunity for Telecom Ventures Afforded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China National Posts and
Telecommunications Industry Corp (PTIC), the country's leading
telecom manufacturer, is becoming a gateway for foreign investors
to enter the Chinese telecom market -- but the price of entry can
be expensive, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
PTIC is insisting that foreign companies transfer their latest
manufacturing technology to the joint ventures they set up with
it, on the principle that such companies stand to gain lucrative
profits from the vast potential market, said Zhao Shuangyin,
PTIC's deputy managing director for imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
To modernize the country's telecommunications industry, PTIC
plans to introduce foreign telecom technology during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), said Li Zhezhi, vice-president of PTIC.
</P>
<P>
Such technology will cover telephone switching with intelligent
programs and mobile communication functions. Asynchronous Transfer
Mode (ATM) technology was cited as an example by the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
The company will also develop domestic manufacturing technology
in synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) with the help of foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
Code division multiple access (CDMA) and flex and reflex paging
technology are also expected to help PTIC update the domestic
manufacturing level of mobile telecom equipment and pagers.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan, PTIC will also consider
introducing manufacturing technology for IC (intelligent card)
payphones and payphone credit cards.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company is looking for foreign partners to
jointly manufacture automatic teller machines (ATMs) to modernize
savings deposit service at the country's post offices.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Chinese Youth Respect Parents, Late Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Young people surveyed in the
Chinese capital city say their role models are their parents --
and the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
In the survey among some 600 Beijing residents aged 16-35, 386
people, or 64.5 percent, say that they definitely have their own
models of respectability, while 35.5 percent aren't sure.
</P>
<P>
A report of the survey, which was conducted by the Beijing
Research Institute of Youth in early May, was carried in "China
Youth Daily" Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of 386 people view either or both parents as
fine examples. Another 17.4 percent chose other family members,
teachers, colleagues, friends and even classmates, because they
are "honest, responsible, kind, hardworking and thrifty, or fond
of learning," the survey found.
</P>
<P>
Out of 386 people, 60 say that they have the most respect for
the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, because he always served
people wholeheartedly, was broad-minded and a statesman.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four of the respondents named Lei Feng, a soldier who
died in the line of duty in 1962 and is regarded as a Chinese
hero, for his generosity and unselfishness.
</P>
<P>
"Young people are still holding on to the Chinese people's
traditional moral principles, such as unselfishness and honesty,
while accepting modern civilization," the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed said that they value unselfishness, honesty,
generosity, and a high sense of responsibility.

<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
has brought down vegetable prices half a month after it was hit by
severe floods.
</P>
<P>
Heavy and torrential rain fell in Hubei in mid-July, causing a
flood that submerged more than 1.13 million hectares of crops, and
as a result, vegetable prices surged.
</P>
<P>
While ordering state-owned vegetable companies to buy
vegetables from Shandong and other northern provinces, the
provincial government encouraged salesmen to engage in
long-distance transportation of vegetables by charging them no
toll fees.
</P>
<P>
In Jianli County alone, more than 250 self-employed salesmen
bought 1,108 tons of dried and fresh vegetables from its adjacent
areas.
</P>
<P>
Ample supply of vegetables have meant normal supplies on the
market, bringing down their prices back to their pre-flood level.

<P>
General Abacha also urged the international community to aid
Ecowas members in the peacekeeping effort in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"The Ecomog (Ecowas peacekeeping force) operation in Liberia

According to a TV report, a decision has been made at the
meeting that elections will be held in Liberia in June next year.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- About 220,000 Bosnian refugees
have applied to the proper authorities to vote at Bosnia's
September 14 elections, Serbian refugees Commissioner Bratislava
Morina has said.
</P>
<P>
Morina told Dnevnik, a local newspaper of Novi Sad city in
northern Serbia, today that about 98,000 refugees will be able to
vote in Yugoslavia, in keeping with regulations set by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is in
charge of organizing the elections.
</P>
<P>
The rest will have to go to Bosnia to cast their ballots, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Morina, the president of the Yugoslav commission for the rights
of refugees, said Yugoslavia was fully prepared for the elections,
and hoped they would consolidate peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed regret that not all refugees had registered,
as it was believed that there were about 360,000 refugees in
Yugoslavia with the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 Muslim refugees had registered to vote in the
Muslim-Croat federation, said Morina, adding that there were Serbs
who wanted to vote in Mostar and Drvar, towns in the Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
She also hoped the OSCE would grant persons seriously ill or
above 65 years of age to vote in Yugoslavia without any
restrictions, as requested by the Yugoslav commission.
