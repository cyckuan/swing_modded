<HEADLINE> South Korea Set Tone with 3-2 Win Over Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Deafening drums and noising
cheers set the tone of the Thomas/Uber Cup Finals badminton
tournament, which was on full swing on Friday when South Korea
disposed of hosts Malaysia 3-2 in the Thomas Cup here.
</P>
<P>
With the two doubles matches more insurable, the South Koreans
needed just one singles match win to claim the victory, but Shon
Seung Mo had the chance slipped away as early as in the first
singles match.
</P>
<P>
Wong Choong Hann, winner of the 1998 Commonwealth Games, scored
the final six points of the game to oust Shon 15-8, 5-15, 15-13 in
87 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Shon, who lost to Wong in the All-England Open in March and the
world championships last May, clawed back in the second set and
led 13-9 in the decisive one, but failed to make the most likable
win.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's world champions Kim Dong Moon and Ha Tae Kwon
leveled the score with a 15-13, 15-6 win over Lee Wang Wah and
Choong Tan Fook in the following doubles match.
</P>
<P>
A surprise victory of Lee Hyun Li in the second singles proved
to be the winning cause after he disposed Ong Ewe Hock 15-13, 4-15,
15-11.
</P>
<P>
Even with Siti Hasmah Mohd. Ali, wife of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and more than 10,000 spectators on
inspect, Lee blazed away on the winning course, edging off Ong 15-
13 in the first set.
</P>
<P>
Ong, finalist of the 1999 Asian Championships, was soon popped
up and held Lee to just four points in the second set and led 11-4
in the third.
</P>
<P>
But Lee managed to level at 11-11 and drove to the triumph in a
row when Ong collapsed.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect Lee to win the second singles," South Korean
coach Kwon Seung Taik said. "I had thought it could be 2-2 and
the game would have been decided in the fifth match."
</P>
<P>
With Lee Dong Soo/Yoo Yong Sung promising the fourth match 15-
11, 15-8, the South Koreans were unassaible in the best-of-five
game.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's the problem with Ong," said Malaysian team
manager Datuk Mohamed Al Amin. "But he said he had muscle
strained in his left thigh when he led 11-6 in the third set."
</P>
<P>
"Home court could give us pressure on both sides, but we know
how to deal with it. Now we don't think about today's game any
more, we have more matches to play," he added.
</P>
<P>
China's women's powerhouse completed their 5-0 thrash of Sweden
in just two hours as none of the Swedes got double digits in a set.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's coach Claes Johansson said, "China's women's team is
one of the best female teams in all sports. They are even better
than the more established Chinese women's table-tennis team."
</P>
<P>
Denmark, finalists of the last Thomas Cup, also opened the
title hunting with a perfect record when they sliced India to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean women met little resistence in the other Uber
Cup game, beating the Netherlands on the same 5-0 scoreline.

Investigations show that the fire was caused by an overheated

parlor lacks necessary fire control facilities and has been opened
without approval from the local fire control authorities.

The predecessor of the video parlor is a food store under the

<HEADLINE> Refusal of PNTR Will Bring About Serious Results, Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua)-- Serious results will follow if the
United States Congress refuses to grant China permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR) status, according to Eugene Martin, charge
d'affaires of the U.S. embassy in Beijing, and some experts from
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
They made the comments here today at a session of the U.S. Asia
Society's 11th Annual Corporate Conference.
</P>
<P>
At a round-table discussion, Marshall Bouton, executive vice-
president of the Society, asked participants to comment on the
impact if the U.S. Congress refuses to grant China PNTR status on
a scale from one to ten.
</P>
<P>
Martin said that he would choose eight. He explained that a
refusal of PNTR status to China would mean isolating China, adding
that it would also lose the broad basis for dialogue between the
U.S. and China on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a refusal of the PNTR status will affect the
economic relations between the two countries, said Martin, adding
that the U.S. government is doing its best to try to avoid such an
outcome.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is "modestly optimistic" that the PNTR status
will be passed.
</P>
<P>
Nayan Chanda, deputy chief editor of the Far East Economic
Review, also chose eight. He commented that even if the U.S.
Congress fails to pass the PNTR status to China, China also can
become a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will gradually realize the harm resulted from the
disharmony of trade between the two countries, Chanda explained. (

<P>
He said that he believes if the PNTR status is not passed this
year, it will be granted next year.
</P>
<P>
Yoichi Funabashi, chief diplomatic correspondent and columnist
of "Asashi Shimbun", and also an International Council Member of
the Society, chose nine. He said that the failure of the PNTR
passage will have negative impact on the Japan-China and Japan-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Shen Dingli, professor and deputy director of the Center for
American Studies of Fudan University, chose between three and four.
He said that if the PNTR status is passed, it would be a win-win
result, explaining that the U.S. can gain immediate economic and
trade benefits, while Chinese enterprises will be able to become
more competitive in the long term.
</P>
<P>
It would be the U.S. own business if it decides to give up its
trade interests.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Platt, president of the Society, said in an interview
prior to the discussion that he strongly supports the Congress in
grantiong China PNTR status.
</P>
<P>
Platt stressed that the development of U.S.-China trade has
become an irreversible trend, which requires the two countries to
maintain normal trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The three-day U.S. Asia Society's 11th annual corporate
conference ended today. More than 800 statesmen, business leaders,
and scholars participated in the event.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, May 13 ( Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on Saturday held talks with visiting Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks took up the situation on the Arab, Islamic and

reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA).
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch arrived at the Saudi Red Sea port of
Jeddah on Saturday on a four-day visit to the kingdom within a tour

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Foreign Trade Up by 9.1 Percent in 1999: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's foreign trade volume
increased by 9.1 percent to reach 6.014 billion Kuwaiti dinars (19.
846 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, according to a report released
by Kuwait's Planning Ministry on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While total imports dropped to 2.318 billion dinars (7.649
billion dollars) from 2.626 billion dinars (8.665 billion dollars)
in 1998, the report said, exports rose by 28.1 percent to reach 3.
696 billion dinars (12.196 billion dollars), a surplus of 1.378
billion dinars (4.574 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Oil exports took the lion's share in the exports, accounting for
90.6 percent of the total, slightly higher than 1998's 89.1
percent, the Kuwait News Agency quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil exports rose by 10.6 percent last year compared to the
previous year, climbing from 310 million dinars (1.023 billion
dollars) to 343 million dinars (1.131 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
As for the main non-oil imports, sedans stood first with 9.6
percent to record 223.6 million dinars (737.8 million dollars),
compared to 254.8 million dinars (840.8 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Water and steam power generators came in the second place of
three percent, and sport utility vehicles the third of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the trade exchanges with foreign countries and entities,
the report said that imports from the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) members - Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates - amounted to 10.4 percent of the country's total
imports, up from 9.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Arab countries also rose from 12.3 percent to 13.4
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
While products from Asian countries accounted for 45 percent of
Kuwait's total imports, the European countries almost retained
their share of 33.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the three biggest exporters to Kuwait
are Japan, the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports to Kuwait accounted for 12.8 percent of Kuwait's
total imports, while the U.S. and Germany got shares of 12.3
percent and 7.7 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Urges GC to Clarify Tehran Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Minister Abdolvahed
Musavi Lari on Saturday urged the conservative Guardians Council
(GC) to clarify the parliamentary election result in Tehran as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
As watchdog of the parliamentary election in February, the GC
should determine the fate of elections in the Tehran constituency
as soon as possible so as to remove the public concern over the
elections, Lari was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he believes that the sixth parliamentary
elections have been held in a sound atmosphere due to strict
monitoring and sensitivity shown by the GC and the Interior
Ministry during the polling.
</P>
<P>
Reformers close to President Mohammed Khatami won more than two
thirds of the total 290 seats in the new parliament, ending the
long time conservative majority in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, the political center of the country, reformers bagged
29 of the constituency's 30 seats. However, with nearly three
months passing by, the GC has not given final approval of the
result, citing so-called vote rigging.
</P>
<P>
The GC has also annulled the election results in certain
constituencies, depriving some 12 reformist winners of their right
to enter the parliament. The action irritated the pro-reform
Interior Ministry, who was the organizer of the election.
</P>
<P>
As political struggles escalated between the conservatives and
the reformers, the judiciary jailed a number of reformist
journalists and closed most of the reformist papers in April.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the closure of the pro-reform newspapers, Lari
urged the conservative judiciary to "deal with any case within the
framework of the national law," the IRNA report said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the judicial system to hold the hearings for the
banned newspapers and to determine their fates as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Moroccan King Mohammed VI on Thursday inaugurated a
wind-power generating plant in the Tatwan area in northern Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The plant was built by Danish company Fistas and funded by a
French consortium of "Electricite De France," "National De Paris"
bank, "Parisbas" bank and "Germa" financial company.
</P>
<P>
The value of the project is estimated at about 60 million U.S.
dollars, and it will be able to meet two percent of Morocco's
energy needs.
</P>
<P>
The plant is believed to be the biggest of its kind in the
world, and it will benefit a mountainous region exposed to winds
all the year round, at a speed ranging from 7 to 15 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni government has allowed the private sector to
operate both internal and external air transport services as from
next year.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Minister of Transportation Abdulmalik al-Sayyani told
reporters that establishing private air transport companies was
contradicting with the concession granted to the Yemeni Airlines,
which enjoys operation monopoly until 2001. The concession expires
with the end of a joint agreement between Saudi and Yemeni
governments, under which Saudi Arabia has 49 percent of the
company's shares.
</P>
<P>
The government allowed the private sector to participate in the
activities of maritime services, maritime transport, overhaul of
ships, management of ports and services of air and land transport.
</P>
<P>
SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- Chief Executive of the Egyptian
Authority for Environmental Affairs Dr. Ibrahim Abdel Gelil said
the Finance Ministry has recently approved the establishment of the
Environmental Protection Fund.
</P>
<P>
Gelil made the statement while opening a workshop on reducing
the sources of industrial pollution, sponsored by the Authority in
collaboration with a group of international donors, including the
World Bank, European Investment Bank and the German Construction
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The fund, to start working next week, is aimed to provide
economic incentives to promote investments in the different areas
of environmental protection, through supporting the interest rates
of the banks.
</P>
<P>
MANAMA -- The Islamic Development Bank said it has signed four
agreements with Sudan to provide 16 U.S. million U.S. dollars to
fund water projects and researches.
</P>
<P>
The bank has so far supplied Sudan with over 335 million
dollars, said a bank statement.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based bank, established in 1975, is aimed at
promoting commerce among Islamic countries.

<HEADLINE> 60 Palestinians Wounded in Clashes with Israeli Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 Palestinians were injured on
Saturday in violent clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank towns of Tulkarem and Hebron, the
Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
</P>
<P>
The clashes took place when Israeli soldiers tried to stop
Palestinian demonstrators who demanded the release of Palestinian
prisoners held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners have been on a hunger strike since early this
month
in protest against their open-ended detention and the inhuman
treatment they received at Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian protesters threw stones at Israeli soldiers who
responded with tear gas, rubber-coated steel pellets, live
ammunition and noise bombs, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Tulkarem, 55 Palestinians, including three
children, two women and an old man, were wounded and two others
were detained in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Those wounded, with injuries mainly seen on heads, necks and
backs, were rushed to hospital.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, five youngmen were wounded during a peaceful
demonstration they organized for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Israel's army radio admitted that dozens of Palestinians were
injured in the clashes, alleging that this only occurred when the
protestors pelted Israeli soldiers with stones and empty bottles.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted an Israeli army spokesman as saying that more
than 20 Palestinians were wounded while two Israeli soldiers and
one civilian were injured. The spokesman denied Israeli forces' use
of live ammunition in their attempt to disperse the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the Palestinian police did not help stop these
clashes.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations, which have entered the sixth day, also
erupted in Ramallah, Bethlehem, Nablus, Qelqeleya and Gaza, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, 47 Palestinians were injured in violent clashes with
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank, according to local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli woman delegation on Saturday visited a set-in tent
set up in Bethlehem and expressed their solidarity with the demands
of the Palestinian prisoners on strike.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 Palestinians are still being held in Israeli prisons
for security reasons.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Jobless Lift Roadblock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Unemployed people from the
Argentine province of Salta started to lift the roadblocks they
had erected on National Route 34 at midday Saturday, after signing
a record of proceedings as an answer to their demands.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators' delegates signed an agreement with national
and provincial government officials, which considered the lifting
as "a fundamental element to reconstruct the peace, find the
dialogue and implement solutions to the immediate problems."
</P>
<P>
According to the commitment, the government will guarantee,
among other things, the implementation of transitory employment
projects for a total of 3,000 people per month between June and
December of this year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also guarantees the freedom of the demonstrators,
since the government will not be able to take either
administrative or judicial measures against them, nor will it
demand any indemnification for the damage caused during the
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The protesters had kept for 10 days roadblocks on National
Route 34, that connects the province with Bolivia, and early
Friday there were confrontations with riot police that came to
clear up the route.
</P>
<P>
The confrontations led to looting and the burning of the
General Mosconi municipal building.
</P>
<P>
Argentina has had double-digit unemployment for the last six
years.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Tourism To Generate 1.2 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The tourism sector will inject this
year 1.2 billion U.S. dollars into the Peruvian economy, said
National Tourism Chamber (CANATUR) Chairman Lima Carlos Zuniga
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the tourism businessmen community said that this
figure will rise from 17 to 18 percent of the hard currency that
will enter the national reserves during the year 2000 in the
export of services line.
</P>
<P>
Zuniga said the number of international arrivals in this sector
will soar by some 17 percent, with more than one million tourists.
</P>
<P>
He said that the arrival of passengers to the country grew 26
percent in April, compared to the same month of 1999, with 76,202
visitors, although he admitted that the figure meant a slight drop
of six percent, compared to the month of March of this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the uncertainty caused by the political fever the
country is going through because of the upcoming elections, the
tourist activity has not contracted, thanks to the promotion of
the tourist destinations and the bigger supply of airline services.
</P>
<P>
Zuniga said that to promote the tourism sector it is necessary
to make land transportation more efficient and to encourage
investment and competition in those services.

<P>
ATHENS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
Saturday called on the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (
PASOK) to adjust to the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a two-day PASOK Central Committee meeting,
which ended Saturday, Simitis said that this was an electronic age
and an adjustment to the new facts must be made through new
proposals, ideas and faces, the semi-official Athens News Agency (
ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that a socialist party must be a party of
continuous reform with a modernizing policy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first for the ruling party after the April
9 elections in which the PASOK was re-elected with an
approximately one percent lead in the number of votes over the
country's main opposition New Democracy (ND).

<HEADLINE> C.America Sets Record in Cell Phones Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Central America as a whole was
one of the zones of fastest growth in mobile telephony in 1999, a
year that closed with 2.6 million cell phones in use, almost nine
times more than the 300,000 registered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is first in Central America in the development of
cell telephony with eight percent of coverage, followed by Panama,
reported the local press Saturday. Costa Rica is third with four
percent of cellular telephony use, Guatemala fourth with three
percent, and Nicaragua and Honduras come next with approximately
one percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. BellSouth Telephone Company regional executive vice
president Luis La Rocca said that the cellular telephony payment
methodology was managed by the "prepaid" system in developing
countries like those of Central America.
</P>
<P>
La Rocca explained that the "prepaid" system has the advantage
of reaching a bigger number of people, including those of a medium
buying power.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "the caller pays" mechanism is another
mechanism that contributed to the growth of the cell phone market
in the isthmus region.
</P>
<P>
The average is five percent at the Latin American level, a
point below the world coverage and ten times less than in the
Nordic countries, where one of every two persons has a mobile
telephone.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Criticizes UN for Biased to Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Saturday strongly
criticized the United Nations Security Council for failure to
"discharge its responsibility" in the Ethio-Eritrea conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that
Ethiopia rejects the UN Security Council's process "designed to
punish the victims of aggression, Ethiopia".
</P>
<P>
The statement said Ethiopia rejects the attempt by the United
States and Britain, -- two of the permanent members of the
Security Council which are leading the effort -- to deny Ethiopia
its lawful right of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
In response to the outbreak of a new round of border conflict
between Ethiopia and Eritrea Friday, the UN Security Council
later in the day appealed in a resolution to immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to meet again within 72 hours to take
immediate steps to ensure compliance with the resolution if
hostilities continue.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia continued fighting against Eritrea at the border by
Saturday night. It said that it will go back to proximity talks
with Eritrea if it gets invitation from the Organization of
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"While exercising our right to defend our sovereignty by all
the necessary means, Ethiopia remains ready, if invited by the
OAU, to pursue peace and commence the proximity talks," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the sponsorship of the OAU, Ethiopia and Eritrea held a
proximity talk from April 30 to May 5 in Algiers, Algeria. But
the indirect talks failed to get any positive result.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Sends Delegation to Zimbabwe to Monitor Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa ruling African
National Congress (ANC) has sent a delegation to Zimbabwe to
monitor the elections there, South African President Thabo Mbeki
said in Pretoria on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
 "We should try and encourage as many people as possible -
organizations, institutions - to send observers to Zimbabwe as
early as possible ... to observe all elements of the election
process," he said in an interview with foreign correspondents a
week ahead of his first state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The South African delegation would work with both the
opposition and the ruling party to try to ensure that upcoming
parliamentary elections be free and fair, Mbeki said, adding that
international election monitors must also be part of the equation
</P>
<P>
An ANC delegation was sent to Zimbabwe this weekend to hear
the opposition's concerns and present them to the ruling party to
find a way to hold fair elections, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who has been criticized by the opposition for failing
to condemn his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe, said he had
told Mugabe privately that the violence must end, the rule of
law must be restored and free and fair elections must be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
 "This is our neighbor. We have to live with the Zimbabweans
forever here. We have got to find a way of making a contribution
to ensuring that all of these matters are addressed," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
 Mbeki is to arrive in Washington on May 22 for meetings
with President Bill Clinton and key government leaders. He will
also visit San Francisco, Dallas and Atlanta before leaving for
Nigeria on May 26.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced Saturday
night that its forces have destroyed eight Eritrean divisions
with thousands of Eritrean soldiers killed or wounded since a new
round of border conflict began Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Government Spokesperson's Office said in a

<HEADLINE> Algeria Rules Out Possible Crisis in Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The scaring statements made by some
U.S. officials and analysts about a likely crisis in oil prices is
unjustifiable, said Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Chakib
Khelil.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian News Agency quoted Khelil as saying that the
mechanisms set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) in Vienna in March this year are working well.
</P>
<P>
OPEC member states are actually abiding by these mechanisms
because oil prices are swinging within the range expected in the
second quarter, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to expect any increase in OPEC oil
production over the next few months, he added.
</P>
<P>
The set mechanisms are proceeding smoothly and talks about
production rise are not necessary prior to the forthcoming OPEC
meeting in Vienna on June 21. The average price for per barrel of
oil is 25 U.S. dollars since March, noted Khelil.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members, except Iraq, decided to increase their production
by 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) over the second and third
quarters under a market monitoring mechanism at their March
ministerial meeting. They set a date in June to analyze world oil
markets over this period.
</P>
<P>
OPEC member states forecast an improvement in the market
condition in June and if any need emerges, there will also be a
further increase in oil production by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"We will then register a spiraling demand for crude. That is why
we should wait the OPEC ministerial conference due in September to
make necessary decisions in accordance with the market demand,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The additional demand expected by the end of the year could be
ranging from 1 to 1.5 million bpds, added Khelil.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia, European Bank for Investment Sign Two Loan Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 13 (Xinhua)-- Tunisia and the European Bank for
Investment (EBI) signed on Saturday two agreements by which Tunisia
will receive two loans totaling 50 million euro (about 45.95
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Attending the signing ceremony were Fathey el-Merdasi, Tunisian
Minister of International Cooperation and Foreign Investments and
Jean Loi, Director of the Mediterranean Finance Department at the
EBI.
</P>
<P>
Merdasi voiced satisfaction with cooperation between his country
and the EBI, remarking that Tunisia is the first country in the
region that gained access to the loans only three months after the
launching of the second Euro-Mediterranean Programme (2000-2006).
</P>
<P>
According to the terms of the agreements, the first loan of 25
million euro (29.96 million U.S. dollars) will be used in
supporting the sectors of industry and services as the second 25
million euro loan will be used in adding one more rail line to the
Tunis-Soussa railway.
</P>
<P>
The loans Tunisia obtained under the Euro-Mediterranean first
programme totalled 371 million euro (about 340.95 million U.S.
dollars), accounting for 16 percent of the funds earmarked for the
Mediterranean region, noted Medrasi boasted.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Loi estimated the prospective loans to be lent over
the first term of the second Euro-Mediterranean programme at 450
million euro (413.55 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He described the cooperation between EBI and Tunisia as "ideal",
emphasizing the bank's determination to boost this cooperation in
various domains.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the future development of this cooperation, Loi said
the future operations are many. They will involve infrastructure
projects as well as promotion of investments in the technological
sector, added Loi.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Concern Over Hostage Crisis in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi expressed here on Saturday his concern over the
prolongation
of the hostage crisis in the Philippines, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Secretary-General of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Azzeddine Laraki, Kharrazi also
voiced Iran's readiness to help in the release of the hostages
taken in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister hoped that the hostage crisis
(which has paralyzed the Philippines in the past two months) will
come to an immediate end and all the hostages will be released
safely.
</P>
<P>
As the current chairman of the OIC, Iran endeavors to promote
the status of the Muslim world on the international scene, Kharrazi
told Laraki, who arrived in Tehran from the OIC headquarters in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Thursday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines
kidnapped 21 hostages on April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan Island
and took them to Jolo, an island at the tip of the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The hostages include three Germans, two French citizens, two
South Africans, two Finns, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two
Filipinos. Philippine government negotiators are now talking with
the rebels on the terms of the release of the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Two Parties Favor Federal Solution in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot United Democrats
party (UD) and the Turkish Cypriot Patriotic Unity Movement (PUM)
Saturday expressed their support to a federal solution in Cyprus,
the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Delegations of the two parties, headed by UD Deputy President
and government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou and PUM General
Secretary Izet Izcan respectively, met Saturday at the UD offices
in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A joint declaration issued after the meeting said a solution to
the Cyprus issue is "long overdue and should be solved without any
further delay" and stressed that everything should be done to
promote intercommunal rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish
communities since 1974 when the Turkish troops invaded and occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then the U.N. has been pushing for reunification of the
island under a bicommunal, bizonal federation formula but all
efforts have so far failed.
</P>
<P>
The UD and the PUM said they will coordinate their efforts for a
united Cyprus and will work together for an independent, sovereign
and territorially integral, demilitarized federal Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the process of Cyprus' accession to the
European Union could be a catalyst for the reunification of the
island.
</P>
<P>
They also said that improved relations between Greece and Turkey
also facilitate efforts to solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, the two delegations of the UD and the PUM
visited Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides at the private clinic in
Nicosia where he is recovering from an operation to remove a polyp
from his large intestine.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press Urged to Observe New Press Law Amid Mounting Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Ministry of Culture
and Islamic Guidance on Saturday urged the country's freedom-
seeking press to observe the new press law imposed by the powerful
conservatives to strengthen their grip on the press.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried out by the Islamic Republic News Agency,
the ministry said the amendments to the press law passed
recently by the outgoing conservative Majlis (parliament) and
confirmed by the Guardian Council had been sent to the ministry for
implementation.
</P>
<P>
All managing directors of publications in the country should
observe legal restrictions imposed in the new press law in
performance of their all-important task of disseminating
information, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Majlis dominated by the conservatives, who controls
most sensitive organs but suffered a series of humiliating defeats
in elections in recent years, imposed more tough restrictions on
the press, allowing judicial bodies to arrest journalists and
publishers for press offences.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, headed by Ataollah Mohajerani, a close ally of
President Mohammad Khatami, suffered serious setbacks in recent
months as it failed to prevent the passing of the conservative
amendments to the press law and the closure of a dozen of reformist
papers.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani himself is also facing mounting conservative
pressure as some conservative papers and officials have openly
called on President Khatami to dismiss the well-known reformist
minister, who has repeatedly vowed to defend press freedom in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times daily, a mouthpiece of the conservatives, said
on Saturday Mohajerani should be sacked "as soon as possible"
as the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei indirectly criticized
him in a sermon on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei did not mention Mohajerani by name, but Tehran Times
said in a commentary it is "clear" he is referring to Mohajerani,
whose ministry is responsible to issue licenses to and supervise
papers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 publications were closed down last month on the
charges of insulting the Islamic regime and values, days after
Khamenei lashed out at the reformist press for becoming the centers
of the enemies in the country.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes Iran's Halt to Drilling in Disputed Gas Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Saturday welcomed a
decision by the Iranian government to stop drilling in a disputed
gas field in the northern Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah "appreciated
the Iranian stance which he said reflected the deep and good
relations between Kuwait and Iran," the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Mehdi Husseini
announced the "Iranian rig (which) operated in the Dorra region
stopped drilling when these disputes emerged and will leave the
area."
</P>
<P>
The Dorra gas field is located in a sector in northern Gulf
waters where the demarcation of the continental shelf is subject to
rival claims by Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The three Gulf states have been locked in talks for years to
agree on a demarcation scheme, but have failed so far.
</P>
<P>
Iran started drilling three months ago in the disputed offshore
area, which caused concern from both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said on Friday that Iran had expressed readiness
to hold meetings with Kuwait and "they will convene in the near
future."

But he did not say when or where the talks will be held over the
dispute.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Libyan, Sudanese FMs to Discuss Sudanese Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt, Libya and Sudan are preparing a
foreign ministers' meeting in the upcoming period to discuss the
Sudanese issue in different aspects, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite meeting will mainly deal with the issues related
to an Egyptian-Libyan initiative aimed at helping end the civil war
in Sudan and realize peace and stability in this largest African
country, Moussa told reporters. But he did not specify the date and
venue of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed a five-point peace plan last year,
calling for permanent ceasefire between the Sudanese government and
the southern rebels, and convocation of a peace conference to be
represented by all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the foreign ministers' meeting will be preceded by a
meeting of an Egyptian-Libyan joint committee, which is responsible
for overseeing the technical details of the peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
And also, senior officials of the three countries will meet in
the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in preparation for the foreign
ministers' gathering, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the northern Muslim opposition
parties have accepted the proposal. But the major southern rebel
group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SLPA) has expressed
reservation over the plan, calling for a merger of the plan with
the one initiated by the Eastern African Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development, or IGAD.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the IGAD secretary general has been invited to visit
Cairo and Tripoli for talks on coordination between the Egyptian-
Libyan peace plan and the IGAD initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Libyan plan is taking its course through contact
and coordination with Sudan and IGAD partners concerned with Sudan,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the next step from IGAD after we have
expressed readiness to coordinate between the two initiatives," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Arab package provides for peace negotiations with all
opposition factions under the umbrella National Democratic Alliance
while the African proposal concentrates on a settlement between
Khartoum and the SPLA.
</P>
<P>
IGAD has for the last seven years sponsored peace negotiations
between Khartoum and the SPLA, in a bid to end the civil war that
has pitted the Islamic north against the mainly Christian and
animist south since 1983. But the negotiations have been fruitless.

KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said Saturday that the government has worked for the
emancipation of women in Uganda to ensure that they are freed

</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks when addressing members of Ugandan
women organizations attending a two-day conference in Mukono

Primary Education (UPE) program that was launched in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government has also pioneered the issue of inheritance so

<HEADLINE> Former Giro d'Italia Winner Suspended for Failing Blood Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian cyclist Evgeny Berzin, the
1994 winner of the Giro d'Italia, or Tour of Italy, was suspended
from the race after failing a regulation blood test, just hours
before Saturday's opening prologue.
</P>
<P>
A routine blood test performed on Berzin showed a red blood
cell level above the 50 percent threshold. This can be an
indication, although not proof, that a rider has taken the banned
substance EPO.
</P>
<P>
Berzin is the 40th rider who had registered above the 50
percent limit, since testing was introduced three years ago by
cycling's world governing body the International Cycling Union (
UCI) "to protect riders' health and safety".
</P>
<P>
UCI's medical teams on Saturday morning in Rome tested all the
180 riders set to contest a 4.6-kilometre time trial.
</P>
<P>
After the 15-day suspension, Berzin, 30 next month, must take a
further test at UCI headquarters in Lausanne. If he passes the
test he will be allowed to race again.
</P>
<P>
Last year, two riders - Spaniard Javier Ochoa and Italian
Nicola Loda - were forbidden from starting the Tour of Italy after
failing blood tests.
</P>
<P>
Italian ace Marco Pantani was the most notable rider to be
excluded when, within 48 hours of victory, he was found to be over
the limit in last year's Giro. The Italian has returned for this
year's Giro after a self-imposed year out of racing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Denmark Revenge with Historical Win in Uber Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Camilla Martin and her Danish
teammates took a sweet revenge of Indonesia over a defeat in the
Uber Cup finals two years ago, beating up the runners-up 4-1 for
the first time in the 43-year-old tournament.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Malaysia suffered their third loss in three days as the
women's team lost 3-2 to Japan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's Thomas Cup competition, defending champions
Indonesia and title-contenders China beat their lowly-ranked group
opponents each with the same maximum 5-0 marks, as Indonesia
whipped England and China succumbed Sweden.
</P>
<P>
With China a class of their own and set to top Group B in the
Uber Cup, Denmark, bracketed alongside with Indonesia, Japan and
Malaysia in Group A, need to win the preliminary round to avoid an
earlier clash against China in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's win put Denmark into the driving position in Group A
as the only team without a loss, while Japan and Indonesia split
their two games. Denmark will take Japan in the final game of the
preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's return to the Uber Cup final after 40 years could not
be as tough as that of two years ago in Hong Kong. At that time,
Olympic champion from Barcelona Susi Susanti and the Atlanta
Olympic silver medalist Mia Audina led the Indonesian women to the
championship matchup against China on Denmark's expense. But
Indonesia were already out of contention for the title here as
Susanti had retired for giving birth to her second child and
Audina had immigrated to the Netherlands after the 1998 Uber Cup
Finals. Audina is seeking for a permission from the International
Badminton Federation (IBF) to represent the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
Martin, ranked second in the world, kept her sweeping run of
the first singles so far with a 11-3, 11-2 win over Lidya
Djaelawijaya in just 15 minutes, one of the shortest game in the
tournament. Helene Kirkegaard and Rikke Olsen stormed back from
one set down to put Denmark into a comfortable 2-0 lead, disposing
off Eliza Natahanel and Deyana Lomban 12-15, 15-10, 15-6.
</P>
<P>
"We must win the first singles and doubles games to promise the
victory over Indonesia," Denmark's team leader Thomas Lund said.
</P>
<P>
Mette Sorensen kept on the routing run in the third match,
defeating Ellen Angelina 11-4, 11-9, before Majken Vange and
Pernille Harder lost to Minarti Timur and Zelin Resiana 15-10, 5-
15, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Mette Pedersen completed the most historical win for Denmark in
the Uber Cup, beating Ninik Masrikah in a three-set marathon, 11-8,
4-11, 11-1. But it is yet the time for the title.
</P>
<P>
"We'll all come out to beat Japan. We must finish first in the
preliminary group to avoid China before the final, because China
are too strong to beat," Lund said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, who were subdued to a 3-2 loss to South Korea in
Friday's Thomas Cup match, are out of the contention to advance to
the semi-final with their second loss in the Uber Cup.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's win was morale boosting for Japan, who lost to
Indonesia 3-2 in Thursday's match. They need to pull down a win
over Denmark in the final preliminary match to relegate or even to
keep in the hunt of the top place of the group.
</P>
<P>
China, who pledged to change their doubles pairings after a
modest 4-1 win over England, lined up the same outings as Thursday
's, but their bet was paid off this time. With three singles
players, All-England champion Xia Xuanze, Japan Open winner Ji
Xinpeng and veteran Chen Hong, all scoring easy wins, Zhang and Yu
proved they would be the reliable first pair for Monday's tie
against Indonesia. They scored a 15-7, 15-4 win over Par-Gunnar
Jonsson and Peter Axelsson in 41 minutes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But China's chief coach Li Yongbo said he wouldn't use the same
pairings when facing Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We'll change our doubles pairings on Monday when we face
Indonesia," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li never expected any points from the doubles matches, so China
must take all the three singles to claim a victory in the matchup
against Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's top doubles duo Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan
played under their usual form, but still overpowering 15-3, 15-7
England's Nathan Robertson and Simon D. Archer, who upset China's
Zhang/Yu, while second doubles duo Antonius Budi Arianth/Sigit
Budiarto thrashed Anthony Clark/Ian Sullivan, 15-6, 15-9.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Ousted by Martinez in German Open Semi-finals </HEADLINE>

<P>
BERLIN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Top seed and defending champion
Martina Hingis of Switzerland fell 7-5, 6-4 to Spaniard Conchita
Martinez in the semi-finals of the German Open women's tennis
tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The defeat also cost her her the world No. 1 ranking. American
Lindsay Davenport will replace Hingis for the spot with the new
rankings to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who struggled for over two and a half hours for the
victory over Frenchwomen Sandrine Testud in the quarter-finals on
Friday, looked tired and made many unbelievable mistakes before
the failure.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, third seed of the tournament, played in almost
perfect form and posted the victory in one hour and 42 minutes.
Now she faces either Amanda Coetzer or fellow South African
Joannette Kruger in the final on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seeks Gulf Stability Through Cooperation: FM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has always been seeking
to maintain security and stability in the Gulf region through
cooperation with regional countries including Iraq, said Kuwaiti
Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Security and stability for the regional peoples can only be
attained by mutual respect for each nation's sovereignty, said
Sabah, also first deputy prime minister, at the opening of a
symposium on the future of the Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties.
</P>
<P>
He called on all countries in the region to seek for peaceful
co-existence to keep the region free of wars, famine and poverty,
adding that "we will have no choice but to live together in the
region in security, peace and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
On the Kuwaiti-Iraqi relations, Sabah said the Kuwaiti and Iraqi
peoples have been linked with solid ties.
</P>
<P>
But he blamed Iraq for "obstructing the process of the historic
communications between the two brotherly countries" by invading
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the holding of the symposium underscored
everybody's sense of the importance of the ties between Kuwait and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, which is organized by Kuwait's National
Assembly (parliament), will center on the Kuwaiti and Gulf views of
Iraq and the Iraqi view of Kuwait, the future of the Iraqi
government and the prospects for the future Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties.
</P>
<P>
But the Kuwaiti official insisted that the "Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties
be based on the principles outlined by the United Nations Security
Council resolutions related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's full implementation of these resolutions constitutes the
basis for establishing solid and sound future relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated at the necessity to resolve the problem of
Kuwaiti prisoners of war (POWs) held in Iraq as one of the
humanitarian basis upon which future ties could be established.
</P>
<P>
The POWs issue is still constituting a worry to each Kuwaiti
family, he said, calling for Iraqi cooperation in closing the
pending issue.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists there are still over 600 Gulf War POWs held in
Iraqi jails. But Iraq denied the allegation.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine military authorities said
Saturday that 11 foreign journalists and a local newsman-guide are
missing as they left for the hinterlands of Patikul, Sulu, early
in the morning, but have not returned as of 20:30 (12:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency quoted military officials in
Zamboanga City, Mindanao, as saying that the 11 foreign
journalists and one local newsman-guide left for Patikul to get
first-hand information on the fate of the 21 foreign hostages now
being held by the Abu Sayyaf extremist group.
</P>
<P>
Local government and military authorities and other newsmen
monitoring and covering the Sulu hostage crisis were worried about
the whereabouts and the plight of the 12 journalists, it said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops were dispatched to locate the missing
journalists.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Trade Surplus Estimated to Increase in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia's trade surplus is expected
to reach 47.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2000, up 5.5 billion dollars
over last year, the Russian Economics Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account rampant unregistered trade, however, the
country's trade surplus is likely to be 39.6 billion dollars this
year, 5.3 billion dollars higher than the corresponding figure
last year, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Russia's foreign trade surplus in the first quarter, not taking
into account unregistered trade, amounted to a record high of 14.1
billion dollars, compared to 7.9 billion in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
In the single month of March, the foreign trade surplus hit 4.6
billion dollars, 1.7 billion dollars higher than March, 1999.
</P>
<P>
If unregistered trade is taken into account, the figures for
the first quarter and March alone are 12.1 billion dollars and 4
billion dollars respectively, compared to 6 billion and 2.3
billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Russia's exports to countries outside the
former Soviet Union in the first quarter soared 41.3 percent to 17.
8 billion dollars from the 12.6 billion in the same period of 1999,
while imports from such countries fell 9.3 percent to 6.8 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Former Zambian President's Son Eyes State House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Tilyenji Kaunda, son of Zambian
former President Kenneth Kaunda, intends to soon take over the
reigns of the United National Independence Party (UNIP), main
opposition party in the country, and eventually run for next
year's republican presidency.
</P>
<P>
Tilyenji is currently contesting the post of secretary general
at the on-going UNIP congress in Ndola, the Copperbelt Province,
Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He outlined his political vision in an interview on Friday,
saying that he was proud to be associated with his father who was
his favorite political hero.
</P>
<P>
Asked how soon he wanted to lead UNIP, a reserved Tilyenji said
"soon enough".
</P>
<P>
Tilyenji, 46, a nonentity in local politics said contrary to
what many critics contend that he has no political clout and that
he was shielding behind his father's fame. He said he had served
as a politician in UNIP for several years.
</P>
<P>
"I was a volunteer for UNIP for some time. I even worked
closely with my late brother Wezi Kaunda. Now I want to go out
full time and make a contribution in Zambian politics," said
Tilyenji who studied political science in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Gosper's Apology "Step in Right Direction", Says Australia's Greek Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- An apology by Australia's IOC vice-
president Kevan Gosper for allowing his daughter to replace carry
Greek-Australian schoolgirl Yianna Souleles to carry the Olympic
torch earlier this week in Athens was a "step in the right
direction", Australia's Greek community said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After defending his actions for two days, Gosper finally
apologized on Friday for allowing his 11-year-old daughter Sophie
instead of the selected torch carrier Yianna Souleles to carry the
torch after it was lit in Greece this week.
</P>
<P>
Gosper said his "fatherly pride" had clouded his judgment in
the affair. He then offered Souleles the chance to take his place
and carry the torch in front of thousands of people at Melbourne
Cricket Ground in July -- the stadium where Gosper won a silver
medal in 4x400 meters relay at the 1956 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Akis Haralabopolous, a member of one of Australia's largest
Greek groups, said Gosper's apology was "a step in the right
direction" but did not absolve him from his actions.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's just an issue of fatherly pride but that
would be a key issue," Haralabopolous said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, as far as Olympic officials are concerned, they'
re on this, the world's biggest gravy train and they can't see the
people for the gravy."
</P>
<P>
The Sydney school which selected Souleles as Australia's first
Olympic torchbearer however accepted Gosper's apology. But they
did not want to see their student take away Gosper's own chance
and proposed that Gosper run together with Yianna.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of the Olympic Games is one that unifies and this
would be stressed by that," the school's headmaster, Steven
Scoutas, said on Saturday.

Xianyang, once the capital of 11 Chinese dynasties, is rich in

To remedy this problem, Xianyang will set up relics management

Fair Reporting on China's Human Rights and Religious Freedom
Needed
</P>
<P>
A television preacher from the United States on Friday praised
China's progress in human rights and religious freedom, denouncing
some reports on China as "distorted and unbalanced."
</P>

China, adding that the Bible is publicly printed and freely
distributed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government's reaction to dealing with
the Falun Gong cult has been inaccurately portrayed as the

<HEADLINE> hke051325--20 Mln Bangladeshis Drink Contaminated Water:Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 million people in
Bangladesh are drinking arsenic-contaminated water everyday, while
about 80 million are at risk of being affected by arsenism,
international experts said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The monstrous disease that badly affected some 10,000 people in
the country had already claimed over 150 lives, experts said at
the third International Arsenic Conference jointly organized by
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Dhaka Community
Hospital (DCH).
</P>
<P>
The arsenic experts and UNICEF officials sought immediate
attention of the people, government and development partners to
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Professor W.R. Chappell from the United States said groundwater
arsenic contamination is a multinational and complicated
scientific problem, faced by people in South and Central Asia,
East Europe, China, Thailand, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"The alarming thing is that arsenic can even contaminate plants
and it is extremely difficult to dissociate arsenic from soil,"
Chappell said.
</P>
<P>
Defining the problem as enormous and complex, UNICEF
representative Shahida Azfar said the arsenic crisis in the
country is a silent emergency, and deserves to be treated
seriously.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the DCH, arsenic level in
drinking water sources reached a dangerous mark in 918 villages of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has recently agreed in principle to
carry out a detailed study on the groundwater for safe drinking
water supply to seriously arsenic-affected areas of the country,
which would cost 275 million taka (5.5 million U.S. dollars).

It was likely to be taken up in Lok Sabha, the lower house of

According to the PTI, the new legislation is consequential to a
United Nations resolution in 1996 which said that all countries
should favorably consider its law on electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
A significant part of the bill is that it provides for a
regulatory regime to supervise the digital signature system,
essential for carrying out financial transactions through the

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Army Opens Shop to Sell Guns, Explosives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian People's
Defense Forces (TPDF) opened a shop here Friday to sell light
weapons and explosives in order to meet emerging market demands,
media here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The TPDF, through its subsidiary Mzinga Corporation led by
Brigadier General January Kisanko, would sell locally made
ammunition and imported guns to mainly hunters, miners, security
and construction companies and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Opening the retail shop situated near the TPDF headquarters,
Minister for Defence and National Service Edgar Maokola-Majogo
said that only authorized customers could acquire the weapons.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the local media should present the issue of
the liberalized arms industry in the right way, claiming that the
shop would employ trustworthy sales personnel and strengthen its
security.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government liberalized the arms industry in 1998
amidst strong public disapproval on the ground that such a move
would put people's lives in danger because guns and bullets will
be easily available.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by the Ministry of Home Affairs, there
were five licensed arms dealers in the country by the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Kisanko said that produce of a TPDF munitions factory would be
on sale in his shop along with imported weapons, explosives and
other engineering products to help the Mzinga Corporation become
self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
The munitions factory, set up in 1971 in central Morogoro
region, has a capacity to produce 12 million shotgun bore bullets
annually while Mzinga became a public corporation in 1974 to
manufacture industrial products and spare parts and offer
industrial services.
</P>
<P>
Kisanko stressed that their clients were required to get all
necessary clearance from relevant authorities before they bought
ammunition and guns.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Thorpe Smashes 400m Freestyle World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Ian Thorpe demolished
his own 400 meters freestyle swimming record at the national
Olympic selection trials Saturday night in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old clocked three minutes 41.33 seconds, to slash
half a second off his previous world mark of 3:41.83 set at last
year's Pan Pacific Championships in the same pool at the Sydney
International Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe was given a standing ovation by a crowd of about 8,000,
one of the biggest in Australian swimming history.
</P>
<P>
"The crowd's amazing. The crowd really brought me home in the
last 50m," Thorpe said after the victory.
</P>
<P>
Despite clocking the eighth world record of his fledging career,
Thorpe said he was more excited just to make his first Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
"I actually made the Olympic Games. That's what I'm excited
about. The time was pretty irrelevant," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think ... the best part of my swim was that I was able to
gain selection. Reputations, past performances all become
irrelevant when it comes to selection trials," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe has won every major national and international title
over the distance since becoming the youngest world swimming
champion as a 15-year-old at the 1998 world championships in Perth.

<HEADLINE> Italian Open Tennis Fans might Suffer from Soccer Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A coincidence of the competitions of
the Italian Open men's tennis tournament and a local Serie A's
soccer game here on Sunday might get the tennis fans caught in the
cross fire of the country's escalating soccer fan violence.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Open men's finals at Rome's Foro Italico is
scheduled to coincide with the kick-off of expectedly highly
charged soccer game of the season, second-place Lazio hosting
Reggina. The soccer game would be played at Olympic Stadium,
which is just 200 meters away from Foro Italico.
</P>
<P>
Authorities fear violence from Lazio fans, who have protested
and rioted this week after league-leader Juventus appeared to get
a favorable call to preserve a 1-0 win last Sunday over AC Parma,
which maintained the Turin squad's two-point lead heading into
this weekend's final game.
</P>
<P>
Traffic will be blocked off Sunday all around the annual
showcase tennis event's venue, with the world's top players as
well as Italy's VIP class expected to be present.
</P>
<P>
Rome's prefect had banned the sale of soft drinks in glass
bottles or cans on Sunday from noon to midnight in the area around
the soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
And the director of the Italian Open, ex-tennis star Adriano
Panatta, tried to both downplay concerns. "In any case, we will
take the necessary precautions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Security throughout the city was being stepped up already on
Saturday.

Beijing) International High-Tech Industries Week 2000.
</P>
<P>
From May 8-12, Beijing National Agricultural Exhibition Hall,
the main venue for the high-tech industries week was packed with
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Some 450 multinationals, high-tech businesses, and scientific
research institutions crowded the exhibition Hall. There were over
900 booths showcasing the world's latest scientific and
technological achievements to some 200,000 Chinese audience.
</P>
<P>
Products on display included GPS (satellite global positioning
system), bio-medicine, Internet refrigerators, intelligent robots,

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Home Woos Foreign Investors to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest China,
the home of the endangered giant panda, woos foreign investors to
help develop its tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the
Sichuan provincial committee of the Communist Party of China, said
that the provincial government encourages solely-funded and Sino-
foreign joint ventures in the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that foreign investors will, as China is opening its
western regions, inject funds and introduce technology and
advanced management expertise into the province's tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan abounds in tourism resources, he said, but many of its
tourism spots are not known to people around the world.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan now has nine state-level scenic spots, including
Jiuzhaigou, Huanglong Temple and Emei-Giant Leshan Buddha, which
have been put on the world heritage list, as well as the Wolong
Giant Panda Nature Reserve and Dujiangyan-Qinchengshan, an ancient
water conservation work and a scenic Taoist holy place. Sichuan
also has seven historical cities.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Sichuan's tourism blueprint, income from
tourism will make up 8 percent of the province's gross domestic
product (GDP) in 2005, registering a year-on-year increase of over
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, more than 48 million domestic and overseas tourists
visited Sichuan, with tourism income reaching nearly 14.7 billion
yuan (1.77 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for less than 4
percent of Sichuan's GDP.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Chongqing in southwest China plans to spend 24.1 billion yuan (
about 2.9 billion US dollars ) on several projects to improve the
environment in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
During the city's Tenth Five-Year plan (2001-2005) period, a
senior government official said the city will invest 5.5 billion
yuan (about 660 million dollars ) to conduct technical renovations
in iron and steel, building material, and glass-making industries
to reduce dust by 23,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Some 12.76 billion yuan (about 1.78 billion dollars) will be
spent to build 27 waste water treatment plants in downtown
Chongqing and along the rivers of the Yangtze, Jialin and Wujiang.
The plants will have a combined handling capacity of 2.18 million
tons of waste water a day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city will construct 26 garbage treatment plants
with a combined handling capacity of 62 million tons a day.
</P>
<P>
The city will also build two ecological demonstration projects
in the western and eastern parts of the city, as well as 35 nature
reserves to improve the overall environment.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, with a population of 30 million, is the world's most
populous city. It has been listed as China's key environmental
construction area because it is located in the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River, China's largest river, and in the Three Gorges
Dam Project area.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A long-prepared symposium on
future relations between Kuwait and Iraq was kicked off here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, which is organized by Kuwait's National
Assembly (parliament) in cooperation with the Strategic and Future
Studies Center at the Kuwait University, consists three parts, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The first part will center on the Kuwaiti and Gulf view of Iraq
and how Iraq looks to Kuwait, while the second will focus on the
future of the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Perspectives over future Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties will be addressed in
the third part.
</P>
<P>
Speakers in the seminar include Kuwaiti State Minister for
Foreign Affairs Sulaiman Majid Al-Shaheen, Sheikh Nasser Sabah Al-
Ahmad, private advisor to Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Sheikh Saad Abdullah Al-Sabah and Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad Bin Jassim Al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the United States, Britain and Arab countries, as
well as key Iraqi opposition figures including Jalal Talabani, the
Iraqi Kurdish leader, will also address the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Committee of Kuwait's National Assembly
began to discuss the idea of organizing a symposium on the future
of the Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties late last year.
</P>
<P>
There has been no sign yet that Kuwait is ready to improve ties
with its arch-rival Iraq, whose 1990 invasion and occupation of
Kuwait triggered the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that more than 600 Kuwaiti and third country
nationals are still held in Iraqi jails, a decade after the Iraqi
occupation. But Baghdad denied the Kuwaiti allegation.

CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- World Bank Chief Economist James Parks said that the
Bank would lend 500 million dollars for house construction and 267
million U.S. dollars for infrastructure improvements in Turkey's
earthquake-hit regions.
</P>
<P>
Parks, who held a meeting with Turkish State Minister Hasan
Gemici in Ankara Thursday, said that the Bank's total contribution
to Turkey's quake reconstruction would exceed 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the aid to Turkey from the Japanese Development Bank, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Investment Bank
are taken into account, Parks said, total assistance would reach 3-
3.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A pipeline designed to transport Caspian oil to the
Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk will cost more than 9
billion dollars, instead of earlier estimates of 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project's contractor, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC),
has completed a new section of the project and laid a 1,359 meter-
long pipeline at the bottom of the Volga River in Astrahan, Russia.
</P>
<P>
CPC sources reportedly said that officials had definitely
underestimated the project costs.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's total public debt was estimated at 20.7
billion U.S. dollars by the end of the first quarter of 2000.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Foreign debt reached 5.5 billion dollars and standing domestic
debt was 17.4 billion dollars. The deposits of the public sector
were 2.269 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A comparison with the figures recorded at the end of 1999 shows

public sector decreased by 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The European Union's Mediterranean Development Aid
(MEDA) Commission has pledged to give some 15 million dollars in
grants for Turkey-EU business development.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, the Turkish Union of Chambers and
Commodities Exchanges (TOBB) will use the fund to build business
development centers in three large cities.
</P>
<P>
TOBB said in a statement Friday that 20 local and foreign
experts will be working in the centers in the three cities, and the
centers will support and advise small- and medium-scale enterprises
on management, marketing, export, strategic alliances and e-
commerce. Over time the project will expand to cover other
provinces.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey is to begin new oil exploration studies in the
eastern Black Sea and east Mediterranean soon, said Osman Demirag,
general manager of Turkish exploration and drilling company TPAO.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey is in negotiations with BP Amoco for Black Sea
exploration and with U.S.-based EL Paso for Mediterranean

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt on Citizenship of British Origin People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- About 86,000 people of British
Origin who renounced British citizenship under Zimbabwean law but
not British law are now deemed to be no longer Zimbabwean
citizens, the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They have been told by the Zimbabwe Citizenship Office to
surrender their Zimbabwe passports.
</P>
<P>
The Citizenship Office said in a statement Friday British
nationals should have renounced British citizenship under the
British Nationality Act of 1981 for the renunciation to be
recognized by the British authorities.
</P>
<P>
Renunciation of British citizenship under Zimbabwean
citizenship law was not recognized by the British authorities and
hence the British nationals were still British citizens.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has not allowed dual citizenship since 1984 and dual
citizens had until the end of 1985 to renounce foreign citizenship
without payment of a fee.
</P>
<P>
Until Friday's statement the Citizenship Office had accepted
this renunciation under Zimbabwean law and Zimbabwe passports had
been issued to those who had made the renunciation only under
Zimbabwean law.
</P>
<P>
The office said Friday that a lot of queries had been made
about British nationals still enjoying dual citizenship following
statements by the British government that they were putting in
place contingency measures to evacuate their citizens from
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"They are, therefore, deemed residents and not citizens of
Zimbabwe. These people who have not renounced, must surrender all
Zimbabwe passports because they are not citizens of Zimbabwe," the
office stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's candidate for the secretary-
general of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), Yasar
Yakis, is off to Cairo on Saturday to lobby for himself, reported
Turkish Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Yakis's Egypt visit is part of Ankara's all-round diplomatic
drive to gain support for its candidate to assume the most senior
post of the 55-member of the Islamic body.
</P>
<P>
Yakis is expected to meet Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
to deliver a message from Turkish Foreign minister Ismail Cem
during his two-day stay in Cairo, a place that is still fresh in
his mind as he just concluded his Ambassadorial term in Egypt last
year.
</P>
<P>
He will also maneuver other familiar high-ranking Egyptian
officials to support him.
</P>
<P>
Turkey apparently attaches great importance to the backing by
Egypt which plays a leading role in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Yakis was in Tehran on Thursday to seek support from Iran,
another influential Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
The OIC secretariat-general is a four-year post which rotates
among the three groups of countries with the the Islamic body,
namely the Arab, Asian and African groups. Turkey is in the Asian
group.
</P>
<P>
Under OIC standard practice, since the outgoing Moroccan
secretary-general is not seeking a second term, Turkey believes
that it ought to be Asian group's tern now to appoint someone to
the office.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was the first country to announce its candidate for
the post, naming its Parliament Speaker Humayun Rasheed Choudhury,
and Turkey proclaimed its candidate second.
</P>
<P>
Faruk Logoglu, Turkey's Foreign Ministry Undersecretary, will
visit the Sub-Indian Continent nation on May 25-26 in a bid to
persuade the Bangldeshi government to withdraw its candidate.
</P>
<P>
Logoglu is expected to tell Bangladeshi officials that it would
be wiser to go to the election with one candidate from Asia and
that it would be difficult for Turkey to withdraw its candidacy
since Ankara has already received strong backing from the Central
Asian states and some Arab countries. If Turkey succeeds in
convincing Bangladesh to quit, Yakis's position will definitely be
much strengthened.
</P>
<P>
OIC was established in May 1970 with its headquarters in the
Saudi city of jiddah.

<HEADLINE> Infant Killed, 4 Injured in Missile Attacks in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A three-year old girl was killed and
four other people were injured in guided missile attacks on
residential areas in the Iraqi capital Baghdad early Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Iraqi interior ministry has held Iranian
agents "fully responsible" for the overnight attacks, in which
eight missiles slammed into the al-Karkh residential district on
the west bank of the Tigris River, devastating three houses.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman identified the dead child as three-year-old Zahra
Mohammad Hamid, and said she had been "martyred."
</P>
<P>
An Iranian-backed Iraqi opposition group has claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying that it was targeted at one
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's palaces.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-based Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in
Iraq (SCIRI) also vowed to continue attacks until the Iraqi regime
was toppled.
</P>
<P>
The attack is the second raid on Baghdad this month and the
third this year. Iraqi authorities blamed both previous attacks on
Iranian agents.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were injured on May 1 and four people were killed
and 38 injured on Marcy 22 in mortar and bomb attacks in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The May 1 attack came hours after a mortar attack by an Iraq-
based Iranian military opposition group on Tehran, injuring six
people.
</P>
<P>
The March 22 attack was also seen as retaliation for a mortar
strike by the Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) on March 13 near
a military headquarters in Tehran that wounded at least four
people, was also blamed on Iran.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, which fled to Iraq after being outlawed by Iran's
Islamic government in 1981, has intensified attacks on Iran in
recent months amid heated power struggle between the conservatives
and reformists in Iran.
</P>
<P>
It also carried out mortar attacks in early February near
government buildings in Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Miss India Crowned as Miss Universe 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Miss India Lara Dutta early Saturday
was crowned Miss Universe 2000 during the 49th Miss Universe
pageant held in Nicosia, Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Miss India was crowned by Miss Universe 1999,
Miss Botswana of that year, Mpule Kwalagobe.
</P>
<P>
The pageant's first runner-up was Miss Venezuela 2000, Claudia
Moreno, and second runner-up was Miss Spain, Helen Lindes.
</P>
<P>
The Judges of the Miss Universe told a news conference that the
Miss India was honored due to "the way she carried herself, her
grace and presence."
</P>
<P>
A model and spokesperson for a Swiss watch company, the new Miss
Universe holds a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's
degree in communications.
</P>
<P>
The staging of the Miss Universe 2000 pageant here was the
brainchild of Cyprus' Commerce Industry and Tourism Minister Nicos
Rolandis to promote the island's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis believes the event will bring long-term benefits to
Cyprus, including an increase in tourism arrivals, mainly from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
But Cyprus' Greek Orthodox Church and some members of former
socialist EDEK party denounced the staging of the Miss Universe
pageant as unchristian and an affront to feminism.
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, the new Miss Universe will be presented with a
reproduction of a golden apple with a cultured pearl on its stem,
which according to Greek mythology was given to Aphrodite, the
goddess of love and beauty who was said to be born on the island.

<HEADLINE> Manila Works to Secure Release of Basilan Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Saturday
reassured hostages in Basilan still in the hands of Abu Sayyaf
extremists that it is ceaselessly working to secure their safe
release.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said
rescue operations for the hostages in Basilan are still going on.
</P>
<P>
"We have not forgotten the Basilan hostages. The operations in
Basilan are still ongoing. They know that we are monitoring the
status of the operations," Zamora.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government is verifying reports that one
of two teachers being held hostage is now sick and that the Abu
Sayyaf wants 250,000 pesos (about 6,000 U.S. dollars) for her
release.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the Crisis Management Committee in Basilan remains
the decision-making authority tasked to negotiate the safe release
of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf snatched about 30 civilians in Basilan in March.
A series of military operations in the past weeks led to the
rescue of 15 hostages, mostly children.
</P>
<P>
But a priest and five teachers were executed by the Abu Sayyaf.
There are still nine hostages being held in Basilan by the
extremist group.

in Congress.
</P>

Speaking to farmers beside a vast field of soybeans at Shakopee,
Minnesota Clinton argued that the biggest benefit of the PNTR bill
will go to the agricultural sector in economic terms as "the
magnitude of the Chinese market virtually defies the imagination."
Minnesota is the third largest state in the United States in
soybean exports and production, fourth in corn and seventh in
overall agricultural exports. In 1998, Minnesota exported 2.4
billion dollars worth of agricultural products to foreign markets,
including 316 million dollars to China. (US-China-PNTR)

<HEADLINE> Heat Beats Knicks 77-76 in Overtime in NBA Playoff Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Anthony Carter's incredible shot
from behind the backboard gave the Miami Heat a 77-76 overtime win
over the New York Knicks on Friday night. Miami now led best-of-
seven series 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Carter, playing the entire overtime as Tim Hardaway was
ineffective, drove along the baseline and faced such a tough angle
that he had to launch the ball over the top corner of the
backboard. Rising four meters in the air, the shot hit the front
rim, bounced high and fell through with 2.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks had one last chance, but the inbounds pass was
deflected away from Latrell Sprewell into Jamal Mashburn's hands
as time ticked away.
</P>
<P>
Carter had 10 points, eight assists and seven rebounds to
supplement 23 points from Mourning, 16 from Mashburn and 14 from P.
J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
The loss was an excruciating one for the Knicks, especially
Patrick Ewing, whose basket with 2.6 seconds left in regulation
forced the overtime.
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, LA Lakers eliminated Phoenix Suns 105-99 to move
one win away from a four-game sweep in the Western Conference semi-

quarter and grabbed 17 rebounds as the Lakers took a 3-0 lead over
the Suns in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
Penny Hardaway, averaging 26 points in the first two games of
the series, scored 31 for the Suns on 11-for-15 shooting, but
missed a 3-pointer with 46 seconds to go and the Suns down 100-97.
Cliff Robinson scored 23.
</P>
<P>
Jason Kidd had 12 assists, but was only 1-for-9 from the field
for four points.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant scored 26 and Robert Horry had 15 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
Rodney Rogers, winner of the NBA's Sixth Man Award who
struggled in the first two games of the series, collected 15
points, but still had trouble from long range and was only 5-for-
12 from the field.
</P>
<P>
The teams battled back and forth through most of the fourth,
with the Suns taking their last lead 95-94 on Shawn Marion's four-
meter baseline jumper with 2:48 to play.

<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine medical personnel are
preparing Saturday for the possible release of a sick German woman
by Abu Sayyaf rebels holding 21 hostages in Jolo Island, Sulu
Province,reports from Sulu said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said medical personnel are standing by for the
release of one or two hostages by the rebels, who said they are
willing to consider the request by the government.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators have left for Jolo Island for a meeting with the
rebel group and the release of one or two sick hostages could
happen in hours, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Abdulaziz Rajab Azarouq, former Libyan ambassador
to the Philippines, and government negotiators met face-to-face
for the first time in 17 days with the rebels, but failed to
convince them to release the two sick hostages.
</P>
<P>
German woman Renate Wallert is suffering from hypertension and
two strokes while French man Steponie Loisy is afflicted with
urinary tract infection.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the rebels asked the negotiators to give
them 24 hours to respond, but later nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the rebels re-established contact with government
negotiators by sending letters of the hostages to their families.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages -- three Germans, two French, two Finns, two
South Africans, one Lebanese and 11 Asians -- were captured from a
Malaysian diving resort on April 23 and brought to the Philippine

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has been
called upon to rescreen all appointed public officers with a view
to removing those who had been indicted for corrupt practices,
according to the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed at the just-closed International
Conference on Corruption and Organized Crimes that the problem of
corruption in Nigeria was "real", and noted that the vice was
being widely perceived as a threat to democracy, political
stability as well as economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued Friday in the capital Abuja after the
conference ended on Thursday said there should be no halt in the
pursuit and prosecution of members of the elite who have been
involved in large-scale corruption in the past.
</P>
<P>
"Their ill-gotten assets should be confiscated to serve as a
deterrent to others," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Nigerian government to enact and implement the
anti- corruption legislation as a matter of urgency to ensure a
speedy disposal of the large number of cases and strive to
re-direct the energies of youths from crime, cultism, and other
vices toward useful pursuits and other practical endeavors.
</P>
<P>
The government should also intensify the mobilization of the
public against corruption, and the focus of the campaign should be
to expose the adverse consequences of corruption, it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will continue to import sugar
until the country attains self-sufficiency of the commodity,
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo has said.
</P>
<P>
Okemo made the remarks when he received the government's
dividend cheque of 144 million shillings (some 2 million U.S.
dollars) from the Mumias Sugar Company for the year of 1998 in the
capital Nairobi Friday, the government-run Kenya Times reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his government has put in places legal
measures to ensure that unaccustomed sugar does not find its way
to local market, so that local industry will not be threatened by
subsidized imported sugar.
</P>
<P>
Okemo also advised the sugar industry to remain competitive by
ensuring production costs are kept low and quality stays high.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government would continue to provide an
enabling environment which includes the development and
implementation of appropriate policies aimed at ensuring the
industry continues to flourish.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Kenya's domestic demand for sugar was over
665,000 tons in 1999 while production in the same year amounted to
only more than 470,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspects Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Two murder suspects were detained
earlier this week for killing two Taiwan business people in
Dongguan City of south China's Guangdong Province on April 28.
</P>
<P>
They will be tried for homicide and robbery and are to face
severe punishment, officials from Guangdong and Dongguan public
security bureaus said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Widely reported by Taiwan and Hong Kong media, the April 28
murder case was solved by local police in 12 days.
</P>
<P>
Coming from Changhua County in Taiwan, the victims, Lin Fuyuan
and Lin Fuming, who were brothers, were respectively the general
manager and vice-general manager of the Changyi Plastic Products
Plant at Shatou Village, Chang'an Town in Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that the suspects admitted that they
climbed into the victims' bedrooms on the third floor at three a.m.
, hit their heads with iron water pipes and then stole 2,100 yuan
and two cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
Both suspects are transient workers from Hubei Province. One of
them, 23-year-old Hu Zhongwang, once worked at the victims' plant
as an entrance guard but was fired this March for breaking the
plant's rules.
</P>
<P>
Furious at the victims' refusal to pay his remaining salary, he
decided to revenge the bosses, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Dong, director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau under
Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department, pledged that they
would work harder to do a good job in safeguarding social
stability and create a fine investment environment for overseas
investors.

<P>
CHENGDU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The "bulb-shaped" Huangtupo No.3
tunnel on the Neijiang-Kunming railway in southwest China, the
longest tunnel of this kind in the country, was completed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 3,005-meter-long tunnel, located at the Zhaotong City,

<HEADLINE> Munich-Chongqing Flight to Bring More European Tourists to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The newly opened direct flight
from German city of Munich to southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality will bring more European tourists to China, German
LTU airlines managing director Peter Haslebacher has said.
</P>
<P>
Haslebacher said the air route put into operation Monday has
shortened distance between Europe and China as it only took nine
hours and 45 minutes for the maiden flight from Munich to
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
He said half of 7,000 air tickets for 26 flights on this route
until October have been booked, showing enthusiasm of Germans and
other Europeans toward this mysterious land.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Munich-Chongqing route provides the quickest
and the most economical way for Europeans to enter China's
hinterland, and will bring more European tourists to China, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Since China became world's fifth biggest tourism destinations
in 1996, the country has received annually about 8 million
overseas tourists. Last year witnessed a record of 8.43 million
foreign travelers.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign tourists entered the country via Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and other eastern coastal areas, tourism officials noted.
</P>
<P>
But as a matter of fact, western China boasts the country's
richest tourism resources, Li Lu'an, general manager of China
International Travel Service, pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the Munich-Chongqing air route will bring
Europeans directly to China's hinterland," he said.
</P>
<P>
This will break the traditional tourism pattern which bring
Europeans first to eastern China and then transit to western China,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Shorter voyage and lower costs on the route will make Chongqing
another biggest destination for European tourists, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian State Officials Asked to Report Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid has issued a presidential decree requiring cabinet ministers
and high-ranking officials in government offices and non-
departmental agencies to disclose their bank accounts to the
public, according to national newspapers here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Instruction No. 4/2000, issued on May 11,
stipulated that the ministers and officials should report the
balance of their bank accounts to the finance minister by May 30.
</P>
<P>
The decree stipulated that the reports have to mention the
names of the offices, the numbers of their accounts and the
accounts' balances as per April 30. They must also identify the
banks where the accounts are and the officials or institutions
controlling the accounts.
</P>
<P>
Praising the decision, Member of the House of Representatives
Idrus Marham and Coordinator of Indonesian Corruption Watch (ICW)
Teten Masduki said the president should also report his bank
account.
</P>
<P>
"The president must be consistent. He should not instruct only
his subordinates to report their bank accounts," Idrus, a member
of House Commission II on home affairs and legal matters, was
quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the president's move was commendable in the country's
bid to eradicate practices of corruption, collusion and nepotism.
He expects the presidential instruction to be carried out
prudently, and not be made as a mere political instrument to
appease the people.
</P>
<P>
Masduki,a member of the National Ombudsman Commission, said
that the accounts of the chairman of the People's Consultative
Assembly, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the
president, vice president as well as the heads of other government
institutions, including the chiefs of the Military should also be
obligated to disclose their bank accounts to the public.
</P>
<P>
He said the decree would not be effective if it only called for
disclosure of the offices' accounts.
</P>
<P>
"The disclosure obligation should also apply to personal bank
accounts. The decree will be useless if it only requires the
reporting of office accounts," he was quoted by the Antara News
Agency as saying.

<HEADLINE> Acehnese Separatist Group Not to Be Recognized Despite Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The position was made clear Friday evening by President
Abdurrahman Wahid when commenting on the joint understanding
signed Friday by the representatives of the Indonesian government
and the GAM.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "It (the accord) absolutely has nothing to
do with the recognition by either the government or the GAM."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab has hailed the signing of the
accord by saying that it was a "Win-Win Solution" for the
resolving of Aceh problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, controversy over the accord signing sparked
nationwide as many worried that such an action will lead to the
independence of Aceh Province and that the Indonesian government
will repeat the mistake it made when it gave East Timor option to
be an independent state and separate from the unitary state of
Indonesia last year.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Indonesian House of Representatives DPR)
Commission II for domestic political and legal affairs Amin Aryoso
regretted that the House was not consulted about the plan.
</P>
<P>
"In the future the government should communicate such things
with the House, at least the foreign minister with the press
commission," Aryoso said, adding the accord should not lead to
another East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences'
Political and Regional Affairs expressed their concern over the
foreign ministry's negotiation with the GAM, describing it as a
diplomatic misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the Indonesian government and the GAM agreed
to reduce tension and stop violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
And as follow-up measures of the accord, two joint committees
and a monitoring team will be set up in Aceh.
</P>
<P>
One of the two committees is the Joint Committee on
Humanitarian Action, which is supposed to focus on the effective
delivery of humanitarian relief, and the other is the Joint
Committee on Security Modalities, which will focus on reducing
violence.

BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Non performance loans (NPLs) in

A key reason that made the level of NPLs be seen only slightly

standards used by local banks in adjusting their NPLs figures, it
said.

Some banks did not immediately transform completely

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Expand Rice Market to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is eyeing countries in
Africa as its new rice export markets, as Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi is leading a Thai
delegation to the region to explore the opportunity, The Thai News
Agency (TNA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Ministry Spokeswoman Orachit Singkalavanich was quoted
as saying that Supachai and his entourage would visit Africa
between May 14 and 21 to strengthen trade ties and cooperation
with countries in the region, as well as to explore ways to expand
Thai rice exports to the economies.
</P>
<P>
Some countries in Africa, namely Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana,
Tanzania, Mozambique and Togo, were food importing countries
because their rice production could not meet domestic demand, she
stated, adding that this will be a good opportunity for Thailand
to expand its rice exports to the region.
</P>
<P>
Senegal imported Thai rice most last year, reaching 368,711
tons, an increase of 111 percent from the previous year, followed
by South Africa and Ghana, making the countries the key targets of
the Thai delegation, the spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Vietnam to Enhance Military Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has agreed to sell arms to
Vietnam and help train Vietnamese military officers, Ukrainian
Defense Minister Alexander Kuzmuk said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting between Ukrainian
Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko and visiting Vietnamese Defense
Minister Pham Van Tra in Kiev, Kuzmuk, who attended the talks,
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk said that Ukraine is ready to sell weapons and other
military equipment to Vietnam, but the two sides have yet to
discuss the sales volume. Kuzmuk did not say what kind of weapons
Ukraine would provide.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko and Tra exchanged views on the prospects of
Ukraine's arms supplies to Vietnam and assistance in the
maintenance of Vietnam's military equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord reached during the meeting, Kuzmuk added,
Ukraine's military academies will help train 30 to 40 Vietnamese
military officers and Vietnam will pay the training expenditures
with rice and rubber.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Tra told reporters that his visit is aimed at
strengthening contact and cooperation between the Vietnamese and
Ukrainian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will continue to import arms from former Soviet
republics including Ukraine since most of its existing military
equipment was manufactured by the former Soviet Union, which
disintegrated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk held talks with Tra Thursday on priorities of military
cooperation between the two countries. Tra, who is the first
Vietnamese defense minister to visit Ukraine, will leave for home
Saturday after winding up his four-day stay here.

SAN JOSE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will try to attract new
investment in the textile sector after U.S. Congress Thursday
approved the elimination of customs tariffs on textile products
imported from the Caribbean Rim.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Economy Minister Tomas Duenas said Friday that the
approval of U.S. Congress is a victory for President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez, who insists that the U.S. should expand the benefits
which Washington granted almost 20 years ago to the Caribbean Rim
Initiative (ICC) countries.
</P>

With the approval, the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on textile
products imported from Caribbean Rim countries and grant them an

SANTIAGO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A deep earthquake measuring 6.8 on
the Richter scale hit border areas between Chile and Argentina
Friday afternoon, leaving at least one person dead, the emergency

<HEADLINE> Global Trade Association Supports PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A global semiconductor
equipment trade association said Friday that "American companies
and workers would be on the losing end" if U.S. Congress does not
approve the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
The Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI)
said that its President Stanley Myers recently returned from a
tour of semiconductor labs in Shanghai. "He observed that
majority of the equipment in these labs was made by non-U.S.
companies," SEMI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Based in Silicon Valley, SEMI serves more than 2,400 companies
participating in the semiconductor and flat panel display
equipment and materials markets of 65 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier letter to U.S. Congress, SEMI and other U.S. high-
tech organizations stated that PNTR is an imperative for
strengthening the position of American high-tech companies in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
"China is a huge, critical and fast growing market for high-
tech products and services, ranging from e-commerce and Internet
services to products such as semiconductors, computers,
peripherals, software, telecommunications, and semiconductor and
other manufacturing and measurement equipment," the letter said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Demands End of Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Friday called on Eritrea and Ethiopia to "immediately
cease all military actions and refrain from further use of force."
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a resolution unanimously adopted during
a night session on the issue. The two Horn of Africa countries
reopened border fighting early Friday, catching international
attention as the two-year border war has already claimed tens of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
The fresh military action followed the collapse of peace talks
between the two countries in Algiers, the Algerian capital, and
the shuttle diplomacy by a Security Council delegation which
visited both capitals recently.
</P>
<P>
Strongly condemning the renewed fighting, the council warned
that it has serious humanitarian implications for the civilian
population of the two countries and constitutes an even greater
threat to stability, security and economic development of the sub-
region.
</P>
<P>
The council demanded the earliest possible reconvening of
substantive peace talks under the auspices of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
It decided to meet again within 72 hours to take immediate
steps to ensure compliance with the resolution if hostilities
continue.

<HEADLINE> Distance Learning Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Education officials are determined
to promote distance learning programs to help develop education in
rural and poor areas of China.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "China Daily", the Ministry of Education
started a distance learning project last May in 145 areas of
central and western China, which have relatively underdeveloped
economies and poor education facilities.
</P>
<P>
The project, featuring computerized teaching networks, is
underway in Chongqing Municipality, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan,
Shaanxi, Qinghai, Gansu, Hunan and Hubei provinces, and Tibet,
Xinjiang Uygur, Ningxia Hui, Guangxi Zhuang and Inner Mongolia
autonomous regions, the newspaper quoted Wang Zhuzhu, an official
with the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wang was attending a workshop on international cooperation on
distance education, which opened yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
To date, 240 primary school teachers in Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, Yunnan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces have
received computer-based teaching training programs, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Wang said such training programs will be introduced into more
schools to help schoolmasters and teachers learn computer skills.
"Equipping these areas with computer networks is a vital.  The
State has invested 80 million yuan in support of the project,"
said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Spreading distance learning is an important step to help ease
the shortage of teachers in western regions. It also allows these
areas to benefit from advanced teaching techniques produced by
more developed areas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry introduced a series of measures early this year to
promote educational development in west China. Distance learning
is a major part of those measures, said Yuan Chengchen, deputy
director of the ministry's Department of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, Kerstin Leitner, co-ordinator of the United
Nations Development Program in China, expressed her interest in
distance learning programs. She highlighted issues such as how to
build information infrastructure in the targeted areas, plans to
work with international organizations, the assessment of learning
programs and teacher training, and how to solve language barriers
among different ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Internet Boosts Women Users' Social Ties: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to some reports that
the Internet creates social isolation, a study released this week
said on-line women in particular believe the new medium has
strengthened their relationships and enlarged their networks.
</P>
<P>
More than 9 million American women have gone on-line for the
first time in the last six months, according to the survey
conducted by the Pew Research Center, a U.S. opinion research
group.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found this surge in Internet by women is
reshaping America's social landscape because women are using e-
mail to increase their contact with relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
"E-mail is a tool that many people now use to deepen and
improve their ties to family and friends," the research center
said. "Use of the Internet actually enlarges most users' social
worlds. And that is particularly true for women."
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five of Internet users say that their use of e-mail has
improved their connection with their family; 59 percent of those
who e-mail their relatives say that their level of contact with
significant family members has increased; 66 percent of Internet
users say e-mail has improved their connection with their friends.
In these areas, women cite the benefits of e-mail more frequently
than men do.
</P>
<P>
"Users' responses challenge the notion that those who log on to
the Internet are turning away from important social relationships
and their contact with the wider world," the research center said.
</P>
<P>
On the Web, the gender gap is quite pronounced in some areas.
According to the Pew survey, women are more likely to seek health
information and play on-line games, while men are more likely to
use the Web to get news, seek financial information and trade
stock on-line, participate in on-line auctions, access government
Web sites, and search for sports news.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the number of Americans who seek
information or complete transactions on the Web is the same as the
number of those who communicate with e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Other on-line activities include seeking fun, looking
information about a hobby, doing job-related research, doing
research about products and services, sending instant messages,
seeking health information and playing games.

MEXICO CITY, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala has seen more than
642 fires across the country since the beginning of the year,
destroying 21,932 hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Friday from the Guatemalan
National Forests Institute (INAB), El Peten, a state bordering
Mexico and Belize, is the worst damaged by fires, where 8,114
hectares of forest has been destroyed, accounting for 37 percent
of the total.
</P>
<P>
There are still 22 forest fires raging now in El Peten, where
most of the country's archaeological centers and animal and plant
sanctuaries are located, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities attributed the fires to criminal acts, wrong
agricultural practices and carelessness of the residents.
</P>
<P>
Several helicopters, including one of the Guatemalan Air Force
and two from Mexico, as well as 2,500 troops and rescue workers
are taking part in the efforts to put out the fires.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes PNTR Bill in Minnesota, Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday traveled to Minnesota and Ohio to push passage of the
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) bill less than two weeks
before the pivotal vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to farmers beside a vast field of soybeans at Shakopee,
Minnesota, Clinton argued that the biggest benefit of the PNTR
bill will go to the agricultural sector in economic terms as "the
magnitude of the Chinese market virtually defies the imagination."
</P>
<P>
Minnesota is the third largest state in the United States in
soybean exports and production, fourth in corn and seventh in
overall agricultural exports. In 1998, Minnesota exported 2.4
billion dollars worth of agricultural products to foreign markets,
including 316 million dollars to China.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 1.3 billion, China is the world's largest
growth market for soybeans and soybean products, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that, over the next 30 to 50 years, China will
have the biggest economy in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton pointed out that to benefit from China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), every member of the WTO "has
to agree to treat China like a member."
</P>
<P>
"The only issue is whether we are prepared to give up this
annual review in return for the economic benefits that we have
negotiated," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think if Congress turns its back on this opportunity, we'll
spend the next 20 years regretting it, and I know we'll spend the
next 20 years paying for it in ways that go far beyond dollars in
farm families' pocket."
</P>
<P>
"This is a vote for economic security," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to business leaders, worker and community leaders in
Akron, Ohio State earlier Friday, Clinton noted that "this is by
far the most important national security vote we will take this
year."
</P>
<P>
"I think if we pass it, it will strengthen and stabilize our
position in Asia and reduce the likelihood of conflict, even war,
there for a decade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that in order to benefit from the provisions of
the trade agreement reached with China in November last year, the
U.S. has to grant PNTR to the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade deal is a good deal economically and it is
more important for the national security of the United States.

The storms from April 12 to 16 buried nearly 10 hectares of
wheat fields in the Alxa Left Banner in the northwestern part of
the region, resulted in deaths or injuries of over 2,000 livestock,
and produced direct economic loss of 1.2 million yuan.
</P>
<P>

past week:
</P>
<P>
China's Pharmaceutical Industry Continues to Improve

<P>
Invention Helps China's Drug Industry Survive: Expert
</P>
<P>
Drug developers in China hope they can extract powerful

<P>
Although China has more than 6,300 pharmaceutical enterprises,
most small and medium-sized ones cannot afford huge investments in
research and development. The industry will suffer setbacks as
more and better foreign products are available on the domestic
market.

<HEADLINE> Wenger Hints at Coaching Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has expressed an interest in one day
coaching Germany, according to local reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Current coach Erich Ribbeck is expected to step down after this
summer's Euro 2000 finals.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of taking the job, Wenger told the
German daily Die Welt: "I'm very close to German football and I
could imagine it one day."
</P>
<P>
Wenger, who comes from the Alsace region in north-eastern
France bordering Germany and is fluent in the language, has also
expressed an interest in one day coaching Japan.
</P>
<P>
But he claimed that the quality of the German squad was not
what it had been in the past and this was one of the reasons for
63-year-old Ribbeck's woes.
</P>
<P>
"The players are not of the same quality as 10 or 20 years ago.
That's the best explanation for the current problems of the coach,
"said Wenger.
</P>
<P>
According to Franz Beckenbauer, vice-president of the German
Football Federation, Ribbeck, who has been under fire following a
series of poor results, will quit after Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck, however, has dismissed this as "pure speculation".

<HEADLINE> Fans Urged to Back England 2006 World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- English football fans are being
urged to sign an online petition backed by the Football
Association of England calling on FIFA to give the 2006 World Cup
to England.
</P>
<P>
Martin Peters and Gordon Banks - heroes of England's 1966 world-
beating side - are to launch the Back The Bid website on which
people can register their support for England to be the 2006 hosts.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as England's bid leaders prepare to make a
presentation to the annual conference of the Confederation of
North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football.
</P>
<P>
The five nations competing to host the 2006 tournament -
England, Brazil, Morocco, Germany and South Africa - face the
first round of votes from the 24-member FIFA World Council on 6
July.
</P>
<P>
If there is no overall winner, which is the likely outcome, the
bid with the least support is eliminated. The same process applies
to further rounds until a majority is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Fans attending Sunday's final 10 Premier League fixtures of the
season will be handed a card commemorating England's 1966 victory
and re-iterating the importance of public support for the bid.
</P>
<P>
Supporters at this weekend's crucial divisional play-offs will
also be called upon to back the bid.
</P>
<P>
Banks said: "To have played in your own country in the World
Cup Finals is an unforgettable experience.
</P>
<P>
"Asking football fans all over the country to lend a hand in
bringing it back to England in 2006 via this website is a unique
way of supporting their country's official bid," he said.
</P>
<P>
The information gathered will be used by the FA to highlight to
FIFA the level of public support for England's bid.
</P>
<P>
More than 36,000 schools have also been contacted in a bid to
encourage pupils to log on and sign the petition.
</P>
<P>
Those logging on to www.backthebid.com are encouraged to lend
their support and are offered the chance to win tickets to England
's friendly with Brazil in May.
</P>
<P>
A Back The Bid spokesman said: "This is England's best chance
of hosting the World Cup since 1966 and the bidding team is urging
the public to get behind the bid to show just how much the country
wants it."

<HEADLINE> Robson Dismiss Gascoigne Transfer Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Urgent talks have been planned
between Middlesbrough football club manager Bryan Robson and Paul
Gascoigne amid speculation over his future.
</P>
<P>
An Australian side called Joondalup City has claimed that they
are close to signing the former England midfielder on loan.
</P>
<P>
But Robson said he was amazed at the rumors that Gascoigne is
leaving the Riverside while Joondalup City's Newcastle-born
manager Paul Simmons insisted that the deal is 80% done.
</P>
<P>
Robson has admitted that there had been a suggestion that
Gascoigne may spend some time on holiday in Australia but he was
adamant that no discussions had taken place with any club.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne missed training on Thursday with a virus as the story
broke.
</P>
<P>
Robson is now keen to find out whether Gascoigne has in fact
been in contact with the Perth side.
</P>
<P>
Robson said: "It's just utter rubbish. I can't even blame the
media now because the manager of the Australian team has come out
and said that he's more or less tied the deal up with us, but we'
ve had no contact with him whatsoever. "
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing in the story at all. They can't even do
anything behind backs. Paul Gascoigne is a contracted player to
Middlesbrough Football Club," he said. "It doesn't matter what the
player agrees, if the club doesn't agree to that, then the player
can't do anything. "
</P>
<P>
"At this moment in time, Paul Gascoigne isn't fit to play in
matches. My concern at the moment is to get Paul fit and then when
we've got him in a condition where he can play a football match,
we'll be looking at areas where we might be able to send him so he
can play some football to regain his fitness. I've got to sit down
with Paul Gascoigne and make that decision on what we think is
best for him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne has started just 44 games for Boro since his 3.45
million pounds move from Glasgow Rangers in March 1998, and only
nine of them this season.

LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- West Ham midfielder Frank Lampard is
set to miss out on the senior England squad for Euro 2000 after
receiving a call up to the Under 21 European Championship side.
</P>
<P>
Howard Wilkinson, manager of England's under-21 team, named
Lampard in his 20-man junior squad, along with several other
leading Premiership players, thereby scuppering his expected
inclusion in Kevin Keegan's selection.
</P>
<P>
But Liverpool striker Emile Heskey and midfielder Steven
Gerrard, together with Newcastle's Kieron Dyer and West Ham's Rio
Ferdinand are not named, which may indicate they are being
considered by Keegan.
</P>
<P>
And Chelsea's Jody Morris is also out - because he is involved
in a court case having been charged with actual bodily harm.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Sad Scene in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of people lined the streets
of the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Saturday, mourning the death of a
three-year-old girl, the latest victim of terrorist attacks, whose
funeral was held in the day.
</P>
<P>
The tearful father told reporters that the whole family was
sleeping when the overnight attacks took place.
</P>
<P>
Awakened by the terrific bang, the father immediately went up,
only to find that his daughter had been killed and the house
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"My house is destroyed, my child is dead now, my brother and I
are hurt. Everything is destroyed, what more do you want to do?"
cried the mother who choked with sobs.
</P>
<P>
At the funeral, the father and mother threw themselves onto the
coffin of the little girl, identified as Zahra Mohammad Hamid, and
almost wept their hearts out.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Iraqi Interior Ministry has held Iranian
agents "fully responsible" for the attacks, which resulted in the
death of the little girl and injury of four other people.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian agents fired eight missiles at densely-populated
residential areas in Baghdad early Saturday morning, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Such a sad scene has been repeated several times since the
beginning of this year, and it is just one more reminder to the
people of the troubled country that their daily life is
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed and eight others injured on May 1 and 38
people were injured on March 22 in mortar and bomb attacks in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian-backed Iraqi opposition group has claimed
responsibility for Saturday's attacks, saying that it was targeted
at one of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's palaces.
</P>
<P>
For years, Iraq and Iran have been trading accusations for
harboring each other's opposition groups engaged in terrorist
activities. The dispute has been a major obstacle to the
normalization of ties between Baghdad and Tehran, which worsened
more than 10 years ago after the 1980-1988 war.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-based Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in
Iraq has vowed to continue bombings until the Iraqi regime is
toppled.
</P>
<P>
The Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO), which maintains a large
guerrilla force in Iraq, has intensified attacks on Iran in recent
months amid heated power struggle between the conservatives and
reformists in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian opposition group shelled the military headquarters
in Tehran on March 13, injuring at least four people.

northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, the electromagnetic radiation
from the mobile phones causes damage to the DNA, and increases the
electric activity of the brain, the temperature and the blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
The mobile phones' radiation also contributes to the
development of tumors especially in children depending on the
conditions under which the mobile use is made.
</P>
<P>
There is also a strong possibility that the continuous
exposure to radiation with a frequency of 900-1,800 Mhz is
possible for pathological reactions such as headaches, dizziness,
stress and others.
</P>
<P>
It appears that this type of radiation affects the driving
ability in a negative way as well as the operation of heart
pacemakers.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Economy Worries Brazilian Financial Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The concern for Argentina's
difficult economic situation affected again the Brazilian
financial market, causing a rise in the dollar parity against the
real and a drop in the Sao Paulo stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The bad news and rumors that emerged about the neighbor country
since Thursday have led investors to disregard the good
performance of the New York stock markets and to seek exchange
rate protection.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar closed Friday at 1.837 reals, rising by 0.66
percent compared to the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The Ibovespa Sao Paulo stock exchange index operated with a
rising trend until the start of Friday afternoon, following the
performance of the U.S. stocks, but the worries about Argentina
toppled the index, which closed at 14.458 points, a 0.28 percent
drop.
</P>
<P>
The Ibovespa index accumulated with Friday's drop a 6.94
percent devaluation this month, and 15.41 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said that the concerns of the Brazilian market
are caused by the misgivings that in a moment of suspicion about
the foundations of an emerging market, foreign investors might
reduce their investments in other countries with the same profile
of risk.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian and Argentine economies are very close to each
other now because of their tight commercial association.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Co. Signs Preliminary Accord With Foreign Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS May 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan state oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) Gas firm and the Shell, Esso, and
Mitsubishi companies have signed a preliminary agreement to
perform studies of economic and technical feasibility of the
Liquefied Natural Gas Project of Venezuela, said local press
reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The project includes the construction of a line of production
with an output of four million metric tons per year starting in
2005, and also the creation of 30,000 indirect jobs during the
phase of construction of the plant, which will use 800 people.
</P>
<P>
The goal of this business, in which PDVSA owns 33 percent, Sell
of Venezuela 30 percent, Esso 29 percent, and Mitubishi eight
percent, is to export liquefied natural gas to the U.S. east coast
and to the Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that because of the wealth offered by the
gas fields located north of the Paria Peninsula, and south of
Trinidad and Tobago, other production lines might be built in the
future to enter markets in the south of the continent and in the
Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal).

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Marchers Will Send Clear Message to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Congress must pass common-sense gun legislation to protect our
children without constraining the rights of legitimate gun owners,
" Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
He said every day in the United States nearly a dozen children
are killed by guns, either intentionally or accidentally, leaving
families with "a wound that never heals."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of parents and children in the United States will
rally for the licensing of gun owners and registration of firearms
in a Mother's Day in Washington Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The "Million Mom March" will take over the National Mall, while
supporters plan to gather in nearly other communities in support
of greater gun control. Scheduled participants include
entertainers, politicians and parents who personally experienced
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors want to convince Congress that ordinary Americans and
parents who personally experienced gun violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, also Sunday, members of a pro-gun organization,
Second Amendment Sisters, plan speeches on the Washington Monument
grounds and a march to the Capitol. The event is independent of
the National Rifle Association (NRA).
</P>
<P>
Gun control legislation is stalled in the U.S. Congress and
prospects for action appear dim in an election year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate approved several measures a year ago, including
a requirement that weapons have child safety locks. It also would
require a three-day waiting period before a sale by an unlicensed
gun seller at a gun show. The same time frame is currently
required for licensed dealer sales at shows and in stores.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also approved language that would ban the
importation of large-capacity ammunition clips; ban possession of
firearms by those convicted of committing violent crimes as
juveniles, and prohibit juveniles from acquiring assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, the House rejected any new controls and there are no
scheduled meetings between House and Senate conferees.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration strongly supports the safety locks
and waiting period language and has criticized the failure of
conferees to meet to fashion a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The NRA and its supporters argue there are plenty of gun
regulations now but the administration has not been enforcing them.
</P>
<P>
The "Million Mom March" organizers want further restrictions
beyond the Senate-approved measures. Chief among them is the
registration of all handguns and a license for their owners.

<HEADLINE> Mejia Seen as Sure Winner in Dominican Republic Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD,
social democrat) opposition presidential candidate Hipolito Mejia
is sure to win the first round of elections next Tuesday,
according to the results of two new opinion polls published
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One of the two polls, made by the U.S. polling firm Penn,
Schoen &AMP; Berland for the "El Siglo" newspaper, forecast that Mejia
will also win the round of voting if there us no definitive
outcome on May 16.
</P>
<P>
The other poll, made by the Argentine polling company Tesis
Consultores for the "Ultima Hora" afternoon tabloid, says the PRD
candidate is sure to win the first round, but does not consider
the possibilities for the eventual second voting.
</P>
<P>
According to the polls, those with the highest possibilities of
victory among the seven candidates vying for the presidency are,
besides Mejia, Christian Social Reformist Party (PRSC) candidate
Joaquin Balaguer, 93 years old and blind, and the ruling Dominican
Liberation Party (PLD) hopeful Danilo Medina.
</P>
<P>
Penn, Schoen &AMP; Berland forecasts that Mejia will get 47 percent
of the votes in the first round, followed by Balaguer with 27
percent, and Medina with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican electoral law demands that the winner of the
first round obtain 50 percent of the ballots cast plus one.
</P>
<P>
If none of the candidates scores that figure, the two getting
the most votes will go to a second round 45 days later.
