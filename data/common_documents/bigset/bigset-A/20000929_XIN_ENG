<HEADLINE> Russia to Reduce Army Servicemen by 350,000 in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia has decided to cut its
armed forces personnel by over 350,000 in the coming three years
from 2001 to 2003, a senior Russian military official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of Russia's armed forces personnel is inevitable,
because we are in a situation in which external military perils
have diminished and the state is unable to fully finance the army,
" said Vladislav Putilin, head of the Russian general staff's main
department of organization and mobilization.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces command regards the reduction as an objective
needed in the current phase of military building, Putilin told a
news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Dozens of thousands of servicemen will have to change
occupations, not all of them have housing or civilian professions.
It is a hard job to dismiss more than 350,000 servicemen within
three years, but we will do our best to reach the goal," Putilin
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The defense department chiefs now have a new task of "fully
carrying out missions with a reduced number of armed forces
personnel," he added.
</P>
<P>
Putilin excludes an outbreak of social tension in the army in
connection with the reduction plans. "The state pledges to give
all social guarantees to the dismissed servicemen. The budget for
2001 has a separate item for the reform of the armed forces," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The number of generals and admirals will be cut in proportion
to the reduction of the army and navy personnel. Under a recent
presidential decree, the number of generals must make up one
percent of the armed forces personnel, Putilin said.

<HEADLINE> WHO, EU to Fight Jointly for Further Tobacco Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) said Thursday that
they are committed to jointly strengthening tobacco control in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"Governments should not support measures that advertise or
glamorize tobacco products. We must do all we can to protect the
health of current and future generations," they said in a joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, WHO Director General Gro Harlem Broundtland met
with the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection David
Byrne at the EU headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
WHO says tobacco use is the most avoidable source of diseases
and premature mortality. In the EU region alone, smoking is blamed
for over 500,000 deaths every year while claiming a total of four
million lives globally.
</P>
<P>
Smoking leads to the suffering of diseases like cancer,
cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases in adults while
inflicting severe health effects on children exposed to it, says
the global health body.
</P>
<P>
"The death toll caused by tobacco consumption can and must be
avoided," the joint statement said.
</P>
<P>
The WHO and EU believe the spread of smoking is ensured by a
combination of advertising and promotion and product design in
addition to tobacco's highly addictive nature.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has proposed a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,
which could address some key issues such as cross-border
advertising, sponsorship and promotion of tobacco, often targeted
at the developing world and transitional economies, said the
European Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The EU will take part in the relevant negotiations due to start
in Geneva on October 16.
</P>
<P>
The Commission itself has proposed to reduce the tar content of
cigarettes and introduce a ceiling on nicotine and carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Europe, it added, the use of misleading
terms in labels such as "light", or "low tar" would be forbidden
and additives used in tobacco products would have to be declared
and analyzed.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Provincial Leader Hopes for More Sister-Cities (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Sister-city relationships have played a role in promoting
personal friendships, linking Jiangsu and foreign local
authorities and pushing ahead with Jiangsu's opening-up drive,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, Wang held separate meetings with more
than 20 foreign local leaders, discussing ways to further
strengthen economic and trade cooperation between sister cities.
</P>
<P>
He said that after China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, China will be able to better integrate into the
global economy, and Jiangsu needs to promote exchanges with the
rest of the world, and make good use of domestic and overseas
markets and resources.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor said that cities in developing countries
have complementary economies with Jiangsu, and they have an
interest in advancing cooperation, therefore, there exists great
potential for cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
Wang said his province hopes to further cooperate with its
foreign counterparts in such areas as urban administration,
environmental protection, agriculture and technology.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that through sister-city relationships, Jiangsu will
better understand the rest of the world, and vice versa," he said.

<HEADLINE> National Day Reception for HK, Macao, Taiwan Compatriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A National Day reception was
held today for compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and
representatives of overseas Chinese and various ethnic groups in
China.
</P>
<P>
Over 900 guests, including Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), attended the reception marking the 51st
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,
briefed those present on the situation in China, including the
successful implementation of the "One Country, Two Systems" in
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also head of the United Front Work Department of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said it is the
lofty aspiration and historical responsibility of all the Chinese
people, including the Taiwan compatriots, to resolve the Taiwan
issue and realize the complete reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said that recognition of the One China principle is the
precondition for solving the issue of Taiwan, adding any attempts
to engage in "Taiwan Independence" are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to carry out the policy of 'peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems'... and strive
unremittingly for an early realization of peaceful reunification
of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Present at the reception were Qian Qichen, a member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice-premier,
several vice-chairmen of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee and vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
The reception was held by the General Office of the CPPCC
National Committee and the United Front Work Department.

<HEADLINE> China Art Festival Unveiled in Chinese "Broadway" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Had it not been for the
traditional Chinese costumes, the settings, and the black-haired
ladies, most people would take it for granted that the grand
performance staged here this evening was a typical Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in splendid costumes, the slim-figured ladies moved in
the softest steps and presented their charming voices.
</P>
<P>
However, the performance, named after a local folk song titled
"Ode to Jasmine", differed from traditional Broadway shows. It
reflected some of the most common duties of everyday life, like
sewing, weaving and going fishing.
</P>
<P>
With the 90-minute-long performance in the capital of east
China's Jiangsu province, the Sixth China Art Festival, the
largest art gathering in China, was unveiled.
</P>
<P>
Caught in the familiar melody of "Jasmine," the audience of 4,
000 in the Wutaishan Gymnasium took a glimpse into the typical
life in this region crossed by rivers and dotted by lakes. China's
beautiful scenery was made known to the world thanks to a Chinese
painter, Chen Yifei, who painted this famous idyllic picture and
left the rest of the world in awe.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the scene echoed the memories in the bottom of his
heart. The 72-year-old He Fang, who wrote the song "Jasmine" 58
years ago based on a local folk song in Jiangsu, was moved to
tears.
</P>
<P>
Actually, "Jasmine" has already spread to the rest of the
country. It even has an English version which most foreigners
regard as a must in order to understand China.
</P>
<P>
The performance was received favorably during the rehearsal,
and before the performance started this evening, it already made
quite a fortune of about twice its production cost.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, folk songs and music are the most fascinating part
of the performance, despite the performance occasionally mixing
some tap dance steps and performers wearing cowboy outfits.
</P>
<P>
"Performances with local flavor could conquer the whole world,"
said an art critic, Jin Ping. Yu Pingping, a local teacher, said
the performance reflects the essence of the region and made her "
feel close" to the cultural essence of this region.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, several rounds of nationwide
bidding have been started for the music composition, choreographic
design, which is the new trend in the restructuring of China's art
industry.
</P>
<P>
"The production of this performance is not different from that
of a Broadway show," said general director Gu Xin.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angolan GVPT Tightens Grips up Rebels in Eastern Border Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Bian Zhuodan
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government troops's
recent take-over of the eastern town of Cazombo has further
tightened its grips on the rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), who are facing a complete
defeat.
</P>
<P>
Before the government's take-over, Cazombo was the last major
town under the rebels' control in the Eastern Moxico province, the
largest province of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces of Angola (FAA) have not only occupied a
region of great military importance, but have also assisted the
government in the diplomatic front, said a FAA source lately.
</P>
<P>
Moxico province covers some three-quarters of Angola's eastern
border with Zambia, a frontier that stretches for more than 1,000
kilometers. The Zambian government has pledged to support Angolan
government in its endeavors to restore its administration along
the bordering areas.
</P>
<P>
The FAA took over Cazombo, an UNITA's stronghold since 1991, on
September 19 with no significant human and material losses, said
the FAA source.
</P>
<P>
The fighting to take over the town was swift, as the Savimbi
followers escaped at the sight of FAA's advancing troops, said an
FAA officer, adding the rebels "didn't even have time to take down
their flag".
</P>
<P>
General Nzumbi, commander of the FAA's first grouping based in
Moxico, said that the conquer of Cazombo was followed by recapture
of other localities in the region, including towns of Lovua,
Lumbala-kakengue, Calunda and Jimbe.
</P>
<P>
The military is now focusing on wiping out "one by one" the
remaining regular units of the rebels, said the general.
</P>
<P>
At present, "we are no longer fighting the rebels in those
localities, but in the bush, because they are totally without
means", Nzumbi said.
</P>
<P>
Another main mission for the troops is to restore state
administration in the province that has been under the rebels'
occupation for a very long time, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi remains in Angola, despite
severe military setbacks over the past year, said Angolan Defense
Minister Kundi Paihama recently, adding the FAA is launching
offensives to capture him.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan civil war, with virtually no break since the country
's independence in 1975, was finally at the tunnel's end in the
first half of 2000, when the government forces had driven the
rebels out of 92 percent of the country's territory in an all-out
offensive starting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
With the overwhelming triumph on the battleground, the
government led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has started
thinking about the next steps--national reconciliation and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Deserters of UNITA are welcome back into society, including "
perhaps even Savimbi himself", said President dos Santos in June
in Bengo province.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA rebels, who have been driven to the scattered
mountainous regions, now have no means to stage a comeback, for
their purse, the diamond mines are in the government's grips.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Strengthen Anti-Corruption Crusade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Friday enjoined the newly sworn-in members of an anti-
corruption commission to "fearlessly discharge their duties" to
improve the country's image.
</P>
<P>
"You are required to fear nothing, no one. Your integrity,
honesty and decisiveness would be tested since your functions
include the punishment of those who offer and receive bribes,"
said Obasanjo at the swearing-in ceremony in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The commission was set up in line with an anti-corruption law
passed earlier this year. Obasanjo administration, which ended
more than a decade's military rule last May, put anti-corruption
one of its major policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
The annual reports of the Transparency International, an
international anti-corruption watchdog, has ranked Nigeria one of
the most corrupt countries in the world for several consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
Corruption has become the greatest impediment on the nation's
way to growth and development, said the president at the ceremony,
adding the commission would serve as a "final notice" to the
eradication of the scourge.
</P>
<P>
The commission, headed by retired judge Mohammed Akanbi, is
comprised mainly of prominent lawyers, scholars and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been given wide-ranging powers to
investigate and prosecute against corruption cases.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Stands in Silent Tribute to Trudeau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The council president, Moctar Ouane of Mali, spoke highly of
Trudeau's "deep dedication to the cause of international peace."
</P>
<P>
"The firm support he gave the United Nations and its activities
are appreciated by the entire international community," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement issued by his spokesman, Annan said
Trudeau had "made a lasting mark, not only on the life of his
country but also of the world."
</P>
<P>
"He was an effective champion for the causes about which he
cared deeply, in particular world peace and nuclear disarmament,"
the statement said. "Canada continues this tradition as an active
participant in the United Nations and in the cause of peace."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general joins Canada in mourning the loss," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Among those who stood for a minute in silent tribute to Trudeau
was former South African President Nelson Mandela, who came to New
York to belief the 15-nation council as the international mediator
for peace negotiations in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, Canada's flamboyant and popular leader who headed
Canadian governments for 16 years, died on Thursday at his home in
Montreal after a battle with Parkinson's disease and prostate
cancer.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Voices Confidence in Peace Process in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mandela, the peace mediator for Burundi, made the statement at
an open U.N. Security Council meeting, at which he briefed the 15-
nation body on the latest developments in the war-torn nation.
</P>
<P>
"I am supremely confident that, whatever the problems lay ahead,
there will be a solid peace and stability in Burundi," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a lot of details and implementation that the
parties would wish to pursue and which they should resolve among
themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two years of peace talks, mediated most recently by Mandela,
concluded on August 28 with a power-sharing agreement between the
ethnic Hutu and Tutsi political parties and the Burundi government
of President Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony in Arusha, Tanzania, brought together
representatives of 10 Tutsi parties, seven Hutu political groups,
the government and the army. But Mandela's efforts have been
hampered by the rebels' refusal to sign a cease-fire until what
they term political prisoners are released. At a follow-up summit
in Nairobi, Kenya, regional leaders gave the government and rebels
30 days to sign the cease-fire or face unspecified international
action.
</P>
<P>
"The political parties now represented a united forum that can
engage with the remaining issues that are not yet part of the
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Numerous areas of agreement can be cited as example of how the
Burundian leadership has practiced compromise, particularly on the
crucial and sensitive issue of Burundi Nations Defense Force," he
said. "Both Hutus and Tutsis have agreed that the force will be 50
percent Hutu and 50 percent Tutsi. It has also been agreed that a
body of respected and independent persons will oversee the force."
</P>
<P>
"The political agreement reached is obviously not the main and
comprehensive peace agreement since some of the major rebel groups
are still outside of the peace process," he said. "The major focus
now is on engaging those forces in the political agreement."
</P>
<P>
Opening the Security Council meeting, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan hailed the August 28 Arusha Agreement as "a
comprehensive blueprint for the reform of Burundian society," but
he also acknowledged "a number of obstacles" to its implementation
to restore peace and stability in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"The Arusha Agreement is a comprehensive blueprint for the
reform of Burundian society," Annan said. "It addresses the root
causes of the conflict, such as exclusion and genocide, as well as
the tragic consequences of the war, including the plight of
hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people.
"
</P>
<P>
"However, before this ambitious program can be fully
implemented, a number of obstacles must still be overcome," he
said, adding that the United Nations is ready to make the
contribution to the success of Mandela's efforts to bring
stability and prosperity to Burundi and the region.
</P>
<P>
Before the convocation of the open Security Council meeting,
Annan met with Mandela and exchanged views on the difficult part
in the implementation of the peace accord, including the power-
sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
But as Annan and Mandela were meeting behind closed doors at
the U.N. headquarters in New York, at least 18 civilians, among
them two women and two children, were killed Friday during clashes
between Burundi's ethnic Hutu and the army on the outskirts of the
nation's capital of Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Fighting intensified since the signing of the Arusha Agreement,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Thursday reached agreement on a
formal statement calling on all parties in Burundi to stop
fighting and start implementing the Arusha Agreement aimed at
ending the country's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Burundi began in 1993 when paratroops from the
Tutsi-dominated army assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, a member of the Hutu ethnic
majority. More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been
killed since then in attacks by the army and rebels.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Soybean Exports Up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian soybean
exports rose to the unprecedented level of 9.7 million tons in the
first eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The soybean exports, worth 1.84 billion U.S. dollars, grew 26
percent in volume and 36 percent in value, compared to the same
period of 1999, reported the Foreign Trade Ministry authorities
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the exports of soya-bean cake, with more added
value, amounted to 6.42 million tons, 2 percent less than in the
same period of 1999. The total volume to be exported in the whole
year will reach 9.2 million tons, the least since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The setback in the bran and oil exports this year was
attributed to several factors, one of them the change in the
profile of the importing countries, especially China, which was
one of the main importers of oil and soya-bean cake.
</P>
<P>
Another of the factors mentioned by the industry for the
increase of sales of the grain at the expenses of bran and oil, is
the present tax policy, which levy no tax for the export of
soybeans.

<HEADLINE> Barak Convenes Emergency Meeting on Bloody Clashes EDS-2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak convened an emergency meeting Friday evening to assess the
situation after bloody clashes beween Israeli soldiers and
Palestinians erupted in the holy sites over which both Israel and
the Palestinians claimed sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Head of Israel's General Security Service, officials from Public
Security Ministry, Israel Defense Forces' General Staff and South
Command, and other security personnel attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office said that further steps,
such as strengthening police forces, will be agreed upon at the
meeting with the goal to restore calm in the area and prevent the
spread of riots.
</P>
<P>
Contacts with the Palestinian National Authority had been made
to urge the Palestinians to prevent the situation from
deteriorating, according to the statement. Both Israel and the
Palestinians also reportedly made contacts with the United States,
and urged the other side to keep cool.
</P>
<P>
Barak said in the statement that he thought the bloody riots,
the severest in months, are very serious. He blamed the clashes as
a result of incitement by the Palestinians and called on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to take measures. Otherwise, he
threatened, Israel will intervene.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred at noon Friday when Israeli army broke into
the religious compound, known as Noble Sanctuary to Palestinians,
to disperse the Palestinian crowd who reportedly pelted Israeli
soldiers and Jewish worshippers praying at the nearby Western Wall
with stones.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Radio claimed that the Israeli troops fired live
ammunition which was the cause of four Palestinians deaths and over
250 injuries.
</P>
<P>
Israel, meanwhile, said the soldiers only fired tear gas and
rubber bullets, and 29 policemen and ambulance men, including
Jerusalem District Police Commander Ya'ir Yitzhaki, were lightly
injured. However, some police officials suggested that they have
used live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The riots later spread to other areas, such as road junctions
near Bethlehem, Nablus and Anatot, an Arab town in north Jerusalem,
leading to further injuries.
</P>
<P>
But the situation in the religious compound has calmed down
after Israel police reached an agreement with the Wakf, the Muslim
trust administrating holy shrines, on the overseeing of evacution
of remaining Palestinian prayers from the area.
</P>
<P>
Jewish prayers had resumed their prayers at the Western Wall
outside the compound as the Jewish New Year started Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The area is within the walled Old City in East Jerusalem, which
Israel captured and annexed in 1967. The Palestinians want the
entire East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent
state while Israel declares the whole of Jerusalem its "undivided,
eternal" capital.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been running high since Thursday when Ariel Sharon,
leader of the right-wing Likud party, visited the Muslim holy site
under the escort of thousands of Israeli policemen.
</P>
<P>
Clashes erupted between Palestinian demonstrators, who were
shouting "God is Greatest" and "Murderer Out," and Israeli
policemen immediately after the visit, in which dozens of policeman
and at least 10 Palestinians were injured.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Morocco Keen on Strengthening Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Morocco concluded on
Friday a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the fields
of construction, infrastructure and technologies.
</P>
<P>
The memo was signed by Turkish Minister of Public Works and
Housing Koray Aydin and visiting Moroccan Minister of Equipment
Bauamor Taghouan in Ankara, reported Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Aydin said at the signing ceremony that the two countries had
agreed on cooperation involving highways, dams, water works,
education, exchange of experts and measures against earthquakes and
other natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that Turkish contractors will take
part in Morocco's construction, Aydin said, adding that he will
visit Morocco in the near future to this end.
</P>
<P>
The activities of the Turkish contractors were concentrated in
Libya, Saudi Arabia and Iraq until the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In recent years however, according to an official report, the
Turkish contractors have begun to shift their activities to the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Eastern Europe and the Asian
countries, due to the economic problems and political instability
in the Middle Eastern and North African countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Taghouan expressed hope that the two governments
should encourage the increase of trade volume between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Taghouan arrived in Turkey on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Tourism Blossoms from Last Year's Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's tourism blossomed from
last year's recession as nearly 7 million tourists visited the
country in the first eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Institute on Friday said that 6.8 million
foreign tourists visited Turkey in the January-August period, up
35.6 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In August alone, there were nearly 1.8 million tourist arrivals,
31.5 percent more than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Turkish tourism was hit heavily by the two devastating
earthquakes which rocked the western region in the second half of
last year. The sector also suffered from problems such as heavy
traffic, poor urbanization and environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed this year's recovery partly to the
authorities' efforts on promoting the sector by holding conferences
on culture and religious beliefs, as well as improving tourism-
related infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to incent the sector further, they called on the
government to take more measures, such as lowering the high
entrance fees at museums and encouraging domestic visitors.
</P>
<P>
They said that domestic tourism, a demand of Turkish people and
a big economic activity, should not be neglected any more by the
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Rocketing fuel prices
have hit Tanzania heavily and are threatening the already rickety
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The pump diesel price rose from the previous 584 shillings to
600 Tanzanian shillings (about 800 Tanzanian shillings for one U.S.
dollar) a liter in Dar es Salaam last week while the petrol price
rose from 605 shillings to 607 shillings, and the kerosene price
from 458 shillings to 510 shillings.
</P>
<P>
Previously, petrol prices in Tanzania remained far higher than
those of diesel, but now the prices of the two petroleum
commodities are close.
</P>
<P>
In Dar es Salaam, commuter buses which used to charge 100
shillings a ride are now charging 150 shillings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said Tanzania's oil imports fell to 25,982.2
tons in June this year from 65,219.6 tons in the previous month
due to high prices of crude oil at the world market.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the World Bank have been quoted as saying that
developing countries will see their gross domestic product reduced
by 1 percent next year if the oil price remains at 35 dollars a
barrel.

JOHANNESBURG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- South African Reserve
Bank Governor Tito Mboweni Friday described the HIV/AIDS pandemic
as a main enemy of the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a graduation ceremony at the University of the
North at Turfloop, Mboweni lamented that approximately 4.2
million people in South Africa have fallen victims of the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
"It is real. It is spreading. Every single day a further 1500
to 1700 people in South Africa get infected," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that among pregnant women attending public
health clinics, the level of infection had risen from 0.7 percent
in 1990 to 22.4 percent in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the banker, between 1997 and 1998, the infection
rate among 15 to 19 year olds rose by a phenomenal 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni called for awareness on the killer disease, saying
about 45 percent of people in the low-income communities either
believe that there is a cure for the disease or that the disease
is not a fatal one.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has
urged people in the country to take precautions to prevent
possible recurrence of the devastating floods taking place in the
country between January and March this year, media here reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Even if rainfall is normal in the forthcoming rainy season,
danger of flooding still remains in much of the southern and
central areas in Mozambique as the soil there is still waterlogged,
said Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao Thursday at a seminar with
the theme "lessons learnt during the last floods".
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that because the water table in earth
remains a very high level in those areas, the soil's capacity to
absorb more water is limited.

<P>
Simao urged people at all levels "to verify our level of
preparedness for an eventual new catastrophe, particularly during
the period between January and March".
</P>
<P>
The families, neighborhoods, district and provincial
authorities and business community should work jointly towards
reducing people's vulnerability to disasters, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has been taking efforts to reconstruct
infrastructures destroyed by floods early this year but the
process has been hampered by lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Over half of the money pledged by the international community
has not yet been disbursed, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister expressed hope that the international
community will honor its promises made in response to the
Mozambican government's appeal for support.
</P>
<P>
The National Meteorology Institute of Mozambique has predicted
a rainfall level of between normal and above normal between this
October and next March in the country, and the government is
expected to present, before the end of October, an emergency plan
on the possible flooding in the forthcoming rainy season.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The National Unity and
Reconciliation Commission of Rwanda has identified poverty,
illiteracy, resettlement constraints and problems in the judicial
sector as hindrances to the reconciliation of Rwandans, Rwanda
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan youths have a vital role to play in reconciling
Rwandans, said Chairman of the National Youth Council John Rusimbi
while meeting representatives at all levels in preparation for the
national conference on reconciliation that is due between 18-20
next month.
</P>
<P>
Rusimbi, also a member of the National Unity and Reconciliation
Commission, was quoted as saying that as long as reconciliation is
attained, 80 percent of Rwanda's problems will be solved.
</P>

Meanwhile, David Nyanshaija, director in the Ministry of Youth,
Culture, Sports and Vocational Training, urged people to look back
and see what has so far been achieved and work hard to meet tasks
ahead.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner to Visit East African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Paul Nielson, the
European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, is to
pay a visit to some east African countries to assess the need for
aid from the European Union, the Walta Information Center reported
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nielson is scheduled to visit Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and E
Eritrea between October 3 and 9, to obtain first hand information
about the impacts of the conflict and droughts upon the region,
the report quoted an European Union (EU) source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea had been locked in a two-year border
conflict since May, 1998 before they signed a cease-fire agreement
in June this year. Kenya and Djibouti have been suffering from
severe droughts in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Nielson is expected to meet government authorities and non-
governmental organizations to raise public awareness of the
efforts undertaken by the European Commission in providing support
by means of humanitarian aid, food aid and development cooperation,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Much of the mission is expected to consist of field trips to
areas where the commission has funded and is funding humanitarian
activities.
</P>
<P>
With 432,000 tons of food aid already delivered or about to
arrive in Ethiopia before the end of this year, the commission has
been playing a major role along with other international donors in
addressing the humanitarian needs caused by wars and droughts in
the Horn of Africa, said the EU source.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Spending, Income Up in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal consumption
spending rose 0.6 percent in August while personal income
increased 0.4 percent, pulling the nation's personal savings rate
down to a record monthly low, the Commerce Department reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In July, Americans' incomes grew by 0.3 percent but their
spending rose twice as fast, by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
As Americans' spending grew at a faster rate than income, the
personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of after-tax
personal income, dropped to a negative 0.4 percent in August, an
all-time monthly low since the government began tracking the
indicator in 1959. July's savings rate was revised upward from a
negative 0.2 percent to zero.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that Americans' spending on durable goods,
cars and other costly manufactured goods expected to last at least
three years, grew by 1.6 percent in August, the fastest pace since
a 1.7 percent increase in February. In July, spending on durable
goods rose 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spending on nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, rose 0.2
percent in August, down from a 0.7 percent rise the month before.
</P>
<P>
Total income growth last month was dampened in part by the
departure of temporary federal government census workers. Analysts
also expected sluggish job growth in August to temper income
growth for the month.

Trudeau's body will lie in state in Parliament Saturday and
remain there until Monday, when he will lie in state in Montreal
before the state funeral.
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, who has been treasured as a political giant in the
country, died Thursday afternoon in Montreal in his sleep from
complications from prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease. He
would have turned 81 in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, Parliament is paying tribute to the former prime
minister, who was in power from 1968 until 1984, except for a nine-
month gap between 1979 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a cabinet minister in
successive Trudeau governments, was the first to honor the "man of
extraordinary courage" in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
"He set in motion forces of change that are still shaping the
soul of a people and a nation," said Chretien.
</P>
<P>
His political foe, Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day, said
Trudeau "grabbed a generation" and "profoundly influenced"
Canadians with his power to stand and face turmoil and crisis "we
had not seen before."
</P>
<P>
In Montreal, people have been outpouring their sympathy and
respect by presenting flowers and notes at the front doorstep
outside Trudeau's home.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 29 (Xinhua) --Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis had a telephone conversation Friday with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, discussing the recent indirect talks between
Cyprus' two communities in New York.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that during the
telephone conversation, Simitis reiterated Athens' support for
Nicosia's efforts to find a just and viable solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem, the semi-official Athens News Agency (
ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the eastern Mediterranean
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the island in a federation formula in line with U.N.
resolutions, the Greek Cypriot side led by Clerides has held
several rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks with the Turkish
Cypriot side led by Rauf Denktash, who, along with Turkey, demands
that a confederation formed by two sovereign states be set up on
the island.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of such talks ended with no breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
To further coordinate the two countries' actions, Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou has invited his Cypriot counterpart and
political party leaders to visit Athens early October,
</P>
<P>
As Cyprus' supporter, Greece signed a joint defense pact with
the island republic.

ATHENS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou has called on Yugoslav opposition candidate Vojislav
Kostunica to participate in that country's presidential run-off.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou urged Kostunica to reconsider the likelihood to
enter the second round of presidential elections under the
precondition that there would be international observers present,
according to the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Seeing this as "an intervention in domestic affairs" of
Yugoslavia, Kostunica rejected Papandreou's such appeal because
the candidate insisted that he had received more than 50 percent
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Under Yugoslavia's electoral law, a majority of the votes is
required in the first round. But the Yugoslav Federal Electoral
Commission announced that neither President Slobodan Milosevic nor
Kostunica met this demand.

Milosevic and Kostunica will have to take part in the country's

<P>
MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Pakistan have
agreed to work together to restore peace in Afghanistan, Pakistani
Ambassador to Moscow Iftikhar Murshed said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached earlier this week during the visit to
Islamabad by Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Interfax news agency quoted Murshed as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries expressed their determination to fight
terrorism and drug trafficking and to cooperate closely in this
regard," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
While in Islamabad, Yastrzhembsky was received by Pakistani
leader General Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani foreign and
interior ministers, Murshed said.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has invited Putin to visit Pakistan "at a mutually
convenient time," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The Talibans have reportedly made major advances in the
northern part of the country against the Northern Alliance, which
Russia supports.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on some media reports that Yastrzhembsky's
visit to Pakistan was possibly Moscow's first step toward becoming
closer to the Taliban movement, Murshed said "the Talibans are a
reality and have been the dominant factor in Afghanistan for the
last several years."
</P>
<P>
"It is for the Russian government to decide what their policy
should be toward the Taliban," Murshed said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin has said that Moscow "would like to see India play a
genuinely important role in international affairs," the Itar-Tass
news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see this because this is in our national
interests," Putin said in an interview with the India Today
magazine and the Moscow-based English-language Russia Journal
newspaper on the eve of his visit to India, which starts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The interview is scheduled to appear in Russia Journal on
Saturday and in India Today on Monday, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Putin dismissed the assumption that Moscow has forgotten the
old ties of friendship with New Delhi and started looking west. "
We have a saying: one old friend is better than two new ones," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president said India is a crucial factor for stability in
the region and in the world as a whole and that Russian-Indian
cooperation will never be directed against any third country.
</P>
<P>
"It is in our interests to have a strong, developed and
independent India, an India that would be a major player on the
world scene," Putin said. "We see this as one of the balancing
factors in the world, and we will do all we can to ensure this
doesn't change."
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Putin said the market economy and
democratic government have "definitively won in Russia and are
here to stay."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed any possibility that democracy, the market economy
and freedom of the press could be reversed in Russia, Tass
reported.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Plane in Iraq to Show Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A Yemeni plane, in defiance of
U.N. sanctions, touched down at the Saddam International Airport
here Friday afternoon to show solidarity with the sanctions-hit
country.
</P>
<P>
This was the second plane from Arab countries to arrive in
Baghdad since Iraq reopened the airport on August 17, and it was
also the first flight from Yemen to Iraq in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Abdul Qader Ba Jammal, who led the delegation, told reporters the
visit is aimed at showing not only solidarity with the Iraqi
people, but also trying to build a new future for the Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his government's call for lifting the decade-old
United Nations sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, who welcomed the Yemeni
delegation at the airport, praised the Yemeni move and slammed
the "illegal" air ban imposed on Iraq by the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 people, including Yemeni Information Minister Abdul
Rahman al-Akwa, parliamentarians and journalists were aboard the
Boeing 727-200 plane.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni plane came after a Jordanian plane landed in Baghdad
on Thursday, being the first plane from an Arab country in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Russia and France were the first to break what the U.S. and
Britain insist "air ban" on Iraq by sending planes to Baghdad after
notifying, instead of getting permission from the United Nations
Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Russia and France will send more
planes to Iraq, and India, Iceland, Syria and Lebanon are
considering flying planes to Baghdad to further crack the air ban.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain maintain that all flights to or from Iraq
must get permission from the United Nations Sanctions Committee,
but Russia and France do not think the authorization is necessary
as they claim that the U.N. sanctions on Iraq do not cover air
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq rejects that the sanctions include an air embargo, saying
that no U.N. resolution forbids humanitarian or civil flights to or
from Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Clashes Spread to West Bank Towns EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes between
Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in the religious compound in East
Jerusalem earlier Friday have sparked confrontations near the
Palestinian self-ruling town of Bethlehem, Nablus and Anatot.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of injuries on both sides, but no exact data
are available so far, according to Israel Police spokesman office.
</P>
<P>
The unrest in the religious compound, known as Noble Sanctuary
to Muslims and Temple Mount to Jews, subsided and many Israeli
soldiers posted there had been picked up by army vehicles and
rushed out, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces reportedly had evacuated residents of
the Or Yosef Settlement near Nablus on account of the current
incidents.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in the holy sites in the walled Old City in East
Jerusalem erupted earlier in the day when thousands of Palestinian
worshipers gathered in the Muslim compound for Friday noon prayers.
</P>
<P>
The compound, housing the third holiest shrines of Islam of Al
Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock, is the site of the former
Jewish Temple, the most sacred shrine of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police claimed that after the prayers, the Palestinians
began hurling stones at the Israelis soldiers posted near the site
and the Jews who are praying at the nearby Western Wall, the only
relics of the Jewish Temple, ahead of Friday afternoon's Jewish New
Year.
</P>
<P>
The police reportedly fired rubber bullets and tear gas to
scatter the crowd. However, the riots later turned bloody and at
least five Palestinians have died and hundreds more injured by live
rounds fired by Israeli army, Palestinian Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel Police reportedly have reached an agreement with the
Muslim trust Wakf, which administrates the Muslim holy sites, that
the organization will oversee the evacuation of the remaining
worshippers from the compound.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty over the site was the deal-breaker at July's
Camp David summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The area is within the walled Old City in East Jerusalem, which
Israel captured and annexed in 1967. The Palestinians want the
entire East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent
state while Israel declares the whole of Jerusalem its "undivided,
eternal" capital.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been running high since Thursday when Ariel Sharon,
leader of the right-wing Likud party, visited the Muslim holy site
under the escort of thousands of Israeli policemen.
</P>
<P>
Clashes erupted between Palestinian demonstrators, who were
shouting "God is Greatest" and "Murderer Out," and Israeli
policemen immediately after the visit, in which dozens of policeman
and at least 10 Palestinians were injured.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Retain Control Over Economy Despite Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia would continue
to have control over its economy despite the threat of
globalization with its emphasis on borderless society and free
trade, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday.
</P>
<P>
While globalization would be unavoidable, it is important for
Malaysians to try and retain control over the country as much as
the Westerners would like to retain theirs, he said at a dialogue
with participants of the one-day National Muslim Youth
Intellectual Discourse here, According to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we accept that there would be globalization and that
borders will be less than before. Even if there is to be a
borderless society, we must have certain control over economy as
much as they (the West) would want to have control over themselves,
" he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the globalization propagated by the West would only
benefit them as they wanted developing countries like Malaysia to
be fully open for them to conduct business without any
restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Arusha Agreement as "Comprehensive Blueprint" for Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan made the statement at an open U.N. Security Council
meeting, which was held to hear a briefing of the mediator, former
South African President Nelson Mandela, on the latest development
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Arusha Agreement is a comprehensive blueprint for the
reform of Burundian society," Annan said. "It addresses the root
causes of the conflict, such as exclusion and genocide, as well as
the tragic consequences of the war, including the plight of
hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people.
"
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to President Mandela's work, the peace process moved
forward significantly," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"However, before this ambitious program can be fully
implemented, a number of obstacles must still be overcome," he
said, adding that the United Nations is ready to make the
contribution to the success of Mandela's efforts to bring
stability and prosperity to Burundi and the region.
</P>
<P>
Two years of peace talks, mediated most recently by Mandela,
concluded on August 28 with a power-sharing agreement between the
ethnic Hutu and Tutsi political parties and the Burundi government
of President Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony in Arusha, Tanzania, brought together
representatives of 10 Tutsi parties, seven Hutu political groups,
the government and the army. But Mandela's efforts have been
hampered by the rebels' refusal to sign a cease-fire until what
they term political prisoners are released. At a follow-up summit
in Nairobi, Kenya, regional leaders gave the government and rebels
30 days to sign the cease-fire or face unspecified international
action.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters earlier Friday, Annan
told reporters, "Obviously, most of the protagonists have signed
the peace agreement, and now we have to try and get a cease-fire
and move forward with the implementation of the agreement."
</P>
<P>
Before the convocation of the open Security Council meeting,
Annan met with Mandela and exchanged views on the difficult part
in the implementation of the peace accord, including the power-
sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"It is always a difficult situation when you get into power-
sharing arrangements," Annan said, "The parties have to get used
to each other, particularly parties which have been at war. So it
is never an easy process, but it is an option that has to be
considered."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Thursday reached agreement on a
formal statement calling on all parties in Burundi to stop
fighting and start implementing the Arusha Agreement aimed at
ending the country's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Burundi began in 1993 when paratroops from the
Tutsi-dominated army assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, a member of the Hutu ethnic
majority. More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been
killed since then in attacks by the army and rebels.

<P>
BERLIN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Franz Beckenbauer, who led the
effort to land Germany the 2006 World Cup, was selected Friday by
his country's soccer officials as president of the organizing
committee for soccer's premier event.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer will be backed by the same team that helped him win
Germany the right to host the World Cup in a heated and close vote
with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The German Soccer Federation chose his right-hand man, Horst
Schmidt, to be in charge of finances, security and stadiums.
Wolfgang Niersbach will handle the press and Fedor Radman
marketing and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, also president of Bayern Munich, said:"We
complement each other ideally _ it has to function with this team.
"
</P>
<P>
The committee's official headquarters will be located in Munich
and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, who didn't want the job at first, said he hoped it
didn't take as much time as landing the 2006 World Cup and hopes
he can handle it as a sideline chore.
</P>
<P>
He said that "But maybe I'm being a little naive."
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, who also led the Germans to World Cup titles as a
player and coach, is given enormous credit in the country for
using his influence and popularity to bring the event to Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
(MSDW) forecast a faster growth in the number of Asian Internet
users in the coming four years.
</P>
<P>
Research results by the MSDW economists showed that by the end
of 2000, the total Internet users in all Asian countries except
Japan will rise 28 percent to 68 million, and by the end of 2004,
the figure is expected to go up by 12 percent to 176 million,
significantly higher than equivalent growth rates in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The results also showed that the key markets of Australia,
China, India and the Republic of Korea will collectively account
for 85 percent of the projected Asian Internet users, and this
represents the largest revenue opportunities in online advertising
and B2C e-business.
</P>
<P>
The economists believed that the Asian online advertising
market will hit 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2004 and B2C e-
commerce will reach 30 billion U.S. dollars, or about 1.5 billion
dollars in net revenues.

SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- USA's Dream Team escaped a
last minute shock defeat as they narrowly beat Lithuania 85-83 in
the men's basketball semifinals of the Sydney Olympics here at the
SuperDome on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After falling behind early and being down 48-36 at half time,
the underdog Lithuanian team rallied back with a 20-6 scoring run
to take the lead 56-54 five minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania remained in the lead with five minutes left in the
game. The lead changed hands a couple of times, and then the score
was tied 80-80 going into the final minute.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania had the momentum going into the last 60 seconds and
after a great defensive stop, Ramunas Siskauskas was fouled
attempting a three-point shot.
</P>
<P>
Instead of giving Lithuania a handy lead, he made only one of
his three free throw attempts, and was forced to watch a driving
Vince Carter give USA the lead 82-81.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Garnett made a steal in Lithuania's back court and was
fouled and sent to the free throw line. He missed both shots, but
Antonio Mcdyess grabbed the offensive rebound and sunk the ball to
put the USA out in front 84-81.
</P>
<P>
Sarunas Jasikevicius scored to keep Lithuania within one and
then a foul sent Jason Kidd of USA to the line. He made one shot
and then Lithuania, USA and 14,653 fans watched Jasikevicius
launch a desperate three-point shot on the sounding buzzer. The
shot missed.
</P>
<P>
The USA will play France in the gold medal match.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Ambassador: Chinese Premier's Visit Important to Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) --Japanese Ambassador to China
Tanino Sakutano said Friday that China's Premier Zhu Rongji's
upcoming visit to Japan is significant to the development of
bilateral relations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Sakutano said during an interview with Xinhua that the Japanese
side expects that during the premier's visit to Japan, the two
sides will further Japan-China relations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Keeping a friendly and cooperative relations between Japan and
China in the 21st century is the "duty and responsibility" of the
two countries, and it will be good for the peace and stability of
the Asian-Pacific region and the whole world as well, said the
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Japan in 1998. The two
sides signed agreements on 33 cooperative projects covering
politics, economy and trade, science and technology, culture,
education, globalization and regional issues. Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi visited China last year.
</P>
<P>
Sakutano said he expects the two sides will discuss the further
implementation of the 33 projects during Zhu's visit to Japan,
which will begin October 12. The two sides will also exchanged

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the normalization of Japan-China relations nearly 30
years ago, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two
countries have grown "better than expected." Sakutano said, citing
the growing trade figures over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade volume hit a record of 66.2 billion U.S. dollars
last year. China is now the second largest trade partner of Japan
after the U.S. and Japan is now the biggest trading partner of
China. In the first half of the year, bilateral trade grew 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
"An important reason for the growing trade is that the two
economies are highly complimentary," the Ambassador said, adding
that the trade will possibly grow even higher after China becomes
a full member of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
A stable and growing China is extremely important to the peace
and stability of the Asian-Pacific region and world as well, and
that is why Japan has offered support to China's reform and
opening drive over the past decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, Japan has offered loans and other financial
assistance of up to 200 billion yuan to China, helping the country
construct railways, highways, ports, air terminals, relieve
poverty, protect the environment and improve health care
facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between Japan and China in the 21st century, I
believe, will be one based on solid mutual trust, and for the
peace and prosperity of the whole world," stressed the ambassador.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong registered a
moderate increase in total deposits and loans of all authorized
institutions in August, Statistics released Friday by the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority showed.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits increased by 2.5 percent in August, with both
Hong Kong dollar and foreign currency deposits registering
increases, the statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
As foreign currency deposits rose faster than Hong Kong dollar
deposits, the share of Hong Kong dollar deposits in total deposits
declined from 54 percent in July to 53 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong dollar deposits rose slightly by 0.5 percent in
August. The rise was mainly attributable to an increase in savings
deposits, while demand and time deposits were virtually unchanged
compared with the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency deposits increased for the seventh consecutive
month, rising by 4.8 percent in August. Of the total, U.S. dollar
deposits registered a more notable rise of 6.6 percent, while non-
U.S. dollar deposits rose more moderately by 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total loans and advances increased by 3.1 percent in August,
following a decline of 1.3 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong dollar M1 declined slightly by 0.3 percent in August.
This was mainly attributable to a decline in currency held by the
public. Both Hong Kong dollar M2 and M3 increased by 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Digital Signature Framework to Boost E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
has adopted a three-pronged approach in establishing a digital
signature framework to drive e-commerce under the "Digital 21" IT
Strategy, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a video conference, Secretary for Information
Technology and Broadcasting Carrie Yau said, to establish this
framework, the government had put in place the necessary
legislation, established a public certification authority, and
taken the lead in using these facilities to help drive greater IT
use within the private sector and the community.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth of Virginia Information Technology Conference
was attended by more than 500 state officials and professionals
from the IT industry of Virginia, via video conferencing in Hong
Kong Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Yau told the audience that Hong Kong had over the past couple
of years devoted a lot of efforts and resources to build a digital
signature infrastructure for the conduct of secure electronic
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government put in force an ordinance on
electronic transactions in January this year, which provides the
legal framework for the development of a public key infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The second prong is the establishment of a public certification
authority, and the third is for the government to adopt public key
infrastructure technology in the delivery of public services.
</P>
<P>
"The framework has certainly contributed significantly towards
realizing our vision of becoming a leading digital city and a
regional e-commerce hub and represents a major step forward for
Hong Kong in the new Information Age," Yau said.

Military officials said Friday.

Central Mindanao, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes said.
</P>

offensive remained at 111.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, four soldiers were killed and 11 other
government troops wounded.

<P>
The operation against the Abu Sayyaf has been stepped up in a
bid to rescue the remaining 17 hostages. All the hostages are
still alive, the military chief said.

against the Abu Sayyaf will be completed soon. But Reyes declined

SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Being an odds-on sure bet for
the gold medal, the U.S. "Dream Team" booked its berth for the
men's basketball final with the smallest margin of victory at the
Sydney Olympic Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dream Team composed of big NBA stars, only narrowly escaped
a humiliating defeat against Lithuania by winning the semifinal 85-
83 after a comfortable 12-point advantage at halftime.
</P>
<P>
It's a shock and still a humiliation for the Americans as they
have never lost in Olympic competition since 1992 when NBA
professionals were introduced to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
With 10.8 seconds left, Lithuania only trailed by one point.
After Phoenix Suns all-star Jason Kidd managed one of two foul
shots, Lithuania still had the chance of victory but guard Sarunas
Jasikevicius missed his three point shot at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
The two-point margin of victory was the narrowest for the
United States in the Olympics since the semifinal in 1988, when
they lost to the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
With the no-dreaming win, the United States will play France in
the final on Sunday for the gold medal of the Olympic Games, while
Lithuania will play Australia for the bronze medal.

<HEADLINE> Cities Worldwide Face More Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- As more and more people rush
into big cities, mayors are facing more problems.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held by the Sixth World Major Cities'
Summit Beijing 2000 here today, they expressed their worries and
discussed solutions.
</P>
<P>
"Tourists bring mountains of money to Bangkok, but the city's
traffic jam turns to be even more famous," said Samak Sundaravej,
Governor of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
He explained that more than 2 million vehicles run in the city,
causing serious air pollution. The city has decided to introduce
state-of-the-art technologies and management to ease the problem.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries are also overshadowed by the same problems.
Claude Roland, Deputy Mayor of Paris, said that the city's traffic
condition is terrible in rush hour.
</P>
<P>
"However, our new measures have got it better," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, the city has paved more sidewalks and
reduced the number of cars traveling along the beautiful Seine
River. It is very reassuring when the city encourages citizens to
walk by foot, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Problems that are faced by the mayors also include population
explosion, illegal immigration, extreme poverty, violent crime,
Internet crime and irrational city planning.
</P>
<P>
The progress of democracy is another major topic cities'
leaders talked about.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing is trying its best to enable the authorities'
decisions to go in accordance with citizens' aspiration," said Liu
Qi, Mayor of Beijing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> l Israeli Border Guard Killed in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GAZA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli border guard was
killed and another was wounded when a Palestinian policeman
reportedly opened fire at them during a joint patrol at the West
Bank town of Qalkilia early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the Palestinian policeman, called
Nail Yasin, shot at the the two Israeli soldiers while they were
having breakfast wounding both of them but a one who was fatally
injured died later at an Israeli hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security troops immediately cordoned the town
disallowing Palestinians to go in or out of it.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Major General Yitezhaq Daton termed the attack as "
very serious" particularly as it occurred in Qalkilia which
experienced " constructive co-operation " between the Israeli and
Palestinian policemen so far.
</P>
<P>
Daton soon decided to suspend the joint patrolling activities.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official with the Qalkilia-based Joint Liaison
Command Office expressed regret for the accident complaining that
it would also hurt the Palestinian interest.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police arrested Yasin but denied handing him over
to the concerned Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yasin, 27, lived in the northern Nablus's village of Asirah
which was attacked on August 27 by Israeli forces who hunted for
resistant Islamic Hamas member Abu Hannud wherein 3 Israeli
soldiers were killed by their own colleagues mistakenly.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Israeli Tourism Minister Amnon Lavkin Shahak
told Israeli Radio "it is in favour of the Palestinians to refrain
from attacking Israelis in order to avoid disappointment in the
ongoing efforts for a final peace agreement with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, Israeli troops were violently attacked
in different locations. An Israeli soldier was killed and another
injured in a bomb attack on Wednesday while no casualties were
reported after an explosive went off against an Israeli patrol
wagon on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Fears are spiralling that violence could return to the region
in the wake of lapses over final status issues between Israeli and
Palestinian peace negotiators.

</P>
<P>
Israel police said that all the 22,000 of the Muslim worshippers
who were present at the compound were now dispersed, except a few
hundred hard-core are still estimated to be inside mosques at the
site.
</P>
<P>
Jewish prayers at the Western Wall outside the compound, who
were praying for the start of Jewish New Year beginning Friday
afternoon, were also evacuated from the area.
</P>
<P>
The site hosts the most holy Muslim and Jewish places in
the Old City, such as the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque
and the relics of the Jewish First and Second Temple which Israel
claimed laid beneath the earth.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty over the site is the deal-breaker between Israel
and the Palestinians at last July's Camp David summit between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been running high since Thursday when Ariel Sharon,
leader of the hawkish Likud party, visited the site under the
escort of thousands of Israeli policemen.
</P>
<P>
Clashes erupted between Palestinian demonstrators, who were
shouting "God is Greatest" and "Murderer Out", and Israeli
policemen immediately after the visit, in which dozens of policeman
and at least ten Palestinians were injured.

ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Sindh High Court
in Lahore on Friday rejected an application moved by the counsel
for ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for calling the chief
executive of Pakistan and some other retired generals as witnesses
in a plane hijacking case.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied beyond any doubt that the appellant has
failed to make out a case for production of additional evidence of
the witnesses in question and that this application has not been
filed with bona fide intention but with a view to obtaining undue
and uncalled-for advantage which cannot be permitted," the full
bench of the court was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of
Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Anti-Terrorism Court in Karachi awarded Sharif
the death penalty in April this year for his order to refuse a

accepted the judgment and made an appeal to the Sindh High Court.

<HEADLINE> India's Economic Growth Slips to 5.8 Percent During April-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Hit by a slowdown in
industry and agriculture, India's economic growth slid to 5.8
percent during April-June this year compared to 6.9 percent in the
same period of last year, an official statement said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
India's gross domestic product (GDP) at constant price was
estimated at 2.86524 trillion rupees (63.67 billion U.S. dollars)
during the second quarter this year, or the first quarter of the
country's 2000-2001 financial year, as against 2.70732 trillion
rupees (60.16 billion U.S. dollars) in the corresponding period
last year, said the statement from the Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The decline in GDP during the April-June period has been
attributed to a mere 2.5 percent growth in agriculture, forestry
and fishing sectors, in comparison to a 4.9 percent growth for
these sectors in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector grew by 5.5 percent during the second
quarter this year, also lower than the 6.1 percent growth recorded
last year, the statement added.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
promised Friday to keep pressure on oil producing countries to
guarantee enough oil supply as a further lowering of oil prices is
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made at the annual auto show in Paris, Chirac
said he hope that the oil consumption countries and the oil
producing countries would reach mutual understanding as both sides
are involved in oil-related problems.
</P>
<P>
"We understand their problems but we also try to explain to
them ours in order to arrive at a balance point which is
convenient for each other and acceptable for developing countries,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac vowed to make the biggest efforts in working with the
leaders of oil producing countries to make sure that oil prices
continue to drop.
</P>
<P>
"The process has started... Some oil companies have already
begun lowering prices. It is indispensable that this process
continues," he added.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil price has fallen to below 30 dollars a barrel
from 36 dollars a week ago after the member countries of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said at a
summit in Venezuela that they will guarantee enough oil supply
with prices between 22 and 28 dollars a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Beaten in Olympic Long Jump Thriller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- American sprinter queen Marion
Jones, vowing to win an unprecedented five gold medals in Sydney,
was stopped on her way to grab her third gold medal when she was
beaten to third place in the women's long jump finals at the
Millennium Olympic Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jones only managed for a bronze medal in the field event as she
only jumped to a distance of 6.92 wherein German Heike Drechsler
jumped away with the gold medal in a distance of 6.99 meters.
</P>
<P>
Already double winner in the 100m and 200m earlier in the week,
Jones will compete in the last two relays of the 4x100m and 4x400m
races at the Olympic.
</P>
<P>
For two years, Jones, an Olympic debutant after she refused to
be a replacement for the Barcelona Games in the U.S. relay team
and missed the Atlanta Games due to injury, has proclaimed that
she has intended to win five gold medals from the 100m, 200m, long
jump and two relays events.
</P>
<P>
After the defeat, Jones admitted for the first time that she
had already known that her husband C.J. Hunter had failed a drugs
test in July.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to keep a secret," she said, "Some of you guys were
trying to find out a secret."
</P>
<P>
Hunter, the shot put world champion, tested positive in July
for the banned steroid nandrolone. He failed in four drugs tests,
including one that was 1000 times over the limit.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Hunter remained to be a member of the U.S. Olympic
delegation, only to be denied official credentials at the Olympic
Games where he can only sit in the spectator seats by buying his
own tickets.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Become World-class Metropolis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua)-- Beijing will be built into an
international metropolis in the 21st century, said Liu Qi, mayor
of Beijing, in a speech today.
</P>
<P>
Making the remark at the Sixth Major Cities' Summit Beijing
2000, Liu said Beijing has been trying to enhance its
international presence by cooperating with cities all over the
world in recent years.
</P>
<P>
So far, Beijing has established sister city relationships with
27 cities and more bilateral cooperation contacts with others.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will open more widely to the world after China's
accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO), said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the Central Business District (CBD), the
Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park, known as the "Silicon
Valley" in China, along with other projects will help the city
meet the increasing demand of communicating with the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Having a history of some 3,000 years, Beijing will also work
hard to protect its cultural heritage in the light of economic
globalization, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
China is planning to help several cities become world-class
metropolises in about 20 years, according to a recent official
report.
</P>
<P>
Judging from factors such as economic strength, infrastructure
construction, and the degree of internationalization, Shanghai and
Beijing are considered to have more potential than other cities to
become the future world-class cities.

<HEADLINE> China Confers Friendship Award on Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
conferred the annual "Friendship Award" on 41 foreign experts
today, acknowledging their outstanding contributions to China's
economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, along with several other senior
leaders, presented the honor to the foreign experts from 22
countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian said at the awarding ceremony that China's tremendous
achievements over the past two decades could not have been
attained without the sincere cooperation, active participation and
enthusiastic assistance of foreign experts. The Chinese government
and people will never forget their help, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that opening to the outside is a long-term policy of
China and the introduction of overseas brainpower is an important
part of China's opening up.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for China to invite foreign experts to work in
China in the course of development while sending Chinese
professionals abroad for study and training, so as to promote
exchanges with the rest of the world and learn from their advanced
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Along with China's expected entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and the implementation of the strategy for
developing its western regions, China's exchanges and cooperation
with other countries in the fields of economy and trade, science
and technology, education, culture and talent will increase, thus
providing more opportunities for foreign experts, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome more foreign experts, overseas Chinese experts and
international friends to take part in China's modernization drive
and opening-up and reform drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 80,000 foreign experts have come to work in China
annually over the past several years, playing an important role in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
Sisanan Senyanouvong, a Lao expert at the China Radio
International, and Philip Murtaugh, a leading executive of the
Shanghai GM Corporation, also spoke on the occasion, expressing
their willingness to promote friendship with China.

NANJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Folk artisans from across the
country gathered in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province and
exhibited their works to local visitors.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition on China's arts and crafts is a major event at
the Sixth China Art Festival which opened last night. About 200
folk artisans from 16 provinces and regions are displaying over 1,
000 folk craft works.
</P>
<P>
Some of the craftsmen are highly respected such as Jiang Rong,
83, who is good at making clay teapots. There is a story that a
plate of clay fruit she once made was so vivid that it attracted
mice which left teeth marks on the plate.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guohuan, the festival organizer, said he believed that the
exhibition makes the art festival more complete.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Aircraft Takes off for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A Yemeni aircraft took off for
Baghdad, Iraq Friday, a Yemeni official said.
</P>
<P>
The flight, Approved by the U.N. Sanction Committee, is believed
as another challenge to the U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It came just few days after French and Russian and Jordanian
airlines made similar fights to the Iraqi capital in defiance of
the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the plane will overfly Jordan and Saudi Arabia
before it lands at the Baghdad International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Saudis insisted that the plane could cross Saudi territory
on condition that it first flies to Amman, Jordan, and not directly
to Iraq. The Jordanians had agreed to allow the plane to overfly
their territory and continue to Iraq, thus the flight became
possible.
</P>
<P>
The plane was initially scheduled to leave Sanaa airport early
Friday, but was delayed owing to the negotiations with Saudi and
Jordanian leaders on the flying route.
</P>
<P>
The plane is carrying Deputy Prime Minister Abdul-Kader
Bajammal, other Yemeni officials, medicine and relief aid, the
Yemeni official said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Hopes Shooting Incident Not to Affect Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Friday that he hopes the shooting
incident near the West Bank town of Kalkilya will not affect the
ongoing peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were shot by one of their Palestinian
colleagues in a joint patrol team in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Friday morning, and one of the wounded later died in the hospital.
He was the second Israeli soldier died in the Israeli-Palestinian
clashes in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, who also holds the acting Foreign Ministry portfolio
and head the Israeli negotiation team with the Palestinians, said
that he believed the bloody attack was an isolated case, and it did
not signal the changing of Palestinian policy toward Israelis and
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged the Palestinian National Authority to condemn
the incident and punish those responsible, adding that the law and
order are unseparated parts of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Border Police Commander Yitzhak Dadon, who arrived at
the scene, said that the incident is a very grave occurrence, "It
cannot be that the incident occurred in Kalkilya, a town in which
cooperation with the Palestinians on security issues is extremely
high."
</P>
<P>
He added that he expects the IDF to suspend joint Israeli-
Palestinian patrols, at least temporarily. Kalkilya, which is under
Palestinian full control (Area A), has been closed to Israelis and
a large number of Israeli troops are currently being brought to the
area.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security source said that they had arrested the
suspect. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala)
also condemned the attack at such a critical time of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami and his colleague negotiator Gilad Sher just returned
from the United States on Friday morning, after laborious peace
talks with their Palestinian counterparts and U.S. mediation team
there. There were some reported progress, but gaps still divide
between the two sides for them to reach a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, an Israeli soldier died of wounds he sustained in a
roadside bomb attack Wednesday night in the Gaza Strip, the first
of such deadly cases in more than one year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday condemned the
roadside bomb attack in Gaza. "The event was very serious," said
Barak. "We will know how to find the assailants, wherever they
are."
</P>
<P>
However, another bomb attack occurred Thursday evening in the
same area in Gaza, but nobody was hurt this time.
</P>
<P>
Likud legislator Limor Livnat, a leading hawkish figure, urged
Barak to suspend the talks with the Palestinians immediately
following the two deadly attacks.
</P>
<P>
She also accused Arafat of "not abandoning terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Closes Firmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso ended
firmer against the U.S. dollar Friday due to stronger regional
currencies and less dollar demand.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed at 46.15 against the greenback, stronger than
the previous close of 46.27.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the peso strength should be attributed to stronger
regional currencies and the lack of corporate dollar demand.
</P>
<P>
"Other regional currencies also recovered against the dollar.
And it has been confirmed that there was not much corporate demand
(for dollars) today," a dealer at a local bank said.
</P>
<P>
The value of trade turnover reached 74 million dollars

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian Prime
Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and his cabinet colleague Buta Singh
were pronounced guilty in a political scandal case by a designated
court here on Friday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Rao became the first former prime minister to get convicted in
a criminal case, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Rao and Singh were accused of bribing members of parliament
belonging to several different parties in 1993 to buy their votes
to save the minority Congress government against a no-confidence
motion, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Pronouncing the judgment on the "politically explosive" case,
Special Judge Ajit Bharihoke found Rao and Singh guilty of
conspiracy under various provisions of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, the PTI said.

<P>
Newcastle striker Kevin Gallacher, Celtic midfielder Paul
Lambert and Craig Burley of Derby rejoined the team after injuries.
Also returning are St. Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Main and
Manchester City defender Paul Ritchie.

<HEADLINE> FIFA: Ticket Sales for 2002 World Cup Postponed beyond Oct. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ticket sales for the 2002
World Cup have been postponed from the planned October 2, starting
date to refine procedures for the complex process, FIFA said in
Zurich on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The revised starting date has yet to be determined, but there
is plenty of time since the longest period devoted previously to
World Cup ticket sales was 14 months, said a statement from world
soccer's governing body.
</P>
<P>
It noted that there are still 20 months until the beginning of
play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The statement said:"It was felt that a postponement to further
hone the sales and distribution structures of the most complex
ticket sale in the history of the FIFA World Cup was acceptable
since fans will still be able to order their tickets and make
travel plans far in advance of the event."
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales are to be launched simultaneously for the
international market and for fans in the host countries South
Korea and Japan, FIFA said.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the aim is to create as system that
all groups, especially the general public, "feel that the
allocation and distribution process is fair and equitable."

<HEADLINE> World Record Holder Beaten by Kenyan Ngeny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Hicham El
Guerrouj of Morocco was beaten for the Olympic gold by world
number two Noah Ngeny of Kenya in the men's 1,500 meters at the
Olympic Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ngeny's winning time was an Olympic record of 3:32.07.
</P>
<P>
The result was a major upset for El Guerrouj who went into the
1996 Olympic final as the favorite but fell with one lap remaining,
having his Olympic dream dashed. The world record holder had not
lost a race since the IAAF Grand Prix final in 1997 and was
expected to claim his Olympic gold medal in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But in the past months, he has been troubled by a leg injury
and after the race, grabbed his upper thigh and some ice and left
the track in tears.
</P>
<P>
The early stages of the race saw Morocco's Youssef Baba acting
as the rabbit, going through the first lap in a fast 54.14, with
El Guerrouj perfectly set in second. But the second lap of 60.6
allowed the field to bunch up and possibly led to El Guerrouj's
undoing.
</P>
<P>
He took over the lead with 600m remaining and Ngeny and Bernard
Lagat of Kenya just sat neatly in behind him.
</P>
<P>
El Guerrouj accelerated in the final 200m in an attempt to open
up a gap behind him, but Ngeny was comfortably able to match his
speed and sat right behind him.
</P>
<P>
Ngeny made his move around El Guerrouj with 80m remaining and
just edged past the world champion with 15 meters to go. A fast-
finishing Lagat was only 0.12 seconds behind El Guerrouj in third.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia defeated Argentina 3-
1 in the final to win the Olympic women's hockey title at the
Sydney Olympic Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The win made Australia the first team in Olympic history to
retain the gold.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, who trailed 2-0 at half-time, earned a consolation
goal through Vanina Oneto in the second-half.
</P>
<P>
The win was a fitting farewell for Australian coach Ric
Charlesworth, a former Australian men's captain, who ended his
seven-year tenure as coach after the match.
</P>
<P>
It also helped senior pro Rechelle Hawkes join swim legend Dawn
Fraser and Equestrian star Andrew Hoy as the only Australians to
win gold medals in the same event at three Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Hawkes, who read the players' oath at the Opening Ceremony two
weeks ago, was part of the team that won their first gold at Seoul
in 1988 and repeated the feat at Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to the Netherlands, who defeated Spain 2-
0.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Ngeny Beats World Record Holder for Men's 1,500m Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Noah Ngeny of Kenya outraced
world record holder Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in the final
meters to take the men's 1,500m Olympic gold medal at the Sydney
Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ngeny's winning time was an Olympic record of 3:32.07, while El
Guerrouj finished second, and another Kenyan Bernard Lagat took
the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very happy," said Ngeny, "For a Kenyan to make the
mile gold medal is very big. When I go back home, it will be
amazing."
</P>
<P>
Ngeny's coach Kim McDonald said that "we got into his mind that
we could beat him tonight if he was through 800m in 1:45. He has
matured so much over the past year."
</P>
<P>
"I discovered him and pretty much coached him from the
beginning. When he ran the world junior record for the 1,500m, we
knew he had promise to be fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
Lagat on winning his bronze medal, said that "this is great,
it's special for Kenya. We've been working for this moment and
I'm so proud of him (Ngeny) for winning. We all work together and
share this victory for Kenya."
</P>
<P>
On what happed to El Guerrouj, Lagat said that "we don't know.
We went into the race and it was not very fast to begin with. It
seemed to get slower and then at the end we picked up the pace and
maybe that was not good for him. He had a lot of pressure on him
coming into this. A lot of people expected him to win, which
gives someone a lot of pressure."
</P>
<P>
The result was surely a major upset for El Guerrouj who went
into the 1996 Olympic final as the favorite but fell with one lap
remaining,having his Olympic dream dashed. The world record
holder had not lost a race since the IAAF Grand Prix final in 1997
and was expected to claim his Olympic gold medal in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthrough in Transgenosis Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
cultivated seven rabbits with an animal mammary bio-reactor,
ranking China among the world's most advanced countries in this
field.
</P>
<P>
Among the 140 rabbits cultivated by Shenzhen Lvpeng
Agrotechnical Ltd. Company and China Agricultural University,
seven contained the human gene auxin, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The company applied the world's most advanced technology of
embryo freezing and external fertilization in the cultivation,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Starting the animal mammary bio-reactor research in 1997, the
Lvpeng Company has established China's largest transgenosis
breeding center in Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone
in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Honored as "the pearl on the crown" in biology, the technology
of the animal mammary bio-reactor integrates some human genes with
animal's embryo, which is then transplanted into its matrix, thus
producing transgenosis animals.
</P>
<P>
By this means, experts said, people can obtain some valuable
protein and rare medicine from the milk of the transgenosis
animals. Due to the low cost and high quality of products, the
technology is believed to have a great commercial value.

<HEADLINE> Major Cities Vow to Cooperate More in Cyber Age (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Heads of the world's 25 major
cities promised today to strengthen cooperation in an information-
prone age with accelerating economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five member cities that have participated in the Sixth
Major Cities' Summit Beijing 2000, held in Beijing from September
28-29, signed the Beijing Declaration as a result of the two-day
discussion on cities' development and cooperation in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration claims that the 20th century is a century in
which urban civilization is highly developed in human history.
Century-long industrialization has accelerated the pace of human
civilization as well as pushed forward urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly more people live in compact communities in cities,
which as an epitome of modern civilization has contributed
significantly to the prosperity and development of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the Declaration notes that a host of vital issues such
as resources shortage, environmental degradation, population
explosion, and ever-growing development gaps in cities have
presented tremendous challenges to urban development.
</P>
<P>
Mankind is once again at a critical historical juncture, and
cities are about to make another serious choice at the threshold
of the new century.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration says that the 21st century will be the "century
of cities". For the first time in human history, most men, women
and children will be living in cities. Accelerated economic
globalization, the increasingly internationalized functions of
cities and the growing interdependence among cities make it
essential to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in more areas
and at higher levels under the principles of prosperity and
equality.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration says that the rapid development of information
technology and the knowledge economy is bringing profound changes
to the lifestyle of city dwellers and exerting an extensive impact
on urban development. Communication among cities and among

<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasury bonds
witnessed narrow fluctuations, while the repurchasing market
slumped sharply this week on the eve of a nine-day trade
suspension for the National Day holiday, which will start tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 plummeted by 0.71 yuan further to 35.28 yuan
compared with the close price on last Friday, buoying the yield up
0.09 percentage points. Now that the yield of the bond has come to
as high as 3.97 percent and its converting ration to the standard
bond has risen to one to 1.32, the room for a further slip is
limited. The bond is expected to recoup the losses when the trade
resumed after the holiday, according to Homeway, China's leading
on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
A Homeway market analyst said that 000696 and 009704 are very
likely to reap big gains in October, underpinned by their high
yields and converting ratios in the repurchasing transactions.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Stock Exchange Thursday released the ratio series
of current bonds to the standard bond for repurchasing
transactions in the fourth quarter of this year. The new ratio
series will go into effect on October 1, 2000.

BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Composite Index
rose 18.18 points to 1910.16 points from last week's 1891.98
points.
</P>
<P>
This week's turnover was 23.55 billion yuan, 29.62 percent less
than last week's 33.46 billion yuan, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The index rallied as long position investors and short position
investors had a struggle. After the index touched the low level of
1874.21 points on Monday, it edged up and ended above 1900 points
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the short position's view, the index was led down by both
profit-taking and release selling, and investors wanted to leave
the market before the National Day and the establishment of the
second board.
</P>
<P>
On the long position's view, the index had corrected for more

market needed to rebound. September 29 is the balance day of the
mutual funds in the fourth quarter, so fund managers wanted to do
some window dressing.

<HEADLINE> China Protests U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese side urges the U.
S. to earnestly follow the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and
the relevant commitments, and abandon the planned arms sales to
Taiwan, said Sun Xuxi, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the U.S. side should bear the serious consequences
arising therefrom," he added.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the U.S. defense department informed
the congress that it will sell Taiwan 1.3-billion-dollar weapons,
which include supersonic medium-ranged space-to-space missiles.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Sun said that the U.S., regardless of
China's solemn representation, will flagrantly sell a large number
of advanced weapons to Taiwan, adding that the Chinese Foreign
Ministry has lodged a strong protest to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Sun emphasized that the actions of the U.S. have seriously
violated the principles of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques,
especially that of the "August 17" Joint Communique, infringing
China's sovereignty and interfering in China's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents Urged to Do More in Sex Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua)-- The results from a recent
survey conducted in Shanghai show that parents need to play a more
active role in their youngsters' sex education.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the questioned 700 parents did not do very
well when it came to talking to their children about sex and 89.1
percent took a "let-it-be" attitude concerning the issue.
</P>
<P>
Only 9.5 percent of the sampled 800 middle school students
admit that their knowledge about sex came from their parents,
according to Thursday's Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by Shanghai educators, covered Yangpu,
Hongkou, Xuhui and Jinshan Districts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Most parents don't know whether they should answer the
questions or how to answer the questions when they were asked
about sex by their children.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that the child's test scores are the main
priority of most parents, while only 35.5 percent of the
respondents concentrate on their children's physical and
psychological health.
</P>
<P>
Sex is traditionally a taboo subject in Chinese culture. People
usually blush when someone raises the subject. Open discussion
about sex with children is usually unthinkable to most Chinese
parents.
</P>
<P>
Dai Yaohong, researcher from Shanghai's Yangpu District, said
that some parents worry that a free discussion about sex may lead
the children to become involved in improper or precocious sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parents' lack of relevant knowledge about sex is
also a major obstacle in communicating on the issue between the
two generations, according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
China is now improving its official curriculum for sex
education. However, with the penetration of mass media, which now
carries considerable amount of information on sex, it is critical
for family members to provide necessary guidance to help
youngsters go through the period of puberty smoothly, said the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> One Million Flood Victims Resettle in Safe Areas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He believes that the migration program is the most important
measure for solving this major problem. The program will
fundamentally coordinate relations between human beings and nature
and enable sound development of the ecological environment and
sustainable development of the Yangtze River basin.
</P>
<P>
The program of strategic importance has witnessed achievements.
The submerging of 337 bottomland areas where people lived, a part
of the program, had greatly lowered the river's floodwater level
of the 1999 flood, similar to the ferocious flood of 1998, and
greatly reduced the flood prevention expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated that the direct economic losses of 1999
Yangtze River flood only accounted for around one-fourth of the
catastrophic flood in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the safety of China's largest river -- Yangtze,
China will put in 4.2 billion yuan (506 million dollars) to
reinforce major parts of the river dikes within three years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also decided to offer 210 million dollars to
help build a digital model system of the Yangtze River for flood
prevention.
</P>
<P>
With all of the efforts, China is expected to complete the
building of an overall and sound Yangtze River flood prevention
system by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The flood victims all welcomed the migration program which
could possibly present them with more ways to make money where
they now live.
</P>
<P>
Xu Songshun, a 39-year-old farmer who had lived on a river
islet near Wuhan of central China's Hubei Province for 10 years,
was among the first group of local farmers to apply for migration.
He moved to a newly built migration village five kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
Xu rebuilt his house four times during his 10 years of living
on the river islet because it was swept away by floods four times.
</P>
<P>
At that time, his home had two shabby cabinets, a bicycle by
the bed, cooking utensils and a cloth wrapper for taking "property
" away when fleeing from floods.
</P>
<P>
Similar to many other migrants, Xu grows crops in his
contracted farmland at the river islet before the farmland gives
way to floodwaters. He also opened a building material shop near
his new house.
</P>
<P>
Migrants can raise fish after the reclaimed land becomes lakes
or engage in other industries.
</P>
<P>
Xu, together with his wife and two sons, is living in a 200-
square-meter two-story house, which is equipped with cable
television, telephone and a tapped water pipe.
</P>
<P>
"We are now living a stable and promising new life," he said.

<HEADLINE> One Million Flood Victims Resettle in Safe Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 1 million flood
victims in the "bottomlands" along the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze River have resettled in safe areas and away from
disastrous floods, according latest stactistics in a document
released by the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Li Antian, head of Yangtze River Water Resources Committee,
said, "It is the world's largest disaster-victim migration program,
as well as the world's largest program for improving subsistence
conditions and ecological environment."
</P>
<P>
He said the migrants are mainly from the provinces of Hubei,
Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui which are located at middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the provinces have drafted plans to
move an additional 2 million people residing in the bottomlands
along the river to nearby highlands over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River floods had constantly threatened the life and
property of people in those four provinces, especially those whose
houses were built on small river islets.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has allocated a total of 5.7 billion
yuan ( 686 million U.S.dollars) to the building of new houses for
the migrants in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government has also cleared the river
islets residing places and turned lake-reclaimed farmlands into
lakes again, in a bid to let the floods pass smoothly.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the program, over 10 billion cubic
meters of floodwater storage capacity is expected to be added to
the Yangtze River, which will help greatly ease the flooding of
the river.
</P>
<P>
Wen Fubo, academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering
and expert in flood prevention, pointed out that the major cause
of the Yangtze floods is due to local farmers recklessly
reclaiming land from lakes and the occupation of flood sluicing
routes.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Likud leader Ariel Sharon vowed Thursday to use "every
democratic means" to resist attempts to divide Jerusalem, in
response to Prime Minister Ehud Barak's suggestion in an interview
with The Jerusalem Post that a peace agreement may allow for
separate side-by-side entities called Jerusalem and Al-Quds.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major historical mistake. It is the first time that a
Jewish leader agreed to divide Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish
people for the last 3,000 years," Sharon said after his visit to
the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem does not belong to us, but to the entire Jewish
people. The fact that one man decided to divide Jerusalem is very
wrong and we will try to stop this in every democratic way."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Clashes that broke out on the Temple Mount and in the West
Bank Thursday following a visit by Likud Party Chair Ariel Sharon
left around 30 police officers and ten Palestinians injured.
</P>
<P>
one thousand Palestinians, lead by lawmakers from the Israeli
Arab factions, threw stones at the police officers who formed a
dense wall around the opposition leader to protect him from
protesters.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said after the visit he had successfully demonstrated
that Israel is in charge of the compound that is revered by Muslims
and Jews alike.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians officials however claimed that the tour backfired
on Sharon because it just underscored how little actual control
Israel has over the area.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A day after a Gaza Strip explosion killed IDF soldier David
Biri, another bomb went off Thursday evening just north of Nahal Oz
roadblock. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's bomb was set some 30 meters from the road, inside
Palestinian territory, and exploded near IDF jeeps patrolling the
area. The IDF believes the two incidents, only a few kilometers
apart, were linked and probably carried out by the same group.
</P>
<P>
The army suspects the perpetrators to be members of some
Palestinian Authority security apparatus. The defense establishment
is concerned that violence in the Gaza Strip could escalate,
especially around Netzarim.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu returned from New
York late Thursday afternoon, faced with increased activity in the
Likud to hold the party's election for chairman as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Avoiding reporters at Ben-Gurion Airport, Netanyahu later spoke
outside his father's home in Jerusalem, but sidestepped the issue
of whether he intends to challenge Ariel Sharon for the Likud
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The way for Netanyahu to return into politics was considered to
have been cleared by Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein's decision
on Wednesday not to indict him or his wife Sara for lack of
evidence, following a probe into allegations of bribe-taking, grand
larceny and fraud.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Community Supports Military Option in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The international community
continues to positively react to the decision of President Joseph
Estrada to launch a military assault to end the five-month-long
hostage crisis in Sulu, the southern Philippines, a senior
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing The Washington Post as an example, Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon said the American newspaper had written an
editorial fully supporting Estrada's decision.
</P>
<P>
"I supported the decision of President Estrada to undertake
rescue operations after being patient for four months,
particularly with the continuing kidnapping of new victims and the
alleged oversupply of money in the area to purchase new arms,"
Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
He said this expression of support reflects the general
reaction of the diplomatic community to Estrada's resolve to end
the atrocities committed by the Abu Sayyaf, as "each government
has a right to make its own decision" in addressing similar
situations.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also noted that the Philippines has already fulfilled
its commitment to the European Union (EU) to resolve the crisis
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Before the Philippine government made its decision to attack
the Abu Sayyaf, Siazon said, the EU was concerned about the safety
of all European hostages kidnapped from Sipadan island in Malaysia
on April 23 and later taken to Jolo.
</P>
<P>
"All foreign hostages taken from Sipadan have been released.
What remains are the new people kidnapped. The commitment to EU is
fully implemented in that sense," he said
</P>
<P>
On September 16, President Estrada gave the military the green
light to conduct rescue and offensive operations to recover the
hostages still held by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
On September 20, two French journalists kept hostage by the Abu
Sayyaf managed to escape from their captors as a result of the
military offensive.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said French President Jacques Chirac expressed his
nation's gratitude to the Philippine government for the release of
all the French nationals from the hands of the Abu Sayyaf in a
letter to President Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"There was a letter from President Chirac to President Estrada,
thanking him for the peaceful efforts to help free hostages,"
Siazon said.

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: Philippine Leader Grants Amnesty to MILF Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced Friday the grant of amnesty to members and
supporters of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), in line
with his commitment to peace, reconciliation and the economic
development of the warn-torn Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the president said the grant
of amnesty shall cover all MILF members and supporters, including
those who have committed criminal offenses on or before September
29, the date on which the directive was signed.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said, this directive does not benefit
those who have been involved in the crimes of kidnapping for
ransom, massacre or torture of civilian non-combatants, rape,
crimes against chastity and other crimes for personal ends.
</P>
<P>
The proclamation entitled Proclamation 390, he said, shall take
effect upon concurrence by a majority of the members of the
Philippine Congress.
</P>
<P>
MILF members and supporters covered by the amnesty grant will
be cleared of their criminal liabilities and would get back their
civil and political rights lost or suspended by virtue of their
criminal conviction, the proclamation stated.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the president has declared such an
amnesty since government troops clashed severely with the MILF in
the western Mindanao area in mid-March this year.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the president declared a June 30 deadline
for the peace talks between the government and the MILF after a
massive armed conflict between government troops and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
On July 9, Estrada declared that the military overran the MILF'
s headquarters Camp Abubakar in Maguindanao Province. Later in
July, MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat declared a holy war against
government agencies and personnel.
</P>
<P>
In the following months, not only the peace talks between the
two sides were stalled, bombings and kidnappings also occurred one
after another, highlighted by the Abu Sayyaf's abduction of 21
Sipadan hostages from Malaysia in late April.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the Sipadan hostages have been released with
the mediation of Libya, the hostage crisis is not over as there
are still 17 hostages including one American and three Malaysians
in the abductors' hand.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, twin bombings took place in the southern
province of Cotabato, killing six and injuring more than a dozen.
</P>
<P>
So, Estrada's granting of amnesty to MILF members is deemed
here as a good decision to seek reconciliation with the Muslim
rebels and to secure precious peace for the war-stricken Mindanao
area.
</P>
<P>
"The judicious grant of amnesty, as an instrument of
reconciliation, to members and supporters of the MILF will
facilitate their return to a peaceful, democratic and pluralistic
society so essential to the attainment of peace and prosperity,"
Estrada said in the amnesty proclamation.
</P>
<P>
In issuing the proclamation, the president also cited the need
to put an end to the "unrest in Mindanao brought about mainly by
the armed conflict with the MILF" which, he noted, "has
considerably slowed down national progress and development."
</P>
<P>
"A climate of peace in Mindanao is most necessary for the
economic well-being of that area," the president added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Ricardo Puno said the
president's amnesty grant is being fully supported by officials of
the Department of National Defense, the Armed Forces of the
Philippines and the Department of Interior and Local Government,
as well as by members of the congress.
</P>
<P>
However, the MILF's response to Estrada's amnesty declaration
is not available at this time.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Aegean Ferry Accident Climbs to 69 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Three more bodies were
recovered Friday morning, bringing the death toll from the ferry
accident off Greece's Aegean island of Paros to 69, with some
people still missing, the Athens news agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the three victims of the "Express Samina"
disaster were recovered near the shipwreck, it said.
</P>
<P>
The 110-meter-long ferry carrying 463 passengers and 61 crew
members sank on Tuesday night after its right side hit a rock near
Paros.
</P>
<P>
The captain of the ill-fated ship admitted Friday that he was
asleep in his cabin when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
Greece has promised to bring those responsible for the sea
disaster to justice.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old ferry belongs to Greece's Minoan shipping
company and was due to be withdrawn from service later in December.
</P>
<P>
Another ferry belonging to the same company also ran aground
off the eastern Aegean island of Naxos in gale late Thursday, the
semi-official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, "Express Artemis," was on a route encompassing
Santorini, Anafi and some other islands with 1,086 passengers and
crew members on board, and all of them were reportedly safe.
</P>
<P>
It is the second ferry accident in the Aegean Sea within three
days.

<HEADLINE> France Plays Down Denmark's Rejection of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- France on Friday played down
Denmark's rejection of euro and reaffirmed its confidence in the
European single currency, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry Laurent Fabius
told a meeting of finance ministers from the 11 euro zone
countries in Brussels that the "no" expressed by the Danes in
Thursday's referendum on euro would not have any impact on euro.
</P>
<P>
"The euro zone has 300 million inhabitants while the Danes only
represent 4 million people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the people in the euro zone still have confidence in
the single currency which he said was a success.
</P>
<P>
Fabius's comment was echoed by his German counterpart Hans
Eichel, who said that the gross domestic product of Denmark
accounts for just 2.7 percent of the total of the euro zone
countries.
</P>
<P>
A majority of Danish voters rejected the euro in the referendum.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones' Dream Shattered in Long Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Marion Jones was stopped on
her way to grab her third gold medal when she was beaten to third
place in the women's long jump finals at the Olympic Games here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who aimed for an unprecedented five gold medals from the
Games, only managed for a bronze medal in the field competitions,
where German Heike Drechsler ran away with the gold medal in a
distance of 6.99 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic debutant Jones, who won the 100m and 200m earlier
after her husband C. J. Hunter was banned for drugs, only managed
her best jump of 6.92 meters in her second attempt.
</P>
<P>
The American track star, who opted to skip the Barcelona Games
as a substitute for the relay team and missed the Atlanta Games
due to injury, has proclaimed in the past two years that she has
intended to win five gold medals from the 100m, 200m, long jump
and two relays events.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the long jump eventually proved to be her weakest where
she can only settle for a bronze medal behind 1992 Olympic
champion Drechsler and 1996 silver medalist Fiona May of Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Noah Ngeny snapped
Hicham El Guerrouj's three-year winning streak in the men's 1,500
meters Friday, beating the Moroccan in the stretch to win an
Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
Ngeny won in 3 minutes, 32.07 seconds. El Guerrouj, the world
record holder and world champion, won the silver and Bernard Lagat
of Kenya took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
It was another stunning end to El Guerrouj's quest for an
Olympic title after he fell in Atlanta four years ago in a tangle
with Noureddine Morceli, who went on to win the gold. El Guerrouj
finished last and hid under the stadium weeping.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones's hopes of winning a historic five gold medals at
a single Games were dashed as she lost the women's long jump final
to German veteran Heike Drechsler, who jumped 6.99 meters for the
gold.
</P>
<P>
Against a field of expert jumpers, Jones' lack of technique was
always evident. She and Fiona May both finished at 6.92, but the
Italian had a better second-best jump.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old American won the sprint double and hopes to
compete in the finals of the 4x100 and 4x400 relays on Saturday,
events that the United States are favored to win.
</P>
<P>
Poland's Robert Korzeniowski walked his way into the history
books Friday morning, when he became the first man in Olympic
history to win the 20km and 50km race walk double.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old sports teacher won the 20km walk here last week.
</P>
<P>
Russia won synchronized swimming's team competition to add to
the Olympic gold it won in the duet.
</P>
<P>
The Russians scored 99.146 out of a possible 100 points. They
earned two perfect 10s for technical marks, and two 10s for
artistic impression with a variety of pattern changes, lifts and
throws.
</P>
<P>
Japan took silver with 98.860. Canada was third at 97.357.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ben Ainslie won the Open Laser single handed dinghy
class after the jury threw out a protest from second-placed Robert
Scheidt of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Scheidt filed two protests against Ainslie after the pair
collided in the final race of the series and the Briton responded
in kind.
</P>
<P>
The jury decided that Scheidt's first protest had been
submitted too late, while his second was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Ainslie's protest was upheld and the Brazilian was disqualified
from the final race but he still took the silver medal.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Developing, Developed Countries Should Be Narrowed in Knowledge Economy Era: Summit Deputies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) --Developing countries herald
with mixed feelings the arrival of the knowledge economy era which
is described by many as one of the most important periods in the
history of the planet.
</P>
<P>
Their deputies attending the Sixth Major Cities Summit Beijing
2000 that ended today expressed concern that the distance between
the poor and rich nations will increase in the next century.
Before this, only one such meeting was held in a developing
country.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mufit Gurtuna, mayor of Greater Metropolitan Municipality
of Istanbul, Turkey, said countries that invest more in the
knowledge economy have been benefited from globalization, which
has caused an uneven distribution of income internationally.
</P>
<P>
A seasoned urban planning advisor from Montreal, in
economically developed Canada, also believed that the poor
foundation in developing countries has made them lack the high
technology and qualified personnel necessary for developing the
knowledge economy, which will start a new round of polarization in
wealth between the poor and rich nations.
</P>
<P>
Many of the summit deputies believe cities will become the
biggest victim in this process. Urbanization has become the main
symbol of global modernization. More than 1 billion of the
additional urban population in the future will occur in developing
countries, but most of these countries have to struggle with
absolute poverty, with no investment to develop itself.
</P>
<P>
At present, 1.5 billion of the world's urban population have
been living in absolute poverty, most of whom are residents from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
A prime part of the world's wealth is circulating among big
cities of developed countries such as New York and Tokyo, which
have turned into major battlefields for multinationals, especially
high-tech giants making frantic procurements.

<P>
However, the city of Berlin has decided to tackle the problem
with another strategy." We have decided to cease the use of
nuclear power. Instead, we will use safer energy, like solar
energy and wind," said the mayor, Klaus Boger.
</P>
<P>
Bio-technology has also brought new problems, according to some
mayors. Some American and European cities have started to adopt
measures to prevent the negative effects of genetically modified
food on human health, but are still pondering about the ethical
problems caused by the cloning technology.
</P>
<P>
Participants also proposed that the wider use of the Internet
has created more weak points in city management. The financial and
business networks are fragile to hackers.
</P>
<P>
Shanti Desai, mayor of Delhi, India, said that his city has
witnessed a greater use of technology in industry and agriculture
in recent years, but the waste and sewage it yields has
contaminated the township environment, rivers and the sea. He
called for increased assistance from concerned international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Bourque, mayor of Montreal, Canada, responded that human
being can live in harmony with nature, but people's sense of duty
is crucially needed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Montreal has set up nine high-tech biological
centers to make classified treatments of dangerous waste. It also
signed a treaty on the protection of the ozone-layer.
</P>
<P>
"Technology should be developed according to our needs. The
future of high-tech safety lies in the cooperation of all
politicians, scientists, engineers, artists and all ordinary men
and women," said Desai.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's GDP Growth Surpasses National Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region has maintained sustained, rapid and healthy
economic development in recent years as a result of the speeding
up of infrastructure construction, deepening reform and opening
wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the recent six years show that the region's
annual gross domestic product (GDP) has increased by an average
rate of 12.9 percent, higher than that of the national average.
Tibet's revenue has increased 2.2 times year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Local government sources say that Tibet can now produce enough
grain for local residents, and at present, 80 percent of the
region's poverty-stricken population is well-fed.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, Tibet's fixed assets investment was 22
billion yuan and the figure for last year stood at 5.66 billion
yuan. The completion of an airport, highway, power station and
telecommunications projects have greatly improved the local
investment environment and promoted local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has six listed companies, and three more are expected
to go on the stock market soon, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The number of projects funded by foreign investors, aided by
international organizations or loaned by foreign governments is
178, with 240 million U.S. dollars of foreign investment already
used.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, more than 50,000
overseas tourists visited Tibet, more than two times that of the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, other provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities of China have all supported Tibet's development by
providing funds, materials, talent and technology. With their
assistance, 2,042 projects have been completed in Tibet in the
past five years.

<HEADLINE> Qinling Grows Taller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have
confirmed that Qinling, the highest mountain in the eastern part
of the Chinese mainland, rises at an annual rate of six
millimeters.
</P>
<P>
The new findings were based on recent explorations of the area.
</P>
<P>
The mountain range grew 10 km in height over the past 100
million years, Zhang Guowei, an academician of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Qinling Mountain range holds an important position in the
formation and evolution of the Chinese mainland. It is not only
the natural dividing line between north and south China, but also
a region exerting a profound influence on the environmental
changes and disasters that occurred in China.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of Qinling was divided into three phases. Its
growth rate in the latest 100 million years surpassed the growth
rate of the Himalayas on the southern rim of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, said Zhang, who is also a professor at the Northwest
China University.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the main cause of Qinling's growth, Zhang said that
the mountain range is still experiencing violent tectonic
movements. The two plates beneath Qinling squeeze together and
bulge in an unparalleled fan-shape.
</P>
<P>
The ascendance of Qinling is of great significance to the
difference in the climate of north and south China. It also lays a
theoretical basis for improving the ecological environment and
speeding up energy and geological prospecting in the area, Zhang
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The increasing use of high-
technology is posting a threat to concentrated human settlements.
Mayors of the world's major cities exchanged their ideas on the
matter at the Sixth World Major Cities Summit Beijing 2000 today.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech safety problem is getting high on the agenda of
the city officials.
</P>
<P>
Oleksandr Omelchenko, mayor of Kyiv, Ukraine, said that the
imperfection of technology can produce horrible disasters like the
nuclear accident in Chelnobyl. Major countries can join their
efforts on precaution measures.
</P>
<P>
The city is still suffering from the aftermath of the accident,
which happened at a site 800 km away from Kyiv. Over thousands of
people died from diseases related to radioactive fallout caused by
the nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
The mayor warned that negative effects from such disasters can
sweep across the border. He extended his hope that similar
calamities will never happen again.
</P>
<P>
Bill Joy, an American software genius, proposes that the
accelerated technological revolution in modern society may turn
off mass-killing disasters, which can cause a snap in human
existence between generations.
</P>
<P>
As more cities turn to nuclear energy for fuel and heating,
people have become more aware of high-tech safety.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qi, mayor of Beijing, gave his opinion at the meeting that
mankind are the master of modern technology. People should not be
turned away by the fear of using new technology, but more
endeavors should be allotted to the research of perfecting it.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that Beijing is building a state-of-the-art
nuclear reactor. The apparatus has been equipped with the country'
s most advanced safety device. It would automatically shut down in
case of an accident.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Discuss Cooperation on Haze Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN environment
ministers are scheduled to meet in Malaysia next month to review
the progress of regional cooperation against transboundary haze
pollution, according to the Secretariat of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The ministers' meeting will be held in Kota Kinabalu of Sabah,
East Malaysia, on October 6 and 7, Bernama news agency reported,
quoting a statement faxed here from the ASEAN Secretariat in
Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN adopted a Regional Haze Action Plan at the height of the
haze pollution problem in late 1997, which contained measures to
mitigate the smoke haze arising from land and forest fires in some
Sumatra and Kalimantan provinces of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"It strengthened the land and forest fire-fighting capability
of the concerned countries and established a coordinating unit at
the regional level," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, ASEAN established a working group to monitor the
operations of sub-regional fire-fighting arrangements for Sumatra
and Borneo.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has also adopted a zero-burning policy, which is being
enforced by the member countries.
</P>
<P>
The haze action plan forms part of a broader ASEAN strategic
plan of action on the environment, which consists of cooperation
in coastal marine environment, multilateral environmental
agreements, and nature conservation and biodiversity besides
cooperation in dealing with transboundary haze issues.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministers are also expected to exchange
views and coordinate positions on various international agreements
such as a medium-term regional program for environmentally sound
and sustainable development for the Asia and Pacific region
adopted early this month in Kita-Kyushu City, Japan, under the
auspices of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Bartercard Hong Kong
Limited, the local arm of the world's largest barter trade
exchange, announced here Friday that its membership in Hong Kong
has grown to 300 from 220 business categories since its launch two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"To date, Bartercard has enabled local businesses to generate
23.6 million HK dollars (about 3.02 million U.S. dollars) worth of
extra sales, which means they have saved an equal amount in cash
expenses by using the system," said Denise Cajucom, managing
director of Bartercard Hong Kong Limited, at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The monthly transaction volume in Hong Kong was approximately 1,
000, involving a turnover of 2.1 million HK dollars (about 269,000
U.S. dollars), she said.
</P>
<P>
She said e-commerce in all its forms is already a key element
in global business life.
</P>
<P>
"Bartercard's strength is that we provide members with
opportunities to conserve cash and increase profits through barter
trading of goods and services with one another, without using cash,
" she noted.
</P>
<P>
She said the Bartercard Hong Kong website has been completely
revamped on the occasion of its second anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Two new features, namely Auction Online and For Sale &AMP; Wanted
sections, have been added to Bartercard International's site.
</P>
<P>
Auction Online is destined to become another important tool for
all Bartercard members. It forms an excellent forum to buy and
sell almost anything, including cars, movie tickets and holidays.
</P>
<P>
The For Sale &AMP; Wanted site is an online electronic classified
marketplace where members advertise goods for sale or post wanted
notes for hard-to-find items.
</P>
<P>
Bartercard's turnover has grown substantially from year to year
since its inception in 1991. Currently, it operates more than 50
offices in nine countries and employs more than 600 staff to
assist over 37,000 member businesses in more than 1,700 industry

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Developing, Developed Countries Should Be Narrowed in Knowledge Economy Era: Summit Deputies (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanti Desai, mayor of Delhi, India, said the gap between the
rich and poor in cities should paid attention to, especially in
developing countries. As one of the world's leading producers of
software, India has made reducing slums in its country as one of
the government's major tasks.
</P>
<P>
Desai urged rich members of the international community to help
the poor. With adequate outside aid, developing countries will be
able to make greater progress in economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mufit Gurtuna, mayor of Greater Metropolitan Municipality
of Istanbul, said the polarization of the wealth in the world has
gone to the extreme. The prosperity status proportion of rich and
poor nations was 11:1 in the early years of this century, but it
changed to 800:1 by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
He urged countries to use advanced technology and experiences
of developed countries to narrow the great gulf, because without
the inflow of capital, technology, productivity, progress of
intelligence, developing countries cannot succeed in today's world.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Liu Qi said that while relying on its own
strength to develop productivity, developing countries should also
make greater efforts to open wider and seek international
cooperation. Beijing has become a place where high-tech research
and development centers for multinationals are situated.
</P>
<P>
In November this year, more than 20 mayors from southwest China

<HEADLINE> Int'l Community Supportive Military Option in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The international community
continues to positively react to the decision of President Joseph
Estrada to launch a military assault to end the five-month-long
hostage crisis in Sulu, the southern Philippines, a senior
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing The Washington Post as an example, Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon said the American newspaper had written an
editorial fully supporting Estrada's decision.
</P>
<P>
"I supported the decision of President Estrada to undertake
rescue operations after being patient for four months,
particularly with the continuing kidnapping of new victims and the
alleged oversupply of money in the area to purchase new arms,"
Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
He said this expression of support reflects the general
reaction of the diplomatic community to Estrada's resolve to end
the atrocities committed by the Abu Sayyaf, as "each government
has a right to make its own decision" in addressing similar
situations.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also noted that the Philippines has already fulfilled
its commitment to the European Union (EU) to resolve the crisis
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Before the Philippine government made its decision to attack
the Abu Sayyaf, Siazon said, the EU was concerned about the safety
of all European hostages kidnapped from Sipadan island in Malaysia
on April 23 and later taken to Jolo.
</P>
<P>
"All foreign hostages taken from Sipadan have been released.
What remains are the new people kidnapped. The commitment to EU is
fully implemented in that sense," he said
</P>
<P>
On September 16, President Estrada gave the military the green
light to conduct rescue and offensive operations to recover the
hostages still held by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
On September 20, two French journalists kept hostage by the Abu
Sayyaf managed to escape from their captors as a result of the
military offensive.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said French President Jacques Chirac expressed his
nation's gratitude to the Philippine government for the release of
all the French nationals from the hands of the Abu Sayyaf in a
letter to President Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"There was a letter from President Chirac to President Estrada,
thanking him for the peaceful efforts to help free hostages,"
Siazon said.

<HEADLINE> (Specially for China-Africa Cooperation Forum) Roundup: Scraping Africa's Foreign Debt, Unkept Promise by West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Yu Dabo
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Heavy foreign
indebtedness remains a fatal impediment to economic growth of the
African countries as most of the promises by the West to write off
debts on the continent do not go beyond lip commitment.
</P>
<P>
Africa's total debt currently stands at 350 billion U.S.
dollars. At the end of 1998, its debt service payments amounted
to about 30 billion dollars or 25 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to the western industrialized countries, U.N.
Secretary-general Kofi Annan described the plight of African
nations saddled with foreign debts, saying that in Africa, the
world's poorest region, 40 percent of government revenues are now
being allocated to serving the debts to the detriment of health,
education and other essential social services.
</P>
<P>
This was echoed by the United Nations Children's Fund, which
said that "world debt and the policies applied with respect to it
cause the death of 500,000 children every year."
</P>
<P>
The region has to spend four times more on servicing debts than
on health and education combined, according to a Jubilee 2000 debt
relief campaign group.
</P>
<P>
So, the African countries need a serious debt relief to be able
to come back on their feet. Naturally, they have consistently
called on their Western creditors to remove their heavy debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
This issue has become a focus of attention since 1996 when
multinational financial institutions and other creditors first
agreed on the terms of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
Last year in Cologne, Germany, leaders of the Group 8 unveiled
a plan for up to 100 billion dollars in debt relief by the end of
2000 for about 40 of the poorest nations, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
They bragged of the debt-relief program, saying that it would
wipe out debt owed by these poor countries if they followed
reforms supervised by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton took the lead to announce that his
country would cancel 5.7 billion dollars debt owed by 36 poor
countries, 30 of them in Africa. Britain followed suit, saying it
would scrape about 7.5 billion dollars in debt owed by poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Western industrialized countries signed up to the
much-publicized HIPC initiative.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that these efforts would hopefully help Africa out of
the vicious cycle of debt and poverty. However, so much has been
said and too little done. One year has passed and it can be hardly
seen any substantial progress in debt relief.
</P>
<P>
So far only about 10 countries including Benin, Burkina Faso,
Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda and Tanzania are eligible
for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
It is a far cry from the ambitious target of 100 billion
dollars debt relief set by the western leaders at the summit last
year.
</P>
<P>
What's the reason? Budget rows with the U.S. Congress have
blocked the debt relief pledge by Clinton, while the European
Union has delayed releasing relief funds until it sees a specific
action from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Besides, international donors have made tough conditions on
debt relief, linking it to moves by African governments to cement
democracy, end wars, open domestic markets, fight corruption and
implement poverty reduction strategies.
</P>
<P>
These will affect the on-going economic reforms in the
recipient countries. Like what South African Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel has criticized that to require African countries to
implement poverty reduction strategies before they have the
resources to do so is to "put the cart before the horse".
</P>
<P>
In fact, Africans are not against any reasonable strings
attached to the debt cancellation, but these should be inspired by
the need to better the living conditions of the masses.
</P>
<P>
As the world is ushering in the 21st century, African leaders
voiced unanimously that the African continent needs a new
beginning not encumbered by debt or imperial self-interests. Any
person who shares the dream of African renaissance must
acknowledge the need to cancel these debts to facilitate African's
entry into the mainstream of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Debts must be canceled for Africa to "command a voice in world
affairs, for it to occupy a seat on the meridian table of
civilization and for it to stand tall in a progressive march into
the new millennium", they added.

SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion the United
States moved into the gold medal final in the women's basketball
tournament, knocking out South Korea 78-65 at the Super Dome on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans kept up the pace with the Americans during
the first half, scoring 40 points against America's 42, before
eventually surrendered off the fight as the United States surged
to a convincing victory.
</P>
<P>
A major factor in the win was the precise shooting of Sheryl
Swoopes who scored an impressive 19 points in the game. Swoopes
came into the match with a career average of 15.7 points per game
in the WNBA league.
</P>
<P>
With only 3 minutes 23 seconds left in the game, Swoopes was
escorted from the field with an injury. This left a gap open for
South Korea to score a few quick points, however, it was not
enough to take the lead away from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States, champions in the Atlanta Olympic Games in
1996, and world champions in 1998, will now play Australia for the
gold medal of the Sydney Games.

SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions the United
States fended off a strong South Korean first half challenge to
win 75-68 and reach the Olympics women's basketball final here at
the Sydney SuperDome on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans had held the Americans 19-19 in the first
half and were trailing only by two points at 40-42 in the break.
However, they struggled to maintain that energy in the second half.
</P>
<P>
American Sheryl Swoopes, who came into the match with a career
average of 15.7 points per game, scored an impressive 19 points in
the game.
</P>
<P>
"We had to change our game to accommodate the Asian style of
basketball," WNBA star Lisa Leslie said after the match.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans looked tired and fatigue in the second half,
which resulted in a sharp lose of team shape and shooting
precision.
</P>
<P>
"In the first period we did our best, but we had so many errors
in the second half," said Yang Jung-Ok.
</P>
<P>
The women's basketball Olympic gold will be contested by the
reigning champions the United States and hosts Australia, who beat
Brazil in an early semifinal today.
</P>
<P>
"It should be a great game. Australia have the home court
advantage and the crowd behind them. So we will have to deal with
that," Leslie said.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Soon Welcome to Try Family Hotels in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China has considered opening
family hotels to foreign tourists after a trial operation period.
</P>
<P>
An official source told Xinhua today that family-run hotels
will be permitted to accommodate foreigners as long as they can
guarantee qualified services and the security of guests
</P>
<P>
"In principle, foreigners will be equal with Chinese in
choosing their hotels," a Ministry of Public Security source said.
</P>
<P>
A source with the National Tourism Administration showed the
similar stand, "we will not put a say to any decisions by local
authorities if they want to open family hotels to overseas guests.
"
</P>
<P>
In fact, family-run hotels are still brand new for most Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, under the encouragement of the State and
promoted by the booming domestic tourism, China's tourism giants
of Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hainan and other provinces started to
look for China's first family-run hotel owners.
</P>
<P>
In the famous tourist attraction of Hangzhou in east China's
Zhejiang Province, the number of applicants soared to 300 in 15
days.
</P>
<P>
In Xi'an, the ancient Chinese capital for some 1,100 years, the
government had to close the bidding in advance because of the over-
heated fervor of citizens.
</P>
<P>
Family hotels must ensure food sanitation, security equipment
and the capacity for more than four guests -- said a latest
relevant interim rule in Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> China Raises Central Government's Share in Stamp Tax on Securities Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese State Council has
decided to raise the central government's share in stamp tax on
securities trading, starting from October 1.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued today, the State Council said the share of
the central government will be raised from the current 88 percent
to 97 percent in three years, reducing that for local governments
to three percent.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment will be done in three steps, raising the central
government's share to 91 percent by October 1, 94 percent by 2001
and 97 percent by 2002.
</P>
<P>
China currently imposes a four percent stamp tax on both sides
of all securities trading.
</P>
<P>
The nation's expanding stock market has led to steady growth in
the government's stamp tax revenue in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, the government's stamp
tax revenue soared to 147.7 percent to hit 26.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The State Council said the adjustment is aimed at strengthening
the central government's capacity to adjust the macro-economy.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Dance Depicting Traditional Chinese Love Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwan dance troupe will
portray a well-known Chinese legendary love tragedy with western
Jazz at the Sixth China Art Festival, which opened yesterday in
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province
</P>
<P>
The Jazz drama of "Tale of A White Snake", characterized by its
connection with Chinese tradition, combines traditional Chinese
culture with western jazz dance to produce the first "Chinese Jazz
Dance" in Asia and worldwide, according to Peggy Wu, director and
actress of the show, and also head of the Jazz Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
The drama is to be staged by Peggy Wu Jazz Dance Company in
Nanjing, Xuzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou of Jiangsu Province,
and Huaibei of Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
It is the only performance from Taiwan at the top-level art
gala.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that more people may understand and accept jazz dance
after viewing the performance with unique Chinese flavor and
marked jazz appeal," said Peggy Wu.
</P>
<P>
The troupe will give seven performances during their short stay
at the art festival.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great opportunity for us to demonstrate our artistic
achievements. And it is of particular significance to present the
audience with some new art forms on the eve of the new millennium,
" according to Danny So, administrator of the Jazz Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
Peggy Wu Jazz Dance Company, established in Taiwan in 1989, was
named after Peggy Wu, initiator of jazz dance in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The troupe is known for its innovation of performing forms and
styles, and especially famous for combining jazz dance with the
essence of Chinese traditional dances.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese fairy tales, the White Snake, after thousands of
years was transformed into a beautiful woman. She met a young man
named Xu Xian. They fell in love and got married.
</P>
<P>
Their tranquil family life, however, was disrupted by an old
monk named Fahai. Persuading Xu Xian to come to the Jinshan Temple,
Fahai warned him that he was married to an evil spirit. When the
White Snake came to find her husband, the monk refused to let her
see him. Thus, the White Snake Fairy was compelled to resort to
magic, whipping up the surrounding waters and flooding the temple.

<HEADLINE> Effort To Combat Epidemic Fever in S.Arabia Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, September 29 (XInhua) -- With one more death form Jizan
in the south, the death toll linked to the Rift Valley Fever(RVF)
rose to 39 in Saudi Arabia, the English-language newspaper Arab
News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Health, there were eight new cases
detected form the same area, including four in Asir and one in the
Eastern Province, bringing the total number of the affected people
to 189, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture and Water Abdullah Muammar continued his
inspection tour in the Jizan region where he confirmed to citizens
that health conditions were under control.
</P>
<P>
Muammar also urged local people to cooperate with spraying teams
working in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said two vaccines has been used to protect from RVF, noting
that seven more helicopters were dispatched to the region on
Thursday evening as a batch of the 20 helicopters to spray
insecticides against mosquitoes, which carry the virus from
infected animals to humans.
</P>
<P>
The RVF disease, which broke out in Saudi southern city of Jizan
near the border with Yemen on September 11, was first reported in
Kenya, Africa in 1930 and was believed to have been brought into
Saudi Arabia through cattles imported from Africa or through people
already infected with it.
</P>
<P>
RVF virus is transmitted from livestock to human by mosquitoes.
It causes high fever, diarrhea, nausea, internal bleeding and
dysfunction of kidneys that can result in death.
</P>
<P>
The disease has also claimed 31 lives in Yemen and over 100
people have also been infected by the virus in the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
As there is no medicine against the disease Saudi and Yemeni
authorities are stepping up joint preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Saudi government has allocated some 24 million Saudi riyals (6.4
million U.S. dollars) to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Health Osama Abdul-Majid Shobakshi, who
started a tour in Jizan on Saturday, said the government was also
contacting the World Health Organization (WHO) to follow the
developments of the disease and control it.
</P>
<P>
An international anti-RVF team arrived in Yemen earlier in the
week has been working on the disease in Hodaida Governorate, 230
kilometers to the northwest of the capital, Sanaa.

<HEADLINE> MILF Denies Responsibility for Twin Bombings in S. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front(MILF) denied responsibility in the recent bombings in the
southern Philippine province of Cotabato, which killed four
persons and injured more than a dozen of others.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview Friday, spokesman Eid Kabalu of
the biggest Muslim rebels in the southern part of the country said
the MILF in its all-out offensive does not attack innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Our targets are purely military personnel and their allies,
the militiamen," Kabalu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He even denied a military accusation that the MILF was creating
a religious war scenario by killing Christians and Muslims to
trigger a war between the two religious groups.
</P>
<P>
"To dispel doubt," Kabalu said, "we suggest an independent fact-
finding body to conduct investigation on the bombings and other
massacres."
</P>
<P>
Two bomb explosions rocked Kabacan town in Cotabato in 24 hours.
On Monday evening, a grenade blast inside the University of
Southern Mindanao campus killed four students and injured 12
others.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims died on the spot while the other two
succumbed to their injuries in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The next evening, a grenade exploded at a Muslim evacuation
center in nearby Kayaga village, also in Cotabato, killing two
children. The blast also injured seven others.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankans have been warned
of natural disasters like earth slips, floods and electrocution by
lightning during the inter-monsoonal period of October and
November,officials here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Meteorology Department K.H. Abeyasinghe
said cumulonimbus clouds which create thunder and lightning are
largely formed during the inter-monsoonal periods from March to
April and from October to November due to convectional activity.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a likelihood of low pressure formation and
cyclone generation in the Bay of Bengal accompanied by thunder and
lightning during the October-November season.
</P>
<P>
Atmospheric disturbances may cause strong winds and heavy rains
during this period. Although September is the final phase of the
southwest monsoon, atmospheric disturbances during this week had
caused heavy rains and floods in many parts of the southwest of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Boost Business Partnership With U.S.-based Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is among several
African countries soon to benefit from business partnership with a
U.S.-based Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE),
Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Regional representative of the CIPE Chris Darroll was quoted by
the paper as saying in Lusaka that CIPE had set aside about 40
grants totaling more than 2 million U.S. dollars for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Darroll, also executive director for Small Business Project
incorporating the private sector initiative in South Africa, said
CIPE was already talking with the business community in Zambia and
results were expected soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are on talking terms not only with Zambia but with many
other countries in the region. But even though our aim is to work
together with the private sector involved in small-scale
businesses, there is need for a vibrant large-scale and commercial
entity," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, since its inception in 1983, CIPE has
funded more than 550 projects in 70 countries and has conducted
management training programs throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Birth Rate Declines Sharply in Past Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's fertility rate has
declined sharply in the past 10 years, standing at 4.7 children
per woman at present as compared with 5.4 children per woman in
1993, Kenyan Public Health Minister Sam Ongeri has said.
</P>
<P>
The latest Kenya demographic and health survey shows that 10
years ago, the fertility rate stood at seven children per woman,
the Daily Nation newspaper Friday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the achievement to collaborative
efforts by the public, private sector and non-governmental
organizations in the provision of family planning services in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He added almost 40 percent of Kenyan women are using modern
contraceptive methods to space their children and protect their
reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
However, Ongeri noted that there is still substantial work to
do in the family planning arena as thousands of women and their
partners in the country are not using any form of family planning.

<HEADLINE> Former Canadian PM Pierre Trudeau Passes Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Canadian prime minister
Pierre Elliott Trudeau died of prostate cancer in Montreal
Thursday afternoon at the age of 81, his sons said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Justin and Sacha Trudeau deeply regret to inform you that
their father, the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau, passed
away shortly after 3 p.m.," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to Parkinson's Disease, Mr. Trudeau suffered from
prostate cancer," according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister has long been honored as one of the
greatest politicians in Canada's history since he led the country
between 1968 and 1979 and from 1980 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
During his term of office, Canada established diplomatic
relations with China on October 13, 1970.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Trudeau led his country to victory in the first
referundum on the future of the French-speaking province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Upon the news of the death of Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien decided to cut short his visit to Jamaica and was
scheduled to pay tribute to Trudeau in the Commons in Ottawa
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Chretien praised Trudeau as "the embodiment of
the dream of a just society."
</P>
<P>
"He is gone but his unfinished work remains -- our country,
Canada," he said.
</P>
<P>
Governor General Adrienne Clarkson said in her statement that
Trudeau "is the sole figure who has continually dominated our
imaginations and our spirits for nearly 40 years."
</P>
<P>
Canadian national flags on Parliament Hill were lowered to
half-mast later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Chretien has said a state funeral will be appropriate although
the final decision rests with Trudeau's family.

SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Host side Australia reached
the final in the women's basketball competition at the Sydney
Olympics by disposing of Brazil 64-52 in the semifinals at the
SuperDome on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australians, who won their country's first Olympic
basketball medal when they took the bronze in Atlanta in 1996, now
face the winner of the second semifinal which is now being played
between the United States and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The hosts got off to a flying start three minutes into the game
with the Brazilians, who they beat by 11 points during the
preliminary rounds, when they had raced away to an 11-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, silver medallists in Atlanta, got back to with one
point of the Australians on 12 minutes of the first half at 14-15,
but could not forge their way to the lead, despite the efforts of
forward Janeth Arcain who scored 21 points after going into the
game averaging 19.2.
</P>
<P>
Australia maintained its defensive pressure with the scoring
power of Sandy Brondello and Lauren Jackson, both of whom finished
the game with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
"The whole game they (Brazil) were coming straight back at us.
They did a really good job actually," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been quite happy with the way we have been playing.
There weren't a lot of nerves out there," Brondello said.

<HEADLINE> CAS Confirms Suspension of Romanian Hammer Thrower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Arbitration for
Sport (CAS) Friday confirmed that Romanian world champion hammer
thrower Mihaela Melinte should be suspended for drugs offence.
</P>
<P>
Melinte was thrown out of Stadium Australia before the
qualifying round after failing a dope test.
</P>
<P>
"She remains suspended," said CAS secretary general Matthieu
Reeb.
</P>
<P>
Melinte had filed an appeal demanding to compete in the Sydney
Games and the CAS met in a session from Thursday night to Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Melinte, 25, holds the world record in the hammer at 76.07
meters and was therefore unable to be allowed to post a
qualification mark for the final due on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
She had been escorted out of the arena just before the
qualification competition after testing positive for nandrolone on
June 7 in Italy but filed an appeal.
</P>
<P>
But the result of the test did not reach the International
Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) before the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Melinte claimed she knew nothing of the finding until the
morning of the competition.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Athletics Federation (FRA) reproached the IAAF for
not respecting the normal time scale for informing of positive
dope tests.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Melinte was arrested by French police
conducting an inquiry into doping in Paris but no charges were
laid against her.

<HEADLINE> USATF to Review Drug Testing Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States athletics
governing body USATF will set up a special commission to review
its drug testing procedures over the last two years after some
criticism from Olympic and athletics officials at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this commission will be to review and issue
written findings relative to USATF's compliance with applicable
anti doping rules and international standards over the last two
years,"said a statement issued by the USATF.
</P>
<P>
The four-member commission is to be headed by Richard McLaren,
a lawyer who is also on the Court of Arbitration for Sport and is
also to include one member of the World Anti Doping Agency.
</P>
<P>
The USATF came under pressure after revelations that shot put
world champion C.J. Hunter, the husband of two-times Olympic gold
medallist Marion Jones, failed four doping tests in June and July
for the steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
The news was released by the athletics ruling body IAAF, while
the USATF does not give names until the cases are decided, which
prompted claims the Americans were covering up doping cases.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 cases are reportedly still pending, but USATF boss
Craig Masback said earlier in the week they did not involve
athletes competing in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The USATF said the commission is to have a report ready by the
end of year and expressed its confidence that its rules are
correct.
</P>
<P>
"We have initiated this action as a demonstration of our
confidence in the matter by which USATF has conducted itself. We
also wish to reassure the public at large of the integrity of U.S.
Track and Field athletes as well as all U.S. Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, we will ensure that full access to our records
will be provided. The commission will be independently funded and
will have full inquiry powers," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The USATF also offered to hand over all doping test control of
its athletes to the WADA in a meeting between U.S. officials and
WADA chief Dick Pound at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The US Track and Field on Thursday proposed to Dick Pound to
assume control of USA Track and Field's anti-doping programme,"
another USATF statement said.

<HEADLINE> Sheepskin Raft Plays New Role (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- With great reluctance, Han
Xingde, a middle-aged man from the Salar ethnic group Qinghai
Province, presented the sheepskin raft, handed down in his family
for generations, to a nearby museum recently, after he won the
gold medal in a recent sheepskin raft race on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
"After driving it on the Yellow River for more than 20 years,
sheepskin raft now becomes such a rarity that the cultural bureau
treasures it in the museum," Han said.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old began to sail the raft to transport timber when
he was 12. Sheepskin rafts were the only means of transportation
for the older generation of Salar residents in Xunhua County of
the northwest China province. All the men of the Salar ethnic
group were capable of sailing rafts.
</P>
<P>
For centuries, they rode on sheepskin rafts to escort logs
drifting downstream and transport daily necessities. "It was an
indispensable conveyance we could not live without at that time,"
Han said.
</P>
<P>
But, sheepskin rafts are being used less and less in people's
daily life after 16 highway bridges built on the upper reaches of
Yellow River over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The mileage of highway in Qinghai, a landlocked province on the
northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has increased from
462 kilometers in the early 1950s to 18,268 kilometers in 1999.
The Salar people now travel by bus and some have even bought their
own cars.
</P>
<P>
"The disappearance of sheepskin raft indicates a shift in the
way of living for the Salar people," said Han Shanghwen, deputy
magistrate of Xunhua County.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Welcomes More Foreign Tourists: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tokyo deputy
governor Yasushi Aoyama said in Beijing today that he hoped more
foreigners will visit the Japanese capital.
</P>
<P>
While extending a special welcome to Chinese people to visit
Tokyo, the deputy governor said that his city has been building
new hotels.
</P>
<P>
Since September, Chinese citizens have been allowed to travel
to Japan as tourists.
</P>
<P>
Information released by the arrival and departure bureau of the
Chinese Ministry of Public Security said that in the first six
months of this year, more than 4.7 million foreigners visited
China, with 1.04 million coming from Japan.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the Sixth Major Cities Summit Beijing 2000
that ends today, Yasushi Aoyama said that although Tokyo is
becoming more attractive to tourists, the growth of the number of
tourists to Japan or Tokyo has not been large.
</P>
<P>
Yasushi Aoyama said that the number of Japanese traveling
abroad in 1964 rose from 128,000 to 16 million in 1998, up 120
times, but the number of foreigners visiting Japan in 1998 totaled
about four million, up by only 12 times.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem Tokyo faces is traffic congestion, and the
airport is 60 km away from the downtown area of Tokyo, which makes
many tourists flinch away, said the deputy governor.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Tokyo hosted the first major cities summit,
calling for global cooperation in resolving problems facing cities.

<HEADLINE> Sheepskin Raft Plays New Role (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local residents have built woolen mills for producing cashmere
and sweaters, which sell well throughout China. By taking
advantage of the abundance of sunshine and difference in
temperature between day and night on the highland, an increasing
number of people began to grow out-of-season vegetables and fruits
and sell them to other parts of China for higher profits.
</P>
<P>
The new line of operation helps increase the per capita net
income of residents in Xunhua to 1,000 yuan annually. This is
considerable progress for this remote and underdeveloped county,
though it is still much less than many other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
To narrow the gap in income between eastern and western China,
the central government has unveiled a long-term strategy to
accelerate economic growth in the western region. One of its chief
purpose is to raise the living standard of all ethnic groups in
the region, said Bai Ma, a government official in Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
With easy access to transportation, sheepskin rafts have turned
from a means of transportation to a sports item to lure tourists.
Descendants of raft drivers are doing jobs in other trades.
</P>
<P>
"However, sheepskin raft is an important way to understand the
history of the Salar ethnic group. The courage, skill and
confidence displayed by the Salar people in driving rafts will
carry on," said Su Ming, a research fellow in Qinghai.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Soon Welcome to Try Family Hotels in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wei Lixing, a Xi'an citizen living in the Minde Neighborhood
Garden and one of the 190 applicants for opening family hotels in
the city, said he wishes his family can receive foreign guests as
soon as possible if he can get the business permit.
</P>
<P>
"For me and my family," he said, "the money is one purpose, but
more importantly, we can make friends with foreigners and learn
more about their countries by receiving them at my own home."
</P>
<P>
Though at present, China in general still advises foreigners to
stay in designated hotels so as to guarantee their personal safety,
foreigners are beginning to have more freedom to choose where to
spend the night in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Rong, a sociologist from the prestigious Northwestern
University in Xi'an, views the consideration of opening family
hotels to foreigners as epitomizing the deepening of China's
opening-up policy in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
"This represents the achievements made by the Chinese
Government in the past some 20 years to encourage mutual friendly
exchanges with foreign countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the late 1970s, Chinese residents were
forbidden to even watch foreigners in throngs," but now, people
are strongly encouraged to contact friendly foreign people through
all means."
</P>
<P>
"To open family hotels will be another vital step for mutual
understandings between foreigners and the common Chinese under
different social systems and cultural backgrounds," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a public security source, because family
hotels are new in China, and are still in a trial stage, they are
not suitable to receive foreigners for the time being.
</P>
<P>
"They still need to improve their services in not only language
but also security measures," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official figure, a total of 72.8 million
overseas tourists entered China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the figure will increase to 137 million in
the year 2020, ranking China the No.1 tourist destination in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Invests on Electricity Grid Substations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to invest 2,723 million rupees (34.7 million U.S. dollars)
to construct a new grid substation and improve existing
electricity grid substations in the Western province, the
Electricity Board said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A contract agreement in this regard was signed here Thursday
between the Electricity Board and the Consortium of ABB Switchgear
AB of Sweden and Mitsubishi electric Corporation of Japan, said a
statement from the board.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Electricity Board Arjun Deraniyagala was quoted
as saying that the board will bear the project cost of 2,245
million rupees (28.6 million dollars) from a loan obtained from
the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the balance from
its own funds.
</P>
<P>
Deraniyagala said investing in power transmission was vital as
the low reliability of the power supply causes power failures.
</P>
<P>
He said that the project included the rehabilitation of the
Kolonnawa grid substation which was more than 40 years old, to
ensure the reliability of the power supply to the Colombo loads
such as the national hospitals, prisons, the parliament, hotels
and government institutions.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the Kolonnawa grid substation was vital
as around 40 percent of the electricity supply to Colombo was fed
from here.
</P>
<P>
The project also included the rehabilitation of the Biyagama
grid substation and the construction of the Pannipitiya grid
substation would improve the quality and reliability of the supply
provided to areas south of Colombo.

MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the Philippine

But the broader-all shares index slightly went up 3.55 points

Analysts said the market is kept in a downward trend as
investors remained cautious about participating actively in the

"The market was expected to trade sideways. Volumes are
thinning because most of the funds have underweighted the
Philippines and local players are staying on the sidelines because

<HEADLINE> Ainslie Wins Men's Sailing Laser Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ben Ainslie of Britain won the
Olympic sailing open laser gold medal at the Sydney Olympic Games
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian world champion Robert Scheidt was second and
Australia's Michael Blackburn finished third.
</P>
<P>
Ainslie was named the provisional winner of the gold after a
tough battle with Atlanta gold medallist Scheidt during which both
boats collided rounding the first mark.
</P>
<P>
Both sailors crossed the finish line flying protest flags,
meaning the result could still be decided in the regatta's
international jury room later on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ainslie's win came after Scotland's Shirley Robertson held off
a late charge from Dutchwoman Margriet Matthysse earlier on Friday
to win gold in the women's Europe dinghy class.
</P>
<P>
Ainslie, the silver medallist four years ago, trailed going
into the final race by nine points but claimed gold by a single
point.
</P>
<P>
With boats able to discard their worst two finishes, the Briton
knew he could regain the lead and reverse the Atlanta medal order
if Scheidt finished well back in the fleet in the
final race.
</P>
<P>
The pair staged a match race down the first leg, with Ainslie
tacking constantly in front of Scheidt to ensure the Brazilian
stayed well behind the 40-boat fleet.
</P>
<P>
Scheidt eventually broke free but had lost too much ground in
the early stages and crossed the finish line in 22nd place.
</P>
<P>
Ainslie crossed in 37th place, meaning his worst previous
finish which would count towards his total points was an 11th.
Scheidt's 22nd placing meant he had to include a previous 21st in
his total.
</P>
<P>
Ainslie finished with a net total of 45 to Scheidt's 46.

<HEADLINE> China's Market Economic System Framework Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese residents might not
be aware of the role the market plays in their daily lives when
they are bargaining with peddlers at fairs.
</P>
<P>
However, if they are told that their right to engage in this
kind of free deals is part of the benefits gained as a result of
China's effort to open wider to the outside world and to build up
the socialist market economic system, people may understand it
better.
</P>
<P>
The shift of government functions in price management from
administrative orders to market regulation, for example, explains
how far the Chinese government has gone in building up a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Market-regulated prices now play a role in 94.7 percent of the
country's total retail sales, said an official at the State
Development Planning Commission, adding that the purchasing price
of 83.8 percent of agricultural products and that of 86 percent of
capital goods are well under market regulation.
</P>
<P>
The government pricing department has been taking measures to
straighten out market order to make sure that prices are set
according to market changes, and organize decision-making hearings
in a bid to cultivate and improve a fair and orderly market price
formation system.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China has promulgated several laws to
further regulate market activities in a move to standardize and
legalize its market economy.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the macro-control measures the central
government has adopted in recent years, such as the moderately
stringent financial policy and the proactive financial policy in
line with market changes and the law of the market.
</P>
<P>
The reform of state-owned enterprises, housing, and government
institutions has achieved breakthroughs, with the market playing
an increasingly important role in the process.
</P>
<P>
The government-initiated strategy to develop the western part
of the country is an inevitable choice, as it aims at balanced
economic development by giving full play to the resource
advantages in the west and the technological, capital and
personnel advantages in the east, according to market rules.
</P>
<P>
China's economic performance has turned for the better this
year, which, experts say, should be attributable mainly to the
fledgling socialist market economic framework.

<HEADLINE> Interview: UK's Share of Pie in HK Grows Bigger, UK Consul-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The British share of the
pie in Hong Kong has grown larger as British exports here have
been expanded since China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong
Kong in 1997, a British diplomat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is safe to say that UK's exports to Hong Kong in the first
months this year increased by 21 percent from a year earlier, and
the increase will be greater in the months to come, British Consul-
General in Hong Kong James Hodge said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that the British share of the pie in Hong Kong is
getting bigger and bigger," Hodge said. "We can always do better,
and everyone wants to try hard to get more of the pie."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that British companies are doing well in Hong Kong
and showing their competence in different sectors in Hong Kong by
trying hard to do business here, and they have a great deal of
interests in this market.
</P>
<P>
Hodge, a veteran British diplomat who started his Hong Kong
term in August this year, is the second British consul-general in
Hong Kong since Hong Kong's return to its motherland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Having followed Hong Kong affairs for many years and spent a
good deal of his career in East Asia, Hodge said, "I'm very lucky
to have come to Hong Kong at a very interesting time of its
development."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his impressions on Hong Kong, Hodge said this is a
very dynamic and busy city, and it is recovering very well from
the effects of the economic problems that affected so much of Asia
starting about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
On the political side, the implementation of the "one country,
two systems" policy in Hong Kong has gone well, and the recent
elections for the Legislative Council went off in a good, open and
transparent way, moving Hong Kong towards a full democratic system
at a pace which the people of Hong Kong would wish, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hodge said the Hong Kong government's efforts in improving the
environment and China's impending accession to the World Trade
Organization will create more opportunities for British companies.
</P>
<P>
"As we are moving into the 21st century, we shall be looking
forward to build a relationship with Hong Kong which is different
from what we had four years ago," Hodge said.
</P>
<P>
The consul-general's plan for his four-year term is to further
the bilateral relation between Britain and Hong Kong which will
benefit both sides. There is a great deal that Britain can offer
Hong Kong since the Hong Kong government has exerted great efforts
to improve the environment and education, Hodge said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall be looking to opportunities to collaborate and
encourage British companies to increase investment in Hong Kong,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hodge was in Beijing for almost two years in 1995 and 1996 as
minister in the British Embassy. He said he and his wife enjoyed
the life there very much. Before he came to Hong Kong, he served
as ambassador to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Asian B2B E-Commerce -- High Risks, High Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Asian B2B (business to
business) e-marketplaces carry significant higher risk than their
U.S. counterparts, and only a handful of Asian e-marketplaces will
eventually survive.
</P>
<P>
B2B e-commerce is still in its infancy in Asia, and Asia e-
marketplaces will face severe competition from the bigger, more
experienced and established Western players, according to a recent
report of Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that B2B e-commerce in Asia will indeed be big,
although the headline numbers overstate the true potential.
</P>
<P>
Total gross B2B e-commerce transaction revenues could reach 445
billion U.S. dollars by 2005, which implies a regional nominal GDP
penetration of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Salomon report admits the true addressable market
opportunities will be much smaller.
</P>
<P>
Asia's B2B e-marketplaces are highly fragmented and growth will
be uneven, with the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Taiwan being the
key markets. Four Asian dragons -- the ROK, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore -- will likely account for 67 percent of total Asia-
Pacific B2B e-commerce transactions in 2005.
</P>
<P>
China and India are two of the largest self-contained economies
and have many companies with long and inefficient supply chains.
Companies in these countries stand to benefit the most from B2B e-
commerce investment.
</P>
<P>
Due to its highly fragmented market, U.S. B2B companies will
not be easy to move in. As a result, many Asia-centric e-
marketplaces will either survive in their own little micro-market
or attract U.S. partners or buyers who are interested in entering
Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Asian e-marketplaces are involved in areas
where traditional Asian industries are strong, such as electronics
and logistics. These marketplaces look best positioned to
withstand foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the revenue, the Salomon report says many e-
marketplaces in Asia plan to generate revenues from just simple
membership or license fees, and transaction commissions. Like in
the United States, clients in Asia will increasingly demand more
functionality than simple transaction capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Successful e-marketplaces will likely use transaction volume as
the catalyst to create the community and would offer ancillary
services and value-added services to sustain the community and
generate revenues, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Asia, many SMEs
will likely be forced to take their businesses on-line following
their bigger competitors and customers in the region, as well as
globally.
</P>
<P>
The Asian SME segment will likely be smaller in size and may be
difficult to penetrate, but e-marketplaces targeting this
fragmented segment should typically have greater pricing power and
sustainable networks.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Oil Price Hike Not to Damage China's Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The recent oil price hike
poses a real threat to China's economic recovery, yet it is not
threatening enough to spoil it.
</P>
<P>
"The oil price shocks could weaken, but not derail China's
nascent, broadly based economic recovery," said Guonan Ma, head of
North Asia economics of Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
China's August exports and imports rose 27.2 percent and a
staggering 54.7 percent year-on-year, respectively, compared to 24
percent and 40 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
In fact, import growth in August reached a five-year high,
surging beyond expectations. As a result, the country's monthly
trade surplus shrank by half compared to 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that while the budding strength in domestic
demand and rapid technology upgrading of China play a positive
role in the country's economic growth, a much larger oil import
bill caused both by higher oil price and rising oil consumption
poses a real threat to China's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices have shot up 250 percent from a low of around
10 U.S. dollars per barrel in early 1999 to a recent high of
nearly 35 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has been a net oil importer since the 1990s, and its oil
imports have increased since 1998, mainly because of stagnant
domestic oil production and rising domestic oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
Ma predicted that China's net oil import bill could double this
year, and could rise further to 15 billion U.S. dollars in 2001,
if the oil price remained at the level of 33 U.S. dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
However, the direct impact of any oil price hikes on China's
economy should be much less than that on most Asia-Pacific
economies as the ratio of net oil imports to domestic oil
consumption is much lower than the Asian average.
</P>
<P>
The ratio for China is only 22 percent, but 100.2 percent for
Japan and 61.4 percent for the rest of Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Second, oil occupies only 26.6 percent in China's primary
energy consumption, much lower than several other Asian economies,
which are heavily dependent on oil, including Singapore, the
Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong, thus decisively offsetting the
effect that higher oil prices could hamper the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
China's economic recovery is still broadening and the 2001
macro story for China will likely be the strength of domestic
demand, according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch estimated that, with the oil price at 33 U.S.
dollars per barrel, the estimated accumulative direct and indirect
impact on China should be no more than 0.5 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
It maintained its bullish macro call on China and its baseline
GDP forecasts of eight percent and 7.5 percent for 2000 and 2001,
respectively, in its report on China economics released on
September 18.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Pre-Pay ADB Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to pre-pay
over 500 million U.S. dollars of loans to the Manila-based Asian
Development Bank (ADB) ahead of their scheduled maturity, Thai
government said in a report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government will first raise funds through new syndicated
and domestic loans to repay 186 million dollars of loans the
Finance Ministry borrowed that are due in 2009, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to refinance a 150-million-dollar
loan made to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand due
in 2005, it said.
</P>
<P>
Repayment of 170 million dollars of loans made to the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority and Metropolitan Waterworks
Authority will also be made before they are due, it stated.
</P>
<P>
The pre-payment plan is expected to save the Thai government
and state enterprises 95 million dollars in debt-service costs,
and may also put downward pressure on the Thai baht over the next
couple of weeks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has totally borrowed some 1.2 billion dollars of
loans from the ADB to restructure its economic and social sectors
since it plunged into the financial crisis in 1997.

LOS ANGELES -- During the next 20 years, the world's freighter
airplane fleet is expected to double, with greatest growth taking
place in widebody freighters, Boeing said Thursday in an industry
forecast report.

the report said, the worldwide air cargo industry is expected to
add more than 2,600 freighter airplanes, as nearly 1,100 current

UNITED NATIONS -- Out of 95 developing countries monitored by

<P>
For the majority of developing countries, "growth is a very
slow or even elusive process," said the report.

GDP or gross domestic product per capita doubles in 35 years if
it grows at an annual average of 2 percent. Out of the 95

Robertson finished a disappointing 16th in the first race of

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Income to Soar From Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Soaring oil prices will
help bring an extra 4 billion U.S. dollars to Mexico's oil revenue
this year, said an official with the state oil company.
</P>
<P>
An increase of crude exports will also make this year a more
profitable year for the country's oil industry, which is the world
's fifth-largest, General Director of Petroleum Mexicano (Pemex)
Rogelio Montemayor told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has increased its crude exports in response to OPEC's
decision to boost oil-producers' output and ease surging oil
prices since April this year.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, whose finances are dependent on oil sales, extracts 3.4
million barrels of oil per day, more than half of which is for
export. Oil represented 32.5 percent of Mexico's tax earnings in
1999.
</P>
<P>
For a period of time, crude prices on the world market exceeded
30 dollars a barrel. Currently prices are still above the
reference oil price band of 22-28 dollars per barrel, despite the
U.S. release of strategic crude reserves last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reference oil price band is believed by OPEC countries to
be a suitable and sustainable floating price range.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is not an APEC member but played a role in the reduction
of world oil supply in 1998 and 1999 which led to the increases of
prices.
</P>
<P>
As global crude prices are still high, the OPEC Summit, which
started on Wednesday in Caracas, Venezuela, is being closely
watched by oil-consuming countries in the world and a solution to
the issue is anticipated.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton held talks with visiting Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok at
the White House on Thursday to discuss an array of issues
including trade and drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
the two leaders agreed that lingering trade disputes between the U.
S. and the European Union should be settled before relations
between the two sides are poisoned.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Kok also noted that 60 to 80 percent of the illegal
drug "ecstasy" reaching the United States originates from the
Netherlands, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the two leaders agreed that the issue will
be discussed further in November at a meeting between justice
officials of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Kok told Clinton that the Netherlands plans
to focus on Africa, including the situation in Sierra Leone,
Ethiopia and Eritrea, when it takes its turn as president of the U.
N. Security Council in November, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Poland Wins Third Olympic Athletics Gold in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Poland's defending champion
Robert Korzeniowski won the country's thrid athletics gold medal
in the ongoing Games after taking his second gold in the men's 50
kilometers walk
</P>
<P>
Korzeniowski, winner of the men's 20 kilometers September 22,
clocked a time of three hours 42 minutes and 22 seconds for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
Poland was second in the athletics gold medal tally, only
behind the Uninted States, who holds the most six golds now.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old, who kept the leading position after 30
kilometers without any challenge, held a one minute and 18 seconds
edge over Aigars Fadejevs of Latvia, who won the silver medal in 3:
43:40.  Joel Sanchez of Mexico won the bronze, his country's
second medal in the men's walk races after teammte Hernamoez
taking silver in the 20km race last week, finishing the course in
3:44.36.
</P>
<P>
"My objective and focus was especially on defending my 50km
title. During the season I found that my average speed over 20km
was very good. I beat my 10km best four or five minutes. So I
decided to go 100 percent for both races," said Korzeniowski, who
was disqualified at the world championships last year.
</P>
<P>
"Judging is very hard. It is the same problem for everyone. My
impression of the judges is that they are very precise and very
just. Maybe the only regret is that they didn't take away Bernardo
Segura (Mexico) berore he crossed the line (in the men's 20km),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On his number -- 2711, the winner said: "My number is a very
special one. It is the 27th Olympics and a double one -- two first
places."
</P>
<P>
China's Yang Yongjian was 10th with a time of 3:48:42. Yang's
teammate Wang Yinhang finished 13th in 3:50:19. Both set up their
personal best times.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity that I didn't finish among the top eight but I
really did my best in the race," said Yong Yongjian, whose best
time was 3:54:13.
</P>
<P>
"We are still slower than our opponents though we have improved
a lot," said Wang Yinhang, who had ran a personal best of 3:53:10
before the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We were too far from the leaders at the beginning periods and
were too difficult to come back late." said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Prosecutors to Fight Soeharto Court Rulings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said state prosecutors would appeal against the
verdict of a panel of South Jakarta District Court judges
dismissing the corruption case against the former President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The South Jakarta District Court dropped on Thursday multi-
million U.S. dollars graft charges against Soeharto after hearing
medical arguments from an independent team of doctors that he was
mentally and physically unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
The court also released the defendant from his city arrest
status.
</P>
<P>
"There is no real will to give justice to the people," Darusman
was quoted by national newspapers Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was satisfied with the judges' decision,
Darusman said his side was trying to make earnest efforts to
create justice in society.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 79, was accused of stealing 571 million U.S. dollars
from the state by funneling money from seven charity foundations
he chaired into the businesses belonging to his family and cronies.
</P>
<P>
Following the abolition of Soeharto's case, hundreds of
students, who claimed themselves as "anti-Soeharto group," staged
protest outside the court building.
</P>
<P>
Police stated that at least one anti-Soeharto protester was
killed and some 30 persons were wounded in a clash with police
personnel.
</P>
<P>
A bus used by Soeharto's supporters, a military vehicle and two
police motorcycles were set ablaze at separate locations in the
capital by student protesters and spectators.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators continued to rally in some areas late into
the night. Together with locals who joined the demonstration, they
beat a military soldier and a police officer, and burned the
military vehicle and a police motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that as of late Thursday night, police had
arrested at least 46 people in connection to the violence.

1999, according to the latest figures released by the country's
Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
The main source of Myanmar's customs duties income comes from
import through normal trade and border trade.
</P>
<P>
Of the customs duties income obtained in the six-month period,
that from import through normal trade amounted to 427.5 million
dollars, accounting for 91.93 percent of the total, while that
from import through border trade was 37.48 million dollars,
representing 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar mainly trades with Singapore, China, Thailand, Japan,
Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea, having border trade with
China, Thailand, India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
As over 40 percent of its foreign trade is done with member
states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
Myanmar pursues the ASEAN customs rules, applying significantly
reduced tariff rates with them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in order to be in harmony with the market situation,
goods produced by the state sector and those imported have been
valued at market prices since 1997, depicting a departure from the
past practice of pricing such goods based on the official rate of
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Myanmar, along with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, is
also preparing for the implementation of the World Trade
Organization Valuation Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Begins Operations to Disarm E. Timorese Militias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
started operations on Thursday to disarm East Timorese militias in
West Timor.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security
Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said that police and military
personnel had been deployed to refugee camps in West Timor to
search for weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Police and military personnel are now on the ground to carry
out sweeping operations," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that one battalion of police Mobile Brigade
personnel had been deployed on Thursday to 11 police subprecincts
in Belu regency to search for weapons.
</P>
<P>
Two battalions of troops from the Army's Strategic Reserves
Command (Kostrad) had also been deployed to a number of locations
around Atambua since Thursday morning to conduct weapons searches.
</P>
<P>
Belu police chief Supt. S.M. Simatupang said that the search
for weapons would continue until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that repressive measures would have to be taken against
the militias if they fail to disarm within three days.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council and the international
community has been pressuring Jakarta to disarm the militias since
they hacked three unarmed U.N. aid workers to death in the West
Timor border town of Atambua on September 6.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council repeated a demand that
Indonesia disband the militias after renewed threats to U.N.
personnel at a weapons hand-over ceremony over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted local officials as saying that the militiamen
have handed in more than 1,000 guns, but they are mostly crude,
handmade weapons. Very few sophisticated weapons have been given
up.

SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ion Tiriac said Friday he will
quit as president of the Romanian Olympic Committee.

<P>
Tiriac said he would step down in "two or three weeks" because
he had introduced the harsh life-ban policy for any Romanian

doctor. Her protest of the decision was rejected Thursday by the

effort to slow AIDS transmission along an 80 km segment of the

as many more typical communities, he said.

The factories, schools and military bases offer larger-than-

<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- French track star Marie-Jose
Perec broke her silence Thursday and sought to explain how fear
drove her from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on France-2 television, Perec said
she regretted her decision to flee Australia but said it was not
worth competing in the conditions she endured.
</P>
<P>
Perec returned to Paris last week on a flight from Singapore,
where her American boyfriend, Anthuan Maybank, had an altercation
with an Australian TV cameraman that ended with police questioning.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Perec has locked herself up in her Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
Her decision to leave Sydney stunned the French Olympic
delegation and officials criticized her for not informing them.
But she said the decision to flee was not easy.
</P>
<P>
"It took me a whole day to take that decision. I left the hotel
in the afternoon, a first time. My boyfriend said, 'No, no, we
will hold up. Let's go back to the hotel, we'll manage but in any
case it'll be okay.' But I didn't hold up. I cracked," she said.
</P>
<P>
Perec, who stayed in a hotel apart from the French team, said
she was spied on, followed by cars and insulted while in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Rider Zijlaard Aims at Another Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Dutch rider Leontien Zijlaard
will have another chance to prove that she is not only the
strongest rider at the Sydney Olympic, but also the most versatile.
</P>
<P>
The women's individual time trial will be held on Saturday over
two laps of a 15.2kg circuit in Sydney's eastern suburbs. The
route traces the same path of the road race but skips the long
slog up the hill from Bronte Beach.
</P>
<P>
Zijlaard, who already won more Olympic medals in one Games than
any other female cycling (she has won two gold and one silver from
her three events so far), is also the winner of the past two world
time trial championships.
</P>
<P>
But the race against the clock can never be considered a one-
rider race. Other riders to watch include the defending Olympic
champion Zoulfia Zabirova of Russia, the bronze medalist Clara
Hughes of Canada and the World Cup champion from 1998 and the road
race silver medalist Hanka Kupfernagel of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli of France, the winner of eight road
cycling World Championship titles including three successive time
trials from 1995 through 1997, is always a contender despite
turning 42 this year.

SYDNEY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia will try to legitimise
its status as world champion at the Olympic Games as it moves into
the free routine portion of the synchronized swimming team event
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian swimmers hold a 0.70 points lead Japan after
Thursday's technical team program. The Russian team tied with
Japan for artistic impression, but they impressed the judges more
technically.
</P>
<P>
At the Olympic trials in April, Russia won the team event and
its free routine was judege only 0.74 points shy of perfect.
</P>
<P>
The team free final is set to be a tight contest. Russia is
swimming a witch-themed routine marked by incredible pace and
aerobic energy, while Japan will perform a routine title "The Bird
of Wonder".
</P>
<P>
Canada, France and the United States will also be competing for
a medal. Currently only one point separates these three teams.

Australia has been the in-form team all tournament and its
strikers have really shown what they are capable of in the last
couple of matches. But Argentina will be tough opposition.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal clash between the Netherlands and Spain will
be an interesting one. The teams met on Wednesday with the
Netherlands emerging victorious. The Dutch should once more prove
too strong. If they can dominated the midfield as they did on
Wednesday, they will dominate the match.
</P>
<P>
The first two games of the day are qualification matches with
India playing Argentina for seventh spot and Germany and Britain
meeting once again in a play-off for fifth.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Violence Casts Clouds on Stalled Peace Process by Lou Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Five Palestinians have been
killed and over 200 others injured in bloody clashes with Israeli
soldiers in the religious compound in the walled Old City of East
Jerusalem Friday.
</P>
<P>
This highlighted the latest cycle of violence surrounding an
Israeli right-wing politician's visit to the holy Islamic sites,
which was regarded "provocative" to the Muslims and invited
widespread condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The cycle of violence, starting from by a roadside bombing
Wednesday, threatened to cast clouds over the already troubled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were worried that the violence may hamper the efforts
by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to revive the peace talks, stagnant since their failed
summit at Camp David in the United States in July.
</P>
<P>
The summit failed to reach any agreement mainly due to
significant gaps between the two sides over the fate of Jerusalem,
especially the sovereignty over the religious site that Muslim call
the Noble Sanctuary and Jews refer to as the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
The religious compound, housing the third holiest shrines of
Islam of Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock, is the site of
the former Jewish Temple, the most sacred shrine of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
It is within the walled Old City in East Jerusalem, which Israel
captured and annexed in 1967. The Palestinians want the entire East
Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state while
Israel declares the whole of Jerusalem its "undivided, eternal"
capital.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach a final peace accord, Barak and Arafat met
again on Monday in what they termed as a "good and warm" summit,
which was followed by meetings of negotiators of both sides in
Washington in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
However, Ariel Sharon, hawkish leader of the opposition Likud
party, decided to visit the sensitive religious site despite outcry
from the Palestinian side. This provocative move added to the
tensions and proved to be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Sharon's planned visit, a roadside bomb exploded
near a Jewish settlement in the Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip,
wounding two Israeli soldiers, one of whom, a 19-year-old, died in
hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His presence in the religious compound along with other Israeli
lawmakers on Thursday sparked clashes between Israeli police and
Palestinian demonstrators in which 25 Israeli policemen and 10
Palestinians were wound. The protesters shouted "Murderer Out" at
Sharon and pelted stones at Israeli police who responded with
rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, the mastermind of Israeli army's invasion of Lebanon in
1982, is notorious for his role in the massacre of hundreds of
Palestinian refugees near Beirut that year.
</P>
<P>
Violence spread to other Palestinian self-rule areas later
Thursday, leading to several injuries. Another roadside bomb went
off Thursday night in Gaza, no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, two Israeli soldiers were shot by one of
their Palestinian colleagues in a joint patrol team in the West
Bank. One died later in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, riots erupted in the religious compound again
between Israeli soldiers and stone-hurling Palestinians, leaving
five Palestinians dead and hundreds injured.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are concerned that such a cycle of violence could
spiral to a dangerous height, nullifying the renewed efforts by
Barak and Arafat in pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the peace progress may be shelved for a while
as the recent developments exposed the lack of trust between the
two sides. Moreover, the bloody clashes may force Barak and Arafat
to cave in to pressures from anti-peace groups on both sides.
</P>
<P>
As time is running short for the peace process to succeed, the
delay could spell greater trouble for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak, whose coalition now controls only one-third seats in the
120-member Knesset (parliament), is eager to reach an agreement
with the Palestinians before political storms come with the
reconvening of the Knesset in late October.
</P>
<P>
Without a peace breakthrough, Barak will have to rush to rebuild
a coalition so as to survive no-confidence votes which seem certain
before him in the no-so-friendly parliament.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has set November 15 as the new date for the declaration
of an independent Palestinian state. He is no less eager to have a
peace agreement with Israel before that date, as he had already put
off the deadline twice.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, both Barak and Arafat feel uneasy at the prospect that
the ardent Mideast peace sponsor, U.S. President Bill Clinton,
whose term ends early next year, may no longer have the enthusiasm
to mediate as the time for him to step down tickers near.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Speaker Condemns Israeli Shooting in Religious Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestine
Legislative Council (PLC) Ahmed Qurei condemned the Israeli
police's shooting of Palestinians in the holy Islamic sites in East
Jerusalem on Friday, which left five Palestinians killed and over
200 injured.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely this is Israeli madness," Qurei told reporters,
adding that "the Israelis lost their sense of balance."
</P>
<P>
The recent incidents undermine all the peace initiatives and
constitute a "crime against our people who will never yield a
single inch of their territories and holy sites," Qurei said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in the religious site, known as al-Haram al-Sharif
(Noble Sanctuary) to Muslims and Temple Mount to Jews in the walled
Old City in East Jerusalem, erupted earlier in the day when
thousands of Palestinian worshipers gathered in the Muslim compound
for Friday noon prayers.
</P>
<P>
The compound, housing the third holiest shrines of Islam of Al
Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock, is the site of the former
Jewish Temple, the most sacred shrine of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police claimed that after the prayers, the Palestinians
began hurling stones at the Israelis soldiers posted near the site
and the Jews who are praying at the nearby Western Wall, the only
relics of the Jewish Temple, ahead of Friday afternoon's Jewish New
Year.
</P>
<P>
The police reportedly fired rubber bullets and tear gas to
scatter the crowd. However, the riots later turned bloody and five
Palestinians died by live rounds fired by Israeli army, Palestinian
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Friday's violence came one day after Ariel Sharon, hawkish
leader of Israel's right-wing Likud party, visited the holy Muslim
sites Thursday morning under the heavy Israeli police escort.
</P>
<P>
Qurei condemned the controversial visit as aimed to "
contaminate" the holy Muslim sites.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak-Bashar Meeting to Enhance Arab Stances: AL Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) said on
Friday the upcoming Egyptian-Syrian summit meeting will boost Arab
stances on "vital and crucial" issues facing the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will visit Egypt on Sunday at
the outset of his first trip abroad since assuming office in July.
He is expected to discuss with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak the Arab-Israeli peace talks, especially on the Syrian
track. Bashar reportedly will also travel to Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab forum welcomes the Egyptian-Syrian summit which
will strengthen the Arab stance with respect to challenges to the
Arab countries, the league's assistant secretary general, Ahmad Ben
Hely, said.
</P>
<P>
Such an Arab high-level meeting will always give momentum to
joint Arab action in all fields, Hely told Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that security and stability would not be realized in
the Middle East unless the Syrian-Israeli peace talks are revived.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were suspended in January due to disputes over
the future of the Golan Heights that Israel occupied from Syria in
the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The league official reiterated the league's firm support for
Syria's stance that Israel must withdraw from the strategic plateau
completely.

GAZA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has called for a general strike to be held on
Saturday to protest the killing of five Palestinians by Israeli
army in the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said over the
official Voice of Palestine radio that only official bodies, such
as ministries, would be exempt from the strike.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Egypt for Talks With Mubarak on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will visit Egypt on Saturday to hold talks with President Hosni
Mubarak, the Egyptian International Press Center said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will take place on Saturday morning at Mubarak's
presidential palace in northeastern Cairo, the center said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit comes when violent clashes erupted in Jerusalem
and the West Bank between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli
police after Israeli right-wing Likud leader Ariel Sharon visited
Al-Haram Al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, in Jerusalem's Old City
on Thursday. The site is known as the Temple Mount to Jews.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to brief Mubarak on the latest tense
situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and its impact on
the peace talks with Israel, diplomats in Cairo said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Haram Al-Sharif houses Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the
Rock, Islam's third holiest site. The Israelis say it is the site
of the ancient Jewish Temple, the most sacred shrine of Judaism.
The control of sovereignty over the site lies at the core of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also expected to discuss the talks between
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators in Washington in the past three
days, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
No progress has been reported in the Washington talks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Calls on All Burundian Parties to Strive for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement, issued at the end of the open council meeting,
said, "The Security Council stresses that the key to achieving a
lasting peace in Burundi lies with the Burundian parties."
</P>
<P>
"It is convinced that compromise is the only means to reach
such agreement, and to this end urges all parties to work toward
resolving remaining differences over the peace accord, and to
proceed to its implementation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Two years of peace talks, mediated most recently by former
South African President Nelson Mandela, ended on August 28 with a
power-sharing agreement between the ethnic Hutu and Tutsi
political parties and the Burundi government of President Pierre
Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony in Arusha, Tanzania, brought together
representatives of 10 Tutsi parties, seven Hutu political groups,
the government and the army. But Mandela's efforts have been
hampered by the rebels' refusal to sign a cease-fire until what
they term political prisoners are released. At a follow-up summit
in Nairobi, Kenya, regional leaders gave the government and rebels
30 days to sign the cease-fire or face unspecified international
action.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is encouraged by the engagement of
regional states," the statement said. "It urges them to continue
their efforts, especially to use their influence to draw the armed
groups firmly into the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Security Council, Mandela voiced his confidence
in the peace process in Burundi, but said there is still a lot of
work to do before all the parties, including armed rebels, are
ready to implement a peace accord aimed at ending the seven-year
civil war in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"I am supremely confident that, whatever the problems lay ahead,
there will be a solid peace and stability in Burundi," he said. "
There is still a lot of detail and implementation that the parties
would wish to pursue and which they should resolve among
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Opening the Security Council meeting, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan hailed the August 28 Arusha Agreement as "a
comprehensive blueprint for the reform of Burundian society," but
he also acknowledged "a number of obstacles" to its implementation
to restore peace and stability in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Before the convocation of the open Security Council meeting,
Annan met with Mandela and exchanged views on the difficult part
in the implementation of the peace accord, including the power-
sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
But as Annan and Mandela were meeting behind closed doors at
the U.N. headquarters in New York, at least 18 civilians, among
them two women and two children, were killed Friday during clashes
between Burundi's ethnic Hutu and the army on the outskirts of the
nation's capital of Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Fighting intensified since the signing of the Arusha Agreement,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council condemns all attacks on civilian
populations," the statement said. "It remains deeply concerned at
the continuing levels of violence in Burundi, in particularly that
perpetrated by rebel groups, despite the call made to them for
direct negotiations with the Burundian Government to secure a
lasting cease-fire agreement."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said, "the Security Council remains
deeply concerned at the dire economic, humanitarian and social
conditions in Burundi and calls on all parties to cooperate fully
with nongovernmental organizations and international organizations
involved in the implementation of the agreement."
</P>
<P>
The council "urges all concerned to ensure that former camp
inhabitants are protected, respected and enabled to return
voluntarily and in safety and dignity to their homes," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council stands ready to consider practical ways
in which it can best support the peace process," the statement
said. "To this end, the council requests the secretary-general
urgently to report to it on specific actions the United Nations
can undertake in the consolidation of peace and economic recovery
in Burundi."
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Burundi began in 1993 when paratroops from the
Tutsi-dominated army assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, a member of the Hutu ethnic
majority. More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been
killed since then in attacks by the army and rebels.

<HEADLINE> More British Troops to Withdraw from N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The British army said Friday
that it was planning to withdraw another 5,500 soldiers from
Northern Ireland provided the security situation continued to
improve.
</P>
<P>
It also has plans to cut the number of military bases in the
province from the current 64 to no more than 20.
</P>
<P>
The army said the timetable for the security reduction would
depend on an assessment of the threat from paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came within days of republicans launching a
new diplomatic offensive aimed at speeding up demilitarization in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Two leading members of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, began briefing foreign diplomats in Dublin
about what they said was a lack of progress by the British
government on scaling down the military presence in the province.
</P>
<P>
The number of British armed force personnel in Northern Ireland
now stands at 13,500 -- the lowest in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense confirmed plans to cut the numbers to 8,
000 at some stage in the future, depending on the long-term
security assessment.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the violence in Northern Ireland there were an
estimated 30,000 troops on duty.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry's long-term plan to scale down the
military presence came as Northern Ireland's police chief Sir
Ronnie Flanagan announced moves to demolish six military bases on
the Irish border.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazil considers essential
the oil market stability for the growth of the world trade and
economy, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso made the speech as he welcomed his Indonesian
counterpart, Abduhrrahman Wahid, who arrived in Brazil Thursday
for a one-day visit. He said that an excessive rise of the prices
of hydrocarbon will damage in a bigger measure the developing
countries. The Brazilian government followed with special
attention the summit of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), of which Indonesia is now a member, held in
Caracas, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president also said during his meeting with Wahid
that the two countries with the biggest extensions of tropical
jungles in the world will benefit greatly if the exchange of
experiences in the study of agriculture and tropical medicine is
increased.
</P>
<P>
"We have natural resources and the scientific production
capability, and we only need to explore the potency of energy
existing in our countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso also insisted in the continuity of the work of the new
Indonesian government to end the conflicts in Eastern Timor. He
underscored the need of actions that will prevent the repetition
of such episodes like the one of Atambua, when three U.N.
officials died.

ATHENS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nine more bodies were
recovered Friday night, bringing the death toll from the ferry
accident off Greece's Aegean island of Paros to 75, with three
persons still missing.
</P>
<P>
The nine bodies were found from the shipwreck site and were
transported to the port of Paros, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 456 people have been rescued of the more than 500
passengers and crew members aboard the 34-year-old vessel, which
rammed into a rock and sank near Paros Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and the country's supreme
court public prosecutor Panagiotis Dimopoulos agreed Friday that
judicial procedures and investigations should be processed as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Promising to bring those responsible to justice, Greece has

was steering the vessel at the time of the shipwreck, and cadet
George Patilas for their role in the accident.
</P>
<P>
The four persons will appear in court on the island of Syros
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Western Sahara Inconclusive: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The talks in Berlin Thursday under the auspices of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's personal envoy James Baker III "was
again inconclusive," Spokesman Fred Eckhard said, adding that
Baker will make his recommendations to Annan as to whether there
should be a follow-up meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief would have to determine the status of the peace
process and whether it has any prospect of moving forward, Eckhard
said. "We are not in a position now to fully assess this latest
round," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Baker met with both sides to resolve the multiple problems
relating to the implementation of the settlement plan for Western
Sahara and to try to find agreement on a mutually acceptable
political solution to the dispute, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deployed a peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara in
1991 with an aim at holding a referendum to allow the people of
the territory to decide between independence or integration with
Morocco. The mission's mandate ends in October.
</P>
<P>
Western Sahara was administered by Spain until 1976. Since then
the U.N. has been seeking a settlement for the north-west African
territory whose neighbor Morocco has a claim to it. Frente
Polisario has opposed the claim.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said Friday that he will visit Iran next year.
</P>
<P>
"Iranian President Mohamed Khatami officially invited me to
visit Iran next year, and I, of course, accepted the invitation,"
Chavez told the press, without mentioning a date, after visiting
with his Iranian counterpart two historical sites in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
Khatami arrived in Venezuela Tuesday to attend the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Heads of State and of
Government Second Summit, held in Caracas Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president extended his visit to the Venezuelan
capital, which had not been foreseen in the official agenda, until
Friday, and visited the house of liberator Simon Bolivar and the
National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Chavez also said that a high-level Venezuelan-Iranian Joint
Commission was created to deepen the economic, political and
cultural cooperation, which will officially meet at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said during his visit to the historical sites that his
government is willing to collaborate widely in all the fields with
Venezuela, one of its 10 partners in the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to collaborate widely in all the cultural,
commercial and political fields," said Khatami after his tour of
the House of Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president and his entourage left at 15:25 (1925 GMT)
for his country from the Maiquetia International Airport, 30
kilometers northwest of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
Khatami held a private conversation with Iraqi Vice-President
Taha Yasin Ramadan, the contents of which were not revealed to the
press, which could have great political significance because the
two countries fought a war between 1980 and 1988, and since then
they had not had almost any kind of relations.

<HEADLINE> Wireless Internet to Drive Voice Systems, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Wireless Internet will be
a big driver for voice recognition systems which enable users to
use voice and data via wireless networks, a U.S. research firm
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Advanced speech/voice systems, new industry standards, the
global expansion of wireless subscribers and the globalization of
content for users using a variety of languages are all factors
contributing to the growth of the speech recognition industry,
according to Allied Business Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Voice XML, the new essential standard that has made Internet
content and information accessible via voice and phone, has opened
the way for a new type of commerce -- voice-commerce, the
researcher said. Users will be able to make purchases and
transactions by using just their voices.
</P>
<P>
The computer language Voice XML is an extension to XML that
defines voice segments and enable access to the Internet via
telephone and other voice-activated device.
</P>
<P>
Voice portals will provide easier Internet access for both
fixed and mobile users. According to the firm's study, fixed voice
portal users in North America will climb from 4 million in 2001 to
17 million in 2005, and mobile voice portal users will grow from
about 1 million users in 2001 to over 56 million by year-end 2005
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Voice portals could well become a new form of interactive car
radio. Commuters could select their news, answer their e-mail or
do their grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a group of voice technology experts from IBM, HP and
other companies gathered at the Silicon Valley World Internet
Center to discuss voice-driven enterprise applications for the
market in the next year. They predicted that in the next few years
most people accessing the Internet, particularly globally, will
not do so using a standard PC, but through wireless phones and
personal digital assistants (PDAs). Since these new Internet
devices are not conducive to extended typing, many experts believe
that voice technologies will have to be deployed.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Open Cooperation Office in Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement, signed by DPRK Ambassador to Italy Kim Hung Rim
and the Italian Development Cooperation vice-director Attilio
Massimo Ianucci, signifies a further step in strengthening
diplomatic ties between the two countries which began earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
In January, Italy was the first G7 country to establish
diplomatic relations with the DPRK, a move which was followed up
in March by Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's official
visit to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Friday's agreement outlines the powers of Italian non-
governmental organizations involved in the cooperation program and
an Italian resident expert will leave for DPRK shortly to oversee
the operation.
</P>
<P>
The assistance program will include financing for UN's Food and
Agricultural Organization's (FAO) food projects and general
agricultural, health and education initiatives including cash
injections to boost technology and banking sectors.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Expects Smooth Transition in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori said Friday that he expected a smooth transition for the
upcoming presidential election in his country under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
"The priority now is the electoral process," he told reporters
after his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that under my leadership, as was my undertaking for
this electoral process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori arrived in Washington Thursday to attend a meeting of
the Organization of American States (OAS). He agreed to announce
on October 15 the date for next year's legislative and
presidential elections after five hours late Thursday of talks
after the OAS meeting.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said he met with Albright earlier in the State
Department and had "a conversation which I consider more than
cordial, very pleasant."
</P>
<P>
He also spent less than 30 minutes at the White House in talks
with National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said the most important thing was to guarantee "
stability and democracy" in Peru.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials downplayed the concern of further instability in
Peru, focusing instead on the presidential and legislative
elections next year.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to President Fujimori is to work with the OAS on
strengthening and deepening democracy in Peru, and working on a
democratic transition that will lead to the elections," said White
House spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Fujimori's visit to the OAS and the
meetings with Albright and Berger were seen as an attempt to
bolster support at home and abroad for his transition plans.

<HEADLINE> Greece Closely Watching Developments in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece is closely watching the
developments in Yugoslavia following both President Slobodan
Milosevic and opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica failed to
obtain a majority of the votes required in the first round of the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching closely and with particular attention post-
election developments in Yugoslavia," Foreign Ministry spokesman
Panayotis Beglitis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Greece's sensitivity on democratic developments in Yugoslavia
was known, as well as the initiatives Greece had undertaken in
this direction, the spokesman said, adding that Athens was ready
to undertake again similar initiatives in cooperation with all the
interested parties in that country, with their European partners
and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's Federal Electoral Commission announced that the
second round of presidential elections would take place on October
8, but Kostunica has refused to enter the presidential run-off
because he insists that he has gained more than 50 percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Greece's appeal for him to participate in the second
round of presidential elections, Kostunica Friday called on Athens
to contribute its efforts to secure a recount of last Sunday's
ballots.

<HEADLINE> Few Italians Represented in Int'l Financial Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy is "undoubtedly under-
represented" in international financial institutions such as the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Italy's
Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Umberto Vattani said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the International Organizations Forum, Vattani
stressed that considering Italy's economic commitment and level of
participation, the number of Italians working for major
international organizations is paltry.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian Foreign Ministry estimates, Italians make
up 6.2 percent of the total of employees working in a sampling of
50 international organizations, but that number drops to a slim 2
percent when tallied for the biggest financial movers and shakers
such as the World Bank and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Vattani stressed that Italy is becoming an increasingly
important protagonist in global politics, and that this was
evidenced clearly in the country's steadfast commitment to
resolving the crisis in the Balkans, and especially in Kosovo and
Albania.

Packard, Lucent Technologies and Intel.
</P>
<P>

rose as well.

of smaller companies was down 2.44 at 521.37. But the American
Stock Exchange index rose 14.51 at 954.31.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange with 1,480 up, 1,437 down and 431
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.12 billion shares from 1.18 billion
