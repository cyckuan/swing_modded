<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- New Vietnamese Foreign Minister

create a peaceful and favorable environment for his country's
socio-economic development, industrialization and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his meeting with foreign media in Hanoi on Thursday,
Nien stressed that the major issues the Vietnamese diplomacy is
being faced with in the first decades of the new century are
integration of Vietnam and international, relationship with big
countries and neighboring countries, traditional ties with the non-
aligned movement.
</P>
<P>
Nien, assumed the current position last January, said that it
is necessary to properly deal with four major relations: relation
between integration and preserving the national true qualities,
relation between integration and maintaining security and
stability for development, relation between the scope and the
depth of integration and relation between Vietnam's own interests
and its contributions to humankind.
</P>
<P>
The new foreign minister stressed that Vietnam's diplomacy
would bring into full play Ho Chi Minh's thought regarding a
diplomacy of peace, friendship, benevolence, righteousness and
faithfulness.

<HEADLINE> Three-day Strike in Bangladesh Comes to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The three-day countrywide hartal
(general strike) enforced by the opposition alliance ended
Thursday with reports of the death of one person and several
incidents in some parts of the country during the period.
</P>
<P>
A worker of the ruling Awami League was gunned down during the
hartal hours Wednesday in Chittagong, the second largest city in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, at least 25 people, mostly with bomb injuries,
were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital over the last
three days.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a total of 20 persons from different parts of
the country including Dhaka city for violence during the hartal
period.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance led by Bangladesh Nationalist Party
enforced the countrywide hartal with simultaneous blockade of road,
rail and waterways, pressing for immediate annulment of the Public
Safety Act and resignation of the government.
</P>
<P>
As part of stringent security measures, the government deployed
adequate number of police and other para-military forces in the
capital city and elsewhere of the country.
</P>
<P>
Most of the industrial belts in the country reportedly were
open with their usual production during the hartal period.
</P>
<P>
A good number of banks and other financial institutions were
seen open in Dhaka as well as other parts of the country during
the last three days.
</P>
<P>
Air, rail and water traffic were on normal operation on
respective routes to and from Dhaka during the period, according
to official sources.

<HEADLINE> India, France in Favor of Multipolar World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- multipolarity or
polycentrism had to be the alternative trend in the world and the
logic of globalization leading to uniformity, thus to unipolarity,
was a "sterile pursuit," Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant
Singh stressed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on "India, France and the multipolar world" held
here, Jaswant Singh said that the setback at Seattle, reluctance
to appreciate regional and global implications of pursuing a
national missile defense policy, use of sanctions and NATO's
actions in Kosovo were some of the more recent examples of the
validity of the perception of the U.S. approach.
</P>
<P>
"Since there is a perception, also perhaps reality that U.S.
action is often driven by its own, short-term, domestic agenda and
interest... the U.S. approach gets to be perceived by other
countries as an attempt at imposition of its values and standards--
whether on human rights, nuclear and missile proliferation,
multilateral trade issues and intellectual property rights," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the United States has emerged as the pre-
eminent global power, he said, "it has also become equally clear
that the United States alone cannot find solutions to most major
international issues facing us, whether in the area of security or
economic or institution building."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visiting French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, who
arrived here earlier Thursday, described the United States as a "
hyperpower," noting that Paris was determined to work for a
multipolar world since the unipolar system has become "excessive,
questionable and has negative implications."
</P>
<P>
He also endorsed India's view that the U.N. Security Council
must be reformed to make it more representative of today's
realities and enable it to provide a link between the multipolar
world and the multilateral system.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Second Match in Thomas Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men's badminton
team beat Hong Kong,China 5-0 in the Group X and moved into the
second round of the Thomas Cup World Championship Asian Zone
Qualifier on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which won a rather hard game against
Thailand, met little resistance from Hong Kong Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hong, who lost 0-2 to an obscure Thai player in China's
opening match on Wednesday, continued to play the first singles
match and beat his opponent, world 25th ranked Tam Kai Chuen, 15-
17, 15-9 and 15-7.
</P>
<P>
"I played much better and with much more confidence today and
displayed my strong points," said a sweat-soaked Chen after the
match. "But I was a bit too conservative after I took the lead in
the first game."
</P>
<P>
The comment on his performance from his coach was "just so so".
Hong Kong didn't find any chance in the following four matches,
losing all of them 0-2 and giving China a comfortable 5-0 win.
</P>
<P>
With two consecutive wins in the 4-team Group X, China has
been assured to qualify from the group as its number one, though
they still have to play Chinese Taipei on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei, crippled by the absence of the top singles
player Fung Permadi due to an unexpected arm injury, was beaten by
Hong Kong (2-3) on Wednesday and Thailand (1-3) by press time)
Thuesday night and has completely lost the hope to advance into
the Thomas Cup finals due in May in Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, China beat top-
seeded Indonesia 3-2 in the Uber Cup qualifier Group X on Thursday,
creating the biggest surprise on the courts of the Indira Gandhi
Indoor Stadium since the opening of the qualifier last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Headed by world 32th ranked Ling Wan Ting and world 115th Wang
Chen, the Hong Kong women, who beat Chinese Taipei 3-2 in their
first match in Group X, made a bold yet carefully-planned
challenge to the defending runner-up.
</P>
<P>
Ling and Wang each won a singles match and joined their hands
to seal their team's final victory by winning the fifth doubles
match, all at a game score of 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the other two matches easily by 2-0 both.
</P>
<P>
"We were very surprised to win and of course very happy," said
coach of Hong Kong Chan Chi Choi after the match. "It's the first
time we've beaten Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
Describing the opponent as a "very inexperienced" team, Chan
said that his team had adopted a very successful strategy by
banking upon winning two of the singles and one of the doubles.
</P>
<P>
"I found my players in fairly good shape after they beat
Chinese Taipei yesterday, and based on my observation of the match
Indonesia played against India yesterday, I also found there was
some chance for us to beat them today," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, after leading Chinese Taipei 3-0 after the first
three singles matches, Hong Kong let the opponents take the rest
two doubles matches to give their own players enough rest for
Thursday's clash, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Hong Kong has been secured the number one position
in Group X, we will try our best to bring our team into the Uber
Cup finals," added Chan.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong entered the finals of the last two Uber Cup
championship for being the host of the games.
</P>
<P>
In other matches of the Thomas Cup qualifier, Japan beat
Singapore 5-0; the Republic of Korea beat India (3-1 by press time)
.
</P>
<P>
In the Uber Cup qualifier, Chinese Taipei beat India 5-0; DPRK
Korea beat Singapore 5-0 and Japan edged Thailand 3-2.

<HEADLINE> Unicef Pledges Support to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (Unicef) on Friday reiterated its continuing support to
education, water supply, sanitation and health programs in
Mozambique, particularly the fight against the lethal disease
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Unicef executive director Carol Bellamy, at the end of her
three-day visit to Mozambique, said that her institution
established the fight against HIV/AIDS as a priority.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that Unicef is worried about the situation created
by AIDS, which orphans thousands of children, reduces the number
of teachers, and has a major impact on the economy, since it
mostly affects people who are economically active.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that though war will continue to claim many
lives in Africa, particularly in those countries still facing
armed conflicts, such as Angola and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, HIV/AIDS still heads the list of the causes that shorten
children's lives.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also announced that the program for education of girls,
 carried out by Unicef and so far restricted to the central
province of Zambezia, will be extended to the rest of the country.
The program aims to reduce the number of girls dropping out of
school and close the gender enrolment gap.
</P>
<P>
As for the current flood emergency in southern and central
Mozambique, Bellamy said Unicef has responded to the appeal by
the Mozambican government for support to the flood victims, by
donating 40 tons of emergency medicines to the Health Ministry,
and it has hired a helicopter to assess the situation in Gaza
province.
</P>
<P>
Unicef has also offered 75,000 litres of fuel for the flights,
and has distributed 200,000 public information leaflets on
malaria, chlorine to purify water, and cleaning materials for the
schools affected by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Calls for Clear Benchmark for Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank on Friday to clarify conditions to be met for benefiting from
the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief initiative.
</P>
<P>
He told visiting British parliamentarians that there is need
for the IMF and the World Bank to set clear rules which the
indebted countries pursuing the HIPC could follow.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we think we have qualified for the HIPC initiative
and the moment we make a move from one point to another, we are
told by the IMF and the World Bank that we did not satisfy the
benchmarks," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a rule to know whether we are right or wrong but
if conditions keep on changing, it becomes increasingly difficult
for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba welcomed IMF's advocacy for poverty
reduction with mixed feelings, wondering how the same
organization advocates poverty reduction while it is opposed to
improved salaries for civil servants.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran's Parliamentary Poll Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian elections headquarters
Friday evening announced the deadline of the sensitive
parliamentary polling was extended by two hours due to the massive
turnout of the people.
</P>
<P>
The poll was scheduled to end at 1900 hours local times (1530
GMT), but long queues were still seen at polling stations at the
deadline, the headquarters said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Iranian voters, who were believed to be showing their strong
support for the moderate President Mohammad Khatami and the
reformist factions, showed a massive turnout.
</P>
<P>
The poll kicked off at 0900 local times (0530 GMT), with long
queues seen in many polling stations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Like the presidential elections in 1997, many elders and women
also turned out to cast ballots in favor of the reformists.
</P>
<P>
Both the two rival reformist and conservative factions pinned
great hope on the elections. The moderates expected to take over
the powerful legislative body to push forward the political reforms
initiated by President Khatami while the conservatives vowed to
safeguard the Islamic values and principles.
</P>
<P>
Over 38.7 million peopel aged above 16 out of the total
population of 63 million are eligible to cast their votes in the
poll and over 5,000 candidates are running for 290 seats in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the moderate coalition of reformers and
centralists would be able to win the poll.

<HEADLINE> Cisco to Create 2,400 Jobs in Ottawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. high-tech giant Cisco
Systems Inc. has decided to add 600,000 square feet to its Ottawa
center and create 2,400 jobs, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The San Jose-based company suggested Thursday that 600,000
square feet "will be built over the next three years," a source
close to Cisco's expansion plans was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
While Cisco won't reveal how much it intends to spend on
expanding its Ottawa complex, the total value could reach 90
million Canadian dollars (about 62 million U.S. dollars), said Bob
Perkins for Canderel Management Inc., which is building Cisco's
new facility.
</P>
<P>
The expansion is a direct hit to Canada's Nortel Networks Corp.
which announced the spending of 260 million Canadian dollars (
about 179 million U.S. dollars) earlier in the week to add 3,600
jobs, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The competition in the fibre-optics market is also joined by
Lucent Technologies Inc. of Murray Hill, New Jersey. The company
has also said this week that it will spend more than 20 million U.
S. dollars to hire 500 people.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday met in a closed meeting to discuss the current
situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) while African
nations are lobbying to get thousands of U.N. peace-keepers into
the central African country to save the peace process in the war-
torn country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as the 15-nation body is expected to vote
next week on the draft resolution which intends to send 500
military observers and more than 5,000 peace-keepers into the
African country.
</P>
<P>
However, some Security Council members, including the United
States, want to be certain that fighting has stopped and there
really is a peace to keep.
</P>
<P>
Despite a cease-fire agreement signed last summer in Lusaka,
capital of Zambia, by warring parties, repeated violations have
been reported from the country, formerly known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
As an initial step, the Security Council last August
authorized the deployment of 90 military liaison officers to
countries involved in the conflict: Congo and its backers --
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, and its opponents, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, it took months to get 79 officers in the field, and
many have been barred from key sites, especially in government-
held areas.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to vote on the long-awaited
draft resolution, which, sponsored by the United States, calls for
military observers to monitor implementation and lay the
groundwork for possible deployment of a much larger U.N. peace-
keeping force, which is called for in the Lusaka Agreement.
</P>
<P>
But there is still uncertainty about when the military
observers will arrive in DRC. And the Security Council was very
vague about the deployment of peace-keepers, saying in late
January that it intends to consider preparations "at appropriate
time."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Rises to All-Time High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year's trade deficit was up a sharp 65.1 percent from a
1998 deficit of 164.3 billion dollars, the previous record.
</P>
<P>
For December, the trade deficit narrowed a slight 5.7 percent
to 25.5 billion dollars as exports rose by 3.2 percent, outpacing
a 1 percent gain in imports.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance for the year reflected a huge 33.7 percent jump
in U.S. foreign oil bill as world prices climbed from 9.19 dollars
at the start of the year to 22.67 dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the 1999 trade deficit in the United States
reflects the lingering impact of the 1997-98 world economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. farmers and manufacturers suffered from the loss of
overseas markets, U.S. consumers reaped the benefit of a flood of
cheaper goods coming into this market.
</P>
<P>
There are glimmers of hope that the U.S. deficits may stop
increasing in the months ahead, analysts said. Exports have
started to post monthly increases after falling for a long period
in the wake of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
For the year as a whole, exports managed a 2.7 percent gain to
a record 958.5 billion dollars after suffering a 0.5 percent
decline in 1998 at the height of the Asian crisis. Exporters have
reported rising demand in recent months as the hardest-hit Asian
countries such as South Korea and Thailand begin to mount
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
However, last year's gain in exports was swamped by a 12
percent rise in imports, which shot up to a record 1.23 trillion
dollars, led by the 33 percent increase in oil imports, which
climbed to 65.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
By country, U.S. deficit with Japan set a record imbalance of
73.9 billion dollars, up 15.5 percent from a 64 billion dollars
deficit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Other record deficits were with Canada, at 32.1 billion dollar;
Mexico, 22.8 billion dollars; and the 15-nation European Union, 43.
7 billion dollars.

the DRC issue, saying that the United Nations was anxiously
awaiting the adoption of a Security Council resolution which would
authorize the deployment of the peace-keeping force in DRC.
</P>
<P>
But the international community had to understand, Annan
stressed in the message, that this relatively small United Nations
force, with its "very restricted" mandate, would not be able to
guarantee protection of the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
"I stress this point because I do not want people serving
under the United Nations flag, and doing their best to carry out
the mandate given them by the Security Council, to be held
responsible for circumstances beyond their control," he said. "The
Member States of the United Nations must not blame us later for
failing in tasks they neither equipped nor mandated us to perform.

It said the events exposed by the investigation would not have

"Systematic management failure" allowed individual workers to
falsify qualify assurance records for reprocessed plutonium bound
for Japan, the NII added.

Speaking after delivering the report, NII chief inspector

workers not following procedures and deliberately falsifying
records to avoid doing a tedious task."

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebel Commander Raduyev Reportedly Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry is looking into the report that
Raduyev has been killed in a special operation by Russian elite
units in the Nozhai-Yurt administrative district of Chechnya, said
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
"This information is currently being clarified and verified," a
Defense Ministry source said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry has declined to officially verify
Raduyev's death.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federal Security Service's (FSB) department on
Chechnya said that it is examining information about Raduyev's
death.
</P>
<P>
Salman Raduyev, the son-in-law of first Chechen president
Dzhokhar Dudayev, became well known in January 1996, when his
squad raided Dagestan and held the village of Pervomaiskoye for
several days.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev is one of the most irreconcilable Chechen field
commanders in his attitude towards Russia and has constantly
threatened that country. According to Raduyev, it was by his
order there was a blast at the Pyatigorsk (Stavropol region)
railway station in April 1997, which resulted in casualties.
</P>
<P>
In January 1999 the Russian Interpol bureau declared 80 Chechen
terrorists involved in 10 criminal cases internationally wanted,
among them Raduyev.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev has undergone two complicated surgical operations, once
after he was injured in March 1996, and again in January 1999. In
February 2000, according to the FSB, he was injured in southern
Chechnya when the federal forces fired upon his squad.

<HEADLINE> Putin Stresses to Clinton Importance of Russian-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin emphasized the importance of Russia-U.S. relations
in a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, calling the
improvement of bilateral ties "a top Russian foreign policy
priority."
</P>
<P>
Putin made the remarks in his personal message to Clinton,
conveyed by Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov, who
is currently on a working visit to the U.S. and met with the U.S.
state head Friday, reported Russian media.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, a great deal of irritability and mutual
criticism has cropped up lately in the Russian-American dialogue.
And yet, the most vital thing has been preserved -- understanding
of the strategic importance of the two countries' cooperation for
the world's fate in the 21st century," says the message.
</P>
<P>
The message, which is a response to Clinton's message of
January 30, also notes that, "The strategic goals of Russia and
the U.S. coincide, for the most part. They include the
strengthening of the international security and stability,
progress on the issue of disarmament, expanding the areas of
nuclear non-proliferation and counteraction against new
transnational challenges, most prominently in combating
international terrorism and organized crime."
</P>
<P>
Putin stated bilateral contacts and a meaningful dialogue
between Russia and the U.S. lie in two key fields, namely,
questions of disarmament and non-proliferation with a focus on
START-2 (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-2) and ABM(Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty) problems, and contemporary tasks of trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Chechnya, the acting Russian president said
the international community can make a constructive contribution
to solving the problem, by focusing on providing humanitarian aid
to the people who have suffered from militants for years.

<HEADLINE> Angola Reduces Port Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Angola government has
decided to reduce by 50 percent the port tariffs on the coasting
transportation in a bid to curb the skyrocketing prices of
consumer goods in the internal market, an official source said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made following an agreement reached by the
ministries of transport and finance, which did not mention more
details, according to the official news agency Angop.
</P>
<P>
Applicable to Angola's most important ports including ports of
Luanda, Namibe (southwest) and Lobito, located in the central
Benguela Province, the measure is part of the government's efforts
to curb the rising trend of the prices of consumer goods on the
internal market.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the rampant civil conflicts around the southwest
African country, Angola has to import most of the basic consumer
goods which are overpriced due to the high port tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also facilitate the circulation of the
locally manufactured goods among the production and consumer
centers, since the tariffs on long distance transportation have
also been reduced by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of transport and finance also stated that as
from now, only the goods imported by departments of the national
defense and police will be free to leave the ports before customs
charges are paid for.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Ruling Party Urged to Mobilize People for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday urged his ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) to capitalize on its success to
ensure people remain on its side in spite of the rejection of the
draft Constitution in a referendum last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"It is the people who, when mobilized, can speak loudest for
the party, strengthen our image and status and lead us to victory
in the elections," Mugabe said when officially opening the Zanu-PF
central committee's extra- ordinary meeting in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The president said the party must be re-vamped in preparation
for the parliamentary polls set for April, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We meet today ... to put in place an action program for the
elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The central committee meeting was expected to consider and
agree on a program for an aggressive election campaign in all
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is also Zanu-PF's President and First Secretary,
said there is need to adopt a practical and dynamic approach to
the elections and give people a sense of belonging to the party.
</P>
<P>
"We need to go back to the people and tap into their heroism
and determination, elements of revolutionary zeal that can make
them work had for the progress of their party, the government and
the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the results of the referendum had caused wild claims
such as that it signaled Zanu-PF's waning support.
</P>
<P>
About 54 percent of the 1.3 million people who voted in the
referendum rejected the draft while 46 percent approved it.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said suggestions that part of the "No" vote was in
protest against the economic hardships people are facing were
justifiable and as the ruling party they must resolve the concerns
of the people.
</P>
<P>
The president said acute shortages of essential commodities and
 escalating prices of basic commodities are disturbing.
</P>
<P>
It is also worrying that those in industry trusted to exercise
restraint in prices had abused the trust. The party and the
government should stop this exploitation of the people, Mugabe
urged.
</P>
<P>
"Time may have come for us to consider dependable measures of
price control for basic commodities in protection of the people,"
he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The East Asia Film Festival,
the first of its kind in Kenya or even in sub-Sahara, was
officially opened in the Kenyan capital Nairobi Friday.
</P>
<P>
The festival is jointly hosted by the Australian High
Commission, embassies of China, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines
and Thailand, and the Malaysian government trade commission to
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Ambassador to Kenya Morihisa Aoki presided over the

</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Kenya An Yongyu said in his opening
speech that at the film festival the Kenyans would be catered by
the peculiar cultural types and life styles in east Asia,
southeast Asia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
This event would also provide a good opportunity for Asian
countries and Kenya to learn from each other's culture and conduct
more exchanges, An said.
</P>
<P>
Katana Ngala, Kenyan Minister for Home Affairs, Heritage and
Sports, said that Kenya has signed cultural agreements with a
number of other countries, thus promoting the mutual understanding
and friendship between the Kenyans and the peoples of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this film festival would also make close cultural
contacts between Kenya and Asian countries and help Kenyans
further understand the culture and customs of the peoples of these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese film "Red River Valley", the winner of China's best
film award for 1997, was screened at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The film depicts the Chinese people, both of the Tibetan and
Han nationalities, uniting in resisting foreign aggression against
Tibet about a century ago.
</P>
<P>
During the eight-day festival, a dozen of films will be
presented, including "A Scene at the Sea" from Japan, "Daughter"
from Thailand, "The Miracle" from the Philippines, and "Love of
Salmah" from Malaysia.

NEW DELHI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- India Friday extended a 10
million U.S. dollar credit to Cambodia for use in agriculture and
agro-based services as the two countries signed four agreements
here, said an Indian External Affairs spokesman.

<HEADLINE> 6 Arrested in India in Connection with Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Six more persons have been
arrested in connection with issuance of passports to the hijackers
of the Indian Airlines Aircraft in Kathmandu on the basis of bogus
documents, police sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The six, including a postman, three passport office employees
and two police personnel, were arrested Thursday in Bombay, they
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the passport office employees received
the passport applications of hijackers along with false documents
and helped them by issuing the passports.
</P>
<P>
The postman was involved in delivering the passports directly
to the hijackers and obtained forged signatures on the
acknowledgment receipts while the two policemen issued false
reports regarding verification of addresses of the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
According to PTI, the six were remanded to police custody
Friday till March 3 by a local court in Bombay.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 0.2 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
January's small gain in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the
most closely watched inflation gauge, marked four months in a row
in which inflation stood at 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clothing prices fell 1.1 percent in January, the largest drop
since February 1989, while energy prices jumped by 1 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the core"
rate of inflation edged up 0.2 percent last month, matching many
analysts' predictions. That followed a slim 0.1 percent rise in
the core in December.
</P>
<P>
The report comes one day after the government said inflation at
the wholesale level was unchanged in January and that core
wholesales prices, excluding energy and food, actually fell 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Both inflation reports suggest that outside of the burst in
energy costs, most other prices remain in check.
</P>
<P>
The 1 percent rise in overall energy prices last month was led
by a 7.9 percent gain in fuel oil prices, the steepest increase in
four years. Gasoline prices rose 1.6 percent and natural gas
prices went up 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Production limits by oil-producing nations and increased demand
because of the cold weather accounted for the increase in energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, crude oil prices moved past the 30-dollar-a-barrel
mark for the first time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War nine
years ago as production cuts adopted by leading producers squeezed
world supply.
</P>
<P>
A rebound in energy prices was the main factor in pushing up
overall consumer prices last year by 2.7 percent, the biggest
increase since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last month, airfares actually fell by 1.4 percent despite the
increase in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food prices fell by 0.1 percent in January, the best
showing since March. Falling prices for vegetables, fruits, dairy
products and pork more than offset rising prices for poultry and
beef.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Take 1,000 Dollar Bill Out of Circulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada plans to phase out all
the country's 1,000 Canadian-dollar bank notes (about 689 U.S.
dollars each) within six years.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Department announced Thursday that the decision "
complements the government's new anti-money laundering bill, which
was introduced in December."
</P>
<P>
"Large-value bank notes make it easier to conceal large sums of
money for movement inside and outside the country," said Jim
Peterson, junior finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The bank notes, worth 1,000 Canadian dollars, account for less
than one-third of one percent of all the notes in circulation, but
10 percent of the value of those notes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of the big bills is estimated to cost the
government up to two million Canadian dollars (about 1.4 million U.
S.dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chechen War to End in One Month: Russian General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Defense Ministry
expects to end the military phase of the anti-terrorist operation
in the rebel republic of Chechnya within a month, Russian General
Staff deputy chief Colonel General Valery Manilov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Once the rebels have been defeated, a Defense Ministry
division, a brigade of interior troops, a border guard unit, and
units of other armed agencies will be permanently stationed in
Chechnya, Manilov told a news conference in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Manilov as saying that federal
troops have boxed in remaining rebels in the province's southern
mountains and the military campaign there is drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the final stage of the third phase of the anti-
terrorist operation and the whole of the military campaign will,
without a doubt, be over very soon,'' Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
Manilov gave some reasons for his optimism: Russian troops'
control of key mountain positions, the blanket monitoring of all
rebel movements, the collapse of the rebels' command and control
system, the sharp reduction of rebel-controlled territory, and
half of the estimated 7,000 remaining guerrillas are ready to lay
down their arms.
</P>
<P>
After nearly a five-month offensive against the Chechen
militants, Russia wrested control of all Chechnya's lowlands,
forcing the rebels into the icy highlands in the south. Federal
troops have also cut off rebel supplies and escape routes into
Georgia further south.
</P>
<P>
During the war, the rebels have lost over 11,000 men. And
federal forces killed 500 to 700 rebels in the period from
February 11 to 18, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
However, the general said that a total of 1,503 Russian
servicemen have been killed in the Chechen campaign with 50
missing and 4,587 wounded since the start of the anti-terrorist
operation in Dagestan and Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> New Boeing Plane Stages Airshow in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 757-300 landed in
Urumqi, today, the capital city of Xinjiang uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China as part of its world air show tour.
</P>
<P>
The 54.4-meter-long plane took off from Urumqi International
Airport and flew around the city in a demonstration flight that
lasted some 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The airplane was piloted by the Xinjiang airline company's
vice-president Zhao Liuan for a quarter of an hour. "This plane
is easier to operate in the cockpit than a Boeing 757-200," said
the fifty-two year Zhao.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 757-300 is 7.1 meters longer than the Boeing 757-
200 and has 20 percent more passenger space. There are 49 Boeing
757-200s in China.
</P>
<P>
 The Boeing 757-300 left the United States in February.
Before landing in China, the Boeing had been to Britain, the
Netherlands, Germany, Spain and other countries. In China, the
Boeing has chosen Urumqi, Chengdu, Beijing and Guangzhou as air
show locations.
</P>
<P>
 Boeing 757-300 is the world's most cost-effective single-
aisle, double-engine airplane, said Jack Gucker, Vice President of
Boeing Commercial Group, who led the world air show delegation.
</P>
<P>
The tour is designed to explore the global market, especially
at a time when its European rival, a four-nation Airbus consortium
is also trying to expand its operations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has purchased 503 airplanes, 67 percent of which
came from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The last Boeing air show in China was in October last year
when the company showed off its Boeing 717s in Beijing, Kunming,
Wuhan and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 757-300 has a maximum capacity of 6,420 kilometers,
or from Urumqi to Berlin, Germany or Jarkata of Indonesia, without
refueling, said Gucker.
</P>
<P>
The Condor airlines of Germany, the first operator of Boeing
757-300s, said it has become more competitive since it bought
several such airplanes in March last year.

<HEADLINE> China Confident in Its Fast Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China is confident in solving
the problems in its economic operations and maintaining rapid
growth for a considerably long period of time, a senior official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar for postgraduates on development in the
new century, Zeng Peiyan, ministers in charge of the State
Development Planning Commission, pointed that the most important
thing in keeping the economic growth momentum is to ensure
political and social stability in China.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that China has huge market potential. Readjusting the
country's industrial structure and spurring consumption will
contribute greatly to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's expected entry into the World Trade Organization will
help the country to make better use of both domestic and overseas
resources to promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As for the problems, Zeng said they mainly include a lack of
real demand, the slowdown in the increase of fixed asset
investment, irrational economic structure, difficulties in some
state-owned enterprises, increasing employment pressure and the
slow increase of farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, great efforts are needed to improve
the quality and efficiency of China's economy, speed up economic
restructuring, develop the western regions, promote urbanization,
pay more attention to education and science, and adhere to the
strategy of sustainable socioeconomic development.

<HEADLINE> Islamabad Deplores Indian Expulsion of Pak Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
Friday deplored the expulsion of three Pakistani diplomats by
India, saying the "unwarranted" action is "clearly intended to
heighten tensions and further strain relations between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
India expelled the three staff members of the Pakistan High
Commission in New Delhi on Friday for allegedly "indulging in
activities incompatible with their official status."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan lodged a strong protest with India
regarding "the uncivilized and inhuman treatment" meted out to two
officials of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, according
to a Foreign Office statement released here.
</P>
<P>
The two officials were picked up by the Indian intelligence
operatives on February 17 and kept in "illegal confinement" for
more than five hours, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"During this period they were severely beaten up and
extensively interrogated. The medical examination revealed that
one of the officials had suffered serious injury to his ear-drum,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Deputy High Commissioner to Pakistan was called to
the Foreign Office and a strong protest was lodged with him over
the above incident.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Pakistan also protested with India
on another related incident of harassment of a female officer of
the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi by the Indian
intelligence operatives on January 27.

<HEADLINE> WFP Appeals for $58M for Hungry Sudanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) Friday launched an international appeal for 58
million U.S. dollars to feed 1.7 million hungry Sudanese.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the needy are in southern Sudan, according to
WFP information office in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"Although the famine that hit southern Sudan in 1998 is over,
hundreds of thousands of southern Sudanese are still at risk of
hunger and malnutrition," Mohamed Saleheen, WFP country director
for Sudan, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
For the past year, in places where the rains were ideal for
cultivation, insecurity had driven people from their homes and
fields while in some other locations, floods had thwarted farmers'
attempts to cultivate and harvest a decent crop.
</P>
<P>
Limited access to affected people, for security reasons,
continue to strain WFP's work in monitoring population movements
and their food needs in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The WFP, a U.N. front-line agency in the fight against global
hunger, in the year 1999 fed more than 86 million people in 82
countries, including most of the world's refugees and displaced
people.

<HEADLINE> Assets of 2 Zambian Mines Sold to Foreign Consortium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia agreed to sell two big
mines, Mufulira Division and Nkana mine assets, to a foreign
consortium on Friday, marking an important stage in the conclusion
of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) Privatization
Program.
</P>
<P>
But, it was reported that the Zambian government will still
hold a special golden share which will provide Zambia with certain
rights exercisable in national interest due to the strategic
importance of these assets to the Zambian Economy.
</P>
<P>
The consortium comprises First Quantum Minerals Limited, a
mining company registered in Canada and listed on the Toronto and
Vancouver Stock Exchanges, and Glencore International AG, a metal
treatment and commodity trading company registered in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony for signing the mine sale agreement,
Zambian Minister of Finance and Economic Development Katele
Kalumba said the Mufulira Division and Nkana mine assets will be
vested at close in a new company to be known as Mopani Copper
Mines Plc (MCM).
</P>
<P>
MCM will be the investment vehicle for Glencore and First
Quantum which will together own 90 percent interest, leaving the
balance of 10 percent for ZCCM, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, by the year 2003, the combined
production for these assets will be in the range of 130,000 metric
tons of copper per annum and 2,200 metric tons of cobalt, as
against the 1998/99 levels of 75, 385 metric tons and 1,354 metric
tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the legal completion and
handover of all the remaining three core assets of ZCCM will occur
before the end of this quarter.
</P>
<P>
"It is our sincere expectation that the successful completion
of these transactions will lead to major developments in the
country's mining industry and the economy in general, to the
benefit of the Zambian people," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been making efforts in recent years
to privatize the southern African country's copper mines in order
to attract more foreign investment and advanced technology and
management as soon as possible.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 houses built
of mud in Botswana have been destroyed by the rains which have
pounded the country since the beginning of the year, South African
Press Association reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
So far, seven deaths have been reported due to the floods.
</P>
<P>
Some of the homeless have been arranged to live in schools and
community centers and the rest will be accommodated in tents,
Dineo Mogwe, Director of Botswana's National Disaster Preparedness
Committee, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the ground is saturated, which makes it difficult for
rescuers to successfully pitch the tents, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Though the local and international community have provided food
stuffs, blankets and tents, but more is needed.
</P>
<P>
"We still need 20,000 baskets of basic food stuffs, 6,500 tents
and 59, 000 blankets," Mogwe said.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan government has appealed to the international
community for help to combat the effect of the disaster, saying
that "the destruction is widespread and enormous."
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predicted that the rains are expected to
continue through to April.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Hold Meeting on AIDS in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will hold a meeting on HIV/AIDS in
Swaziland this weekend, the office of South African Health
Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The region should coordinate activities, including research
and strategies on HIV/AIDS," Tshabalala-Msimang said.
</P>
<P>
"Other relevant sectors should also be included in response to
the multi- sectoral nature of the epidemic," said the minister,
who is expected to attend the meeting designed to review progress
made in implementing a SADC HIV/AIDS plan.
</P>
<P>
The 14 SADC member states agreed last year to make more
resources available for the fight against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The SADC countries held a meeting last December and established
the Multi-Sectoral SADC HIV/Aids Task Force to refrain the disease
from spreading.
</P>
<P>
At the last SADC summit of heads of state and government in the
 Mozambican capital Maputo last August, a protocol was signed to
encourage cooperation among member states in addressing health
problems and challenges facing them.
</P>
<P>
The protocol deals with ways to better use of the health
resources to make a healthier population in the region.
</P>
<P>
A healthy population is critical for sustainable human
development and increased productivity in southern Africa which
continues to have high HIV prevalence rate.

<HEADLINE> Flood Water Rising in Southern Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The flood waters of the Limpopo
River are still rising at Xai-Xai, capital of the southern
Mozambican Province of Gaza, inundating outlying suburbs and
low-lying areas in the centre of the city.
</P>
<P>
Film shot from a helicopter by Mozambican Television (TVM), and
shown on the main news broadcast on Thursday night, clearly showed
the waters invading the Xai-Xai suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Xai-Xai is on the south bank of the river while the farmland on
the north bank has been swamped. Indeed in the TV footage, the
river seemed to stretch to the horizon with no sign of a north
bank.
</P>
<P>
In the centre of Xai-Xai, the flood waters have infiltrated
through the city's drainage and sewer systems. The area most
seriously threatened is the Mira-Rio zone, close to the city
council offices.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Gaza provincial directorates have already taken the
 precaution of moving equipment out of their offices, and taking
it to buildings on high ground.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the AIM (Mozambique News Agency)
Friday, officials in the office of Provincial Governor Eugenio
Numaio have also packed their bags and are preparing to evacuate
the buildings at any moment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, helicopter rescue missions are continuing in the
Limpopo Valley.
</P>
<P>
One unexpected complication is that some peasant families are
refusing to abandon their cattle. In Gaza traditional society,
cattle are the main form of wealth. TVM even reported cases in
which farmers asked the helicopter crews to airlift their cows to
safety.
</P>
<P>
There is no sign of an end to the drama on the Limpopo, since a
further flood peak is now moving down the river.
</P>
<P>
According to the Southern Regional Water Board (ARA-Sul),
between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning the height of the
river rose from 7. 61 to 7.98 metres.
</P>
<P>
This will almost certainly mean further flooding in the next
few days in the Chokwe region, and eventually in Xai-Xai.

<HEADLINE> Angola, Israel Sign Contract on Exclusive Diamond Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Angola and
Israel have signed a contract on the exclusive sale of diamonds to
the transnational Ascorp Company, informed sources said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the rough diamonds covered in the contract will be cut
and polished in Israel, which is considered as one of the most
important international diamond processing center, said the source
asking for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the Angolan government and the Israeli
 industrialist Lev Leviev are both partners of the Ascorp Company.
 Lev Leviev is responsible for processing the diamonds for Ascorp.
</P>
<P>
Only the diamonds extracted from the mines in the areas
controlled by the Angolan government are covered in the contract,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
The export of those diamonds should be authorized by the
Angolan government, under the terms of the U.N. Resolution 1173
which stipulates sanctions against the Angolan rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi's National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) rebels have been mainly financed by the illicit diamond
trade in their on-going war against the government led by
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry had
said that the agreement with Angola is part of the ministry's
strategy to ensure new sources of raw material, with the Angolan
diamonds as complement for those supplied by the South African De
Beers corporation.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of Israel's diamond imports in 1999 were
supplied by De Beers.

<HEADLINE> Doors for U.N. Inspectors to Iraq "Remain Closed:" FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohamed Said Al Sahaf said here on Thursday that the doors for U.N.
arms inspectors to Iraq "remain closed," Spanish local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf explained that the problem is not personally with Hans
Blix, Chairman of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission (UNMOVIC), but "what is wrong is the (U.N.) resolution
itself."
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.N. Resolution No. 1284 passed last December
unveiled the "dirty plot of the United State and Great Britain to
infinitely prolong" the nine-year international embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister recalled that when Blix, as the head
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), concluded his
last duty on the inspection of Iraq's alleged nuclear power and
failed to get clear evidence, he was asked by the Iraqi government
to report back to U.N. in a written form, but Blix answered with "
No" since "the United State would not care."
</P>
<P>
Urging an immediate end to the embargo against Iraq, Sahaf said
Washington and London's policy would only "hurt the innocent 22
million Iraqi people," and according to the 1996 U.N. resolution
on "oil for food," Iraq is entitled to import food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Spain, Sahaf exchanged views with his
Spanish counterpart Abel Matutes Y Juan on humanitarian supports
to Iraq. Spain is the only major Western country that continues
to keep diplomatic relations following the Gulf War.

NATO, and to establish a fair free-market economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Mesic said gaining access to EU and

President Franjo Tujman, who died of cancer in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mesic said Croatia is willing to develop relations with all
countries which regard Croatia as its partner, and to peacefully
co-exist with its neighboring nations, especially Bosnia-
Hezergovina.
</P>
<P>
On his domestic policies, Mesic promised to establish a stable
and open free market economy, create jobs for youth, provide
social security for Croatians and respect the rights of minority
ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>

and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Mesic said he will cooperate closely with the parliament and
the government to realize his promises.

<HEADLINE> Putin Protests Latvian Court Conviction of Russian Partisan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin on Friday protested the conviction by a Latvian
court of a former Russian partisan, Vasily Kononov. He urged Riga
to pardon the elderly communist who has been sentenced to jail for
"war crimes" during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Putin told journalists in the Siberian city of Irkutsk that he
had addressed his message of protest to Latvian President Vaira
Vike-Freiberga, asking her to intervene in the case.
</P>
<P>
Putin said his goal is to help veteran Kononov, who was "
unjustifiably sentenced by a Riga court."
</P>
<P>
Vasily Kononov, 76, was sentenced by Riga district court to
six years in prison on January 21 for his role in the killing of
nine people in 1944 when he was commander of a World War Two
communist guerrilla group in Latvia.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian "repressive apparatus is ever more frequently
targeted against fighters in the anti-fascist resistance," Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
He said "Moscow is prepared to grant Kononov Russian
citizenship so that he and his family can move to Russia," and all
necessary living conditions will be provided for them.

<HEADLINE> Education May Draw Hot Debate at Coming Conferences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- According to analysts,
education is expected to become a hot topic at the upcoming annual
conferences of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Last month, a 17-year old high school student killed his mother
with a hammer because she pressured him to improve his grades. The
incident sent shocking waves around the country.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Education, Chen Zhili, called for effective
measures to relieve the pressure of studies among primary and
middle school students soon after the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy and China's Education Inspector-General, Liu Bin,
said he would make a proposal at the upcoming conference to urge
everyone to take the issue seriously. "Basing student performance
entirely on exams is in dire need of change."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education this week released an urgent circular
to get rid of evaluating grades out of hundred and the practice of
listing the names of students according to their grades.
</P>
<P>
After a three-week long winter vacation, primary and middle
school students are returning to their classrooms with bags full
of books. The image of a student dragging a suitcase full of books
appeared on a popular program on China's Central TV Station. The "
People's Daily" carried an editorial recently calling for society
to provide support and guidance for primary and high school
students.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Ministry of Education showed that the
average Chinese teenager is shorter than their Japanese
counterparts. Analysts attributed this to the years of hard study
and lack of out door activities.
</P>
<P>
In a 1993 synopsis on education reform, the Chinese government
began to shift emphasis from an education based entirely on taking
examinations to focusing on other aspects of student performance
in schools.

<HEADLINE> Innovative Technology Vital to China's Economy in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- American Chinese Chang-Lin
Tien, a member of the U.S. National Science Board, said here today
that the application of innovative technology is vital to China's
fast economic development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The 7th Berkeley Chancellor of the University of California
made these remarks at a symposium for Chinese youth in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tien distinguished innovative technology from high
technology, saying that the former highlights "innovation."
</P>
<P>
"High-tech products are now competing in the world market
fiercely, computers chips for instance, but they are no longer
highly profitable as before," he said. "Instead, if you have a new
idea to apply the technology in basic industries, you may get high
returns."
</P>
<P>
He pointed four major conditions that will facilitate the
development of innovative technology: talented professionals from
various fields; adequate capital for investment in research and
development; cooperation between world-class universities and
corporations; and a clean and healthy environment.
</P>
<P>
He said China needs more talent in business administration
rather than in technology and more spending on research and
development.
</P>
<P>
The prominent scientist also said "If the problem of
intellectual property cannot be resolved, innovative technology
will not develop."
</P>
<P>
He argued that to make groundbreaking progress in the realm of
innovative technology, young people should not only be equipped
with advanced scientific knowledge, but also be able to broaden
their horizons and be able to apply what they have learnt.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tien is internationally recognized for his research in heat
transfer technology. He has received many honors including the Max
Jakob Memorial Award, the highest international honor in the field.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Voters Favor Reformers in Parliamentary Election by Rong Song, Liu Guoyuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian voters on Friday once
again showed their support for reformist President Mohammad Khatami
with a massive turnout and votes for the reformers.
</P>
<P>
"I came to vote for the reformers," a high school student told
Xinhua at the Husseinie Ershad Mosque in northern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Holding a candidate list of the reformist Islamic Iran
Participation (IIPF), she said that the reformers will surely win a
majority in the sensitive polling, which is believed to create a
new power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The student, who declined to give her name, expressed hope that
Mohammad Reza Khatami, the youngest brother of President Khatami,
would be elected future Majlis (parliament) speaker.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Khatami, a doctor-turned politician, has risen to
prominence as a leading reformist for the parliamentary election
and the IIPF has sought to make him the top winner in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The voting was officially kicked off at 0900 hours local time
(0530 GMT) and will last for 10 hours and can be extended to 12
hours if necessary.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 63 million, Iran has over 38 million people
above 16 years old who are eligible to cast their votes at over 36,
000 polling stations in 28 provinces across the country.
</P>
<P>
Both the reformers and the conservatives, who dominate the
country's most sensitive organs but suffered heavy setbacks in
recent years, pinned their hope on the polling.
</P>
<P>
A medical university instructor told Xinhua that the Iranian
young generation strongly support the newly-established IIPF
because the party knows the country very well and brings hope for
it.
</P>
<P>
"Although the IIPF is very young, but the members of the party
are skilled, I vote for them," the middle-aged woman said, showing
a list of the IIPF candidates.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF, which was formed in December 1998 after President
Khatami won an unexpected overwhelming victory over the
conservatives in 1997, has turned to spearhead the reformist
factions supporting Khatami's political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi, 78, told Xinhua after casting his vote that the IIPF
and his alliance would stand to win though centralist candidate
Hashemi Rafsanjani, former Majlis speaker and president, may be
elected the next Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
"I'm old, the country belongs to the young generation," he said,
pointing to college and high school students inside the mosque,
where the polling station is set.
</P>
<P>
A supervisor at the polling station said "I believe that the
incoming Majlis should be broad-based with the participation of
various factions, parties and groups. If the Majlis is controlled
by one faction or party, it will not be in the interest of the
country."
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would select 10 among the reformer
candidates , 10 among conservatives and 10 among independents.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,083 candidates are running for 90 seats in the
parliament, with 30 seats for the 581 hopefuls in the Iranian
capital city of Tehran alone.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 voters queued in the Seyed Naseroddin Mosque in southern
Tehran for casting their ballots, with many perusing candidate list
of the IIPF.
</P>
<P>
An executive official told Xinhua that the voters are very
active this year.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have cast their votes and more voters will come in
the afternoon after the Friday prayer," he said.
</P>
<P>
A religious student told Xinhua that he would vote for the
conservatives because they are devotees to the Islamic revolution
and Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Rafsanjani, the current chairman of the
powerful arbitral and advisory State Expediency Council, would be
the next Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
However, a 75-year-old woman expressed doubt that Rafsanjani
would be able to gain the post, which he had held for almost 10
years before being elected president in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"We can not predict that at this moment, but I believe the IIPF
will win," she said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Discontent With S. Africa's Appeal for Peace Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 18 (Xinhua)-- Secretary-General of Angola's
ruling party Friday accused some high-ranking South African
officials of urging the Angolan government to negotiate with
Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria's stand is contrary to that of the international
organizations of which South Africa is a member, including the
United Nations and the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), said Joao Lourenco, head of the ruling People's Liberation
Movement of Angola .
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is a member country of SADC. And it is known to
all that SADC's position of the Angolan civil conflict, which
condemns Jonas Savimbi, regards him as a war criminal and does not
advise the Angolan government to negotiate with Savimbi," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lourenco, Angolan President Jose dos Santos Monday
advised the South African government to pay more attention to
their own domestic problems instead of the internal affairs of
Angola.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa should worry about its internal problems and
leave Angola in peace," he quoted Santos as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that South African ministers of defense and
foreign affairs, along with former president Nelson Mandela,
recently criticized Luanda's choice of military option to end the
Angolan conflict and appealed for negotiations between the
government and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola.

<HEADLINE> Main Faction Leader Calls for Reconciliation Among Somalis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Main faction leader Ali
Mahdi Mohamed Friday urged the Somalis to forgive each other and
called upon the politicians to make concession for the sake of the
country which has not had a central government for nine years.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi made the call after landing at the Issaley airport,
about 15 kilometers northeast of the capital Mogadishu, where
hundreds of heavily armed militiamen and dozens of battle wagons
from various parts of the capital received him.
</P>
<P>
The faction leader returned home after nearly 10 months of
absence from the capital. He fled Mogadishu after some of his
security guards attacked his weapons store in his house and looted
his cache of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The Somalis should move forward by reconciling, leaving behind
those trying to oppose to all developments towards the
reestablishment of a government for Somalia, Ali Mahdi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not point his finger at any particular one
group.
</P>
<P>
He called on the political leaders to stop wrangling about for
political posts in the barbaric way and make their efforts to
rescue the Somalis from the current plight of lawlessness and
anarchy
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi pointed out that the political stagnation among the
Hawiyeh main community leaders is the main problem for Somalia's
crises, noting that the community should now work for the
formation of a unified leadership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about his role in the leadership, the faction leader
said it is not now time to lobby for a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
He commended the current efforts made by the traditional
leaders in trying to convene a Hawiyeh peace conference in
Mogadishu, which has been postponed for three times.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the proposed general reconciliation conference for
the Hawiyeh community remains unclear as most of the political
leaders have reportedly forwarded their opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Hawiyeh community leadership to be elected would represent
its people in the forth coming general reconciliation conference
for Somalia to be held in Djibouti on April 20 for the
establishment of a national government of Somalia, said Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
Before returning home, Ali Mahdi had stayed in Djibouti for
seven days during which he met with Djiboutian President Ismael
Omar Ghelleh and senior Djiboutian officials who are preparing for
the Somali reconciliation conference.
</P>
<P>
However, Ali Mahdi did not say a word about his meeting with
the Djiboutians nor about his ideas in helping the realization of
Djibouti's peace plan.

<HEADLINE> ITTF to Stick to Format of Separate World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Table
Tennis Federation (ITTF) may stick to their latest format of
having separate World Championships for individuals and teams to
reduce the burden on future host countries, ITTF President Adham
Sharara said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This formula seems the best way to give more opportunities to
smaller countries to host the world meet, he told reporters after
attending the ITTF Congress here in conjunction with the week-long
Dawei 45th world Team Table Tennis Championships which start here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch city of Eindhoven hosted the individual championships
last August.
</P>
<P>
The 45th world individual and team championships were supposed
to have been held in Belgrade last year but the political
situation in Yugoslavia forced the ITTF to split the events.
</P>
<P>
Sharara said: "We will propose the separate event like now. It
will be a yearly event with one year for individual and another
year for team event."
</P>
<P>
The future of the world championships which feature more than
100 teams will be discussed by ITTF members next Wednesday,
Sharara said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese women's team
still aim high to finish within top three despite the absence of
their top player Chire Koyama in the 45th World Team Table Tennis
Championships here which begin Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing to be worried about as being without Koyama,
because they can stil manage a formidable team to challenge the
top teams such as defending champions China and South Korea, women
's team coach Kenji Kondo said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Koyama, who is ninth in the latest world rankings, injured her
ankle when she fell during a training session nine days ago and
had to be replaced by an experienced veteran Ginko Haneyoshi.
</P>
<P>
The members of the team are mostly youngsters who are given
exposure to major tournaments and can take these opportunities to
prepare for future big ones, especially the 46th World
Championships in Osaka next year, he told reporters after a
training session at Putra Stadium here where the week-long
championships will be held.
</P>
<P>
"We are not targetting to win here but when we host the event
next year, I am sure we will be in a good position to regain the
crown. We will be more than happy if we can finish third behind
China and South Korea here," Kondo said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted China will clearly be the strongest team in the
meet and also South Korea, DPR Korea and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Japan's women team are in Group C with Germany, Croatia,
Yugoslavia, Italy and Slovak Republic.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Airlines in east
China has signed a contract with Canada's Bombardier Aerospace,
attached to the Bombardier Inc., to purchase three CRJ200 (
Canadair Regional Jet) planes for 68 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We will use the planes to develop the regional transport
market. It is as yet not practical and economical to use larger
airplanes," said Shanghai Airline President Zhou Chi today.
</P>
<P>
The CRJ200 has 50 seats and is designed for regional air
transport markets.
</P>
<P>
James Dailly, vice-president of the Asia/Pacific Sales for
Bombardier Aerospace, said that he is satisfied with their
business operations in China. His company has put China on top of
its Asian business expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Airlines was set up in 1985 with the Shanghai
municipal government and the Bank of China as its main share
holders. It is now operating 100 routes covering 35 cities
nationwide flying Boeing 767s, 757s and 737s.
</P>
<P>
Bombardier Aerospace, the third largest producer of civil
airplanes in the world, mainly builds planes with 20-70 seats.
</P>
<P>
Dailly said that the Shanghai Airlines is its third Chinese
client in less than one year. The other two are Shandong Airlines
and Shaanxi Chang'an Airlines, which ordered a total of eight
planes from the Canadian company last November and earlier this
year respectively.

<HEADLINE> Interview: WTO Chief Wishes China's Early Entry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has been bidding to join the WTO for the last 14 years.
It reached a bilateral agreement with the United States last
November, and is yet to strike a deal with the European Union (EU)
and some other WTO members before it can join.
</P>
<P>
As a new round of China-EU negotiations will begin soon in
Beijing, an important one that Moore wishes both parties succeed.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is working towards the same objective (China joins
the WTO this year)," he stressed. "That is, to get this thing
wrapped-up, finalized and through, and this year."
</P>
<P>
On the opportunities and challenges China will face after it
joins the WTO, Moore said that China's entry into the WTO will
give the country more opportunities for development, and will lead
to prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
However, the existing problems will not disappear as China
joins the WTO, he said. State-owned enterprises will have to
sharpen their competitive edge and some industries will face
enormous pressure.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries are also facing similar difficulties, Moore
said, adding that he believes that the talented Chinese people
will have a brilliant future.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's House Fails to Question Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives (DPR) working committee (Panja) failed Friday to
summon and question former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"We have been received by his oldest daughter Madame Tutut (
Siti Hardiyanti Indra Rukmana) and Soeharto's lawyers and medical
team, and we have been given information that Mr. Soeharto can't
be questioned due to his health condition," Chairman of the Panja
Sukowalujo Mintohardjo told reporters after meeting with Tutut at
Soeharto's residence.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was expected to meet with Panja Friday to reveal his
policy in disbursing Banking Liquidity Support (BLBI) to the
country's sick banks during his rule. But the 78-year-old man
failed to show up in the parliament building when the Panja was
waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
His medical team said that he has many problems with his
communication skill. After receiving such an explanation, the
Panja decided to go to Soeharto's residence to meet with him in a
bid to get comprehensive information in connection with the BLBI
scandal as well as verify his real condition.
</P>
<P>
"Madam Tutut has apologized because Pak harto (Soeharto) is not
able to give information about the matter (BLBI issue). We quite
understand her explanation due to Soeharto's medical reasons,"
Mintohardjo said.
</P>
<P>
Early this week the Attorney General Office also failed to
summon Soeharto and question him as a suspect in an alleged
corruption case, also due to Soeharto's medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said
that Soeharto may be detained for legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto is a suspect, and the legal code says that suspects
may be detained for legal reasons," Darusman was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Friday as saying, adding that his side will
then set up an appropriate medical team to verify Soeharto's true
health state.
</P>
<P>
After Soeharto was forced to step down in May 1998, he has been
under fire and highlighted by many parties both at home and abroad
in connection with his alleged responsibility for rampant
corruption in the country. But Soeharto has denied these
allegations.

Agreement and the Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Visiting French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told a press
conference that Paris would also like to appeal to India and
Pakistan to initiate confidence-building measures to avert a "new

</P>
<P>
He said that France would support any action or initiative
taken in the right direction.
</P>

"The current situation is dangerous," he said, adding "We hope
it will be possible to contain the current situation and overcome
it and nothing is done to worsen the situation."

The U.S. is worried over the situation, he said, "We are

France looked for "positive signals" from India, including New
Delhi signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and accepting
increasing controls for safeguard stipulated by the International
Atomic Energy Agency, the minister said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Privatization Goes Slowly in Rwanda's Hotel Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Privatization has been going
slowly in Rwanda's tourism and hotel industry with very little
money trickling in, an official with the Rwandan Privatization
Secretariat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
So far, only two hotels and three guest houses have been
privatized, said Ngabonziza Anselme, who is in charge of the
advocacy unit at the privatization secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"Six hotels and three guest houses formerly owned by government
were earmarked for privatization," the Rwanda News Agency quoted
the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Four hotels remain unsold for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan government opted for privatization of parastatals
given the fact that they had turned out to be more of a liability
than an asset," Ngabonziza said.
</P>
<P>
The privatization policy adopted in 1996 was aimed at
increasing production and avoiding corruption and poor management,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the policy has experienced a lot of
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to the government's commitment, more than 24
parastatals have been been divested.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry in Rwanda is greatly boosted by an
extensive shoreline on Lake Kivu, which stretches from Cyangugu in
the southwest to Gisenyi in the northwest.

LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo reaffirmed that his country deserves a permanent United
Nations Security Council seat in view of its contributions to the

<P>
Local media Friday quoted the president as saying that Nigeria

Nigeria believes in peace and security as vital elements for
economic growth and development, he said.

JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
and South Africa are to establish a cooperation council next month
to monitor implementation of a EU-South African free trade pact,
the Business Day newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The council, which should have been set up some time ago, was
set aside to allow resolution of the impasse hampering the
implementation of the bilateral free trade agreement, said Edwin

</P>
<P>
Smith said the council would also serve as a dispute resolution
 instrument if there were differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, EU and South Africa are set to resume talks next
month on the fisheries agreement which was suspended two years
ago, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries talks are among other meetings scheduled for next
month, which will conclude the wine and spirits agreement, EU

JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki and former president Nelson Mandela will head for
Tanzania next week to take center stage in face-to-face peace
talks between belligerents in Burundi, South African Press
Association reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's participation stemmed from his support for Mandela's
mediation efforts and desire to rid Africa of its wars,
presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are giving substantial support to the peace process in
Burundi," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela took over as Burundi mediator from late Tanzanian
founding president Julius Nyerere last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Mbeki's trip to the northern Tanzanian
town of Arusha is part of his vision to an African renaissance,
which is a long- term strategy to pull Africa out of a cycle of
decline and war.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's aids have repeatedly said regional wars ravaging Africa
would top South Africa's foreign policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha talks will bring together Burundi's Tutsi-led
military government, opposition parties and Hutu rebels fighting
to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time the rebels participate in the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Embarks on New Phase of Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has started the second phase of privatization of parastatal
sectors with a big challenge ahead.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the newly appointed Commission of the Parastatal
Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) here Friday, Minister of State for
Planning and Parastatal Reform Nassoro Malocho said the government
is gearing up for a challenging period in the restructuring and
divesting of public utilities and infrastructure parastatal in the
next phase of privatization.
</P>
<P>
The new commissioners and the entire PSRC staff are facing the
prime task of handling well the coming divestiture process to
ensure meaningful results, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of utilities and infrastructure sector is going
to be a complex, delicate and sensitive process politically,
socially and economically because the sector touches on the lives
of practically all Tanzanians, Malocho said.
</P>
<P>
Those to be dealt with in the coming phase include Dar es
Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority, Tanzania Harbors Authority,
Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited, Tanzania
Telecommunication Company Limited and Tanzania Railways
Corporation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is now in the seventh year of privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Originally the PSRC had been expected to wind-up the
privatization exercise by 1998, but following the slowness of the
process caused by various factors, the period has been extended.
</P>
<P>
"If all goes well," said Malocho, "the remaining parastatal
sectors are expected to be divested in the next four years."
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, about 295 parastatals have been
divested out of a total of 395 parastatals earmarked for
privatization in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hurdles and difficulties PSRC experienced during
the initial stage of the program have been dealt with to a large
extent and the future looks extremely bright, said Malocho.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that it will take a long time before the
economic gains of these reforms be felt and appreciated, noting
that it is important to sustain a strong commitment to the
restructuring process by all stakeholders so that the benefits to
the economy are realized within the shortest time possible.
</P>
<P>
The benefits will be in the form of increased production,
creation of more jobs, higher incomes, improved infrastructure,
access to public utilities, export markets and capital inflows, he
added.

HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks fell 382.07
points, or 2.25 percent, to close the week at 16,599.16 Friday, on
concerns over impact on banks and developers by another U.S.

</P>

</P>
<P>
Analysts said the blue chips were hit after U.S. Federal

perception that at least two interest rates increases may take
place this year.
</P>
<P>
Investors who took profit from companies that hit record highs

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains a center
for international arbitration since its return to the motherland,
said a senior official of the International Bar Association (IBA)
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"People understand that the Hong Kong International Arbitration
Center (HKIAC) is an independent body and I know that American
businesses are continuing to write arbitration in Hong Kong under
the auspices of the HKIAC into their contracts since the
resumption of China's sovereignty here in 1997," said David W.
Rivkin, chairman of the International Bar Association (IBA)
Committee on Arbitration.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the Third IBA International Arbitration Day
Conference, at which 150 representatives from 28 countries
discussed enforcement of arbitral awards.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration award is similar to a court judgment, but
unlike a court judgment in that the arbitrators do not have the
power to enforce the award and sometimes have to bring the case to
a court to enforce the award.
</P>
<P>
Rivkin attributed one of the main reasons why the annual
conference was held in Hong Kong to the high profile of the HKIAC
in the world of international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
"People continue to have confidence in conducting their cases
in Hong Kong. The numbers of arbitration conducted by the HKIAC
stay fairly stable," he said.
</P>
<P>
HKIAC, a non-profit body, was established in 1985 to assist
disputing parties to solve their disputes by arbitration and by
other means of dispute resolution.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sets Tough Conditions for Helicopter Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign companies that have
contested a Turkish 4-billion-U.S.-dollar gunship co-production
project were required to supply Ankara with precision-guided
missiles, guns and aerial rockets to equip the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
This will allow Turkey to have immediate operational readiness
and capability of destroying, for example, half a battalion enemy
tanks with one such attack helicopter, Turkish Daily News reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Defence Industries Undersecretariat required that the
bidding companies for the project must equip the helicopter with at
least eight precision-guided missiles, 20-30mm guns with a range of
4 kilometers, and 2.75-inch unguided aerial rockets.
</P>
<P>
All those systems must be able to be operational in extreme
climatic conditions, especially high temperature.
</P>
<P>
The project involves the co-production of 145 helicopters, with
an initial batch of 50 expected to cost 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Land Forces Command has also set a requirement,
asking the companies to lease 10 attack helicopters to Turkey in
order to meet its immediate demands.
</P>
<P>
Although Turkey added tough conditions to the tender, foreign
companies from the United States, Italy, France, Russian and Israel
have engaged in a fierce competition for the lucrative project and
made a variety of offers to Turkey in an attempt to increase their
chances of winning the contract.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Reform Value Added Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo Thursday said plans were underway to comprehensively
review the administration of the value added tax (VAT) regime in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Friday quoted the
president as saying that the move was aimed at improving the
administration of VAT in order to increase the yearly revenues
accruing from it to the three tiers of government in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was speaking at an audience with a
delegation from the Palm Oil Producers Association of Nigeria,
said since the VAT, which was an indirect form of taxation, was
apparently more acceptable to the populace than direct taxes, it
made sense to work toward higher levels of efficiency in its
administration.
</P>
<P>
He assured the delegation that the government would address
their complaints about past inconsistencies in fiscal policies of
the government, which they said had adverse effects on palm oil
production in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the present administration was doing everything
possible to revive the country's agricultural sector and the
production of cash crops like palm nuts, cocoa, cotton and rubber,
which formerly "contributed significantly to natural revenue."

KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States who are
here to attend the Dawei 45th World Team Table Tennis
Championships which opens Sunday are out to improve their rankings.
</P>
<P>
The Americans reckon they can improve their places with team
manager Bob Fox targetting an optimitic 20-25th placing for the
men and 10-15th placing for the women.
</P>
<P>
Their men were ranked 32nd women 25th based on the final
placings at the last World Team Table Tennis Championships in
Mancester two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Fox said to improve their rankings, they have the players to do
the job, espcially naturalized China-born Amy Feng who was ranked
74th in the world individuals.
</P>
<P>
The other players who are not world-ranked are eager to fly
high.
</P>
<P>
However, one thing that worries fox is the prospect of meeting
the top teams in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Fox said they hardly have a chance against teams like China (
ranked first) and Germany (men ranked fourth and women third), so
whatever happens they would put up a fight and in the end this
should be all that really matters.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday night that he
succeeded in last year's election by the large number of votes and
not the erection and takedown of campaign billboards.
</P>
<P>
Barak declined to respond to reporter's question about the
arrest of two activists of his One Israel ruling coalition on
Wednesday, saying that the investigation is still under way. The
two activists were released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Knesset (parliament) members from the Right and Left
continued to throng the police's National Fraud Squad headquarters
to submit allegedly incriminating evidence of campaign funding
violations in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A secret meeting of the European Union's committee of experts
on the Middle East on February 9 recommended that Israel be
accepted into the European and Others Group at the United Nations,
a move would pave the way for Israeli delegates to head official U.
N. commissions and for Israel to win a voting seat at the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs long denied Israel membership in the Middle East Group
at U.N..
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendation does not, however, mean that the
decision is final and it must be approved by three more EU
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. State Department Thursday for the first time warned
Israel against attacking Lebanese civilian infrastructure
installations in retaliation for Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas'
attacks on Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that the U.S do not
believe that Israeli attacks against civilian infrastructure and
populated areas will solve the problem. Such actions will only add
to the sufferings of the people of Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
On February 8, Israel Air Force jets destroyed power stations in
several Lebanese cities.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister David Levy said Thursday that Israel will
not "continue playing the game" and will not rejoin the five-nation
Grapes of Wrath committee until Hezbollah removes its guerrillas
and weapons from Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied Israel would attack and destroy any
population center in response to Hezbollah attacks. He said
Israel's strikes at the power stations were a warning and "the
warning was received."

Mahathir said that he thought it unnecessary for him to be
called as a witness in the trial as all the evidence had already
been given but he would appear in court if required.
</P>
<P>
Arifin agreed with Karpal Singh that such comments, which
infringed upon the merit of the trial and might amount to contempt
of court, should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the High Court here Friday ordered the defense in
the sodomy trial of Anwar and his adopted brother Sukma Darmawan
Sasmitaat Madja to show the relevancy of the prime minister's
evidence before calling him to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, and Sukma, 39, are jointly charged with sodomizing
Azizan Abu Bakar, 39, the former driver of Anwar's wife.
</P>
<P>
Sukma, a businessman, applied to the court in October last year
to subpoena Mahathir to appear as his witness in his personal
capacity and Anwar did likewise Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Banks Urged to Step up Islamic Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's banking sector
has been urged to step up Islamic banking activities to help
expedite the government's aim of seeing Islamic banking take a 10
percent market share in local banking.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia hopes to achieve the target
in the next 10 years, Deputy Finance Minister Shafie Mohd Salleh
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
As by November last year, the total assets in Islamic banking
stood at 28.4 billion ringgit (about 7.473 billion U.S. dollars)
or a five-percent market share of the local banking system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the new banks which undertake interest-free
banking services at their branches would upgrade their operations
to become full-fledged Islamic banking branches.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pledges to Manage Oil Windfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
assured the nation that the oil windfall arising from increased
price of oil in the international market is secure and will be
judiciously managed, according to a local newspaper Daily Times
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted presidential spokesman, Doyin Okupe, as
saying that all proceeds of the oil windfall are channelled into
the federation account and not a dedication account as was the
case in the past.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media Thursday in the capital Abuja, Okupe said
the government would not embark on extra budgetary expenditures as
a result of the rising oil price from the earlier 18 U.S. dollars
per barrel to the present 30 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Oupe made this clarification against the backdrop of fears
that the excess revenue might be misappropriated as experienced in
the past.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the biggest oil producing country on the African
continent with a daily output of more than two million barrels.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Urged to Reply to Proposal on Inter-Korean Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Unification
Minister Park Jae-kyu Friday called on the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to reply to President Kim Dae-jung's
proposal to establish an inter-Korean economic community.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government is resolved to build a strong
foundation for economic community under the principles of
separating politics from economics, Park said at a press
conference marking the eighth anniversary of the 1992 Inter-Korean
Basic Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I hope each government-funded institute of the two Koreas
holds dialogue on building the inter-Korean economic community as
early as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inter-Korean dialogue is essential for mutual benefits and
solving all the pending issues on the Korean Peninsula, added the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung proposed in his New Year address that Seoul and
Pyongyang build a common economic community for mutual prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Kim's proposal is seen as a continuation of his "sunshine
policy" which pursues inter-Korean reconciliation, exchange and
cooperation based on separating business from politics.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Issue Foreign Exchange Equalization Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government will
issue a foreign exchange equalization bond worth one trillion won
(about 885 million U.S. dollars) next Monday to absorb the inflow
of foreign stock investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The Finance and Economy Ministry said Friday that the net
inflow of foreign stock funds this year as of last Wednesday hit
three billion U.S. dollars, serving as a decisive factor for the
strong South Korean won.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean won has appreciated to 1.124 against the
dollar Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Japanese yen continued to weaken against
the dollar, reaching 110 yen Thursday in New York from 106.9 yen
late last month.
</P>
<P>
The won's rally, coupled with the yen's depreciation, will hurt
South Korean exports and consequently worsen the current-account
balance. For this reason, it needs to absorb excess dollar supply
by expanding the foreign exchange equalization fund, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance and Economy Minister Lee Hun-jai said he does
not believe the value of the yen has changed considerably because
it was predicted to move between 105 and 106 yen against the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
No big problems will plague the dollar supply and demand in the
first half of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling for foreign exchange equalization bond for this
year is five trillion won (about 4.425 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bond issue reached 2.85 trillion won (about 2.5
billion dollars), less than the ceiling of 5.85 trillion won (
about 5.2 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> France Registers Big Trade Surplus in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- France registered a big trade
surplus of 123.8 billion francs (about 18.88 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1999, the General Direction of the French Customs announced
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is lower than the 145.134 billion franc (about 25
billion dollars) trade surplus registered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
French experts at the Ministry of Economy and Finance said that
the drop of trade surplus is due to the effects from the Asia
financial crisis, the rise in world oil production and the
devaluation of the euro against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French State Secretary of Exterior Trade
Francois Huwart said Thursday that he was optimistic about a
growth of French export in near future, as the world trade is
experiencing an acceleration of growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Museum has launched
its website, giving the public the opportunity to experience a
unique adventure at the heart of the Olympic world, the
International Olympic Committee announced in a press release
received here today.
</P>
<P>
With more than 300 web pages combining text, images, sound and
video, the site offers a virtual visit of the Museum's permanent
and temporary exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
During their on-line visit, Olympic Internauts will, for
instance, be able to admire the "golden shoes" Carl Lewis wore
during his 200m winning race in Los Angeles in 1984. A chance for
the public to relive this magical moment before going on to
discover other equally symbolic objects.
</P>
<P>
The "virtual galleries" are one of the site's novelties. These
exhibits, available exclusively on-line, are inspired by some of
the museum's treasures, such objects related to the opening and
closing ceremonies of the XVI Olympic Winter Games in Albertville,
theme of the site's first virtual exhibit.
</P>
<P>
This concept will also be applied to several topics, thus
allowing the Internaut to revisit great moments of Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
One of the site's most attractive features is its interactivity.
A section specifically designed for children will soon allow
younger viewers to discover the Museum as a virtual playground and
guide them through a world of Olympic sports and athletes. A
section dedicated to the history of the Olympic Games will also be
published in cooperation with David Wallechinsky, a world-famous
Olympic historian.
</P>
<P>
Also launched today, the Olympic Collectors Commission (OCC)
website, an exceptional meeting point for several million Olympic
collectors from all over the world. Stamps, coins, torches and
mascots will soon be auctioned or exchanged on line.
</P>
<P>
The site already offers a detailed catalogue, through image and
text, of collectors' favorites, such as the series of stamps
printed for the 1896 Athens Olympic Games, the coins produced for
the Centennial or the Sydney Olympic Games, together with all the
torches and mascots.

Rare information on philatelic, numismatic and memorabilia
federations world-wide is also available.

<P>
Red is also at the top of this year's favor color list in other
Chinese cities like Guangzhou and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars say the prevalence of red duds reflects the
public's confidence in the future.
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, popular things always represent the spirit,
economic conditions and lifestyles of a nation," said Sun Zhikai,
a university teacher in Beijing. "People's living standard is now
largely improved, and they are more confident in their future than
at anytime in history."
</P>
<P>
"For a typical Chinese, red always means something to be
celebrated," he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences indicated that 67.4 percent of the residents surveyed in
60 major Chinese cities believe that positive changes are in store
for society and the economy.
</P>
<P>
Even the stock market has been affected by the enthusiasm, with
nearly all the stocks increasing in value this past week and a

<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- If you're seeing red, you must
be in Beijing, where the color representing good luck to the
Chinese can be seen -- or not -- on all shapes and sizes of
clothing.
</P>
<P>
"I am very delighted to see so many young girls wearing red,"
said a local taxi-driver, who remarked that about a third of his
female passengers are sporting red coats or sweaters. "The color
red often makes me think of something festive and lucky."
</P>
<P>
Wang Hui, a middle-aged man working for a foreign-funded
company, joined the fashion frenzy by buying a dozen pairs of red
underpants.
</P>
<P>
"I like to wear business suits and black overcoats in this
season, but I still prefer to wear some small red accessories to
make me feel younger," he said, adding that at the beginning of a
new millennium and in this year of the dragon, red will guarantee
blessings.
</P>
<P>
Chinese tradition says that red removes bad luck, especially
for those in their "own year." For example, a person born in the
year of the dragon should dress in red during a dragon year.
</P>
<P>
"About half of the buyers tend to choose red underwear these
days," said Liu Liqing, a sales clerk in Xidan, one of the major
shopping districts in downtown Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Probing Iranian Support for Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Suspecting Iran had channeled
weapons to Turkish Islamic radical group Hezbollah, Turkey has got
to investigate the issue.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is prompted by recent findings that the
weapons seized by Turkish police in recent operations against
Hezbollah were extremely similar to the six-truck arms confiscated
four years ago that were later proved loaded in Iran, Turkish Daily
News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors of Diyarbakir State Security Court will concentrate
on ascertaining the serial number of the confiscated weaponry from
the six trucks, and compare them to arms seized in recent raids
against the Turkish Islamic terror group in order to substantiate
whether Iran has been supporting Hezbollah by providing weapons.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, Turkey seized six trucks of weapons and
explosives that were suspected at that time for the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting since 1984
for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The weapons seized in 1996 included 14 mortars, six anti-
aircraft guns, 168 RPG launchers and ammunition, 1132 bags of gun
powder and 10,748 TNT blocks.
</P>
<P>
The recent find raised suspicion that the weapons intercepted in
1996 were channeled to Hezbollah, which began its operation in late
1980s and used to target mainly the PKK and other sympathizers of
Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government has recently launched crackdown on the
radical group, which Ankara accused of kidnapping and killing
dozens of businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah is thought to have no connection with the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was leading a guerrilla
war against Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iran has refuted that it had supported the radical Islamic group
in Turkey, dismissing the accusation of Turkish authority as "
unfounded."

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's external
liabilities stood at 136.4 billion U.S. dollars at the end of last
year, down 12.3 billion dollars from 1998, the South Korean
Finance and Economy Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's loans to foreign nations totaled 145.7
billion dollars last year, up from the previous year's 17.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country became a net creditor of 9.3 billion
dollars last December.
</P>
<P>
However, last December saw the country's external liabilities
grow because loans from foreign bank branches here surged by 1.3
billion U.S. dollars and the short-term foreign debts rose 100
million dollars, with the ratio against total foreign debts
standing at 27.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Loans from the public sector soared 4.4 billion dollars last
December to 74.9 billion dollars due to an increase in foreign
exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
South Korean foreign exchange reserves topped 74 billion
dollars at the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Will Fulfill Its Obligations, Foreign Trade Minister Told Moore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua)-- China hopes its WTO accession
will be accelerated with the assistance of the director-general
and the secretariat of the global trade body, said Shi Guangsheng,
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks while conferring with Mike Moore, visiting
WTO director-general, here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Shi noted that China's negotiations with WTO members had
apparently sped up following its agreement with the United States.
Talks are also under way with a few other WTO members including
the European Union which have not yet signed a deal with China, he
added.
</P>
<P>
As a responsible big country, China will, after joining the WTO,
carry out all obligations under its framework, abide by its rules,
and implement the bilateral and multilateral accords, while
enjoying relevant rights as a WTO member, Shi stressed.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities and challenges alike will come to China after its
WTO accession, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is currently revising existing laws,
regulations and policies in accordance with WTO rules, and making
known to the public what WTO is and how its rules work, he added.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Moore said that the purpose of his Beijing tour was
to express support and provide assistance for China's WTO entry on
behalf of the WTO, the staff of the WTO Secretariat, and himself.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the world trade body are beneficial to China,
to all the countries in the world, and to WTO itself, Moore
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Moore said his goal is clear and he wishes China will become a
WTO member at an early date so as to make it a real World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Moore arrived here Thursday to start his 3-day visit to China
at the invitation of Shi.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Can Be Part of E-Commerce:  UNCTAD Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a press conference on the launching of the UNCTAD report and
CD-ROM, Lamvim Bruno, head of UNCTAD's e-commerce section, said
that within two to three years, e-commerce will account for 10 to
25 percent of world trade.
</P>
<P>
Although the share of developing countries in e-commerce is
still very small, the growth is very fast, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in developing countries, even least
developed countries (LDCs), there are some small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) are very active in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
However, some governments are not aware and are underestimating
the situations in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested public procurement in developing
countries in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
With big public sectors in some developing countries, e-
commerce can enhance transparency and increase efficiency, Bruno
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that e-commerce is an issue beyond mere technology,
which should involve everyone including governments, private
sectors and trade unions in order to address the social value of
it.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Crack Down on Illegal Transfer of Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Tax
Service (NTS) said Friday that it will crack down on those who use
paper companies in tax havens abroad to illegally transfer funds
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The NTS will crack down on some 200 such firms with affiliates
set up in foreign tax havens, with a probe focusing on funds
hidden in the accounts of paper companies in tax havens, including
earnings from exports and profits from overseas dealings which are
not brought into South Korea.
</P>
<P>
It will send investigation teams to look for business
facilities, including plants of the paper companies, in tax havens.
</P>
<P>
If it fails to find such facilities, any funds enter the paper
companies' account books will be transferred to parent companies
at home and thus face taxes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NTS investigators will also look into the
purchase of equipment made overseas, especially those booked
through paper firms in tax havens to see whether prices were fixed.

WELLINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Seafood
Industry Council Chairman Dave Sharp said Friday that the latest
export statistics showed record earnings for the industry.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand exports reached 1.34 billion NZ dollars (670

making it a cornerstone of the economy. About 40,000 people are
reliant on the industry for jobs, many of them in coastal
provincial townships.
</P>
<P>
"Profitability in the industry has come about from efficiency
gains which have been particularly hard to achieve.

<P>
"Last year saw legislative changes that effectively reduced the
business costs for many in the industry and that gave the industry
an edge in a highly competitive international market place," Sharp
said.

<HEADLINE> S'porean Firms Urged to Focus on Cutting-Edge Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the groundbreaking ceremony of Chartered
Semiconductor Manufacturing's "FAB 7" water fabrication plant at
Woodlands Industrial Park, north of the mainisland of Singapore,
the prime minister said that to be on top of the intense and
relentless competition in the semiconductor industry, Singapore
will have to do more than expanding capacities and cutting costs
and Singapore companies must offer cost-effective leading-edge
process technologies to their customers.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, I would encourage our companies to consider
teaming up with key industry innovators wherever possible, to
bring advanced manufacturing processes and services to the market,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing is one of the world's
leading independent foundries providing wafer fabrication services.
Its "FAB 7" wafer fabrication plant is a 2.1 billion U.S.-dollar
project occupying about 4.3 hectares of land and will be the 12th
wafer fabrication facility in Singapore equipped to support
advanced manufacturing process technologies by providing wafer
fabrication services using the well-proven state-of-the-art 8-inch
wafers.
</P>
<P>
The facility, expected to go into production in mid-2001, also
marks the single largest investment in the electronics sector in
the city-state to date and will create 1000 high-quality jobs when
fully operational.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that the global semiconductor market is a big growth
area and his country can benefit from the continuing electronic
boom.
</P>
<P>
Data shows that the global semiconductor market chalked up a
record sale of 150 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 and the market is
expected to grow by 25 percent annually over the next two year.
</P>
<P>
Other newly-released data says that wafer demand is expected to
increase from 6.5 million wafers a year in 1998 to an estimated 21.
9 million wafers in 2003, amounting to a compound annual growth of
27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging local companies to meet the global competition, the
prime minister said that Singapore's response is to speed up the
liberalization of the key economic sectors, for example, banking
and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that for local companies to succeed in global
economy, they must pass the international test, not a protected
local market test," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Goh encouraged Singapore companies to follow three Words: Focus,
Think Big and Take Risk, which he said is the strategy of the
Chartered and a small number of local companies that have also
become global players.
</P>
<P>
According to his explanation, Focus is to identify the right
niche for the business, Think Big means having a global market
vision, while Take Risk is to do sums, exercise business judgment
and take the calculated risk.

NAIROBI, February 18 (xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) will resume financial aid to
Kenya around the middle of this year as the Kenyan government
sustains its current economic reform process, local media reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of resuming aid to Kenya are far above 80
percent. If the government continues with the ongoing reform
programs, then the funds are surely coming mid this year," WB
Kenya County Director Harold Wackman was quoted as saying here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wackman noted that his bank is satisfied with Kenya's ongoing
reforms and changes in several government parastatals.
</P>
<P>
However, Wackman suggested that Kenya should concentrate on
creating jobs, trimming government spending and strengthening
checks and balances in managing the public sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to Wackman, the WB and IMF are prepared to help Kenya
fight poverty by supporting the country's economic growth and
programs targeting the poor.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-dollar loan to Kenya in July
1997 to reinforce its protests against what it claimed were poor
governance and corruption.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages More Involvement in Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The China State Administration
of Forestry recently issued a circular calling for more businesses
and organizations to fund afforestation projects so that the
general public will be more involved in the country's tree
planting drive.
</P>
<P>
The circular also asks localities to encourage state- and
collective-owned and private companies and individuals to be
engaged in afforestation and promises to closely link their
efforts in this regard with the economic effect of the
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that the state encourages all legal persons,
economic organizations and individuals to acquire use rights of
state- and collective-owned barren hills and land to plant trees
by means of contracting and renting.
</P>
<P>
And the proprietary rights of the forest as well as the use
rights of the forest land as a result of the afforestation can be
transferred to others with compensation and inherited or purchased
by the state.
</P>
<P>
According the circular, those who plant trees in barren hills,
or sandy land for the purpose of public interest have priority of
enjoying part or whole use rights of the forest land as a result
of the afforestation.
</P>
<P>
To boost the country's afforestation, China has divided tree
planting into two categories: public tree planting and tree
planting for commercial use.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Leaps in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua)-- China's foreign trade volume in
the first month of 2000 chalked up a 50.8 percent rise over that
of January last year, to hit 32.1 billion U.S. dollars, with a
surplus of 1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics by the General
Administration of Customs (GAC), China's export volume in January
reached 16.8 billion U.S. dollars, up 47.8 percent over the same
period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Of the total exports, general exports jumped 71 percent over
the same period last year to 7.1 billion U.S. dollars. Processing
exports reported a 33.4 percent growth at 9.25 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Export value by state-owned enterprises took up half of the
total volume, while overseas-invested enterprises claimed 45
percent. And the growth rate of the former was far greater than
the latter.
</P>
<P>
China's export volume has been on an upward track since the
third quarter of 1999. The overall recovery of the world market,
as well as the increase of export refund rates introduced since
late last year have contributed to boosting China's exports, a GAC
official said.
</P>
<P>
Import value reached 15.3 billion U.S. dollars, a 54.4 percent
rise over the January last year. General imports kept up the rapid
pace of growth with a volume of 6.64 billion U.S. dollars, up 74
percent compared with the corresponding month last year.
Processing imports stood at 6.6 billion U.S. dollars, up 38.9
percent. Overseas investors imported 890 million dollars worth of
goods as part of their investment, showing an increase of 31.5
percent over the January 1999.

TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Following week-long heated
campaigns by rival factions, Iran kicked off its crucial
parliamentary elections on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The election officially started at 0900 hours local time (0530

</P>
<P>
Over 38 million above-16-year-old eligible voters in Iran, which

</P>
<P>
However, the final number of the candidates has not been

still remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry, which is responsible for carrying out

but suffered heavy setbacks in recent years, pinned their hope on
the election.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the moderate coalition of reformers and
centralists would be able to win a majority in the expanded 290-
member parliament as the Iranian people hope a new legislative body

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Strengthen State-owned Enterprises Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to further reform
its state-owned enterprises by cutting more than half the number
of state-owned enterprises, Vietnam News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government is examining a proposal to reduce the
number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by more than a half to
make them more efficient and enable them to play a key role in the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The number of SOEs would be cut from 7,000 to 3,000 between
2000-2005, the newspaper quoted Vietnam's Deputy Industry Minister
Nguyen Minh Thong as saying, adding that the rest would become
joint-stock companies, be sold off, leased out or contracted to
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
The reform would mean that the government would no longer have
to support loss-making SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Thong, who is also vice director of the SOE Renovation Board,
said that for the next three months the government would try out
the parent company model, under which corporations and their
subsidiaries are connected financially but remain independent in
other areas such as decision-making.
</P>
<P>
the Corporations of Marine Navigation, Marine Products and
Civil Aviation would be the first to take part in the experiment.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Corporation of Posts and Telecommunications has
also asked to participate.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even those SOEs which remain 100 percent state owned
after the end of this renovation process will possess special
mechanisms to enable them to become truly strong corporations.
</P>
<P>
Other steps are being taken to improve the performance of SOEs.
Some Vietnamese corporations have taken steps to reduce the number
of people in senior management.
</P>
<P>
Some corporations are seeking investments from private
companies. There are also plans to change the basis of the
financial structure of SOEs, from capital allocation to capital
investment.

<HEADLINE> New Transport Credit System to Be Introduced in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A new transport credit system is
to be introduced in Bangladesh for the government officials to put
a brake on the huge drainage of public money presently spent on
procurement and maintenance of government transports.
</P>
<P>
The new system will provide government officials with a unique
opportunity of buying a car once they surrender the official
vehicles entitled to them under the existing system.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system an official enjoying the entitlement of
government transport will get a soft loan of 400,000 taka (7,700 U.
S. dollars) and will receive a monthly allowance of 8,000 taka (
154 dollars) for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation for the new system came from the Public
Administration Reforms Commission (PARC) in the backdrop of
mounting pressure on public expenditure on maintaining and
operating the government transport pools.
</P>
<P>
If implemented accordingly, a recent PARC report said, it could
save the government some 14 million taka (270,000 dollars) each
year.

<HEADLINE> Africa Merely Erased: Algerian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abelazizi
Bouteflika said here Friday that the whole Africa is merely erased
as the powerful countries have escaped their obligations to open
up new markets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 10th Session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Bouteflika,
who is also chairman of the Organization of Africa Unity, said the
developing countries, representing the sweeping majority of the
mankind, are excluded from the process of consultation and
collective decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The powerful countries, through increasingly sophisticated and
disguised protections, escape their obligations to open up their
markets in accordance with the new framework of international
relationships.
</P>
<P>
He said such a situation has brought about a new map of the
world from where the whole continent of Africa is merely erased.
</P>
<P>
He said the power of markets has in fact downgraded the basic
requirements of human development and has tragically tended to
aggravate inequalities and social precariousness in the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"This new dimension in the role of markets has been used to
limit the corrective action by the developed countries and cut
public aid to its lowest level for decades, he added.

DHAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from mass liquor
poisoning in Feni, 150 kilometers southeast of Dhaka, rose sharply
to 43, while some 100 other people were still fighting for life in
one of the worst alcoholic catastrophes in Bangladesh.

rectified spirits by unscrupulous people for greater profits
caused the tragedy.

Panic spread as doctors feared that patients who took minimum
30 milliliters of the toxic liquor methanol might die within 12

<HEADLINE> U.N. Hercules Crash-Lands in Darwin, Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations Hercules
aircraft with 29 people on board crash-landed Friday at an
airforce base in Darwin, the northern Australia, but there were no
injuries, a defense spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The C130 plane was arriving from the East Timor capital of Dili
when it was forced to land on its belly because its landing gear
failed to activate.
</P>
<P>
"A U.N. Hercules has just done a wheels-up belly-down landing,"
defense spokesman Steve Ridgeway said.
</P>
<P>
A police spokeswoman said the 29 people on board were evacuated
and there were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
"There was smoke coming from the plane as it was landing, but
that was probably caused by the friction as it was belly-landing,"
the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency services had been on stand-by but were not needed.
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was over and done within about 20 minutes,"
the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The plane was carrying mostly cargo from Dili when it crash-
landed at the Darwin Royal Australian Air Force base, close to the
city's commercial airport.
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway said the crash-landing would delay the arrival of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan by about an hour.
</P>
<P>
Annan is due to touch down from East Timor later Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
There was no information on why the landing gear failed to work.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Introduce Venture Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysia Technology
Development Corporation (MTDC) plans to introduce a venture fund
based on the MTDC Technology Index which was launched Friday, its
chairman Omar Abdul Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
The fund with 20 million ringgit (5.263 million U.S. dollars)
to 30 million ringgit (7.894 million U.S. dollars) would be
invested in 30 companies that make up the components of the newly-
launched index, Omar told a press conference after the launch of
the index here.
</P>
<P>
The venture fund would be launched within a year subject to
necessary approvals being sought and the movement of the index
which will serve as a benchmark for the performance of technology
stocks in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the MTDC is not a pioneer in setting up a fund based
on an index because in the United States similar efforts are
practiced by several investment banks.

LOS ANGELES -- The U.S. economic expansion will continue this

<P>
BUDAPEST, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian National Bank
Thursday announced further cuts in its benchmark interest rate and
two-week deposit rate, the second within two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark interest rate dropped by 0.5 percentage point and
the two-week deposit rate was down to 11.75 percent from 12.25
percent. The overnight inter-bank borrowing interest rate fell to
13.75 percent from 14.25 percent, while the overnight deposit rate
was lowered to 9.75 percent from 10.25 percent, the Hungarian News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The overnight inter-bank borrowing interest rate was cut by 1.5
percentage points on January 19 this year, the largest-ever cut by
the Hungarian National Bank in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Rising investor confidence and improving economic indices,
including those for budget deficit and inflation, have made lower
interest rates possible, Hungarian National Bank officials said,
adding that this second cut within half a month shows that the
macroeconomic situation of the country is favorable.
</P>
<P>
The banking circles have reacted differently to the
announcement. Some banking experts believe that the lowering of
interest rates would produce a positive impact on the stock market,
while others believe it may not be good for investors, as the
interest rates are already near the inflation level.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Team New Zealand is well
prepared and ready to defend the America's Cup, the Evening Post
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We've had our own testing program and time to trial things. We
're ready to race," the Wellington-based newspaper quoted Skipper
Russell Coutts of Team New Zealand as saying at Friday's final pre-
America's Cup press conference in Auckland, the biggest city in
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The race for the America's Cup starts Saturday. Team New
Zealand and challenger Prada Challenge of Italy will contest nine
races in the 30th America's Cup tournament in the Hauraki Gulf off
Auckland. They have been set from Saturday to March 4, with each
race worth one point, and the first boat to win five points will
win the cup.
</P>
<P>
Coutts is wary of the Italian threat to an historic first
successful defense by a non-American holder of the Cup, the
Evening Post reported. It quoted Coutts as saying "It is going to
be a very tough battle."
</P>
<P>
Conditions on the Hauraki Gulf would be vastly different to
when New Zealand won the Cup in San Diego five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We have changing conditions here, a different set of variables.
This is going to be a great race." Coutts said.

<P>
DHAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar on
nuclear disarmament began in Dhaka Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 150 participants from host Bangladesh, India, Pakistan,
Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Fiji, the Philippines, Japan, France
and the United States are attending the three-day seminar, jointly
organized by Community Development Library and FOCUS on the Global
South, a Bangkok-based non-government organization working for
security.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the seminar is not only to discuss
geopolitical security, but also to forge greater unity to help
take pragmatic steps to ensure security of food, the environment,
ecology and other security concerned fields in South and Southeast
Asia, said Varsha Rajan Berry, research associate of FOCUS India
Program.
</P>
<P>
"If we can not convert more and more people against the
unjustified nuclear race by the two neighboring countries of India
and Pakistan, security, in large part, would remain far-reaching,"
said Varsha.
</P>
<P>
Varsha noted that FOCUS chose Bangladesh, a non-nuclear power,
as the conference venue just to avoid India and Pakistan as both
of them had conducted nuclear tests.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee (IOC) President Juan Antonio Samaranch said Friday he
remained confident the Sydney Games would be the best ever.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a three-day Executive Board meeting in
Sydney, Samaranch said the IOC always considered the construction
of venues as the most important aspect of Games preparation, and
on that score the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic
Games (SOCOG) could not be faulted.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch praised the Games villages and the attitude of
Australians to sports and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The IOC board was briefed on Friday on the content of the
opening ceremony, which the president described as "wonderful"
without revealing any details.
</P>
<P>
He also said the disagreement between IOC Vice-President Dick
Pound and SOCOG president Michael Knight over treatment of Sydney
Games sponsors was "nearly ended".
</P>
<P>
Pound Thursday accused Knight of "having a dysfunctional
relationship with sponsors and effectively undermining a world
record marketing effort."

<HEADLINE> Feature: Anti-Drug Veteran Fights for Drug-Free  Philippines By Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- As the Chinese saying goes,
when a veteran goes into action, he can do the job of two. This is
the desire the gray-haired Alfredo Lim has cherished in the
fighting for a drug-free society in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
After being appointed head of the Department of Interior and
Local Government at the age of 70 early this year, Lim vowed to
step up the campaign against crimes, with the priority in the anti-
drug drive.
</P>
<P>
In his mind, to win the war against illegal drugs, it is not
adequate to just arrest drug addicts and pushers, and "the big
fish" must be caught and brought to justice as well.
</P>
<P>
"The law applies to all, otherwise, none at all," he told
reporters earlier, adding that he was not awed by the position or
stature of any person.
</P>
<P>
His toughness earned him, 10 years ago when he was police
general and director of the National Bureau of Investigation, the
moniker "Dirty Harry," which was said to be a typical figure of an
anti-crime hero in a Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
His practical working style led to the unique way of painting
warnings on houses of suspected drug pushers in 1995 when he was
Manila mayor. The so-called shame campaign was reported to have
achieved desired shock effect.
</P>
<P>
His uncompromising stance might explain the reason why
President Joseph Estrada chose him, regardless of his age, as
interior secretary charged with the task of combating the
terrifying drug menace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Latest official reports said about 23 percent of Filipinos are
hooked on illegal drugs. The estimate means 17.25 million
Filipinos, based on the current population of 75 million, are drug
abusers.
</P>
<P>
Illegal drug trafficking in the country has also become a very
lucrative business for drug lords who earn about 6.2 billion U.S.
dollars yearly.
</P>
<P>
Apart from personal tragedies of drug abusers, the present
spate of criminal incidents throughout the country are mostly drug-
related, according to other reports.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 50 chief executives of major companies in Manila
earlier this month showed that most businessmen are worried about
rising criminality.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders reportedly listed peace and order, among
others, as "issues perceived to be most urgent."
</P>
<P>
The executives said many other cities in the country also
suffer from "some image problem" related to peace and order,
adding that the image problem discourages new investment.
</P>
<P>
As the first step after he accepted the cabinet post, Lim
joined hands with Panfilo Lacson, newly appointed head of the
Philippine National Police, and launched an ongoing battle against
drug abusers and traffickers.
</P>
<P>
In the recent week-long anti-drug operations conducted by the
Western Police District in Manila, police arrested 84 suspects and
confiscated more than 500 grams of drugs. Similar positive reports
kept pouring in from various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lim revived his shame campaign against drug pushers
by spraying red-colored warnings on the houses of two defendants
in drug cases in Manila.  Although the move was later suspended
after the Court of Appeals ruled it as unconstitutional, Lim was
not frustrated. "No amount of criticism can derail my plan to
improve peace and order in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, addressing the national anti-drug summit,
Lim urged local governments to strengthen the over-5,000 community-
based anti-drug councils, which he said would play a vital role in
the war.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he asked the Philippine National Police to monitor
the politicians and police officials who are suspected of
involvement in illegal drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Lim said he had received reports that some influential
politicians and ranking police officials could be protecting drug
peddlers or involved in illegal drug business.
</P>
<P>
But the interior chief stressed that the only way to curb drug
trafficking in the country is to enforce harsh laws that are in
urgent need to combat the cunning maneuvers of drug lords.
</P>
<P>
He called on Congress to approve tougher legislative bills,
saying that drastic laws would discourage drug traffickers from
undertaking illegal drug activities.
</P>
<P>
While the drug problem, like any other complicated and
comprehensive social phenomenon, can not be solved overnight, Lim
has never looked hesitant about pushing ahead with his anti-drug
plans.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tourism Earnings All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tourism Industry's
earnings hit an all-time high of 254 million U.S. dollars in 1999,
the official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Aviation and Tourism Dharmasiri Senanayake was
quoted as saying that the figure was a 24 percent increase over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Senanayake said tourism and aviation had done extremely well
during the past few years following the government's incentives to
the industry and extensive international tourism promotional
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Image building efforts by the tourism industry and Sri Lankan
Airlines had also contributed to the significant growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka recorded 436,000 tourist arrivals last year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has rich tourist potential, which, if tapped properly,
could help the country successfully compete with other major
tourist destinations, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The country's strongest points were attractions like culture,
ancient sites, and wildlife since there is a trend towards eco-
tourism in comparison to the hitherto popular trend of sun, sea
and sand destinations, Senanayake said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has proposed to launch a series of programs aimed at
promoting eco-tourism this year along with other extensive tourism
promotional campaigns, he said, adding that the World Tourism
Organization Executive Council Sessions are scheduled to be held
in Colombo this year.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Rejects Protectionism at UNCTAD Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will not apply
protectionism to its economy, said Mexican Foreign Minister
Rosario Green during the 10th United Nations Conference for Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) in Bangkok on Thursday, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Protectionism hampers the process of world trade globalization
which obliges nations to devise novel and intelligent formulas
that help expand markets and make free trade compatible with
social progress and distribution of income, Green said.
</P>
<P>
She said that international financial crises have brought into
focus the importance of the application by all countries of
realistic and responsible macroeconomic policies, as well as the
urgency of strengthening national financial systems.
</P>
<P>
She said she is firmly convinced that opening to international
trade can be a way to create better-paid jobs, which can help
improve people's living standards while reducing inequality among
nations.
</P>
<P>
Green, who leads a Mexican delegation to the conference,
mentioned some development priorities for Mexico: globalization,
free trade promotion, and reinforcement of the international
financial system.
</P>
<P>
She said Mexico is not seeing globalization as a foe, but a
challenge, which is "a power that needs to be dominated and
directed."

<HEADLINE> KFOR to Stay Long in Kosovo: NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting NATO chief George
Robertson said Thursday in Skopje, capital of Macedonia, that the
NATO-led peacekeeping force (KFOR) is to stay in Kosovo for a long
time, according to news reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who flew to Macedonia Thursday from Russia, made the
remarks in his address to the Macedonian parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that KFOR, with its main goal to prevent violence in
Kosovo by all means, will be stationed in the ethnically-troubled
Yugoslav province until its mission is fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told Macedonian legislators that it is not easy to
achieve lasting peace and security in Kosovo, given the recent
violence in the Kosovo town of Mitrovica, where the situation has
grown tense as a result of ethnic Albanian terrorists' attacks on
Serbian residents and French peacekeeping troops, killing at least
12 and injuring many others.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary-general pledged that the military alliance
will take all imperative measures to stop violence in Kosovo and
reinforce military strength in Mitrovica when necessary.
</P>
<P>
KFOR entered Kosovo to maintain peace last June following the
end of NATO's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia, but violence has never
halted, with ethnic Albanian separatists and terrorists repeatedly
assaulting Serbs under the connivance of the peacekeepers and the
U.N. special mission there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Robertson charged that the international community
has not provided in time necessary funds for the reconstruction of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit to Macedonia, KFOR's home front with
about 4,000 NATO troops stationed, Robertson met with Macedonian
leaders including President Boris Trajkovski, Prime Minister
Ljupco Georgievski and Defense Minister Nikola Kljusev. They asked
the NATO chief to help Macedonia join the western military bloc at
an early date.
</P>
<P>
Robertson left Macedonia Thursday evening for Albania.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Europe will
take part in cleaning the polluted Tisa river by providing
technical help and research fund, a European Union official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Margot Wallstrom, commissioner for the EU Environment Affairs,
said after meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos
Thursday that the two sides have agreed to set up an international
committee to coordinate with countries and organizations which
will provide assistance. She said the Council of Europe will play
an important role in the committee.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, the Economic Commission for Europe, the U.N.
Environment Program and the European Council have all agreed to be
represented in the committee.
</P>
<P>
Wallstrom, on a special trip for the solution to the pollution
problem, said that the Council of Europe will participate in the
work of the Hungarian-Romanian experts committee as an observer.
</P>
<P>

<P>
During the past four years, the general secretary said, the SPS

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The German Mercedes Benz
vehicle firm plans to invest 12 million U.S. dollars in its plant
of Santiago Tianguistengo in central Mexico, Mercedes Benz Mexico
(MBM) president Jose Vieira Lima told the press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vieira said that the MBM foresees an 8-percent growth in
production this year, which means a total output of 28,000
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
He added that the MBM and its national network of distributors
sold 9,394 units in the domestic market last year, comparing with
7,030 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the low demand in the first five months of 1999 for
commercial vehicles, the MBM enlarged its sales and held 33.2
percent shares of the wholesale market, posting an increase of 1.2
percent over 1998.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chilean Economy Shrinks 1.1 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chile's economy registered a
1.1 percent drop in 1999, the Central Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sectors that pulled the index downward were agriculture,
livestock, forestry and mining, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector was affected by a slump in fruit
production because of bad weather while the growth in the mining
sector bogged down in the last month of 1999 after active
performance in previous months, according to data from the
National Statistics Institute.
</P>
<P>
One of the sectors that went upward was industry, partly due to
improved power supply from hydroelectric plants in the country,
said the bank.

<HEADLINE> Anti-doping Workshop Opens in Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop opened
Thursday in Montreal to tackle doping problems in sports.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from about 30 countries and regions are
gathering to discuss ways to get drugs out of sports before the
Summer Olympics is staged in Sydney later this year.
</P>
<P>
A solution rests with the new World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA),
which will set international standards for testing programs,
sanctions against cheaters and education programs, some
representatives say.
</P>
<P>
Denis Coderre, Canadian secretary of state for amateur sport,
is placing high hopes on WADA, saying if the new agency works, "we
will save the Olympic movement."
</P>
<P>
Donald Vereen, deputy head of the U.S. delegation, urged all
governments to work quickly for noticeable changes for the Summer
Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The use of performance-enhancing drugs, such as the anabolic
steroids, has become a common concern in recent years with some of
the critics describing the issue as a crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's parliament on Thursday
approved the long delayed state budget for fiscal 2000, after the
country was run without a budget for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
The budget was adopted by a vote of 252 for, 18 against and
three abstentions following a heated debate in the third reading
of the draft. Leftist deputies of parliament refused to take part
in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The budget, centering on social security, regional
appropriation and external debts, envisages both revenues and
spending of 33.43 billion hryvna (about 6 billion U.S. dollars),
the first zero deficit since Ukraine's independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The government had proposed the draft budget as early as last
September but the first draft was rejected by parliament.
Approving the new draft was delayed because of the country's
presidential elections, naming and confirming of a new cabinet and
a crisis within the parliament itself.

<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- European champions Manchester
United edged closer to becoming football's first billionaire club,
after bursting through the 800 million pounds barrier on Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Shares in the club hit a new record high as their value soared
to 800,085,563 - a massive 170 million pounds more than BSkyB were
ready to pay a year ago until their takeover bid was blocked by
the Monopolies Commission.
</P>
<P>
Share prices have steadily risen during the last few months,
taking them beyond the 240 pences offered by Sky.
</P>
<P>
And following the announcement of last week's 30 million pounds
shirt sponsorship deal with Vodafone, prices have gone through the
3 barrier for the first time since the club increased the number
of shares in circulation.
</P>
<P>
Fans who invested in the original minimum holding of 50 shares
in July 1991 now find themselves with a considerable profit.
</P>
<P>
The value of one original share bought nine years ago for 3.85
is now 61.60.
</P>
<P>
Supporters who made the minimum investment of 192.50 in 1991
can now pocket 3,080 if they sell their holdings - a profit of 2,

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-financed businesses
in south China's Guangdong Province, the country's N0. 1 economic
powerhouse, have been playing a more important role in the
province's economy and have fared better financially than locally-
funded ventures.
</P>
<P>
A report released by local economic departments studying
foreign-funded businesses in the province also pointed out that
businesses financed by investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
did worse than businesses funded by other overseas investors and
were advised to import advanced technology and equipment, readjust
product mix, and improve management skills.
</P>
<P>
The economic performance index of ventures financed by overseas
investors was 124.35 percent, but the economic performance index
of businesses backed by Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan was 103.62
percent, lower than the provincial average.
</P>
<P>
People working with Sino-foreign joint ventures get the highest
salaries, with the per capita annual salary average standing at 21,
500 yuan, while people working with businesses backed by Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan investors get the lowest salaries, with the per
capita annual salary average 9,500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
There are 7,800 overseas-backed businesses whose annual sales
income exceeds five million yuan each, accounting for 43.6 percent
of the province's total industrial enterprises, said the report.
</P>
<P>
These ventures employ 51 percent of the province's total
industrial workforce, generate 57.6 percent of the province's
total industrial output value, and their total assets account for
49.5 percent of the province's entire amount.
</P>
<P>
The overseas businesses are engaged in light industry,
electronics, telecommunications equipment production, making
garments and textiles, and food processing.

<HEADLINE> More Rails to be Built in Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua)-- China will spend an estimated
100 billion yuan building large and medium-sized railways-related
projects in the country's immense western territory during the
2001-2005 period.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the total length of railways in western China will
reach 18,000 km, said Railway Minister Fu Zhihuan.
</P>
<P>
Key projects in the ambitious plan include rail lines between
Baoji in Shaanxi Province and Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu
Province; between Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi, and Hefei, capital of
Anhui Province, between Zhuzhou and Liupanshui and the line
linking Suining, Chongqing, the largest metropolis in western
China, and Huaihua.
</P>
<P>
In addition, speed limits for trains will be raised to sharpen
the competitive edge of railways in the transport market.
</P>
<P>
When the new railway timetable starts this October, the travel
time by train between Beijing and Urumqi, capital of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, will be shortened from
the current 60 hours to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are 14,858 km of rail lines in western China,
but they are low-grade and cannot meet the needs of economic
growth in the region.

BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's product quality
watchdog is keeping an eye on everyday consumer goods to curb sub-
standard products, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quality inspection departments have carried out the largest
nationwide campaign ever to force shoddy and poor quality products
out of market during the first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The annual inspection was aimed at guaranteeing that consumers
have quality goods to buy, according the State Administration of
Quality and Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the administration show that inspectors across the
country seized two billion yuan (about 240 million U.S. dollars)
worth of fake and shoddy products in three rounds of nationwide
inspection last year.
</P>
<P>
"We will take tougher measures this year," Ma Xuebing, director
of the Market Supervision Division of the Administration, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides disseminating the results of the inspection, the
administration will publicize those producers and brands of shoddy
and poor quality products, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the administration would take an iron hand in
cracking down on sub-standard products to protect consumers'
rights and stimulate the sluggish domestic market.

<HEADLINE> Collymore Apologises for Fire Stunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Stan Collymore has publicly
apologised for the misbehaviour that led to Leicester City's
players being expelled from a Spanish hotel.
</P>
<P>
Collymore, who was Thursday fined two week's wages for letting
off a fire extinguisher at the Spanish resort where Leicester were
preparing for the Worthington Cup Final, put his actions down to "
high spirits" but admitted: "It was not the best thing to do".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Sky Sports, Collymore said he accepted his
punishment, which will also includes work in the local community.
</P>
<P>
"I'll take it fully on the chin. I would firstly like to
apologise to the gaffer and to all at Leicester City," the 29-year-
old said.
</P>
<P>
"We were having a drink, and a laugh and a joke. I did see it
off (the fire extinguisher) and did spray it at the physio. It
seems as if one or two people did not take it in the spirit in
which it was meant," he said.
</P>
<P>
The controversial Collymore joined Leicester a week ago from
Aston Villa vowing to turn over a new leaf. But his actions
following a drinking spree at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in La Manga
persuaded his manager Martin O'Neill to fine the player the
maximum fortnight's wages permitted, estimated at 30,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
"I agree it was not the best idea. We went out to have fun as
well as doing some training," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone at Leicester has made me feel great the lads have
made me feel fantastic. It was just high spirits and it was not
intended to hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction shows how high profile footballers have become.
It is a little bit out of all proportion in the papers."
</P>
<P>
Asked about his punishment to do as yet unknown community
service, Collymore sounded prepared to take his medicine. He said:
"I will do it happily. Leicester City do a lot of community work
so I would have to partake in that anyway."
</P>
<P>
The striker returned to footballing matters when stating he is
happy at Filbert Street: "I was pleased from a football point of
view to get 90 minutes on Saturday at Watford and had another 90
minutes in the reserves on Monday, so things are going well on
that front."

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Take Active Part in Political Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province,
which faces Taiwan across the Taiwan Straits, has begun
preparations for the third phase of a weather disaster forecasting
system.
</P>
<P>
The move resulted from a suggestion put forward last month by
Ye Rongsheng, a member of the Eighth Fujian Provincial Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Fujian's CPPCC members offered 968
suggestions to the local government last year, 80 percent of which
have already been adopted.
</P>
<P>
Giving suggestions is a major way for CPPCC members, non-
Communist parties and other people's groups to participate in
China's government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
In recent years CPPCC members across China have been more
active in giving their opinions and advice to the government.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC
presented 584 suggestions in 1999 involving economic reform,
business environment and development of the private economy.
</P>
<P>
And in Hainan Province, CPPCC members have completed a series
of research projects which yielded a great number of valuable
ideas regarding tourism, the anti-drug struggle, and social
security.

<HEADLINE> Ancient City Site Discovered in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists
recently discovered a 4,000-year-old city site on the outskirts of
Lianyungang, a coastal city in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The site covers a total area of about 150,000 sq m, including
41,000 sq m for the city proper.
</P>
<P>

<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager
Kevin Keegan said on Thursday that Steven Gerrard and Gareth Barry
have been called up for next Wednesday's friendly against
Argentina "on merit".
</P>
<P>
Keegan has included 19-year-old Liverpool midfielder Gerrard
and Aston Villa defender Barry, who will be 19 on the day of the
game, in a 24-man squad ahead of the Wembley clash.
</P>
<P>
And Keegan insisted the teenagers have earned their places with
impressive club form of late.
</P>
<P>
"In all the games I've seen I don't think anybody has played as
well as he (Gerrard) has done over the last six to eight weeks,"
Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
"Gareth Barry is playing very well and contributing to Villa
and they're both in on merit.
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking for left-sided players but he (Barry) is in
on merit. He is one of those players who is dependable who finds
time on the ball and uses it well.
</P>
<P>
"He came from Brighton straight into Villa's first team and he
hit the wall, which happens to a lot of players.
</P>
<P>
"The secret is how do you react. He bounced back and came back
in the right way. He is a good athlete and let's get him in with
the big boys and see how he gets on," said the manager.

<HEADLINE> England Manager Supports Heavy Punishment for Dissent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager
Kevin Keegan said here on Thursday that any players who show
dissent to referees should be heavily punished.
</P>
<P>
"I always felt even at club level we should be fining players
heavily for dissent because it really isn't necessary," the
England manager said.
</P>
<P>
"If a player is trying to win a ball and stop a goal, even
handles it on the line and gets sent off, you sort of say 'well he
broke the rule, got sent off, they got a penalty'.
</P>
<P>
"Dissent is always hard to justify."
</P>
<P>
English soccer has given the appearance of being awash with
dissent and violence lately, with four leading clubs charged with
misconduct on Monday after weekend incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association of England, discerning an apparent
trend towards "collective intimidation of match officials" also
wrote to all clubs this week warning them to cut out dissent.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United players in particular have been in the
headlines for crowding angrily around referees and intimidating
officials when decisions went against them.
</P>
<P>
United captain Roy Keane was sent off against Newcastle United
on Saturday for two yellow cards and England internationals Paul
Scholes and Andy Cole, with Dutch defender Jaap Stam, were all
booked for dissent.
</P>
<P>
Keegan pointed out that Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson
had spoken out and added that it was hard to see how referees
could win in a climate where they were constantly criticized
whether they handed out cards or not.
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season I was going to games where referees were
starting to brandish yellow cards in the first five minutes of the
game and rightly so," he said.
</P>
<P>
But that led to more dismissals as a result of second bookings
and Keegan said that two or three weeks ago referees were advised
to be more lenient.
</P>
<P>
"I personally think, if you take aside two or three instances,
the games have been better for it. But you can always
find problems in anything," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
England's own record, with three players sent off in the Euro
2000 qualifiers, is not good but Keegan said discipline off the
pitch had been excellent since he took over from Glenn Hoddle last
year.
</P>
<P>
"I am pretty strict on discipline, in terms of getting in time
for meals, not abusing any privileges, doing things right. On the
football field, the discipline then becomes the problem of the
referee."
</P>
<P>
He said the main punishment for any suspended player was
missing out on opportunities to play for the national team and
possibly being replaced long-term by someone else.

<HEADLINE> Collymore Fined for Bar-room Rumpus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Stan Collymore was fined two
weeks wages by Leicester City for letting off a fire extinguisher
at the La Manga resort in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Collymore, who joined the club from Aston Villa last week, has
been severely reprimanded by the club and must undertake
additional community duties, at the request of manager Martin O'
Neill.
</P>
<P>
The club also announced that the costs of the aborted trip will
be met by the players.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at Filbert Street, Northern Ireland-born
O'Neill said: "We had a word with the players to see if it was
true.
</P>
<P>
"And what came out of that was that the incident which led to
the party being asked to leave was the fire extinguisher going off.
</P>
<P>
"Collymore admitted that it was his responsibility."
</P>
<P>
O'Neill admitted he was not totally surprised by what had
happened to Collymore, who arrived at the club following a series
of high-profile off-the-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
"I always felt when he came here - which as someone said was
just 131 hours ago - that there would probably be an incident
involving Stan in some way," he said. "But I didn't expect it to
happen so soon.
</P>
<P>
"He's extremely sorry and I didn't consider it a sackable
offence."
</P>
<P>
The Leicester team and officials were asked to leave the
complex after a disturbance in the bar on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to hotel staff, players were drunk and had insulted
other guests.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not best pleased with Stan and he knows that.
</P>
<P>
"I have fined him two weeks wages, the most I can under PFA
rules."
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said he felt let down by first-team coach John
Robertson, who had taken charge of the trip to La Manga in the
manager's absence.
</P>
<P>
"John looked after the party and he's very contrite at the
moment," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion boxer
Herbie Hide is being questioned by Norfolk police in connection
with an alleged attack on a woman.
</P>
<P>
The former WBO world heavyweight champion was arrested on
Wednesday night on the outskirts of his home town of Norwich.
</P>
<P>
It is understood he was detained on the street rather than
inside a premises.
</P>
<P>
A Norfolk police spokesman said: "A man was arrested last night
in connection with allegations of assault on a female.
</P>
<P>
"He is helping police with their inquiries at Bethel Street
police station in Norwich."
</P>
<P>
He said the inquiry was at an early stage and it was not yet
known whether charges would be brought.
</P>
<P>
Hide's reign as WBO world heavyweight champion came to an end
last June after he was stopped in two rounds by Ukrainian Vitali
Klitschko.
</P>
<P>
The defeat is thought to have spelt the end of the Norwich-
based fighter's career at the top level of boxing.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Visits Kuwait to Boost Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan arrived here Friday on a three-day visit aimed at
bolstering cooperation in all fields between China and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Tang told reporters that he will discuss with
Kuwaiti leaders "means of furthering friendly cooperation between
our two countries in the new century."
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also exchange views on the situation in the
Gulf, as well as other regional and international issues of mutual
and general interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister reaffirmed China's clear support to
Kuwait's just causes, especially with regard to the issue of the
Kuwaiti nationals allegedly still held in Iraq, adding he "
mentioned the matter during a recent meeting held in Beijing with
visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists Iraq is still holding more than 600 Kuwaiti and
third country nationals detained by Iraqi troops during their
occupation of Kuwait in 1990 and early 1991, a charge rejected by
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The issue remains the major block to a direct Kuwaiti-Iraqi
contact. 
</P>
<P>
Tang is scheduled to meet on Saturday with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh
Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah. He will also hold talks with his Kuwaiti

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
's bypassing of Pakistan during his trip to South Asia next month
could aggravate tensions in the region, Pakistan's Ambassador
Malleeha Lodhi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has a declared objective of promoting peace
and security in South Asia. He will be defeating that objective if
he engages with only one country. He may unwittingly embolden the

<P>
Clinton has planned to visit India and Bangladesh, but has not
decided whether the South Asia tour includes Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Lodhi said former President Jimmy Carter bypassed Pakistan in
his 1978 visit to the region and the decision emboldened the
Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should be aware of the consequences of a
decision not to visit Pakistan," he said. "That would be
unwittingly sending signals. There is a law of unintended

<HEADLINE> Mexico Has 22.8 Bln Dlr Trade Surplus with U.S. in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexico had a record 22.8
billion dollar trade surplus with the United States in 1999 with a
two-way trade of 196 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mexico also set a record in annual exports to the United States
of 109 billion dollars, and an unprecedented 9.458 billion dollars
in December, said a report of the U.S. Commerce Department
received here.
</P>
<P>
U.S. statistics show that the two-way trade of electronic parts,
motor vehicles, and chemicals made Mexico the United States'
second trade partner, pushing Japan to third place.
</P>
<P>
Only Canada, with a bilateral trade of 364 billion dollars with
the United States, surpassed Mexico. Japan is third with an
accumulated trade of 188 billion dollars in 1999, said the monthly
report.
</P>
<P>
The new 1999 level of the Mexico-United States balance of trade
means a 13.3 percent increase over the 173.401 billion dollars of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the United States had a trade exchange of 81 billion
dollars in 1993, before the signing of the North America Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
Mexican exports increased 15.9 percent in 1999, going from 94.
629 billion dollars in 1998, to 109.706 billion dollars in 1999,
the highest in the history of the two countries' commercial
relations.
</P>

The United States' exports to Mexico also set a record by going

<HEADLINE> Greece to Continue Intercepting Turkish Fighters Over Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Air Force fighters
would intercept the Turkish warplanes if they infringed Greece's
national air space over the eastern Aegean Sea, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas stressed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reppas made the remark at a press briefing when he was
commenting on Turkish protests on the Greek fighters' interception
of Turkish jets.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reportedly planning to deliver a demarche to Athens
Monday over the alleged harassment of Turkish jets by Greek
fighters in the airspace over the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their dispute in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Although the strained relations between the two neighboring
countries have been improved since last June, Greece still accuses
Turkish fighters of violating the Athens Flight Information Region
(FIR) and its national air space over the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has urged Greece to enter into a dialogue over their
dispute in the Aegean Sea, but Greece has refused to do so because
Athens insists that it has no dispute with Turkey in the Aegean
but the delimitation of the Aegean continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
Greece Friday reiterated its stance that any discussion of
military dialogue over the Aegean should be based on a 1988
agreement signed by the then Greek and Turkish foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Friday that the full anti-aircraft coverage of
the Aegean and the Greek mainland would be secured by the end of
2001.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of six "Patriot 3" missile systems of small
and medium range, the anti-aircraft umbrella for the protection of
Greece would be complete, he said in northern Greece.

<HEADLINE> Spain Joins World Bank in Global Distance Learning Network Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
government of Spain jointly launched Friday a new program that
will enable learning organizations in Spain to share knowledge and
expertise with developing countries around the world via the use
of modern technology.
</P>
<P>
The new Distance Learning Center, which was unveiled at the
National University for Distance Education in Madrid, will provide
a multimedia learning environment through the use of the latest
communication technologies such as interactive video conference,
electronic classrooms, satellite communications and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed Friday via a two-
way video conference ceremony. Spanish Vice President Rodrigo de
Rato Figueredo signed the MOU for Spain at the Distance Learning
Center in Madrid and World Bank Managing Director Sven Sandstrom,
accompanied by World Bank Vice President for Latin America and the
Caribbean David de Ferranti signed for the World Bank in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
From its base in Madrid, the new center will link into the
World Bank's Global Distance Learning Network, which will begin
operations in 10 countries this summer. In addition to Spain and
the World Bank, the Global Distance Learning Network will involve
partnerships with other bilateral donors, private sectors,
multilateral institutions, specialized non-governmental
organizations and learning institutions from around the world.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bush Leads McCain in Two New Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W.
Bush leads Arizona Senator John McCain in two new polls on
Saturday's crucial Republican presidential primary in Carolina
State of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bush was ahead of McCain by 52 percent to 40 percent in a CNN-
USA Today-Gallup poll and had a 44 percent to 38 percent edge in
an NBC News poll released Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bush was ahead among Republicans, 66 percent to 28 percent,
while McCain had an advantage about as big among independents and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that in this race, the biggest variable is
the Republicans vs. the Independents and Democrats," said Frank
Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
But several other polls released earlier this week, including
the Palmetto Poll by Clemson University and the Mason-Dixon poll,
have indicated the race is a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he is confident that he will win Saturday's
primary while McCain, counting on crossover votes from
independents and Democrats, said he will prevail if the turnout is
large enough.
</P>
<P>
In South Carolina, voters don't register by party. Anyone can
vote in the Republican primary, including Democrats, who don't
have a primary but will hold caucuses on March 9.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a Bush win in South Carolina would restore
confidence and bolster his front-runner status, but another loss
would shake his campaign badly. Bush lost to McCain in the New
Hampshire primary on February 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a McCain win in the state would send him roaring
into Michigan Saturday, but a loss would raise questions about his
ability to draw Republican votes.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Foresees OPEC Output Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) could decide soon to raise its
production to stabilize the world market, said the Venezuelan
state oil company Friday.
</P>
<P>
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) Chairman Hector Ciavaldini said
that the OPEC could stabilize the world oil market with an
increase of its production of 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd) for
the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the high prices of oil caused instability in the
international market that has a deficit of a little more than 2
million bpd, so an output rise of 1 million bpd would not be
enough.
</P>
<P>
The excessive increase of the prices of oil, that surpassed the
30 dollars in the  U.S. market, could generate unfavorable
reactions in the economy of the developed economies, with higher
rates of interest, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez Thursday dismissed the
idea that his country, the world's third oil producer, would
modify in a unilateral way its quota, and said that it will wait
until the OPEC adopts a decision on the issue .
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi Thursday said he
believed the "ideal" crude oil price range was 20 to 25 dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the statements from two of the OPEC's most
influential members were viewed as the strongest indication yet
that the cartel is likely to boost output in March to map out a
production plan for the coming six months.

According to the preliminary calculations, the Dow index fell

<HEADLINE> 10 Civilians Kidnapped in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Ten persons were
kidnapped Friday by a group of guerrilla members who torched a
trailer truck in a false checkpoint that blocked a highway in the
north of Colombia, said military spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
The fake checkpoint was set up in a branch road some 60
kilometers south of Cartagena, where the People's Liberation Army
(EPL) rebels detained vehicles with travelers who rode on the so-
called Caribbean Trunk Road.
</P>
<P>
The EPL was demobilized in 1991 with a peace agreement that was
disowned by many of its members.
</P>
<P>
The EPL is the third most important guerrilla organization in
the country after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
and the National Liberation Army (ELN).

UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday expressed concern over the high level of
tension affecting south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is now on a trip to Asia, said in a statement issued

the potential for further destabilization of the already very

The U.N. Secretary-General reiterated his call to all parties
to exercise restraint and in particular to respect the
noncombatant status of civilians.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all parties would double their
efforts to achieve measurable progress in the peace process.
</P>

Tension has risen in recent weeks in south Lebanon after
Hizbollah killed several Israeli soldiers and Israel carried out
air attacks against three Lebanese power stations and suspected
Hizbollah targets.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Plunge On Fear Of Higher Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks plunged
with the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 300 points
Friday, the day after the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
warned of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index closed down 295.05 at 10,219.52. The blue chip
index fell more than 12 percent from its peak of 11,722.98 on
January 14.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 42.17 at 1,346.09 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 137.18 at 4,411.74.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell sharply on fear of high interest rates following
the harsh wards on inflation and interest rates from Greenspan
Thursday. The Federal Reserve chairman told the House Banking
Committee that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again to keep
inflation under control unless consumer spending and the stock
market quickly cool down.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday when Greenspan made his remarks, the Down index
fell 46.84 points but investors in technology stocks thumbed their
noses at the warning by driving the Nasdaq index up 121.27 pints
at 4,458.92, another new record.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged despite a government report on moderate
increase in January's Consumer Price Index. The Labor Department
said the CPI edged up a smaller than expected 0.2 percent in
January, indicating that inflation remains under control.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 14.59 at 586.67 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 5.50 at 931.96. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 12.74 at 545.68.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 3-to-1 on the New

<HEADLINE> Former French FM Dumas to Stand Trial For Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Former French Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas will stand trial for allegedly participating in abuse
of public fund, said two French judges on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The judges of investigation, Eva Joly and Laurence Vichnievsky,
signed an order on sending Dumas and his former mistress,
Christine Deviers-Joncour, to court over a case of corruption with
oil group Elf-Aquitaine
</P>
<P>
Dumas, 77, and Deviers-Joncour, 52, reportedly received an
estimated 65 million francs (10 million U.S. dollars) of illegal
payment and kick-backs from Elf.
</P>
<P>
The trial will last about six months, said French judicial
sources.
</P>
<P>
Dumas half resigned from his post as president of the Council
of State in March 1999 by leaving the post on ``paid holidays''
after Deviers-Joncour made public his sharing of the sum she
received from Elf.
</P>
<P>
The former foreign minister of the Socialist government under
President Francois Mitterrand was also accused of using his
influence to make Elf create a job for Deviers-Joncour.
</P>
<P>
Dumas was allegedly involved in the deal between France and
Taiwan over the sale of three French frigates made by the Thomson
CSF group in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Elf, representing Thomson CSF in the maneuver to persuade the
French government to give its greenlight to the deal, reportedly
paid Deviers-Joncour and Dumas a large amount of commission in the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Dumas, who was then foreign minister, was believed to have
played a decisive role in obtaining the agreement of the Elysee
presidential palace to the arms sale.
