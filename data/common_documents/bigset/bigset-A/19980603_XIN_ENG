<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin met
ten tycoons in the Kremlin Tuesday to discuss settlement of the
recent turmoil on Russia's financial market.
</P>
<P>
The ten business leaders showed their support for the Russian
government at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that Russia's situation is difficult but that
Russia "has a highly skilled government which is taking the
necessary measures," the president's spokesman, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, told a briefing after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Russia's stock market sharply tumbled last week primarily due
to investors' concerns over the young Russian cabinet's ability to
handle the economic problems under the impact of the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The main stock index has plunged 44 percent since the beginning
of May and the government has tripled interest rates to as high as
150 percent to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they also discussed changes to the tax
system, measures to solve nonpayment problems and proposals on
tariffs for electricity, gas and railroad transportation.

<HEADLINE> International Labor Conference to Address Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The 86th International Labor
Conference began here Tuesday with the abolition of extreme forms
of child labor as its immediate goal.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, representatives from governments,
employers and trade unions greeted hundreds of marchers who have
crossed over 100 countries this year in a "Global March Against
Child Labor" to demonstrate their opposition to child labor.
</P>
<P>
"You are far from your homes, but you have a home here," said
Michel Hansenne, Director-General of the International Labor
Organization (ILO). "We are going to develop some tools which can
be used by everyone wishing to bring an end to child labor."
</P>
<P>
In order to change the situation that millions of children are
exposed daily to exploitation, risks of accident, diseases, and
deaths, Hansenne said, the ILO will try "to identify, confront and
eliminate without delay" the extreme forms of child labor at its
annual conference in Geneva on June 2-18.
</P>
<P>
Conference President Jean-Jacques Oechslin said that the
current conference would be devoted to finding ways to protect
child laborers.
</P>
<P>
"Children represent the most vulnerable segment of our
societies and we cannot tolerate their exploitation under any
pretext whatsoever," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ILO estimates that 250 million children at the age of
between 5 and 14 in the developing countries have to work full
time or part time, of whom 61 percent are in Asia, 32 percent in
Africa, and seven percent in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Multiply U.S. Sales of Heroin: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Mexican drug cartels are now
producing some of the world's most potent heroin and are seizing
control of a rapidly growing share of the U.S. heroin business,
said The Washington Post on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Mexican drug dealers were long regarded as
peddlers of cheap, low-grade heroin that accounted for only a tiny
portion of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico has become the second-largest source of heroin used in
the United States, and the purity of the Mexican-produced drug has
increased sixfold in the past two years in what U.S. law
enforcement and health authorities describe as alarming trends,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The changes are tied to an emerging alliance between a
Colombian heroin trafficking organization and Mexican drug
smuggling groups that are learning how to produce more potent
heroin.
</P>
<P>
The largest evidence of the new alliance emerged in October
when Mexican officials arrested two Colombians and a Mexican near
the North Mexican town of Durango.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic shift, Colombian and Mexican drug cartels largely
have taken over distribution in the U.S. from Asian organizations,
whose share of the American market has plunged from 90 percent to
28 percent since 1992, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted U.S. officials as saying that the shift in the heroin
supply coincides with a disturbing turn in drug consumption in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The number of heroin users has risen from 500,000 to 600,000
over the past two years while that of cocaine users has dropped
significantly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The purity of heroin from Mexico also increased significantly.
Until two years ago, Mexican cartels produced only a low grade of
heroin called "black tar," which was about seven to 20 percent
pure.
</P>
<P>
"But the purity of Mexican heroin has since climbed to an
average of 50 to 60 percent, with some seizures recorded at 76
percent purity," said the report.
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities discovered the dramatic rise in purity levels
of Mexican heroin when 14 teenagers and young adults in one Dallas
suburb died in 1996 after using "uncut" Mexican heroin so pure
that it exploded in their systems like a bomb.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Climb 5.2 Pct to New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Stimulated by a home-buying heat
in the South, the U.S. new home sales jumped 5.2 percent to a
record in April, the Commerce Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sales picked up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
888,000, the most since the government began tracking them in
1963, and thus surpassed the old record of 881,000 set in
February, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The home-buying enthusiasm is largely attributed to low
mortgage rates as well as low unemployment which hit a 28-year low
of 4.3 percent in April and steady rising income.
</P>
<P>
April marks the eighth consecutive month of sales above
800,000, the longest such period on record. The next longest
string above 800,000 for five months was recorded in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The new home sales in April were especially strong in the
South, where sales soared 18.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 418,000, the most since December 1983.
</P>
<P>
Sales fell 9.2 percent to a rate of 157,000 in the Midwest, 3.1
percent to 95,000 in the Northeast and 0.5 percent to 218,000 in
the West.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median price of an existing home was 147,000 in
April, down 2 percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accuses Austria of Adopting Negative Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Tuesday accused Austrian
Prime Minister Victor Klima of adopting a negative attitude toward
Ankara's efforts to win membership of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"Klima seems to be at the same point reached by the (EU)
Luxembourg summit and does not reflect the genuine realities,"
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan told a weekly
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Klima said recently in an interview with the French newspaper
Le Figaro that Turkey would not be admitted into the EU in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's (EU) candidateship does not seem to be acceptable."
Klima said.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided at the December summit to exclude Turkey from
its immediate expansion process, sparking harsh reaction from
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the new president of the EU will be able to come
closer to the realities and have a more realistic evaluation of
the situation," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Austria is to hold EU's rotating presidency on July 1 after
Britain's term expires.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been striving to enter the EU. But so far no
substantial progress has been made due to a number of differences
with the 15-nation organization.

LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
Mo Mowlam on Tuesday confirmed that former Hong Kong governor
Chris Patten will head a commission to review the role of Northern
Ireland's Protestant-dominated police force.
</P>
<P>
"Can I take the opportunity this morning to confirm that the
commission will be under the chairmanship of Chris Patten," Mowlam
told the annual police federation conference in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Patten, the former chairman of the opposition party the
Conservative, had said he would accept the post if the peace deal
was approved by the May 22 referendum. A majority of voters have
endorsed the historic peace agreement in the referendum, paving
the way for the ending of the 30-year-long conflict in the divided
province.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said she hoped to announce all the members of the
commission, whose review of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)
was agreed as part of the peace accord, by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the RUC's members are pro-British
Protestant and the police force has long been a target of
suspicion and hostility by Northern Ireland's minority Roman
Catholic community. Irish Republican Army's political wing Sinn
Fein has insisted on the reform of the RUC as part of the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam assured the 13,000-strong RUC that the pact would not
lead to the force's disbandment, as demanded by Sinn Fein.

<HEADLINE> UK Takes Measures to Punish World Cup hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) - Britain has reached an agreement with
France, which forbids UK football fans who cause trouble at this
year's World Cup to return to France for the rest of the
tournament, Home Secretary Jack Straw announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Straw told a news conference that under the deal with France,
any British hooligan convicted of a football related offense at
the World Cup could face court action at home on their return in
addition to any punishment handed down by the French judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He said that English and Welsh courts could impose restriction
orders on top of punishment imposed in France.
</P>
<P>
"I have sought to ensure that we do everything we can help to
ensure that those who are decent and law-abiding are able to watch
football in safety and comfort," Straw said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that last year, Straw had encouraged judges to
use restriction orders when convicting anyone of a soccer-related
crime as one of the measures to prevent UK fans from causing
trouble.
</P>
<P>
At present 65 UK football troublemakers have been imposed
restriction orders to prevent them from attending the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Straw said that he expected the number of orders to increase
before the World Cup begins on June 10 in France as many cases of
football violence are still underway in courts and some other
troublemakers may be arrested at other matches before then.

<TEXT>
<P>
Peres, also a Knesset (parliament) member, made the remark
while commenting on the ongoing political debate in Israel whether
the Labor Party should support Netanyahu in a parliamentary vote
on Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank and provide a
political safety net to him if the vote is turned into a motion of
no-confidence.
</P>
<P>
Troop redeployment is crucial to the peace process and Labor
should provide a political safety net to Netanyahu in Knesset
because Labor's policy is to have peace with the Palestinians and
all other Arab nations, Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Ruling coalition whip Meir Sheetrit from Likud called on the
Labor on Monday to support Netanyahu on the second troop
redeployment and provide a political safety net in parliament if
the redeployment issue goes to the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Senior Labor Knesset members met on Monday and discussed this
request, but decided not to take any position right now.
</P>
<P>
Sheetrit said he will call on Netanyahu to bring the second
troop redeployment up for a vote in the Knesset without worrying
about the threat by Knesset members on the far right to vote
against it.
</P>
<P>
But the coalition National Religious Party (NRP) has urged
Netanyahu to ignore Sheetrit's call for a safety net, saying a
safety net won't help a prime minister who loses the trust of
senior members of his coalition.
</P>
<P>
NRP opposes the government to hand any more West Bank
land over to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Welcomes Proposed ILO Convention on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has hailed a new convention proposed by the International
Labor Organization (ILO), saying that it will be a milestone in
the worldwide campaign to eliminate all forms of hazardous child
labor.
</P>
<P>
"Only as we get rid of working practices which expose children
to injury, illness and death will we be on the road to abolishing
all forms of labor which deprive children of their fundamental
rights," UNICEF's Executive Director Carol Bellamy said here
Tuesday when commenting on the ILO convention under discussion.
</P>
<P>
The convention will be debated at the ILO's annual conference
here on June 2-18. Among the proposed provisions are measures for
the immediate halt to extreme and exploitative forms of child
labor and the creation of national programs to protect the very
young, especially girls.
</P>
<P>
The new convention would establish criteria for determining
work hazards and would also designate certain practices as
criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 percent of primary school children in developing
countries drop out before completion, according to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF calls on governments to allocate 20 percent of their
budget to education and basic social services and on donors to do
the same with their official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that it would cost six billion U.S. dollars a
year, on top of what is already spent, to put every child in
school by the year 2000. It points out that this is less than one
percent of what the world spends every year on weapons.

<HEADLINE> Pak Decision to Go Nuclear "Understandable": Iranian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reaffirmed here Tuesday that "the decision by Pakistan to
go ahead with the (nuclear) tests is understandable under the
prevailing circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who left for India Tuesday afternoon, made the
remarks in a statement issued at the end of his two-day visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the regional situation, "we received a full
briefing by Pakistan on the events which led to their decision to
conduct the tests and their present stand on the situation and
what might lie ahead."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan, we feel, is genuinely prepared for dialogue with
India and that there are possible ideas which may be explored that
could contribute to reducing tension and containing the situation
while the larger issues are being considered," the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"As the result, we have felt useful to go to New Delhi to
engage in discussion and further explore the possibilities for
gradually enhancing the level and means of confidence and reducing
tension with peace and security of the region in mind," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who arrived here Monday afternoon on a two-day visit
to Pakistan, is the highest-ranking foreign official to have come
to this country after its six nuclear tests on May 28 and 30.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that although the visit had been
short, he was able to have in-depth and extensive discussions on
all issues of mutual interest as well as regional matters.
</P>
<P>
On economic relations, Iran and Pakistan have agreed and
decided to pursue attentively expansion of trade in various areas.
The two countries particularly examined in detail the proposed
major oil and gas projects, according to Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan issue has been on the top of the agenda. Kharrazi
said that Pakistan and Iran are now in "full agreement that there
is no military solution for Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
"The two countries will, from now on, work jointly to bring the
(warring Afghan) parties to the negotiating table and to
facilitate a political settlement," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, the Iranian Foreign Minister called on
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and held talks with his Pakistani
counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan and Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Siddique Kanju.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Appeals for 7.3 Million Dollars for Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) issued here Tuesday an urgent appeal for 7.3
million U.S. dollars to help refugees who have fled killings,
mutilation and rape by rebel forces in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The amount needed by UNHCR should cover relief aid for the new
arrivals in Guinea and Liberia through the year's end.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that most of the new arrivals are women and children
and many are suffering from severe malnutrition and various
diseases contracted while hiding in the bush to evade rebel
atrocities before they were able to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has reinforced staff in Guinea and Liberia and is rushing
in food, blankets, and jerrycans ahead of the rainy season. It is
also working with other relief organizations to set up health,
water, medical and social services in the camps.
</P>
<P>
"The people who fled Sierra Leone are in terrible shape, and we
have to do all in our power to help them," said Soren
Jessen-Petersen, UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner who visited
the victims of atrocities and refugee camps in the border area in
Guinea at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, 182,000 Sierra Leoneans have swept into
Guinea and another 55,000 to Liberia, swelling the number of
Sierra Leonean refugees in the two countries over seven years of
civil strife to 530,000, according to UNHCR. The influx into
Liberia has stopped, but small numbers continue to arrive in
Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Talks With Israeli Minister "Fruitful" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
Tuesday he had "fruitful" talks with visiting Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on ways to reactivate the deadlocked
Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told reporters at the end of his talks with the Israeli
official that Mordechai's Cairo visit came at his invitation.
</P>
<P>
"Our meetings have been fruitful. We met this time to see what
are the means which could help push forward the peace process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who arrived here before noon, has left for
home. Defense and Military Production Minister Mohamed Hussein
Tantawi, Mubarak's Political Advisor Ossama el-Baz and Israeli
Ambassador here Zvi Mazel attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which fought three wars with Israel in the past 30
years, became the first Arab nation to make peace with the Jewish
state in 1979. It has also been an important mediator in the
Arab-Israeli peace talks since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"Those who took part in war know the meaning of war and the
meaning of peace," said the president, who himself rose from the
military barracks.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio reports earlier, Mordechai's talks
with Mubarak were expected to focus on the Israeli proposal to
withdraw from South Lebanon, the strategic situation in the Middle
East and means to push forward the peace process, especially on
the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
He was believed to have explained to Egyptian officials the
Israeli stance and security requirements regarding the Israeli
second stage troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled for more
than 14 months since Israel began to build a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Israel has rejected a latest U.S. proposal on a 13 percent
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, whereas the Palestinian
National Authority has accepted it.

<HEADLINE> Intergration of African Culture in Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan minister Tuesday called
for the integration of African culture in science education when
opening the seventh Pan African Children's Book Fair here in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 sub-Saharan African states attended the show
through the African Publishing Network. They are Kenya,
Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mauritius,
Namibia, Mali, Malawi, Senegal, Ghana, Cote d'Ivore, Botswana and
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony on Tuesday afternoon, Joseph Nyagah,
Kenyan Minister of Information and Broadcasting, urged Africa to
take steps to enhance "cross fertilization of science with
African culture in the development and provision of children's
education."
</P>
<P>
"It's essential to cultivate children's interest in science at
an early age in order to create a seed-bed for a technology
culture" in Africa on its way to industrialization, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "while selective exposure to foreign cultural
materials in the media may broaden your knowledge, the basic
challenge is to be proud of your own heritage," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He strongly called for "serious efforts to promote our
(Africa's) own indigenous cultural productions."
</P>
<P>
"Our TV and radio program producers, film makers and others in
the entertainment and information sectors must come up with
attractive and interesting products which reflect the rich
cultural heritage of our people so as to curb dependence on
imported media programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Africans, both adults and children, "are continually bombarded
by the out-pouring of popular culture," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Relevant education for the young people plays an important
role in the projection of national image," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he praised that the annual book fair acts as "an
international forum dedicated to focusing attention on the
information and reading needs of young people throughout the
continent."
</P>
<P>
The "book fair has undergone tremendous growth over the years"
since it was first launched in the Kenyan capital in 1992 with
"only two participating countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of kinds of colorful books for children aged between
two and 17 are on display at the fair under the theme of
"Learning Science at an Early Age."
</P>
<P>
Five school children received this year's Librarians and Avid
Readers Award at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the fair include the launch of the
build-a-home-library campaign and the inauguration of a discount
book store and a book club.
</P>
<P>
Besides book exhibition and sales, there will also be a
children's reading tent, art and science workshop, an artists'
bazaar, children's reading competitions and a series relevant
seminars.
</P>
<P>
The six-day fair, which draws participants from nearly 40
countries both in Africa and beyond, is organized by the
Foundation for the Promotion of Children's Science Publications
in Africa formed in 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday rejected
Nigeria's accusations that it was planning to disrupt Nigeria's
coming election, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was not interfering in Nigeria's domestic
affairs, let alone undermining its electoral process,
presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said in response to a
statement issued by Nigeria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Abacha government said in the statement that South Africa,
the United States and Ghana were plotting to disrupt Nigeria's
presidential elections in August, and that officials from the
United States and South Africa recently met in Ghana to discuss
coordinated action.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana dismissed the claims as "just an electoral trick",
which the Abacha regime designed to mobilize voters "against as
many enemies as possible" on the eve of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said South Africa's track record showed that it
would not cooperate with any non-African country to bring another
African government into disrepute or destabilize it.
</P>
<P>
South Africa believed its relations with Nigeria were on a
firm footing, he said.

TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The explosion at the Islamic

the incident took place at 1:45 p.m. local time (0915 GMT) when
explosives related to a case under investigation were being

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Tuesday rejected a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over his performance during his first two
years in office.
</P>
<P>
The motion was defeated by a vote of 41-6 with 3 abstentions,
as most of the ruling coalition parties boycotted it and didn't
took part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, at least 61 members of the 120-seat Knesset
must vote in favor of a no-confidence motion for the prime
minister to step down. The coalition parties are currently
occupying 61 seats.
</P>
<P>
The motion was submitted by four opposition parties -- Labor,
Meretz, Hadash and National Democratic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
When summing up Netanyahu's two years in office last week,
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak accused Netanyahu of leading the
nation to war and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Barak predicted a violent confrontation in the region that
will result in heavy casualties, caused by the stalemate in the
peace process and Netanyahu's putting his political survival
above the talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has taken a tough stance in the peace process since
he took office in June, 1996. And the Israeli-Palestinian talks
have been deadlocked for more than one year after Israel began to
build a controversial Jewish settlement in the eastern
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Smaller Trade Gap with Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Tuesday called for a solution to the trade
imbalance between South Africa and Malawi, saying his country's
big trade surplus with Malawi is hampering the development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is that trade imbalance, the relations will
never really improve completely," Mandela said after meeting
visiting Malawian President Bakili Muluzi in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Between January and August last year, South Africa's exports
to Malawi stood at 728 million Rand (146 million U.S. Dollars),
compared with its imports from Malawi of 248 million Rand (50
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both countries would have to explore the best approach to
achieve equity in trade, South African Press Association quoted
Mandela as saying.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi, accompanied by his ministers of foreign affairs and
commerce as well as a large business delegation, began a
three-day state visit to South Africa on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit was aimed at strengthening cooperation and
encouraging business between the private sectors of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Malawian Foreign Minister Mopopa Chipeta said he hoped that
this trip would produce a "clear plan of action" for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi met South African parliament's presiding officers and
was scheduled to tour Robben Island, where Mandela had been
jailed for 18 years, on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He would be the guest of honor at a banquet hosted by Mandela
later on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Egypts Renews Call for Nuclear-Free Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Tuesday called for a principled system to free the Middle East
from weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He was telling reporters after meeting visiting Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai here.
</P>
<P>
"We call to make the area from weapons of mass destruction,"
Mubarak said, when asked to comment on Egypt's position towards
the recent nuclear tests in India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"I ask that there should be a principle to end weapons of mass
destruction all over the world and there should be an
international initiative over a number of years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has issued two initiatives in 1974 and 1991 calling for
freeing the Middle East from weapons of mass destruction in
general and nuclear weapons in particular.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed difference with Iran's reported stance that
every Muslim felt safe following the Pakistani nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"I shall feel safe if all weapons of mass destruction were
removed because this would give security to everybody in the
world," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, whose country is believed to be the only nuclear
power in the region, said Israel wants to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We want to sign the treaty. We should not think of arms. We
should think of peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official refused to draw comparison between the
situation in Middle East and the South Asian subcontinent where
India detonated five nuclear devices early in May, followed by
Pakistan's six nuclear blasts two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
"We live in the Middle East and not in India or Pakistan. We
look forward to realizing peace,"
</P>
<P>
Mordechai flew back to Israel Tuesday afternoon after a
few-hours visit to Cairo. Mubarak said they had "fruitful" talks
on ways to reactivate the deadlocked Mideast peace march.

<HEADLINE> French Bullet Train Maker to Sell 20 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The French bullet train maker
GEC-Alsthom will begin to sell some 20 billion francs (3.3 billion
U.S. dollars) worth of stocks from later this month, announced the
group's president and chief executive officer Pierre Bilger on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The group, which also sells electricity and builds electrical
energy centers, will from now be independent and separated from
the General Electric Company (GEC) of Britain -- with which it
allied in 1989 -- and the Alcatel telecommunications group of
France.
</P>
<P>
Alsthom, now renamed Alstom, will begin to introduce from June
22 its shares in Paris, London and New York simultaneously, with
each of its shares worth from 190 to 220 francs (from 32 to 37
U.S. dollars), said Bilger.
</P>
<P>
"Alstom will be a company with fully responsible exercise for
its own destiny," said Bilger.
</P>
<P>
He said that Alstom aims to become the world's leader in two of
the three fields of its specialties -- transmission and
distribution of electricity and equipment of railways and trains.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-Swedish ABB group is now the number one in the world
in electricity transmission and distribution business, while the
Swedish-Swiss-German Adtranz is the top producer of equipments for
railways and trains. Alstom remains the second in the two fields.
</P>
<P>
Alstom is also the number two in electrical energy business
after the General Electric of the United States, but it will not
try to surpass GE, said Bilger.
</P>
<P>
It will also abandon its Dutch legal registration and be fully
based in Paris, while its governing board imitates the model of
American companies with five non-executive chief officers.
</P>
<P>
Alstom is the joint candidate with the German Siemens for
building the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed train railway project.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the economic and financial crisis in some Asian
countries will affect the strategy of the group in the region,
Bilger said that it will not, because the countries most touched
by the crisis only have a small percentage of the investment by
the group in the region.
</P>
<P>
China and India remain the two major markets of investment for
Alstom, he said.

<HEADLINE> African Summit to Seek Ways to Maintain Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Tuesday the upcoming summit of the Organization of the
African Unity will seek ways to settle disputes through peaceful
means and maintain peace on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who will lead Egypt's delegation to a ministerial
meeting and the summit held in Burkina Faso on June 4-10, told
reporters that political and security problems in Africa will top
the agenda of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems in Africa's political, economic and social
situations, Moussa said, the continent still boasts successes as
"a general economic growth indicates progress."
</P>
<P>
"Political awareness in Africa is also growing, with border
disputes and their consequent instability and refugee problems now
a known bane," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of an African mechanism for managing and
solving inter-African conflicts is a great development within the
African action framework," the Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the ability of conflict-management of
African countries have been greatly sapped by their financial
predicament.
</P>
<P>
He said the financial crisis that faces the Organization of the
African Unity is more critical than ever before and thus blocks
the mechanism from playing an effective role.

MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An intergovernmental agreement on
plutonium was signed here by Russia, Germany and France on
Tuesday, according to Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement the Russian nuclear power plants will be
able to use the plutonium obtained from dismantled nuclear
warheads and no longer needed for the country's defense.
</P>
<P>
Russian Minister for Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov after the
signing ceremony said, "This refers to the 50 tonnes of plutonium,
which will be processed into fuel and initially used at the
existing power plants without any substantial modification of
their reactors."
</P>
<P>
Adamov said experts from the three countries will be given two
years to draw up a feasibility study of the project. After that a
decision will be made on the construction in Russia of an
installation to turn weapons-grade plutonium into fuel for nuclear
power plants.
</P>
<P>
In Adamov's opinion, such use of weapons-grade plutonium will
decide two problems -- non-proliferation of nuclear technologies
and fuel supply to the power industry.

<HEADLINE> International Community Urged to Stop Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) officials Tuesday called on the international community to
take concrete steps to stop Israeli settlement activities in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help foreign diplomats have a clearer
understanding of "gravity" of the situation in East Jerusalem,
PNA Minister of Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi and Minister for
Jerusalem Affairs Faisai Husseini led a group of foreign consuls
in Jerusalem to visit a disputed land in the Muslim quarter of
the Old City Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The land, where dozens of Jewish students from the Ateret
Cohanim religious school set up several temporary shacks last
Monday and thus triggered a violent clash between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian legislators, was empty again after the
municipal authority ordered the students to leave and the shacks
to be torn down.
</P>
<P>
But the Antiquities Authority of Israel will begin an
exploratory excavation there under an agreement it reached with
the municipality and the Ateret Cohanim authority.
</P>
<P>
Husseini described the move as another attempt to build a
settlement in the Arab East Jerusalem, saying it would make the
negotiations between Israel and the PNA "more complicated." He
urged the Israeli side to stop such settlement actions in order
to make the permanent status talks "sooner and easier."
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said Jerusalem is a "human heritage" and the focal
point of Israeli peace talks "not only with the Palestinians, but
also with the whole Arab world".
</P>
<P>
She urged the international community to take "concrete steps"
to put an end to "Israeli violations" of the Palestinian rights
over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We have to rescue Jerusalem, rescue the lands, rescue the
Palestinians and the peace itself," she said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Old City tour, Ashrawi and Husseini had a meeting
with the foreign consuls at the New Orient House, the informal
office of the PNA in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which lasted about one hour, the PNA officials
briefed the foreign diplomats on Israeli settlement activities in
East Jerusalem, including a plan to build a 50-apartment
settlement in the center of the Old City.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Israel and the Palestinians over East
Jerusalem have flared up recently, mainly because of what the
Palestinians called intensified efforts by Israel to demolish
Arabic houses and build Jewish settlement there.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that two empty houses in East Jerusalem
were demolished Tuesday morning, but Palestinian sources put the
number at five and said all the houses belong to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
No issue is more volatile than that of the status of Jerusalem
in Israeli-Palestinian talks. Israel claims the entire city as its
"united and eternal capital" while the Palestinians want East
Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

<HEADLINE> Conference Calls for Addressing Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- K. Y. Amoako, Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), Tuesday called for policy options in addressing Africa's
underdevelopment in the field of communication technology and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the global connectivity for Africa
conference which opened here Tuesday, Amoako noted, "One aspect
of the policy option deserving attention is the fact that the
sector remains heavily dominated by state-run post and
telecommunications monopolies."
</P>
<P>
"The increasing demand for advanced communications
technologies is also putting increased pressure on the limited
infrastructure base in the sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the globalization is bringing about unique
challenges in information technology for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Forty seven African countries have Internet connectivity today
compared to a mere four in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, excluding South Africa, only one person in ten
thousand has access to the Internet, which is in any event
dominated by content produced in the northern countries, he said,
adding that "an overwhelming majority of Africans remain at the
very margins of the information age."
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is the first regional follow-up to
last year's Toronto Global Knowledge Conference. It is hosted by
ECA, the World Bank group, the Information for Development
Program, the International Telecommunication Union and the
African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The conference will provide a unique opportunity for
participants, including more than 30 African telecommunications
ministers, representatives of civil society as well as private
African and non-African corporations and operators, to engage in
frank dialog on the issues and options of connectivity open to
the continent and the value of information for Africa in terms of
trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The conference is believed to evolve concrete proposals for
cooperation in the telecommunications sector towards overcoming
Africa's development challenges.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Arab Summit Is None of Israeli Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Tuesday brushed off an Israeli criticism of a proposed Arab
Summit, saying the summit only responds to Arab will to salvage
the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
"Holding an Arab Summit is to free the peace process of the
deadly shackles placed by the incumbent Israeli leadership," PNA
chief delegate to the Arab League Mohamed Sobeih told Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"It is exclusively an internal affair of the Arabs that does
not need permission from anyone else," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih, who is also secretary of the Palestinian National
Council, dismissed statements by David Bar-Illan, senior aide to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that seeking to hold an
Arab summit is a "flagrant violation" of the Oslo agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo agreement bans taking such measures as it stipulates
settling dispute within a direct negotiation framework and through
a mediator acceptable by both parties, the Israeli official
claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan was quoted by Israeli Radio as making comments on the
proposed Arab summit in Damascus or the Cairo-based Arab League
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih said Bar-Illan's statements only "inspired ridicule and
surprise on the part of Arab public and all peace-lovers
worldwide."
</P>
<P>
"An Arab summit meeting does not heed such statements. Instead,
it seeks the help of world's major powers to put an end to such
provocative statements by the Israeli leadership," he added.
</P>
<P>
Both the world public opinion and peace-loving forces in Israel
know who wants to destroy the peace process by getting it to the
current tragic situation, Sobeih said.
</P>
<P>
An Arab Summit, which has been called for by Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat, is likely to take
place in Cairo early in June to tackle the flagging peace process,
according to Arab diplomatic sources here.
</P>
<P>
But PNA Secretary General Al Tayeb Abdel Raheem said Tuesday
that the proposed Arab Summit will not be held before the United
States officially announces its peace initiative and names the
party that is responsible for blocking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
to PNA President Yasser Arafat has promised that the U.S. will
officially announce its peace proposal soon.
</P>
<P>
Washington has reportedly proposed an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13.1 percent of the West Bank, but Netanyahu turned it down.
</P>
<P>
Launching a drive for an Arab Summit, Arafat last week held
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz, Moroccan King Hassan II and President Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan Al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates. He will extend the
campaign to Oman on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks collapsed 14 months ago after
Israel started to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
where the Palestinians want as their future capital.

BONN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB) made
its start-up in Frankfurt on Tuesday with its six-member board
convening their first meeting to prepare for the launch of the
single European currency euro on January 1, 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Urges International Community to Repond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Olara A. Otunnu, Special
Representative of U.N. Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict, on Tuesday urged the international community to make
Sierra Leone a pilot project for a more concerted and effective
response to the needs of children affected by war.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, who had just concluded a four-day visit to Sierra
Leone, said that one of the most pressing challenges facing the
country today is the "crisis of the youth" -- the plight of
children affected directly and indirectly by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Special Representative said there are many serious
manifestations of the impact of the prolonged conflict on the
children, including street children, child combatants, displaced
children, unaccompanied children, victims of atrocities, and the
collapse of health and education services.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu identified five areas requiring urgent action by the
international community: the demobilization and reintegration of
child combatants; the resettlement of internally displaced
persons; the tracing of families of unaccompanied children; the
rehabilitation and support of victims without limbs; and the
provision and rehabilitation of medical and educational services.
</P>
<P>
The Representative urged the international community to make
the rehabilitation of the children of Sierra leone a pilot project
for post-conflict reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of children in Sierra Leone is very serious but
not overwhelming. The situation can be turned around with
carefully organized and targeted assistance. Providing new hope
for the children of Sierra Leone may well be the best way to
ensure national recovery for the country as a whole," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Dialog with Syria on Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian government
official said here on Tuesday that it is necessary for Jordan and
Syria to conduct direct dialog in order to iron out their
differences over the convening of an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister for Development and Minister of Foreign
Affairs Jawad Anani made the remarks after Saudi Arabian Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz failed Monday to reconcile the
stances between Syria and Jordan over the agenda and venue of the
proposed summit aimed at reactivating the long-stalled Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Direct dialog between the two countries can help Jordan
understand the Syrian position on the summit in specific terms,
so that the kingdom can know what on earth the differences are
between them and finally iron them out, Anani told reporters at
the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We do not specifically know what the Syrian position is
because we did not open a direct dialog with Syria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan holds that careful preparations are needed to enhance
Arab coordination on the convocation of such a summit and the
Jordanian-Syrian dialog is just part of it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has called for an Arab summit
to blame Israel for the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations which have been deadlocked for more than a year
over the construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Syria reportedly wants the summit to be held in its capital,
Damascus, while Jordan prefers the summit to be held in the
Egyptian capital of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi crown prince arrived here Monday from Syria. His
visit to Amman aims to reconcile the views of Syria and Jordan,
which fears that an Arab summit will put brakes on its
normalization of ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and bilateral
cooperation has been conducted in the fields of trade, airport
construction and water supply.

<P>
MAPUTO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) issued a
communique here Tuesday, expressing regret that no agreement has
been reached between the Mozambican government and the
oppositions on local elections.
</P>
<P>
But the EU said it recognized that the National Resistance of
Mozambique (RENAMO), the country's biggest opposition, and other
15 opposition parties have the right to freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
These parties have decided not to participate in the local
elections on June 30 in the excuse that there were malpractice in
the registration process last year.
</P>
<P>
"To establish democracy in Mozambique is a process in which
all Mozambicans should participate," EU said in the communique.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU didn't mention whether it will cease the
financial support to the forthcoming local elections. It is one
of the major supporters in the Mozambique local elections.
</P>
<P>
RENAMO issued a communique not long ago, appealing to the EU
to stop its financial support in the country's local elections.
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambique's National Committee of Elections, the
ruling Mozambique Liberation Front, the Democratic Union, and 12
other independent groups are among those to take part in the
coming elections.

<HEADLINE> Britons Back Proportional Voting System, Poll Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
said on Tuesday Britain's next election, due by mid-2002, might be
held under a more proportional voting system if a referendum
approved a change.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after an opinion poll showed that most
Britons would scrap the first-past-the-post voting system which
gave Prime Minister Tony Blair his big parliamentary majorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, conducted by NOP, 72 percent of voters
backed a change to proportional representation. The figure fell to
57 percent after pollsters gave a concise summary of the arguments
for the first-past-the-post system.
</P>
<P>
Straw told the parliament that the commission was expected to
report in October, followed by a referendum "well before the next
election."
</P>
<P>
Campaigners for a switch to proportional representation for the
lower House of Commons welcomed the poll.
</P>
<P>
"What this tells us is that before we even begin campaigning,
we have got this great bedrock of support," Andrew Puddephatt,
director of the constitutional change pressure group Charter 88,
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Before last year's election Blair promised British voters a
referendum on whether to keep the present single-seat constituency
system, which benefits large parties, or to switch to a specific
PR alternative.
</P>
<P>
He has set up a committee to decide precisely which PR system
should be on offer at the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Any electoral system in which seats won by a party were broadly
proportional to its share of the total vote would produce a
seismic change in British politics.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Accepts British Explanation on War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides Tuesday expressed satisfaction with explanations made
by British High Commissioner to Cyprus David Madden over a report
on war in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
But Kasoulides did not elaborate on the British explanations
when he was speaking to reporters before leaving for Italy to
attend a European Union meeting.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Sunday Times newspaper reported on Sunday that
Britain has contingency plan to airlift 250,000 people from Cyprus
over fears of a war if Cyprus goes ahead with the deployment of
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles later this year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he is still "not satisfied with the
leak of information in this case."
</P>
<P>
He said he told Madden at a meeting Monday that the leaking of
information by the British Defense Office to the press does not
contribute to good bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Madden has said the British government has nothing to do with
the report.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said Cyprus' High Commissioner to Britain Michalis
Attalides made representations Monday to the British Foreign
Office over the report.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed the missile deal with Russia in January 1997. The
missiles are scheduled to be delivered in August. Turkey, the
United States and Britain oppose the deal. Turkey has threatened
to destroy the missiles if they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has said its stand on the issue has not changed. But,
meanwhile, it has made it clear that it would consider not to
deploy the missiles if substantive progress is achieved in seeking
a settlement of the Cyprus problem or demilitarization of the
island is agreed by the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Referring to efforts to settle the protracted Cyprus problem,
the Cypriot foreign minister did not rule out the possibility of a
recourse to the United Nations Security Council if the deadlock in
the peace talks is not overcome until autumn.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot peace process came to a halt last summer when
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the talks with
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides in protest at European Union's
decision to start accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said that he would not return to the negotiations
unless his entity in northern Cyprus controlled by the Turkish
Cypriots is recognized and the Cypriot government suspends the
talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island to protect the Turkish ethnic minorities after a failed
coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua ) -- Russia has expressed wishes
to work with Tanzania in developing agriculture, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Co-operatives public relations officer Jumanne
Mnyau said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has made a proposal aiming at revamping
Tanzania's agricultural sector and consolidating the agricultural
relationship between the two countries, Mnyau said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tanzanian Minister of Agriculture and Co-operatives Paul
Kimiti received proposals from the Russian ambassador Boku
Zavgayer on ways of improving agriculture on behalf of Russian

expertise, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian government plans to provide technology and
low cost agricultural equipment to the Tanzanian farmers, and
suggests the two countries launch coordination projects and
establish a co-operation trade center which will be beneficial to
farmers of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti thanked the Russian government's proposals and said his
ministry is going to work on them and then make decisions.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry is conducting research on advanced
agricultural equipment to ease the burden of farmers especially

<HEADLINE> Clinton Advocates Statistical Sampling in Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday advocated using statistical sampling to avoid undercounts
of minorities and the rural poor in the national census 2000.
</P>
<P>
Congressional Republicans have already voiced objection to the
method.
</P>
<P>
"It's not about politics, it's about people," news reports
quoted Clinton as saying when he visited a community center in a
heavily Latino community in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said severe undercounting of populations such as
children, minorities and homeless people is now hurting attempts
to funnel federal help to those who need it. He said the experts
agree that using statistical sampling, along with "quality checks"
that involve head counts in certain neighborhoods, can reduce the
error rate to 1/10 of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
That would mean only about 300,000 Americans may be missed in
the next census count, rather than the millions overlooked in the
1990 tally, he said.
</P>
<P>
With that tally, an estimated four million Americans nationwide
were overlooked, with higher rates of undercounting among
minorities, according to Robert Shapiro, undersecretary for
economic affairs at the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
Census results are a factor in establishing boundaries for
congressional districts. They also play a role in determining
eligibility for federal funds for an array of programs from
Medicaid to roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
Sampling is supported by congressional Democrats, who stand to
benefit if census results show higher counts in urban areas, where
voters traditionally are Democratic.

<HEADLINE> Over 15 Million Ethiopian Children Vaccinated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Minister Adem
Ibrahim said Tuesday 15,700,000 children across the country were
vaccinated against poliomyelitis in the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
In an annual performance report presented to parliament, Adem
Ibrahim said that along with the polio vaccines, vitamin A
capsules were given to 3.6 million children in the stated period.
</P>
<P>
He noted that pharmaceuticals and medical equipment worth over
3,860,000 U.S.Dollars were distributed among hospitals in Addis
Ababa and eight national regions.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to control malarial epidemic, the ministry has
dispatched anti-malaria drugs and chemical spraying equipment to
the regions, the minister said. Some 708 metric tonnes of ddt and
200 metric tonnes of malatine were also imported and distributed
to various regions in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Adem Ibrahim noted that although there are 1,805 drug stores,
44 drug importers and 17 whole salers, there is still a problem
in the distribution and quality control of medicines.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of skilled manpower, weak information exchange
between the center and regions and the prevalence of harmful
practices are but some of the problems witnessed in the sector,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ar present Ethiopia has 1,483
physicians, 4,214 nurses and 10,625 health assistants.

<HEADLINE> Forests in E. Tanzanian Region Diminishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Coast Region runs
the risk of turning barren if the rampant felling of trees there
is left uncontrolled, Regional Commissioner Philemon
Sarungi has said.
</P>
<P>
Although the region presently has 396,000 hectares of forest,
it may look like a desert in six years if no efforts are made to
deal with people who fell trees for charcoal production, Sarungi
told a group of members of parliament who visited there over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Sarungi said that the depletion of the forests is manifested
by the decrease in charcoal production year by year.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, 761,190 sacks of charcoal were sent to
Dar es Salaam from the Coast Region in 1986 while the figures
went down to 450,000 sacks in 1988 and 161,000 sacks in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This does not indicate that the charcoal dealers were
conscious of the problem of deforestation but reflect the
difficulty they encountered in finding suitable forests for
charcoal production," a report reaching here Tuesday quoted the
regional commissioner as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said some VIPs in the government have got involved in the
business. "We know for sure that some of the trucks ferrying
charcoal to Dar es salaam belong to influential figures. When our
guards asked them why they were involved in such business, they
just replied that they did it so as to repay the loans for their
lorries and pickups."
</P>
<P>
The regional commissioner has appealed to the members of
parliament to help the region to arrest the situation.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Forges United Strategy for EU-Med Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries on Tuesday forged a
united strategy politically and economically in preparation for
the coming European-Mediterranean Partnership summit.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day preparatory meeting for the summit, which was
attended by foreign ministers of nine Arab countries in the
Mediterranean basin, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
announced that the Arab countries had reached a consensus on all
issues which will be raised at the summit due on June 3-4 in
Palermo, Italy.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to insist on a just, full and lasting peace in the
Middle East based on the principles which were formulated in the
1991 Madrid peace conference, he said at a joint news conference
with Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
They will hold Israel, especially its government, responsible
for the deadlock of the peace process due to its refusal to honor
those peace principles.
</P>
<P>
On the economic level, Boueiz said, the foreign ministers
stressed the necessity to boost cooperation with the European
Union but should not be limited to the movement of goods.
</P>
<P>
This kind of cooperation should provide facilities for the
exchange of persons and information at different levels, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said that the meeting marks a good start for
cooperation and coordination with Mediterranean and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The nine Arab countries are Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt,
Tunisia, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco and the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The European-Mediterranean Partnership was launched in
Barcelona, Spain in 1995 with the aim of fostering political,
economic and cultural ties between the 15 EU member states
and 12 southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, including
the nine Arab countries, Israel and Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Competitive in World Market: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries have
the capacity individually and as a region to make their mark in a
highly competitive global market, President Nelson Mandela said in
Cape Town Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Their success in doing so would have a profound impact on their
future, Mandela said at a banquet in honor of visiting Malawian
President Bakili Muluzi.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi arrived in South Africa early Tuesday morning for a three-day
state visit.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that by pooling their abundant resources and sharing
the benefits of their strategic position between emerging economic
powers in Asia and Latin America, Southern African countries could
realize their cherished vision of cooperation for regional growth and
development.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for Africans to act together and to take
charge of Africa's destiny," Mandela noted.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Malawi, Mandela said South Africa was committed
to working towards a more equitable trade balance with Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mandela said relations between the two countries would
never be improved completely as long as there was a trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
South African exports to Malawi stood at 145.4 million U.S. dollars
and imports at 49.6 million U.S. dollars between January to August
last year, according to a survey by the South African Foreign Affairs
Department.
</P>
<P>
In response, Muluzi said his visit to South Africa was aimed at
strengthening cooperation and encouraging the private sector to do
business.
</P>
<P>
Malawian Foreign Minister Mopopa Oj Chipeta said: "It is our hope
that by the time this visit come to a close, we have a clear plan of
action for areas of cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Blair Insists RUC not to be Disbanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister said in
Belfast on Tuesday the Northern Ireland police force -- the Royal
Ulster Constabulary (RUC) -- will not be disbanded.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no paramilitaries running the police service.
That would be quite wrong," Blair told reporters after meeting
with Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister flew into Belfast from Dublin earlier
Tuesday in his latest drive to bring peace to Northern Ireland. It
is his fourth visit to the troubled province in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed: "If we can change the context in which
policing takes place to one of peace and stability and progress,
then hopefully we can get policing done in a normal way which is
what all the members of the RUC want, quite apart from the
public."
</P>
<P>
Blair remains under pressure from unionists over the exact
nature of other controversial parts of the peace agreement,
including the early release of paramilitary prisoners and
decommissioning of arms.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionists want to see a start to decommissioning before
they will agree to which parties can take office in the Northern
Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Blair explained it was for the independent decommissioning body
to decide the precise timing of its work.
</P>
<P>
"There is a process which is already under way and it is for
the independent commission to actually launch their schemes," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Complains of ADB's Indifference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has complained about the
indifference of the African Development Bank (ADB) toword its
economic plight, a report from Abidjan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Elie Saleeby, Liberia's representative to the ADB expressed
his country's disappointment of the ADB at the regional bank's
annual meeting in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Saleeby said the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund have fielded several missions to Liberia and even
co-ordinated the donors' conference, but the ADB has only sent
one mission.
</P>
<P>
As an African institute, he said, one would have expected to
see the ADB playing a leading role in mobilizing donor support
for Liberia, both in the provision of resources and debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, "The bank has failed Liberia and other
post-conflict African countries."
</P>
<P>
Saleeby said the situation is particularly painful for
Liberians as the west African country had played a special role
in the conception and establishment of the ADB but failed at this
critical time, meaning that Liberia is at a difficult time as it
has just arisen from seven years of bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that huge external debt arrears have denied
Liberia the access to all traditional sources of development
assistance and served as a major impediment to the country's
reconstruction efforts after seven years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize that Liberians do not intend to
remain aid-dependent. We realize that Liberia must be rebuilt by
Liberians themselves and that ultimately we must marshal our own
human and financial resources for this purpose," he said.

<P>
MAPUTO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has promised to
offer another 1.5 million U.S. Dollars to Mozambique for its
landmine clearing programs.
</P>
<P>
The offer was announced Monday by Brian Curran, U.S.
Ambassador to Mozambique, who attended a Children's Day
celebrations in southern Mozambique's Inhambane Province.
</P>
<P>
Curran said the U.S. government has, since 1993, offered 14.5
million Dollars in helping Mozambique clear the mines on its
land.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also given the country eight million Dollars for the
treatment and rehabilitation of the landmines victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said that U.S. special forces also join the
landmine clearance programs in Mozambique, the
information Agency of Mozambique reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the U.S. government is to spend 80 million
Dollars on landmine clearance worldwide this year, which will add
up U.S. government's budget on landmine clearance to 153 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has cleared about 60,000 landmines since the civil
war ended in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Pays Second Installment on Ethics Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, speaker of the
House of Representatives, has paid a second installment of 50,000
dollars toward the 300,000-dollar penalty imposed by the House
last year.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Weinstein, Gingrich's spokesman, said Tuesday that
Gingrich used his personal money to reimburse the House for the
ethics panel investigation into charges he used tax-exempt funding
to advance his political goals. He acknowledged making inaccurate
statements to the ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich made the first 50,000 dollar payment, also from
personal funds, in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Weinstein said Gingrich would use his own money to make a third
50,000 dollar payment at the end of November. In an agreement
worked out with the ethics committee, the final 150,000 dollars,
due in January 1999, can come from either personal funds or a loan
offered by 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, the
former Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has still to decide whether he will make use of Dole's
loan offer, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
In the year-long ethics panel probe, Gingrich denied Democratic
charges that he had misused tax-exempt donations. He reached a
plea bargain in December 1995 in which he admitted making
inaccurate statements to the committee and said he should have
used proper legal advice that would have warned him not to use
tax-exempt groups to promote political ends.
</P>
<P>
He submitted to a reprimand from the full House and agreed to
reimburse the House for the costs of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's office maintains that the 300,000 dollars represents
just a reimbursement for the committee's investigation, and is not
a fine or a penalty.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Neutral Nations Helped Nazis in World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland and other neutral
nations kept Nazi Germany's war machine running and were paid by
Nazis with looted gold during World War II, said a U.S.
administration report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that although Switzerland was Nazi
Germany's banker, other neutral nations, Sweden, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey and Argentina, provided materials to keep the war going.
</P>
<P>
"The cumulative trade of the World War II European neutral
countries helped to sustain the Nazi war effort by supplying key
materials to Germany essential to their conduct of the war," said
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat at a press conference
here on the report.
</P>
<P>
The report doubled the former estimate of how much gold was in
a Nazi account in Switzerland that received deposits of wedding
rings, teeth fillings and other valuables of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, one of Germany's largest World War II trading partners,
supplied iron ore and ball bearings. Portugal and Spain provided
nearly all of Germany's tungsten used to produce weapon-grade
steel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey provided 100 percent of Germany's chromite, used to
harden steel to make armor. Argentina also did business in wartime
goods, but was most helpful as a Nazi sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
In all, those five neutral countries handled 500 million U.S.
dollars in assets for the German government and its citizens
during the war and dealt in 300 million U.S. dollars in looted
gold, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland held from 250 million to 750 million U.S. dollars
in German private and government assets, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted leaders of the Nazi-backed fascist regime
in Croatia may have used Vatican ties after World War II to escape
Europe with plundered gold from Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
The neutral nations, which also traded with the Allies and
feared a Nazi invasion if they cut off German supplies, continued
helping the Nazis until near the end of the war, said Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the motivation, whatever the pressure, it sustained
the war effort," Eizenstat said of the neutral nations' trade with
Nazi Germany.

LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe ended
a lackluster session slightly higher Tuesday, with tradings thin,
no big stimulation and an uninspiring performance on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 index on the London market closed barely changed
at 5,842.3, up only 4.4 points or 0.08 percent, after having
fallen 28 points in early morning trading on the back of weakness
in engineer Siebe and drug stocks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the market was overshadowed by recent
world market jitters and the Dow offered no stimulation.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that market sentiment remained one of caution
ahead of this week's deliberations in interest rates by the
Monetary Policy Committee and there were still worries about
political and financial problems in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stocks posted modest gains, with the DAX
30 index ending at 5,582.78, up 13.70 points, or 0.25 percent, in
cautious trading, with players unsure about the near-term
direction of the market, dealers said.

On the Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index finished the session up
45.82 points or 1.13 percent at 4,086.98 after the Pentecost

The market was boosted by strength in the dollar and a big rise
in index heavyweight France Telecom which closed up nearly 6
percent.

Meanwhile, investors remained upbeat about the economy despite
the pilots' strike.

<HEADLINE> Simitis Stresses Need to Continue Efforts to Join EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
stressed Tuesday night that his government was determined to
continue its course towards taking Greece into European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a parliamentary debate on Greece's European
prospects, Simitis said that EMU was a difficult but necessary
path, and the Greek government guaranteed the final success.
</P>
<P>
Success with EMU was inexorably linked with social cohesion and
a strengthening of the new welfare state they were daily laying
the foundations of, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed the need of making structural
changes, particularly in banks and state-run companies, to make
them more flexible and competitive.
</P>
<P>
He said Greece could develop at a rate of 8 percent a year, but
the condition was the country must readjust its productive
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Of the European Union's 15 member states, Greece is now the
only country which meets no criteria of joining EMU in January
1999. To qualify the target of joining EMU in 2001, Greece has
since this year begun a drastic economic reform including the
privatization of banks and loss-making state enterprises, but
employees of banks and public utilities have been staging strikes
to express their opposition to the government reforms.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researchers Identify Aging Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of Canadian researchers have
identified a gene that plays a central role in aging, said reports
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They have also shown that by manipulating the gene they can
lengthen life of certain insects.
</P>
<P>
The researchers inserted a human gene called SOD1 into certain
nerve cells of fruit flies. By doing so, the life span of the
flies, which usually survive 80 days, was increased by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Then how does the SOD1 gene slow down the aging process? Dr.
John Phillips, one of the researchers, said the gene instructs
cells to produce an enzyme that counteracts the destructive
properties of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
As oxygen is used by the body, it produces waste products
called free radicals, which can damage cells. The SOD1 gene makes
sure that enough of the protective enzyme is made to neutralize or
eliminate the free radicals.
</P>
<P>
But as the body grows older, the cells become less efficient at
making the protective enzymes, said Dr. Phillips, professor of
molecular biology and genetics at the University of Guelph.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the aging process could be slowed down by
putting more of the SOD1 gene in the motor neuron of the fruit
flies.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step in trying to identify genes that
regulate and control aging," said one of the researchers, Dr.
Gabrielle Bouliance at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
But Bouliance and others were quick to point out that they are
far from being able to lengthen human life in a similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
Their findings were published Tuesday in the Journal Nature
Genetics.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Labor Market Slackens in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore, June 3 (Xinhua)-- Singapore's labor market slackened
significantly in the first quarter this year as impact of the
regional economic and currency crisis sank in, a government report
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the Manpower Research and Statistics
Department said that employment creation fell in the first quarter
as a result of slowdown in the economic activities. The total
employment increase was 9,064 jobs, lower than the gain of 16,159
in the same quarter last year and much lower than the traditional
high increase of 35,805 in the last quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Retrenchment reached a record quarterly high. A total of 7,131
workers were retrenched in the first quarter, which was the
highest quarterly figure recorded since the data was first
compiled in 1983 and constituted 73 percent of the retrenchment in
the whole of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary estimate of the number of unemployed persons in
March 1998 was 43,500, notably higher than 37,200 in December and
35,100 in September 1997. The seasonally adjusted overall
unemployment rate in March 1998 rose to 2.2 percent from 2.0
percent in last December and 1.8 percent in September 1997.
Notwithstanding, the jobless rate remained significantly lower
than the average of 5.7 percent reached in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The number of job vacancies dropped to an all-time low of
26,148, representing a 44 percent reduction compared to a year
ago. The vacancy rate fell from 5 percent to 2.7 percent, the
lowest ever recorded since the quarterly data was compiled in
1987.
</P>
<P>
Labor turnover continued to fall with the resignation rate
declining to 2.5 percent from 3.2 percent in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The weakening in demand for labor was also reflected in less
overtime hours. The weekly overtime hours averaged 4.2 hours in
the first quarter of 1998, lower compared with 4.6 hours a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The report said that unless the economic situation improves,
labor demand in Singapore is likely to soften and employment is
expected to rise as graduates will be entering the labor market in
the next few months.

<HEADLINE> Australia Imposes No Economic Sanctions Against Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia has not imposed
economic sanctions against Pakistan in response to its nuclear
tests last week, said a statement of the Australian High
Commission here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has moved to implement a range of
measures -- similar to those imposed on India -- to demonstrate
Australia's condemnation of the nuclear tests, and "our desire to
contribute to international efforts to half further nuclear
proliferation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, economic or trade-related measures have not
formed part of Australia's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, consistent with its concern for the well-being of the
people of Pakistan, it said, Australia will continue with its
small humanitarian assistance program in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has condemned Pakistan's decision to
undertake nuclear tests in the strongest possible terms, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, the
statement said a nuclear arms race in South Asia will exacerbate
rather than solve regional security tensions.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on Pakistan and India to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt, German and Italy clinched a contract Tuesday to
jointly exploit the Aswan iron ore in southern Egypt, with a total
investment of 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds (443 million dollars),
the Al Hayat newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Egyptian Industry and Mineral
Minister Suleiman Reda said the iron ore will be exempt from
taxation for 20 years as of the date of production.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of the iron ore is estimated at 3 million
tonnes, the amount just to fill the gap between Egypt's needs of 7
million tonnes and its production capacity of 4 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the companies from the three countries will
also jointly produce steel bars, seamless steel pipes, railway
tracks and other steel products used as building materials.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- A fertilizer plant in Abu Dhabi, the biggest in
the Middle East, started operation on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It will produce 200,000 tonnes of fertilizer annually, including
80,000 tonnes of compound fertilizer and 40,000 tonnes of liquid
fertilizer, an official of the factory said.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's unemployment rate reached 8.4 percent in
the first quarter of the year, the highest since the last quarter
of 1993, triggering new debate over the government's economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available Wednesday, the unemployment
rate is 1 percent higher than that in the same period of last year
and 0.8 percent higher than that of the previous quarter. It means
some 189,000 people are without work.
</P>
<P>
The figures aroused a storm among politicians and labor
experts, partly because Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman has
recently said that the country's economy has begun to turn around.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Despite a sharp fall in oil earnings of the oil
giant, Iran managed to reduce its foreign debts to 12.56 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of 1997 from 16.8 billion dollars in March
1996.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) available
Wednesday showed that Iran's long- and medium-term foreign debts
stood at 9.68 billion dollars while its short-term debts were 2.88
billion dollars by end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, if contingent obligations, including opened letters of
credit not yet consigned and future interest, were taken into
account, Iran's total external debts would reach 24.5 billion
dollars, the CBI report said.

<HEADLINE> India Continues to Flight-Test Surface-to-Air Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- India's naval version of
surface-to-air missile "Trishul" was flight tested from an Indian
naval ship in Cochin port of southwestern India Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The missile was last test-fired in Orissa State of eastern
India on May 11 when India also conducted three underground
nuclear tests at Pokharan of Rajasthan State.
</P>
<P>
This is the first development flight test of the missile in a
series before it is offered for user trials and this time it used
new and advanced guidance technologies, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The naval version of the missile is designed for two roles with
the India navy -- as a surface-to-air missile against adversary
aircraft and, as a counter to sea-skimming missiles launched
against Indian warships, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trishul missile is part of the integrated guided missile
program which includes intermediate range ballistic missile
"Agni", surface-to-surface missile "Prithvi", surface-to-air
missile "Akash" and anti-tank missile "Nag", he further said.
</P>
<P>
User trial of this version of Trishul is expected to be
completed this year, he added.

It is of great importance to make people aware of the harm of
drug by holding such exhibitions, he noted. He added that
anti-drug work is a matter which concerns the whole of society and
should be given top priority by governments at all levels.

<HEADLINE> Scowcroft Urges Stronger Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A stronger and more
comprehensive Sino-American relationship would heighten regional
security and support trade and investment, says former United
States National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States last
year established a new premise for Sino-American relations and the
two presidents demonstrated a shared commitment to cooperation and
what was characterized as a "strategic partnership," Scowcroft
said in response to written questions by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation would come in three modes: coordinated action,
where useful, on issues of common interests; issues where there
are sharp differences would be set aside, but would not prevent
cooperation elsewhere; on open issues of those where differences
are not basic, solutions and common grounds would be sought,
according to Scowcroft.
</P>
<P>
"In plain words, this means that the foundation for discussion
of any issue -- be it economic or security -- will be a common
interest and a desire to avoid conflict," said Scowcroft, who
served as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
for former Presidents Gerald Ford and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
Through President Bill Clinton's reciprocal visit, which
Scowcroft called "really the second half of the summit," he shows
the American people that relations require direct exchanges at the
highest level, Scowcroft said.
</P>
<P>
"This summit confirms that the friendship between the two
countries is founded in basic interests, and is strong and
genuine," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said two events had occurred since President Jiang's visit
that gave weight to the idea that the U.S. and China had many
interests in common.
</P>
<P>
First, the deepening crisis in Asia reveals how important the
region is to the health and prosperity of both the Chinese and
American economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has received a great deal of credit in the eyes of
American policy makers for its support for stability in the region
-- both through direct assistance and by its commitment to a
strong and stable Renminbi, the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has exercised its leadership as well. We
both need Asian economies that are healthy and stable," Scowcroft
said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said the decision by India to test several nuclear
devices reminds everyone that South Asia remains one of the most
dangerous places in the world.
</P>
<P>
China had achieved an understanding with India that seemed to
provide an end to their troublesome border dispute, only to have
the Indian defense minister warn of an imagined Chinese threat to
India, resurrecting old fears in both countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Education Chief Appeals for Whole-day Primary Schooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Director of Education Helen Yu of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) appealed
Wednesday to principals and teachers to work together for an
earlier implementation of whole-day primary schooling.
</P>
<P>
Yu said her department will endeavor to secure more resources
to enhance the quality of education including improving the
class/teacher ratio in primary schools. "We firmly believe that
whole-day primary schooling provides a better environment for
students to learn, to interact with peers and teachers and to take
part in extra-curricular activities," she said.
</P>
<P>
The education chief said she noticed that this view had been
supported by educational bodies, which had been urging the
government to speed up the implementation of such a schooling
system.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department is raising the percentage of students
in whole-day primary schools from the previous target of 40
percent to 60 percent by the 2002-2003 school year, with the
ultimate goal of whole-day schooling for all.
</P>
<P>
SAR's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa had undertaken to announce
the time-table for achieving this target in his next Policy
Address, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
"Our major difficulty now is finding sufficient sites for new
schools," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, the department had considered taking
various measure including building more new primary schools by
2002-2003, designing smaller schools to optimize land use, using
all vacant classrooms where applicable and building additional
classrooms where feasible.
</P>
<P>
And the average class size was to be decreased, which, as Yu
put it, "is a price worth paying for the benefits that whole-day
schooling brings to the learning environment of our children."
</P>
<P>
The time-table was being actively drawn up for full
implementation of whole-day primary schooling. "The success of
quality education depends much on the leadership and dedication of
 our teaching profession," she added.

<P>
"It is imperative that the United States and China continue and
enhance our shared efforts at nonproliferation and building
regional security," he said. This should include discussion of a
coordinated approach to Pakistan's security.
</P>
<P>
Triggered by India's explosion of its nuclear devices, Pakistan
had recently detonated six underground nuclear devices. Both China
and the United States had tried to dissuade Pakistan from staging
the tests and expressed regret over the development which, it is
feared, could further endanger the security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Calling for enhanced mutual understanding, Scowcroft said,
"There is a serious lack of understanding in both countries about
the fundamentals of the relationship, and too much uninformed
rhetoric."
</P>
<P>
More than 25 years after the signing of the Shanghai
Communique, he said, "I doubt that half the members of the
U.S. Congress can explain the document. So too, there have been a
host of books published in China which demonize the United States."
</P>
<P>
"Our fortunes are linked, and we owe it to our populations to
provide accurate portrayals of the other country and its people,"
Scowcroft said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that, when we talk honestly about our interests
and intentions, the public in both countries will find that
picture persuasive. We demonstrate shared interests by our actions
and by how we deal with one another everyday."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impact of Sino-American relations, Scowcroft
said, "A stronger, more comprehensive Sino-American relationship
-- where consultation between policy makers and military leaders
at all levels is the norm -- would heighten regional security and
support trade and investment." He said that more consistent and
improved cooperation between the two countries is a threat to no
one and can pay dividends throughout the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
"We need not always agree -- our relationships are complex and
becoming more so. But our economies are converging, and we have
tens of thousands of student exchanges every year, countless
business people, and more government and military officials than
ever before," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our interests are overwhelmingly congruent, and our
capabilities are often complementary. Neither government can
afford a failed bilateral relationship, and there is no excuse for
failure now."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leadership is justifiably confident about the
future of China, and the United States is enjoying record
prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The best relations between countries are possible when both
governments are popular and secure.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need grand announcements or dramatic new agreements
to sustain the relationship now, and none should be expected," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming summit should affirm mutual respect, and
highlights China's progress and the improved life of the ordinary
Chinese people," Scowcroft said.
</P>
<P>
"Visible examples of cooperation between the two in dealing
with issues of world significance, such as the Asian financial
crisis or stability in the Gulf, would have a profound, favorable
impact both regionally and globally," he said.

Ministry of Construction and the State Environmental Protection
Agency, who have jointly issued regulations on strengthening
control of garbage discharged by ships operating on the river.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications has demanded that boats be
equipped with enough garbage containers and separate rubbish
into different categories when collecting it.
</P>

September 1995. The first phase of the project is expected to be
completed by 1999, when the rich natural gas of Nigeria will be
piped to Togo, Ghana and the Republic of Benin.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the pipeline is expected to be expanded to the
whole west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Lagos, Sese pointed out that the energy crisis in
several west African countries have caused serious concern for
ECOWAS, which may explain why the project is gathering momentum
after years of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
Sese disclosed that the ECOWAS is trying to get private
enterprises interested in the project, the cost of which is put
at about 260 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Open Trade to S. African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Trade Minister Vitorino Hossi said
here Wednesday Angola will open its trade to southern African
countries starting July to boost business and promote mutual
development.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement to the press at the Luanda
International Airport after returning from a World Trade
Organization (WTO) meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Hossi revealed that the Angolan government will sign trade and
industry agreements with southern African states in July in a bid
to open its trade to them.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister noted that open trade might also bring
about a series of problems. Therefore, it is necessary to make
appropriate adjustment to the country's administrative and
financial institutions to meet future challenges.
</P>
<P>
Agreements with countries in the region on trade and industry
will also lead to certain revision on tariff, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the WTO Geneva meeting, Hossi said the meeting
will exert positive impact on international trade and explore new
prospects for trade, especially electronic trade.
</P>
<P>
Currently Angola has close trade relations with the United
States and European countries which export most of the products
Angola needs. Trade with other neighboring countries is however,
quite scarce.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Angola's decision to open its trade to
southern African states will boost its trade with other countries
in the region and promote its trade and economic ties with them.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive's Commission
on Innovation and Technology of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) on Wednesday organized a workshop to
arouse public awareness and debate about such issues as the
current and future challenges facing SAR's economy.
</P>
<P>
The 40 members of the workshop -- all prominent figures from
the business, academic and public sectors -- exchanged views on
what a center of innovation and technology should mean for Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
A Commission spokesman later introduced areas discussed by the
participants, which also included whether Hong Kong SAR should
aspire to become the Silicon Valley of East Asia or to follow the
experiences of other economies in Asia; the choice between "high
tech" and high value-added activities and between manufacturing
and service industries; and the synergistic relationship between
the Hong Kong SAR and the adjacent Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Commission would organize
additional workshops in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Commission was appointed by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
in March 1998 to advise him on the measures necessary to make Hong
Kong a center of innovation in East Asia. It is due to submit a
first report to Tung by October this year, and will complete all
its tasks within 12 to 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Historical Letter of Invitation Made Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A letter written 49 years ago by
a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) inviting a top
scientist to return to the motherland was made public here today.
</P>
<P>
The scientist was Qian Xuesen, who has made significant
contributions to China's success in guided missile and space
technology research.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, 1949, commissioned by the CPC's Central Committee,
Cao Richang, a professor of psychology in Hong Kang and a member
of the CPC, wrote a letter to Qian, then in the US, which reads as
follows:
</P>
<P>
"The whole country will soon be liberated. The north and
northeast parts of China are already at peace, and all kinds of
industries are now under re-construction, including the aviation
industry.
</P>
<P>
"The authority in the north [the CPC] has been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time, but due to bad communication
conditions they can not greet you directly, so I was entrusted to
write to you.
</P>
<P>
"We hope you can return to the motherland as soon as possible,
to play a leading role in laying a foundation for the aviation
industry in the north."
</P>
<P>
Not knowing Qian's address, the letter was mailed to Ge
Tingsui, one of the sponsors of the Association of Chinese
Scientists in America, for him to pass on.
</P>
<P>
Ge transcribed the letter in a notebook which is still
preserved.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, 1949, about four months before the founding of
the People's Republic of China, Ge mailed the letter to Qian and
wrote another letter to him, which says:
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, the authority in north China is very
enthusiastic about the improvement of technology. Under the
pre-condition of serving the public, absolute freedom is ensured.
</P>
<P>
"If you, well-known in the international academic community,
can return to the motherland immediately, many more Chinese
scholars currently staying overseas will follow you, which will
greatly benefit New China."
</P>
<P>
Also made public today was a letter from former senior Chinese
leader Hu Yaobang to mathematician Hua Luogeng, and a
clock presented as a gift to Chinese scientist Tan Jiazhen by
Chiang Wei-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
All these letters and related objects are among a number of
relics donated by members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and
the Chinese Academy of Engineering to the Museum of the Chinese
Revolution here today.
</P>
<P>
In June 1992, when Tan visited Taiwan, he met with his
student Chiang Wei-kuo and received a clock from Chiang, on which
Chiang wrote:
</P>
<P>
"People on both sides of the Taiwan Strait all identify
themselves as Chinese, so we need only one China; We hope every
Chinese can have the opportunity to lead a good life. China should
gain respect from the whole world."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, on Wednesday rejected a proposal that a bill
on Russia's cooperation with Taiwan be put on its agenda, the
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill was prepared by Duma's Geopolitics Committee while the
proposal to discuss it was drafted by Chairman of Liberal
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said that the State Duma opposed
the bill because Duma "does not know the existence of such a
country (named Taiwan)." Taiwan is a province of China.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Duma's Committee on International Affairs
Vladimir Lukin said the LDPR faction in effect proposed that
Taiwan, part of China, be recognized as a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
Lukin also cautioned his colleagues not to support the motion,
saying "this draft law contradicts our constitution and all
international obligations of Russia."
</P>
<P>
Only 77 Duma deputies voted for Zhirinovsky initiative when it
needed 226 votes to be passed.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed, 20 Injured in Tehran Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The explosion at the Islamic
revolutionary court in northern Tehran on Tuesday killed five
people and injured 20 others, local newspaper Iran Daily on
Wednesday quoted witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the death toll was not confirmed by official sources,
said the newspaper, which is run by the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported on Tuesday that two were
killed and two others injured in the explosion which took place
at 1:45 p.m.local time (0915 GMT) in the waiting hall of the
court.
</P>
<P>
The News Radio, run by Tehran Radio, reported on Wednesday
that Iran's outlawed Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) has
claimed responsibility for the explosion at the court, which deals
with cases related to arms and drug smuggling, anti-revolutionary
activities and issues threatening national security.
</P>
<P>
However, the IRNA Tuesday quoted an official from the court
public relations office as saying that the incident happened due
to negligence when explosives related to a case under
investigation were being carried to the court.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, Iran's largest armed opposition group, launched a
series of violent attacks on Iranian targets inside and outside
the country during the past decade, triggering a number of
cross-border raids by Tehran on the MKO bases near Iraqi capital
Baghdad.

TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan plans to open an international
forum of experts to discuss recent nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan, and seek ways to maintain the nuclear non-proliferation
regime.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi is expected to propose
the international forum at a June 12 meeting in London of foreign
ministers from the Group of Eight (G-8) industrialized countries,
Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to have experts at home and abroad compile a
proposal for governments concerned as early as possible on
concrete ways to maintain and strengthen the nuclear
nonproliferation regime and speed up world nuclear disarmament,"
the Japanese spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The forum may mainly consist of experts from non-government
sectors, but government experts, as private persons, would be
allowed to join the gathering, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials
said.
</P>
<P>
India detonated five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13,
triggering off a nuclear arms race in South Asia. India's nuclear
tests prompted Pakistan to respond with its own nuclear tests on
May 28 and 30.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six countries attending an extraordinary meeting in
Geneva of the Conference on Disarmament condemned India and
Pakistan on Tuesday and urged them to join the Comprehensive Test
Ban and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaties.

<HEADLINE> National Conference Calls for Improved Grain Circulation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji stressed
today that all surplus grain must be purchased at protective
prices, state-owned grain enterprises must sell grain at slightly
profitable prices to avoid losses and grain purchasing funds must
be used properly.
</P>
<P>
At a national TV-telephone conference on grain purchasing and
marketing, Zhu asked grain enterprises to step up their efforts at
reforming themselves to improve grain circulation.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged local grain purchasing and storage
enterprises to buy all surplus grain from farmers at protective
prices so as to protect farmers' interests and mobilize their
initiative for farming.
</P>
<P>
Grain enterprises must purchase grain from farmers all year
round. They may buy low-quality grain at lower prices but
cannot refuse to purchase it.
</P>
<P>
Except for agricultural taxes, grain enterprises are not
allowed to set aside other items of fees or taxes at the request
of township or village officials, who in turn are not allowed to
charge various improper fees at grain purchasing sites.
</P>
<P>
According to the conference, farmers' grain can only be bought
by state-owned grain enterprises. Non-state-owned businesses or
individuals are banned from direct purchase of grain from farmers.
</P>
<P>
The conference noted that state grain enterprises must sell
grain at prices which include purchasing prices, reasonable
expenses and minimum profits. Only in this way can the enterprises
prevent new losses and make up accumulated losses.
</P>
<P>
In terms of retail of grain, state-owned grain enterprises can
decide their own selling prices on the basis of certain profits,
and local governments or pricing departments are not allowed to
fix unified floor prices.
</P>
<P>
State grain enterprises must not sell grain while losing money
in business. Governments at all levels have the responsibility
for supervising grain enterprises to purchase and sell grain on
a profitable basis, according to the conference.
</P>
<P>
In addition, grain purchasing funds from the Agricultural
Development Bank must be used for grain enterprises to purchase
grain; they must not be used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
As soon as grain enterprises sell their grain, they must return
the principal and interest to the bank promptly. In the meantime,
financial departments of local governments should not order
state-owned grain enterprises to hand over their profits to higher
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The conference also pointed out that the fundamental way out
for state grain enterprises lies in reform. Only in this way can
they increase their competitiveness on the market and be
responsible for their own profits and losses.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the enterprises should downsize
staff, enhance efficiency, expand service fields and improve
internal management, according to the conference.

<HEADLINE> Price Waterhouse Praises China's New Assets Assessment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The leading international
accounting firm Price Waterhouse today said China's adoption of a
new assets classification system will help the Chinese banking system
improve its transparency and comparability with the international
banking community.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has decided to
introduce a new five-degree loan risks classification system in
August to its state-owned commercial banks in a move to improve
credit loan management.
</P>
<P>
J. Thomas Macy, chairman of Price Waterhouse's Financial
Service Practice China, said that this internationally-recognized
system will present many exciting opportunities for Chinese banks
to strategically position themselves in this highly competitive
market.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the system, which was first implemented in
the United States, has been widely adopted by banks in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
He called it an "early warning" system, a system that "looks
forward." He noted that it focuses on identifying problems at an
early stage so as to ensure a timely solution to the problems.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Macy said that since in the
past Chinese banks practised a different assets classification
system, it was difficult for the international banking community
to know the real situation of the Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
"The adopting of the new rules will help the foreign financial
institutions to get to know better the performance of the Chinese
banks and boost the confidence of foreign investors," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Yong, a partner in Price Waterhouse, told Xinhua that
his company began to cooperate with China's central bank in 1995
to introduce on a trial basis the new system to several commercial
bank branches in China.
</P>
<P>
Today Price Waterhouse held a seminar here featuring the
implementation of the assets classification system. High-ranking
executives and credit officers from a dozen Chinese banks attended
the event.

<HEADLINE> Australia's GDP Roses 1.3 Percent in March Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia's gross domestic product
(GDP) rose by 1.3 percent in the March quarter that would lead the
annual growth rate to 4.9 percent, the highest since 1994.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the latest statistics issued by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics Wednesday, federal Treasurer Peter
Costello said Australia now has become one of the world's
fastest-growing economies after its annual economic growth surged
to a three-year high in the first three months of 1998 despite the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Costello capitalized on the figures, saying "this means that
Australia is probably the fastest growing country in the
industrialized world and certainly a strong economy of the Asian
region."
</P>
<P>
But behind the headline 4.9 percent annual GDP growth, the
national accounts data also offered worrying signs that the Asian
turmoil was beginning to bite.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending fell for the first time in five years, while
stocks showed a rapid build-up.
</P>
<P>
Costello warned that the growth would slow to the lower 3
percent range in 1998/99, while remaining solid by world
standards.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Perth Radio, Prime Minister John Howard
regarded the data as proof that the government had safeguarded the
economy against the Asian turmoil. He said the figures showed most
economic indicators were running as strongly as they could.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the economy is really performing well, we have given
it security and safety amidst all of this Asian economic turmoil."
</P>
<P>
Opposition treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said the headline
figures were welcome, but warned they were "a mirage" based on a
rapid build-up of stocks, and hid flat business investment and
private consumption.
</P>
<P>
"Today's growth figures are one-off, unsustainable and give no
hope at all to Australia's jobless," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Pledges Africa World Cup in 2006 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONROVIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sepp Blatter, currently FIFA's
secretary general, promised on Tuesday in Monrovia's soccer
stadium the 2006 World Cup to Africa if he is elected president of
soccer's world ruling body FIFA next week.
</P>
<P>
"I will not give you all my programmes for Africa, but what I
can promise, which will be a reality, is that if I am elected
president of FIFA, I will give the 2006 World Cup to Africa," said
the presidency candidate in a campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
Blatter contends with European Football Union (UEFA) chief
Lennart Johansson in a bid to succeed Joao Havelange as president,
to be resolved at the FIFA congress in Paris next Monday.
</P>
<P>
His pledge was responded by promises of support for his
election from Liberian officials.
</P>
<P>
"If you receive one vote, that ballot will be the one from
Liberia," said Edwin Snowe, the president of Liberian Football
Association.
</P>
<P>
Blatter promised Liberia additional FIFA cash in return to
rehabilitate the country's soccer facilities destroyed during
nearly eight years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
"Liberia will receive more money than the others because of
your delicate situation", said Blatter.
</P>
<P>
The official said several African countries had promised him
their votes, among them Guinea, Sierra Leone and Mauritania, whose

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Symposium on Sino-US Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 veteran diplomats and
specialists on international issues articulated their wish here
today that the coming visit of US President Bill Clinton will
further lead Sino-US relations toward a period of healthy and
positive development.
</P>
<P>
They said this at a symposium on Sino-US relations held by the
China Institute for International Strategic Studies (CIISS), where
former Chinese Ambassador to the US Li Daoyu delivered the keynote
speech.
</P>
<P>
Despite some existing divergences, they said, the two countries
have extensive and significant common interests. The establishment
of long-term, healthy and stable Sino-US relations not only
accords with the fundamental interests of the Chinese and
US peoples, but also serves to promote peace and development of
the world, they added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the US last October
successfully enhanced mutual understanding, and accelerated
cooperation between the two countries, thus lifting Sino-US
relations to a new stage, they concluded.
</P>
<P>
A civilian academic group devoted to studies of international
issues, the CIISS has over the past 20 years played an active role
in improving Sino-US relations through exchanges and cooperation
with prestigious US institutes and scholars in the field.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China will probably face a water
crisis by the mid-21st century if no measures are taken to curb the
worsening water shortage.
</P>
<P>
This warning appears in a report titled "Water Shortage and
Possible Solutions", drawn up by over 30 scientists and experts
from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the Chinese Academy of
Engineering (CAE), the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of
Education.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, which was released here today, about
half of over 600 cities across the country are suffering from
water shortages, which lead to an annual loss of 200 billion yuan
(about 25 billion US dollars) in industrial production and cuts
grain output by 15 billion kg to 20 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
China's total industrial output was valued at 5,371 billion
yuan and its grain output amounted to 490 billion kg in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The report says thats demand for water will go up to 800
billion cu m by the mid-21st century from the present 500 billion
cu m, accounting for 28 percent of its usable water reserves.
</P>
<P>
"International experiences tell us that a water crisis will
arise when the demand exceeds 20 percent of the total reserves,"
the report points out.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zonghu, a prominent scientist at CAS, listed serious
waste and pollution as major causes of the water shortage in
China, in addition to other reasons like reduced rainfall.
</P>
<P>
In the agricultural sector which accounts for half of the total
water consumption, the actual waste is as high as 60 percent, said
Zhang. "China can save 100 billion cu m to 120 billion cu m of
water each year if farming irrigation improves the efficiency of
the use of water by 0,2 percent."
</P>
<P>
Currently, one third of industrial waste water or 90 percent of
waste water from people's daily lives are discharged into rivers
and lakes without being treated. As a result, ninety percent of
cities have reported deteriorating water quality.
</P>
<P>
The report points out the only solution is to implement water
conservation in every social sector and gradually cut water
consumption.
</P>
<P>
CAS academician Xu Guanhua said that a group of CAS experts
will begin an investigation tour along the Yellow River to find
out the cause of frequent flow stoppages of the country'
second-longest river.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Washington-based World Watch issued a warning
report on the fact that dry-ups in parts of the Yellow River
totaled 226 days in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Corretja Reaches French Semifinals as Third Spaniard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Alex Corretja became the third
Spaniard to move into the men's seminfinals as he clinically
disposed of Belgian Filip Dewulf 7-5, 6-4, 6-3 at the French Open
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 14th seed's victory over Dewulf, the 1997 semifinalist,
underscored Spanish men's dominance on slow clay courts after
Felix Mantilla and Carlos Moya made to the last four on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old baseliner will play his first grand slam
semi-final against the winner of the last quarter-final later on
Wednesday between France's Cedric Pioline and Morocco's Hicham
Arazi.
</P>
<P>
Dewulf, 26, got off to the better start as he broke Corretja
early and moved into a 5-3 lead in the opening set, having lost
just four points in four service games.
</P>
<P>
But Corretja broke Dewulf for 5-5 with his heavy and topspin
groundstrokes and two games later a whipped cross-court backhand
passing shot gave the first set to the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
Corretja never allowed his 39th-ranked opponent back into the
match and errors began to creep into Dewulf's game before his
devastating forehand deserted him and a wide and long groundstroke
off that side gave victory to Corretja after one hour 50 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Pacers's Players Hope Coach Bird to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers coach Larry
Bird, who said he wanted to quit the position after the team
exited the playoffs, was voted as a brilliant coach by the Pacers
in a poll.
</P>
<P>
Guard Mark Jackson dismissed Bird's idea as "stupid". Chris
Mullin, who played with Bird on "Dream Team I", said the coach's
success speaks for itself. Reggie Miller said Bird delivered
everything he promised.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, Bird said: "My golf game is a little
rusty. I can always pick that back up."
</P>
<P>
But nobody said he should leave the team. Pacers president
Donnie Walsh said the question was moot until Larry asked him
personally.
</P>
<P>
"What Indiana accomplished and what Larry Bird accomplished in
his first year benefits all of us in the NBA for years to come,"
said NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
Bird took the job with the team coming off its worst season in
a decade, wrapping up a record of 39 wins and 43 losses. Bird, who
was named the NBA Coach of the Year, guided the Pacers to 58
victories - the second longest runners-up record in Eastern
Conference - in the regular season this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 Hall of Fame players who preceded Bird into the
coaching ranks, only Lenny Wilkens will get back to the hall as a
coach.
</P>
<P>
As a new coach at any level, Bird worked out his own way to
lead the team. The veterans got almost complete freedom.
</P>
<P>
He recognized Jackson could run a ballclub, so he handed him
the keys. He knew Miller, Mullin and Rik Smits could be trusted to
take good shots, so he gave them permits. Bird also gave younger
guys like Jalen Rose freedom to let them flourish in turn.
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't said one time since he's been here who he is or
what he's done," Antonio Davis said."But everybody knows."

<HEADLINE> HK Judge on Civil Courts' Role in Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The civil courts are the natural
forum for the enforcement of intellectual property rights, Justice
Rogers J.A. of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Considering the relative functions of the civil and criminal
law in the field of intellectual property rights, the most
appropriate courts to enforce intellectual property rights are
courts exercising civil jurisdiction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Justice Roger was speaking at the three-day World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) Asian Regional Symposium, which
closed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Intellectual property rights are private rights -- it is up to
the individual holders of those rights to identify, claim and
protect their interests. They can do that by bringing an action in
the civil court," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rogers said civil courts award damages to compensate the
injured party as well as injunctions to stop
infringement. "Damages awarded in the recent past have come to
very high figures," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the enforcement of intellectual property rights by
criminal prosecutions, Rogers said that the criminal law was an
appropriate tool where there had been trademark counterfeiting or
copyright piracy as opposed to mere infringement. In criminal
cases, the prosecution is brought by the government at public
expense.
</P>
<P>
"The power of criminal sanction is needed, but it must be
exercised with discretion and good judgment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The WIPO Symposium was designed to create a forum for the
discussion of the Agreement on the Trade Related aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), one of the subsidiary
agreements of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and binds all 132 WTO members. TRIPS also
expands the scope and protection of the intellectual property
rights to trade related issues.
</P>
<P>
Roger praised the symposium as "useful." "In the first place
by bringing together those involved in the implementation of the
TRIPS Agreement, it has provided a broader perspective of how
TRIPS works around the world.
</P>
<P>
"In the second place it has enabled a number of important
points about TRIPS to be discussed. It must always be remembered
that intellectual property rights constitute monopolies and
monopolies should only exist if they can be shown to be in the
public interest," he said.

<HEADLINE> Transgenically-Produced Drugs Being Researched in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Drugs produced with transgenic
technology may dominate China's huge pharmaceuticals market in
future. But they are still being researched, according to a Chinese
geneticist involved in the field.
</P>
<P>
"The milk of transgenic animals contains a human gene which
provides therapeutic protein. Medicines produced from the milk may
become powerful weapons against difficult illnesses, like cancers
and hereditary diseases," said Prof. Zeng Yitao, an academician of
the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Research results have suggested that not only hereditary
diseases, but cancers and cardiovascular diseases, are associated
with defects in certain genes. A transnational program to map
all human genes, known as the Human Genome Project (HGP), is being
conducted in order to identify which genes can cause illnesses.
</P>
<P>
"Once they discover a pathogenetic gene, scientists will know
what kind of gene to inject into mammals, such as sheep, cows
or pigs, to enable them to produce milk which contains a certain
therapeutic protein," Prof. Zeng said in an interview with Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the possible debut of such medicines on the world market
this year, China may develop such products in another three to
five years, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Medical Research Institute of Genetics, where Zeng
works, has co-operated with Fudan University to breed five
transgenic goats. One goat has produced milk carrying the IX
Factor, or plasma thromboplastin component (PTC), which can be
used to treat hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
Commercial production of transgenically-produced drugs with low
production costs will be the most profitable industry in the future,
Zeng predicted, adding that the annual sales may hit 25 billion US
dollars in ten years time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, transgenic technology has been adopted to breed
better grain varieties which can resist drought, frost or
pests, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The professor is in Beijing to attend an ongoing biennial
conference of academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and
the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Transgenic goat research has been supported by the country's
"863" High-Tech Plan since 1990.
</P>
<P>
China has established two research centers of transgenic
animals in the Shanghai Institute and the Beijing-based China
Agriculture University, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn of Thailand's Debt Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand would not see a true
economic recovery unless its debt problem was resolved, economic
experts warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending a seminar here on the resolution of
Thailand's debts said that alleviation of the debt problem
remained a key obstacle to the economy's recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government should help lower the private sector's
debts to stop the economy from collapsing even further, they said,
suggesting that this be done without the use of public money and
the state act as a facilitator in the process of bringing the
creditors and debtors together.
</P>
<P>
This strategy, the experts said, would encourage foreign banks
to roll over short-term debts and reach individual settlements
with debtors. Thailand's debts now stand at 90 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the roll-over rate of 85 percent is
actually dropping. With an estimated 4 billion U.S. dollars due
each month, a 15 percent maturity rate puts tremendous pressure on
the balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
The maturity structure for roll-overs is very short, only
extended from one to three months, because head offices are keen
to keep their options open. Moreover, Japanese banks, by far the
largest single creditor group, are facing a difficult situation at
home with widening premiums reducing roll-overs.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the policy of encouraging debt roll-overs was
just a short-term palliative and did nothing to solve the
long-term problem. However, there still seems to be a reluctance
in providing any official support for debt restructuring along the
lines of Indonesia and South Korea, as there is fear it would
confirm how bad the situation really is.
</P>
<P>
This also highlights the need for the framework to be supported
by the international community, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Reach New High in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployment rate
reached 8.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, the highest
since the last quarter of 1993, triggering new debate over the
government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available Wednesday, the unemployment
rate is 1 percent higher than that in the same period of last year
and 0.8 percent higher than that of the previous quarter. It means
some 189,000 people are without work.
</P>
<P>
The figures aroused a storm among politicians and labor
experts, partly because Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman has
recently said that the country's economy has begun to turn around.
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers quoted Labor and Social Affairs Minister
Eli Ishai as saying Tuesday that much of the blame lies with the
Bank of Israel's tight policy. Meanwhile, Immigration and
Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein called on the government to
pump state funds into the workforce rather than improving the road
and rail infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
But Neeman rejected the criticism on the government's policies,
saying that the situation would be even worse without them. He
said the government would continue to allow the private sector to
develop and grow, to serve as an engine for the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also strongly denies that its monetary policy
is the cause of the rise in the unemployment rate. It suggested
that the problem is structural, with many people falling victim to
the change from traditional industries to high-tech ones.

BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Pollution has become a serious
problem for 1,153 schools in 69 provinces across Thailand,
according to a survey by the Office of the National Primary
Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
The survey, whose results were made available on Wednesday,
revealed that 89 schools are affected by dust from quarries and
mines, 37 by dust from cement factories, 203 by dust from other
industrial factories, 45 by dust from mills, and 406 by road dust.
</P>
<P>
Up to 348 schools suffer from the stench and noise emitted by
nearby factories, and 25 from smoke that comes from burning wood
and rubbish.
</P>
<P>
In certain areas, the density of small-size dust in the air
reached 1,700 micrograms per cubic meter, five times the
acceptable standard.
</P>
<P>
Pupils and teachers have developed health problems such as
shortness of breath.

<HEADLINE> "Almost No Ecological Changes in Three Gorges Area" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The latest environmental monitoring
bulletin reports that the general ecology in the Three Gorges
Project area basically remained the same last year as the
year before.
</P>
<P>
"The effects of the project on the ecology and environment have
been mainly limited to the construction region, and no remarkable
damage has emerged," the bulletin says.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin, mainly compiled by the China Environmental
Monitoring Center, said that water and soil preservation and tree
planting efforts have greatly reduced the unfavorable impacts of
the project on the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir area near Chongqing has a forest coverage rate of
nearly 22 percent, and that in Hubei Province, 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rare and endangered aquatic animals, including the white-flag
dolphin and the Chinese sturgeon, have been protected in
regions affected by the Three Gorges Project, according to the
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges and its surrounding area were hit by 93 minor
earthquakes measuring below 4.4 on the Richter scale last year,
which was similar to the situation the year before.
</P>
<P>
Seismic disaster prevention projects completed in the area have
greatly reduced losses caused by such phenomena as landslides and
mud-rock flows.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin says that although the water quality of the
mainstream of the Yangtze River is basically good, river sections
near cities have witnessed an obvious rise in pollution. It adds
that pollution accidents mainly caused by oil pollution happened
frequently last year, but were fewer compared with the year
before.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the density of suspended particles in the air was
rather serious around the project construction site.
</P>
<P>
China's environmental monitoring network in the Three Gorges
area has been keeping a close eye on the ecology and environment
in the area and the whole Yangtze River basin since 1996, and
since last year China has been issuing an annual bulletin on the
monitoring results.

<HEADLINE> European Automakers Propose Emission Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- European automobile manufacturers
on Wednesday handed the European Commission a new proposal for
carbon dioxide emission levels.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made by the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association (ACEA), contained a carbon dioxide emission commitment
of 140 grams per kilometer of new passenger cars sold by ACEA
members in the European Union (EU) by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, adopted by the ACEA board last Thursday, also
addressed a number of other environmental concerns which the
commission had voiced.
</P>
<P>
The ACEA proposed reviewing in 2003 the possibilities for
moving further toward the 120 grams per kilometer target by 2012.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive body, however, expects to
achieve an average carbon dioxide emission of 120 grams per
kilometer by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The ACEA proposal earlier did not contain any conditions that
caused concern to the commission and the European Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Union Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said, "We have
made substantial progress with the ACEA over the last few weeks,
but we are not there yet. There are a number of sticking points
where we still have to find solutions."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the ACEA's claim on fuel quality forced
the automakers and the commission to postpone their final decision
on the ACEA proposal on carbon dioxide emission.
</P>
<P>
The European Council of Ministers and European Parliament are
expected to discuss and work out a fuel quality directive.

of the oil giant, Iran managed to reduce its foreign debts to
12.56 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1997 from 16.8 billion
dollars in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) available
Wednesday showed that Iran's long- and medium-term foreign debts
stood at 9.68 billion dollars while its short-term debts were 2.88
billion dollars by end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, if contingent obligations, including opened letters of
credit not yet consigned and future interest, were taken into
account, Iran's total external debts would reach 24.5 billion
dollars, the CBI report said.
</P>
<P>
President of the CBI Mohsen Nourbakhsh said last month that
Iran enjoyed a favorable trade balance of 3.83 billion dollars in
the past Iranian year, ending March 20, with its total exports to
be 18.82 billion dollars, including 3 billion dollars from non-oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
Iran had expected to obtain 17.7 billion dollars from oil
exports in the past Iranian year, but failed to reach the goal due
to the sagging oil prices to below 12 dollars per barrel by March.
</P>
<P>
Iran earned 18.5 billion dollars in 1996 from oil exports when
oil price stood above 19 dollars per barrel, which enable it to
pay back some of its foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review China's Macro Economic Indices Show Favorable Changes (1) by Xu Xingtang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by the related
departments show that China's real estate sector has been
recovering quickly, with the national real estate index rising
above what is called the "prosperity line" in April.
</P>
<P>
This is good news to the Chinese government, which has called
on the country to shake off the consequences of the Asian
financial crisis and try to achieve an eight percent economic
growth rate this year.
</P>
<P>
For the past few months, China's economy has been operating
fairly smoothly. Although the inertial declining trend of the
economy has not yet been reversed, some advance indices of the
macro economy have shown favorable changes with the gradual
implementation of the central government's macro-economic control
measures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the central bank show that the decline in loans
has been basically stopped, with total loans rising by 153.75
billion yuan in the first four months, of which over 151 billion
yuan was added in March and April.
</P>
<P>
Medium and long-term loans increased more than 10 billion yuan
in April to reverse the declining trend in the previous three
months, indicating that the central bank's readjustment of monetary
policies has become effective.
</P>
<P>
The analysis by the State Statistics Bureau of the first four
months' economic development shows that the state's efforts in
expanding domestic demand through increased investment have achieved
results. National fixed assets investment in the first four months
reached 271.3 billion yuan, up 12.2 percent from the same period
last year, and the growth rate in April was as high as 15.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
What should be noticed is that investment in enterprises'
technological upgrading rose sharply, investment in central China
began to recover and many more new projects have been launched.
</P>
<P>
Increased investment has helped push up heavy industrial
production, which was up 7.7 percent in April, one percentage
point higher than in the first quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
Another point worth noticing is the growth of new consumption
areas. With the change in Chinese residents' consumption
structure, some new consumption areas have been formed, including
residential housing, automobiles, rural area consumption, social
services, information consumption and cultural consumption.
</P>
<P>
Experts share the view that these new areas will inject new
vigor into the development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Noted Chinese economist Liu Guoguang said that the country has
favorable objective conditions to support its economic
growth. Transport, energy, raw materials, agriculture,
foreign exchange reserves, inflation rate and other critical
sectors are at their best time and capable of supporting a growth
rate higher than eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good reason to believe that, with the government's
fine-tuning measures taking effect, the declining trend of
the economic growth will gradually be stopped, and the economy is
expected to recover in the second half of this year or the first
half of next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he also pointed out that much needs to be done to solve
the current economic problems and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shucheng from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said
that, considering the present economic conditions, it is possible
to meet the eight percent growth target.
</P>
<P>
He said that the consequences of the Asian financial
crisis will inevitably weaken exports' contribution to the
economic growth. As a result, increased investment becomes a
critical factor in expanding domestic demand to push the
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"More efforts should be made to choose appropriate investment
projects and ensure increased investment be actually used by the
targeted projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that industrial development should be combined
with local characteristics to give full play to local growth
potential and avoid repetitive construction.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the government should make more minor
macro-economic readjustments in time to solve the current
difficulties and problems in the overall economic
development.

<HEADLINE> At Least 25 Killed in German Train Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people were killed and 200
others wounded when a high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday morning at the rail station of the northeastern German
town of Eschede.
</P>
<P>
The Intercity-Express (ICE), the country's fastest train,
apparently hit a car which had plunged onto the rail tracks from
a bridge, the German news agency DPA quoted eyewitnesses as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The car had reportedly smashed through the crash barrier of the
road bridge and plunged onto the rail tracks in front of the
oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
The train, enroute from Munich to Hamburg, slammed into car
with a speed of at about 200 kilometers per hour, derailed and
smashed into the bridge support.
</P>
<P>
The entire structure of the bridge then collapsed, burying part
of the train under the rubble. All 13 carriages were telescoped
into one another, making it difficult for rescue workers to
retrieve the passengers trapped in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
According to German rail authorities, the train has seats for
759 passengers. The number of people actually traveling in the
train is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the worst rail accident in modern German
history.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Important for Butterfly Collection: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Himalayan kingdom of Nepal
can be an important country for butterfly collection, where rich
species of butterflies have been found, Collin Phillip Smith, an
entomologist, said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 16,000 species of butterflies in the world, 640
species have been identified so far in Nepal, the official RSS
news agency Wednesday quoted Smith as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Natural History Museum in Pokhara, about 200 kilometers
northwest of Kathmandu, has a collection of 10,000 butterflies of
576 species found in Nepal and the rest of the world, the RSS
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 10,000 foreign and Nepalese tourists
visited the museum established in 1965, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Science Museum at Swoyambhu in Kathmandu has a
collection of all the indigenous butterflies in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Butterflies found in the southern Terai plain and the northern
Himalayas of Nepal differ in size and species. Some of them were
detected at an altitude of 17,000 feet (about 5,180 meters), the
RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese collectors spent up to 500 U.S. dollars for a male
butterfly and 100 dollars for a female one found in Nepal on
mountains 9,000 feet (2,740 meters) high, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that he has collected samples of butterflies in 60
of the 75 districts in Nepal, and found 375 species in the
Kathmandu Valley and 300 in the Pokhara Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Briton has undertaken studies and research in butterflies
in Nepal for the past 25 years, and has five books to his credit,
the RSS added.

<HEADLINE> Supporting Policies Encourage Coal Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's largest coal
producer, is urging the country's coal enterprises to export more
coal products by working out a series of favorable polices and
measures, in a bid to check the declining economic efficiency in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
To support coal exports, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China will offer the coal enterprises nationwide loans totaling
around three billion yuan, to alleviate their fund shortages, said
Zhang Baoming, head of the newly-organized Administration of the
Coal Industry,
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national coal export conference held here today,
the senior official added that the country will offer a nine
percent export rebate for the coal enterprises instead of the
present three percent.
</P>
<P>
The Administration will still cut export commissions for coal
enterprises by one third, in a bid to bring into full play the
initiatives of these enterprises to export more coal products.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China is the world's largest coal
producer, turning out an annual 1.35 billion tons, or one third of
the world's total. The country has earned 5.4 billion US dollars
by exporting 150 million tons of coal over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
However, its annual coal export amount to only just over 3,000
tons, about six percent of the world's total coal trade volume,
and so there is a huge potential to tap.
</P>
<P>
China plans to export 35 million tons of coal this year, and 50
million tons by the year 2000. The expansion of coal exports will
make the sector open wider to the rest of the world, and will
promote its operation and management from being extensive to being
intensive, said the official.
</P>
<P>
At present, supply exceeds demand in coal markets both at home
and abroad. The dwindling demand for coal in Southeast Asian
countries last year has affected China's coal exports, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will take all measures possible to
expand its coal market shares worldwide, particularly in Asia,
Europe and South America.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Latest Environmental Situation Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's latest environmental
situation report says that the ecological environment in a number
of regions continued to deteriorate last year under the pressure
of population and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The annual report, issued today by the State Environmental
Protection Administration, said China enhanced efforts for
pollution control in cities and major regions, and scored
remarkable achievements in the Huaihe River Valley.
</P>
<P>
"Some regions witnessed improved environmental quality
last year," said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that China's seven river systems,
lakes, reservoirs, underground water in some regions and some
coastal waters have suffered from pollution to varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
Many cities suffer from serious shortages of water, according
to the report, which added, "The shortage of water resources and
water pollution have restricted the country's economic and social
development."
</P>
<P>
China's air is still polluted mainly by sulphur dioxide, smoke
and dust. Central China and the southwestern part of the country
suffer greatly from acid rain.
</P>
<P>
With the faster urbanization, pollution caused by automobile
exhaust fumes has become serious in some big cities, although the
country's major urban air pollution problems are still sulphur
dioxide, smoke and dust, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Organic pollution is the main problem in urban water pollution,
and more cities are suffering from water shortages caused by
pollution.

<P>
Urban noise pollution has been turning serious, and so has the
garbage problem.
</P>
<P>
However, some medium and small cities have witnessed
improvements in the environment.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that both the quality and area of the
country's cultivated land have been decreasing, with the growth of
population and industry as well as the improper use of
agricultural chemicals.
</P>
<P>
"Too much land has been improperly used and wasted," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China's forestry coverage rate was nearly 14
percent last year. However, grassland has degenerated because of
over-development, and biodiversity faces threats.
</P>
<P>
The country suffered from high temperatures last year and its
northern areas were hit by drought, affected by the unusually
strong El Nino, which was unfavorable to the country's
agriculture, the report added.
</P>
<P>
China issues its annual environmental situation report every
year before June 5, the World Environmental Day, in accordance
with its Environmental Protection Law, in a bid to increase
awareness of its environmental situation, improve the public's
environmental awareness, and promote international cooperation and
exchanges in the field.
</P>
<P>
The national data in the report do not cover Hong Kong, Taiwan
or Macao.

<HEADLINE> hke060359 -Pak Reiterates Readiness to Resume Dialogue with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan on Wednesday reiterated his country's readiness to
resume dialogue with India and called for multilateral efforts for
an early solution to the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Multilateral efforts are required to solve the core and
fundamental issue of Jammu and Kashmir which has led to
nuclearization of South Asia, said Gohar during a meeting with
Japanese Ambassador to Pakistan Minoru Kubota, according to an
official press release.
</P>
<P>
Gohar stressed that Pakistan was compelled to conduct nuclear
tests in order to protect its national security which was
"threatened" by India's nuclear program and "belligerent
statements" emanating from the Indian leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he appreciated the concern Japan had shown about
Pakistan's security and emphasized the need to further strengthen
the mutually-beneficial ties between Pakistan and Japan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Japanese ambassador reiterated his
government's proposal of hosting a meeting between India and
Pakistan in Tokyo to solve the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
He informed Gohar that Japanese leaders had said that the
Kashmir issue was the root cause of the problem in South Asia and
the United Nations General Assembly should help resolve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ambassador on Wednesday also called on Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who said on the occasion that his
country had no choice but to rectify the strategic imbalance in
the region because Indian nuclear explosions had created serious
threats to the security of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to another press release issued by the government,
Pakistan has formally welcomed the Japanese proposal to host a
meeting between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad on Wednesday told
the Japanese ambassador at the Foreign Office that Pakistan
appreciates that Japan has taken the lead and focused on the root
cause of tensions and the necessity of a just settlement of the
Kashmir dispute which alone can promote peace and stability in
South Asia.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) signed here on Wednesday an air
services agreement with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip and
Luxembourg's Minister of Communications and Transport Mady
Delvaux-Stehres signed the accord on behalf of their respective
governments. The prime minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude
Juncker, was present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
"Air cargo transport provides an important link between Hong
Kong and Luxembourg," Ip said while speaking at the signing
ceremony. "Our aviation relations date back to 1972, when Cargolux
started all-cargo services to Hong Kong. Since then Cargolux has
been playing an important role in promoting our bilateral trade."
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the air services agreement opens a new chapter
in the economic and aviation relations between Hong Kong and
Luxembourg. I look forward to the continued growth of the
bilateral relations in the years to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR/Luxembourg agreement is the 29th air services
agreement signed by Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Acts to Ease Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will create at least
100,000 jobs in the next 18 months to ease the rising
unemployment, which hit a 14-year high of 3.9 percent, Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our employment prospects in the foreseeable future are
positive. More jobs will go around," Tsang said after chairing a
meeting of a government employment task force.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force on Employment met for the first time here
Wednesday to address the unemployment problem and explore ways of
creating jobs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Tsang stressed that tackling unemployment requires concerted,
collective and continued efforts from the government, the business
sector and the community.
</P>
<P>
"... there is no panacea in tackling unemployment. This is
likely to be a long battle," he said. "The answer to the
unemployment problem, both here in Hong Kong and elsewhere, lies
with economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
During the three months up to April 1998, the jobless rate in
Hong Kong soared to 3.9 percent, the highest since 1984. It stood
at 3.5 percent in the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force on Employment met to assess the potential
employment opportunities as a result of the government's major
policy initiatives, infrastructure development and public works.
</P>
<P>
It said in an assessment report that the Special Administrative
Region government will be able to offer 11,000 posts at all levels
in the civil service in the current financial year which ends in
March 1999. The remaining 89,000 new jobs will be created by the
private sector and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Tsang also unveiled a package of 12
measures aimed at creating more jobs, strengthening employment
services, enhancing training and retraining, promoting further
education and combating illegal employment.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure development, which is expected to involve a
total investment of 235 billion HK dollars (30 billion U.S.
dollars) over the next five years, will generate 40,600 jobs in
the upcoming 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will boost its spending on
labor-intensive maintenance works, advance commencement of public
works, and speed up the construction of environmental projects in
an attempt to provide more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Set up in April 1998, the Task Force on Employment comprises
senior government officials and representatives from the business
and employee sectors, the academia and training institutions. The
financial secretary said the task force would meet regularly and
work hard with all concerned.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Toughens Measures to Protest Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIRUT, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Any one found to have cut down a tree
without approval in Lebanon would be jailed and fined up to 10,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Agriculture Ministry has drafted a bill containing
strict regulations on protecting trees that are threatened by
increasing haphazard building work in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The bill, the first of such type in the country, forbids falling
any tree without the approval from the ministry, according to a
ministry statement available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If the bill is passed, any violator would face a prison sentence
up to three years, with a fine of up to 15 million Lebanese pounds
(about 10,000 U.S. dollars) for each tree that has been cut down or
uprooted, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, any type of public work must be preceded by an
assessment of its damage to the environment.
</P>
<P>
In exceptional cases, the ministry would give approval with the
proviso that the builders replant trees within its boundaries under
strict guidelines and supervision.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the creation of the bill "was prompted by the
treat of deforestation" that kept growing with economic activities
after the end of the civil war in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is concerned with a sudden expansion of villages,
the construction of wide roads through forested areas, and the
threat of landslides and pollution, it added.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM to Visit France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko will begin a two-day visit to France on Wednesday to
enhance economic ties between the countries.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that the visit by Kiriyenko is apparently
aimed at re-establishing the credit of Russia in the eyes of
international investors, as the country is experiencing a serious
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be Kiriyenko's first trip abroad since he took
office in April.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko will meet with President Jacques Chirac and Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin on Wednesday evening, and will co-chair
with Jospin a session of the Russian-French joint economic
committee on bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Paris, Kiriyenko said that Russia wishes to
reinforce its economic relations with France.
</P>
<P>
Besides bilateral relations, Kiriyenko is also expected to
discuss with French leaders the provision of financial aid to
Russia by the most industrialized nations of the G-7 group.
</P>
<P>
France, which registered a 5.5 billion franc (900 million
U.S. dollar) deficit in its trade with Russia in 1997, also wishes
to expand its economic cooperation with Russia in energy and other
fields.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Trading Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
trading stronger Wednesday but was well off its intraday highs
after strong growth data failed to inflame buyers.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended the local session at 61.66 U.S. cents
after closing at 61.23 here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
revealed gross domestic product (GDP) rising by a seasonally
adjusted 1.3 percent for the March quarter, for an annual growth
of 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The result had economic growth steaming ahead of expectations
in the first three months of 1998, despite the threat from the
economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the very strong number, the Australian dollar really
still remained very bearish," Rothschild Australia treasury
manager Paul Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
Market participants took on board comments by analysts that the
headline figure of a 1.3-percent rise was very misleading because
of a build-up in business inventories.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Markets chief economist John Edwards said the figures
portrayed an economy where consumption spending and investment
were flat and domestic final demand was negative (down 0.3 percent
in the quarter) for the first time in many years.
</P>
<P>
He added that if it were not for the buildup of stocks, the
expenditure measure would also have been negative.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas also said a major local bank appeared to be active
in the market, selling Australian dollars for a Japanese concern.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar has of late been tracking the fortunes of
the yen and traders said that would continue for some time.
</P>
<P>
Commodity prices is also a negative factor weighing on the
Australian dollar, and while both the yen and the gold price have
improved over the past 24 hours, traders said neither was out of
the woods yet.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended the day here at 84.90 from 85.32
against the Japanese yen and at 1.0947 from 1.0906 against the
German mark.

<HEADLINE> China Not to Resume N-Testing: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
that China opposes all nuclear tests and will not resume such
tests itself.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark when meeting with Jean Miot, president
of Agence France Presse, here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on whether China would resume nuclear
testing, following the suit of India and Pakistan, he noted that
China opposes the nuclear arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose the nuclear tests conducted by India and have
expressed serious regret over the nuclear tests carried out
by Pakistan. However, India originated the tense situation
in the region," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that even though China has nuclear weapons, it is
committed to not using nuclear weapons first, and advocates the
complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons. "China will not resume nuclear testing," he reiterated.

<HEADLINE> EU Strives for Customs Flexibility, Simplicity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Wednesday requested European legislators and government officials
to make customs code more flexible and simple.
</P>
<P>
In a report sent to the European Parliament and the European
Council of Ministers, the commission stressed that efforts must
chiefly be concentrated on organizing and coordinating national
systems so that existing customs rules may be better applied.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the European Union, urged
amendment of the basic regulation for the sake of greater
flexibility, specially in such matters as customs debt, and for
the sake of simplicity of formalities for customs declaration.
</P>
<P>
The European Union codified its customs law in 1993 when
hundreds of legal instruments were replaced with significant
improvements in transparency and simplicity.
</P>
<P>
The commission claimed to have taken several steps to improve
the efficiency of customs policy, both for the uniform application
of customs rules and for protecting the European Union's financial
interests.
</P>
<P>
It proposed to the legislators and government officials that
there should be more flexibility relating to the requirement to
submit certain accompanying documents with the goods declaration
in order to remove an obstacle to the computerization of customs
clearance procedures.

<HEADLINE> China Implements National Software Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China has begun to implement a
universal supervision system for technological standards of all
computer software produced in the country.
</P>
<P>
A relevant government institute issued the first group of
certificates of registration to 23 software products of 24 local
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Ministry of the Information
Industry, the national software registration system is aimed at
creating a fair market environment for software manufacturers in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the registration system is not a copyright system.
</P>
<P>
Under the registration system, The government examines every
software product to see whether it has the technological
characteristics that the manufacturer claims, and, if it has,
whether these functions comply with national standards.
</P>
<P>
The software that passes the examination will receive certificates
of competence.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that the registration system will help
users choose among various software products.
</P>
<P>
At present, the National Software Products Administration
Center is the government institute in charge of the examination
and registration work.
</P>
<P>
China's computer industry has expanded at an annual rate of
more than 50 percent for the past seven consecutive years. Sales
of PCs totaled 3.5 million items in China last year. In the same
period, the local software industry grew by over 30 percent per
year, with the local software market exceeding 11 billion yuan
(about 1.3 billion US dollars)-worth in 1997. China now has five
national software production centers.

<P>
BONN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were killed and
many others wounded when a high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in a rail station in the northeastern German town of
Eschede, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred before 11 a.m. (local time) when the
Intercity-Express, the country's fastest train, was on the way to
Hamburg from Munich.
</P>
<P>
The train jumped tracks when traveling at a speed of about 200
kilometers an hour, slamming into the base of a road bridge. About
13 cars went off the tracks.
</P>
<P>
The death toll has not been officially confirmed and the
wounded are being airlifted by helicopters to nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
About 400 rescue workers at the scene were trying to retrieve
the injured from the wreckage. They were having difficulties
reaching the injured because the bridge had collapsed onto the
telescoped carriages.
</P>
<P>
So far, the cause of the accident is still unknown.

<HEADLINE> India Not Rules Out Increase in Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
said Wednesday that India does not rule out any increase in the
defense budget in the future if it is warranted.
</P>
<P>
Talking to foreign journalists here, he said no country could
afford to ignore its national security concerns. The 14-percent
increase in the defense allocation in the 1998-99 budget,
presented to the parliament on Monday, is meager as it is mostly
to take care of the inflation and growth.
</P>
<P>
Turning to nuclear weaponization, he said it would be financed
out of the funds provided in the budget for the defense research
and development organization.
</P>
<P>
India conducted five nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 and has a
plan for nuclear weaponization, which have been denounced by the
world community.
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes told the on-going
Upper House session Wednesday that the government has approved the
next phase of the 2,500-kilometer long-range missile Agni for
developing a longer-range missile system in the country. The
present Agni project has been completed.
</P>
<P>
He said an integrated guided missiles development program
undertaken by the defense research and development organization in
June 1983 for the design, development and limited production of
four missile systems -- Perithvi, Trishul, Akash, Nag -- and a
re-entry technology demonstration project of Agni is in progress.

<HEADLINE> Downward Trend Persists in Australian Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- An improvement in gold and
resource stocks and strong economic growth figures Wednesday
failed to reverse this week's downward trend on the Australian
sharemarket.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index fell 9.1 points to 2662.0 in tepid
trade, with a weakening of the Japanese market providing another
dampener for local sentiment.
</P>
<P>
"It looked good this morning but the information we got has
hurt the market, plus we had the rally yesterday afternoon," said
Steve Negrine from Reynolds and Co.
</P>
<P>
"No one is enthusiastic. It's difficult to get anyone keen
about buying in this market."
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index was down 24.9 points at 4625.6, with
banking stocks generally weaker after stronger than expected
growth figures severely damaged hopes for a cut in official
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Growth of 1.3 percent in the March quarter was higher than
market expectations.
</P>
<P>
"The GDP figure showed a bit of growth and counts out any more
rate cuts," Negrine said.
</P>
<P>
ANZ fell 24 cents to 10.77 Australian dollars after going
ex-dividend, while Westpac dropped 5.2 cents and Colonial added
eight cents.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said that major institution Merrill Lynch was a late
seller in several major stocks.
</P>
<P>
Global media giant News Corp added one cent while its preferred
shares were four cents stronger.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 5.1 points higher at 1085.1
after Tuesday's heavy fall.
</P>
<P>
Rio Tinto rose 35 cents to 19.30 Australian dollars while BHP
shed one cent to 13.80 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index retraced some of Tuesday's losses, rising 22.3
points as the bullion price surged and closed 6.70 U.S. dollars
higher at 294.35.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 257.2 million shares, worth 789.9 million
Australian dollars (489.73 million U.S. dollars), with falls of
652 outnumbering rises of 396, while 404 stocks were steady.

<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the financial
community in China and the United States will discuss the Asian
financial crisis at a seminar to be held here on June 9.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President George Bush and Governor of the People's
Bank of China Dai Xianglong will address the seminar, which will
be organized by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship
with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and the U.S.-based Chubb Group of

</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss the backgrounds against the
financial crisis, its impact on China and the world as a whole,
and measures China has taken to prevent the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis, which broke out in July last year, has
thrown many countries in both southeast and northeast Asia into
economic plight and has had an enormous impact on the global
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the effect of the crisis is still
lingering on and that against this backgroud, the seminar will

<HEADLINE> Jobless Reach New High in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployment rate
reached 8.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, the highest
since the last quarter of 1993, triggering new debate over the
government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available Wednesday, the unemployment
rate is 1 percent higher than that in the same period of last year
and 0.8 percent higher than that of the previous quarter. It means
some 189,000 people are without work.
</P>
<P>
The figures aroused a storm among politicians and labor
experts, partly because Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman has
recently said that the country's economy has begun to turn around.
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers quoted Labor and Social Affairs Minister
Eli Ishai as saying Tuesday that much of the blame lies with the
Bank of Israel's tight policy. Meanwhile, Immigration and
Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein called on the government to
pump state funds into the workforce rather than improving the road
and rail infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
But Neeman rejected the criticism on the government's policies,
saying that the situation would be even worse without them. He
said the government would continue to allow the private sector to
develop and grow, to serve as an engine for the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also strongly denies that its monetary policy
is the cause of the rise in the unemployment rate. It suggested
that the problem is structural, with many people falling victim to
the change from traditional industries to high-tech ones.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Link Smoking to Hearing Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A five-year study of 3,753
people of the age 48 to 92 found that smokers are 1.7 times as
likely to suffer from hearing loss than nonsmokers, the Journal of
the American Medical Association said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The more people smoked, the greater their risk of hearing loss,
said the study, funded by the National Institute on Aging and
conducted by researchers at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
Karen Cruickshanks, leading researcher of the study, reported
that people who smoked an average of a pack a day for 40 years
were 1.3 times as likely to have a hearing loss as those who
smoked a pack a day for a decade.
</P>
<P>
She also said that nonsmokers who lived with smokers were
almost twice as likely to have hearing loss than those who were
not exposed to smoke at home.
</P>
<P>
Of the participants between the ages of 60 and 69, the results
of the study showed that 35.3 percent of nonsmokers suffered a
hearing loss, compared with 47.3 percent of ex-smokers and 56.4
percent of current smokers.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Leonetti, a professor at Loyola University Medical
Center in Maywood who specializes in the study of ear-related
disorders, said doctors like himself already believed smoking
could cause hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
Whether smoking actually contributes to hearing loss is still
unclear. To confirm the link, the study's authors are now
conducting a five-year follow-up study, in which they are tracking
hearing changes among smokers and nonsmokers in order to determine
if a direct cause-and-effect relationship exists.
</P>
<P>
Hearing loss is estimated to affect 30 to 35 percent of adults
aged 65 to 75 years old in the United States.

NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 21 people were killed
and nine others injured in a landslide triggered by heavy rains in
Assam state's Cachar district, eastern India, Wednesday, official
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have pulled 18 bodies out of the rubble of
thatched huts of the victims and search was on for three more
victims.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the worst landslides in recent years in the
state. The victims, mostly tea garden laborers dwelling on a
hillock, were buried alive when torrential rains and high velocity
winds razed to the ground mud-built thatched huts along the
hillside adjoining the Chandighat tea estate.
</P>
<P>
The casualties were feared to be higher as searchers went on to

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a bridge connecting
Macao and Zhuhai in south China's Guangdong province will start
later this month, the Sino-Portuguese Infrastructure Coordination
Commission (SPICC) has decided.
</P>
<P>
The commission will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the
launch of the bridge at the end of June, said a press communique
issued Tuesday following the commission's two-day plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The planned bridge, scheduled to be completed before the
handover next year, will open up a new passage between Macao and
Zhuhai apart from the current land border gate.
</P>
<P>
"It will help improve Macao's outward land transportation
conditions and facilitate the development of Macao's islands and
Zhuhai's Hengqin Island," said Xie Houhe, chief of the Chinese
side of the commission.
</P>
<P>
With a planned investment of more than 200 million patacas
(about 25 million U.S. dollars), the bridge will be 1.3 kilometers
long with six traffic lanes. It is 22 meters high above the water
surface.
</P>
<P>
The investment will be shared equally by Macao and Zhuhai. Each
side is responsible for the construction of its part of the
bridge. It will be managed by governments of both sides and will
be toll free for traffic.

<HEADLINE> South Chinese City Goes From Noisy To Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- People who are used to the noise
of a city may be surprised on the streets of Nanning, the capital
of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Some residents call it a miracle, it's as if they were suddenly
thrown into a different world on September 1, 1997, when drivers
were prohibited from blowing their horns in this city of 1.28
million people, 63 percent of whom are members of the Zhuang
ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Nanning has an area of only 84 square kilometers, with 220,000
motor vehicles, 144,000 of them motorcycles. To this number are
added 1.3 million bicycles and a large number of vehicles from
outside the city, all crammed into the narrow streets, leading to
a lot of honking, which has had a bad effect on local citizens.
</P>
<P>
"My house is near the road," one person complains, "so to deal
with the noise, my son has to close the windows to do his
homework, even on hot days."
</P>
<P>
China has had a noise law since March, 1997, and since
September of 1997, Nanning has sought to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
A recent study showed the average noise level on the city's
main streets having dropped from 74 decibels to 69.9 decibels,
making Nanning one of the most successful cities in reducing the
honking.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the amount of noise coming from construction sites,
factories and residential areas was another task of the Nanning
Environment Protection Bureau, which last year reinforced
restrictions at 220 major constrution sites.
</P>
<P>
It even stopped constrution work near schools during the annual
entrance examinations last summer, a move that was highly praised
by teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's efforts brought Nanning's average noise volume
down to 57.8 decibels in 1997, much lower than the national level.

foreign investors turned out to be net buyers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Players also sold following Tuesday's rebound in the Nikkei

JINAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Qufu city in east China, the
birthplace of Confucius, is using a computerized file system to
manage historic and cultural relics at the Confucian Temple.
</P>

Confucius, one of the most famous philosophers and educators in
ancient China.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Calls for Asia-Pacific Information Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong Wednesday urged the creation of an Asia-Pacific information
society to timely reap the benefits of convergence for the
Asia-Pacific's role in the global information society.
</P>
<P>
"It is a bold vision to create an Asia-Pacific information
society," Goh said in his opening address at the Third APEC
Ministerial Meeting for Telecommunications and the Information
Industry.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "the vision will not only have the
development of telecommunications and information technology but
also the society of the future."
</P>
<P>
The arrival of an information era will have great consequences
"far more significant than we could ever imagine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunication ministers and their representatives from APEC
members are attending the meeting whose theme is "Realizing the
Asia-Pacific Information Society."
</P>
<P>
Goh urged Asian economies struggling in the economic crisis not
to hesitate in making efforts to develop the telecommunications
and information industry. "Some economies may not give priority to
prepare for the advent of the Asia-Pacific information society.
but they would pay a price for the delay," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the "financial crisis has shown how crucial
it is for us to deal with the challenges of an increasingly
interdependent and networked global environment." "Our markets
have become so interlinked that the difficulties one economy faces
invariably affect other economies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Asia is reeling from an economic crisis, the prime
minister also said, "This crisis is partly brought about by
globalization and the revolutionary changes in telecommunications
and information technology."

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Archives' "Guardian Spirits" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- In a spacious workroom not far from
the Lhasa River, 74-year-old Ngawang Qoida, the eldest archivist
of the Archives of Tibetan History, sits cross-legged on a
cushion, busy with his daily work, arranging stacks of archives.
</P>
<P>
Official documents are a major part of the Archives' files,
which are crucial to Tibetan historical research, he says.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan History Archives now has more than three million files
from the Tibetan regional government, since Tibet was officially
incorporated into China in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
The Archives houses a fifth of the country's total archives
concerning Tibet, including letters and official documents
exchanged between the central and Tibetan regional governments,
imperial edicts and decrees, and reports to the emperors from the
regional governments.
</P>
<P>
The Archives has a staff of 100 people, the older ones are all
specialists in Tibetan language and history, and many of the
younger ones have received professional training in categorization
and conservation of archives.
</P>
<P>
Workers began rescuing Tibetan archives in 1959 when the
central government provided manpower and money to collect more
than three million volumes and over 400 gunnysacks of files, most
of them quite worn and scattered about in different regional
government agencies, official residences, and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
The Archives was completed in 1984, and began using microfilm
in 1990, thanks to President Jiang Zemin, who noticed, after a
visit to Tibet, that the Archives was still using primitive
methods in its filing system.
</P>
<P>
The microfilm has greatly prolonged the life of historical
files and made the use of archival resources possible, according
to Dagwa, a microphotography technician of the first generation at
the Archives. Some 140,000 volumes of historical files are now on
microfilm.
</P>
<P>
And Zhouga, the director of the Archives, says, "People like
Ngawang Qoida are really the guardian spirits of Tibet's
historical files, and they have contributed quite a lot to the
conservation of Tibet's archives."

<HEADLINE> IMF Provides Credit Facility to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF)has released 53 million U.S. Dollars to Zimbabwe following
its executive board's approval of the country's request for 176
million U.S. Dollars stand-by credit facility.
</P>
<P>
In a statement faxed from Washington, the IMF said that the
next tranche of 18 million U.S. Dollars would be released in
mid-August subject to the Zimbabwean government's meeting the set
targets by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"The International Monetary Fund's Executive Board approved on
June 1, 1998, a thirteen-month stand-by arrangement for Zimbabwe
equivalent to special drawing rights (SDR) 130.5 million or 176
million U.S. Dollars," the Zimbabwe News Agency Tuesday quoted
the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The first tranche under the arrangement equivalent to 39.1
million SDR or 53 million U.S. Dollars has been disbursed,"the
IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Three additional tranches of 35 million U.S. Dollars each
would be disbursed in mid-November and in the middle of February
and May 1999 subject to the country's economic performance at the
end of September and December 1998 and March next year.
</P>
<P>
Following the approval, an IMF team is expected in Harare in
July to start discussions on a three-year enhanced structural
adjustment facility (ESAF) which could replace the stand-by
arrangement before its expiry.
</P>
<P>
ESAF will also provide the country larger access to IMF
resources on concessional terms.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe desperately needs an injection of foreign currency to
improve its balance-of-payments position and kick-start the
second phase of economic reforms, the Zimbabwe program for
economic and social transformation (ZIMPREST).
</P>
<P>
The IMF, the world's lender of last resort, suspended crucial
financial aid to Zimbabwe in September 1995 because of what was
seen as the government's fiscal indiscipline.
</P>
<P>
However, in interviews with the Zimbabwe News Agency,
economists and market analysts said that the latest IMF move was
just a short-term measure and warned that the country could miss
the set targets if it does not urgently restore macro-economic
stability.

Uygur Autonomous Region, thanks to the regional government's
arduous efforts.
</P>
<P>
An employment insurance fund of more than 16 million yuan
(about two million US dollars) has been set up in the autonomous
region, and more than 3,400 disabled people have received

Statistics show that among the 540,000 disabled people in
Xinjiang, 200,000 are living in poverty, one fifth of the
region's poverty-stricken population.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local governments at all levels have increased
poverty-relief input and promulgated laws and regulations to
safeguard the interests of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies have also been carried out in rural
areas, which have saved the disabled people 21 million yuan of
various fee charges.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Resume Drug Export to Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will resume export of
manufactured pharmaceutical products to Ghana next month, 10
years after it was banned by the Ghanaian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the export was made possible by the lifting
of the ban by Ghana in November 1996 after bilateral talks, the
Guardian newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It added that officials of the Ghanaian Food and Drugs Board
had given a favorable assessment of Nigeria's drug manufacturing
facilities early this year.
</P>
<P>
Official sources at the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Group of
the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (PMGMAN) estimated that
Nigeria will be able to export 500 million Naira (about five
million U.S. Dollars) worth of drugs to Ghana in the third
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
It was also estimated that export to Ghana will boost the
capacity utilization of Nigeria's pharmaceutical sector from the
current 20 percent to about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Valentine Ofili, the executive secretary of the PMGMAN, was
quoted as saying that a symposium and exhibition will be held in
Ghanaian capital Accra from July 14 to 17 for the promotion of
drugs made in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
About 30 Nigerian firms will attend the event organized by a
Ghanaian consultancy firm, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Registration Number Deal Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangming Daily reports on
cases involving the illegal selling of registration numbers at
Tongren Hospital, a nationally-known eye disease hospital.
</P>
<P>
One of the paper's reporters went to the hospital, in downtown
Beijing, recently around 5 o'clock in the morning and found about
300 people waiting at the registration office.
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to jump the queue?" one man came over and asked
him.
</P>
<P>
"Sure, but how?" was his answer.
</P>
<P>
"If you give 100 yuan, you can get expert's registration below
the 50th place, 30 yuan will get a place between 50 and 80, and 10
yuan will get an ordinary doctor," was the reply.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see to it that you get registered. If not, you don't
pay," the seller added.
</P>
<P>
At around 7 o'clock, when the registration window was about to
open, a man who claimed to be a hospital employee came out and
told the crowd, "Those with numbers come first and queue up, all
others please form another queue."
</P>
<P>
So, the people who paid the illegal fee got priority in
registering, while those who didn't, no matter how early they
came, had to wait.
</P>
<P>
After several of these media exposure, the hospital
administration began to take steps to stop this by warning
patients.
</P>
<P>
However, some people still seem to be ready to pay the sellers,
and many others are ready to come queue up as early as 3 or 4 in
the morning, the hospital authorities say. The local police
station says that it has also got involved to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
But, the reporter say, neither the hospital authorities nor the
local police have really been as effective as they claim.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Report New Impotence Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Two experimental drugs that can
be taken orally look like promising alternatives to Viagra for the
treatment of male erectile dysfunction (MED), U.S. scientists
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a study of an experimental drug called Phentolamine or
Vasomax, about 37 percent of men with mild to moderate impotence
responded to a 40 milligram dose and 45 percent responded to an 80
milligram dose, reported Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a professor of
surgery at Boston University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Viagra, Phentolamine could safely be used by men taking
nitrates -- such as nitroglycerin -- for heart disease, said
Goldstein, adding that the major side effect of the drug was nasal
congestion.
</P>
<P>
The drug will be available in the United States in a year or
so, the doctor estimated.
</P>
<P>
Another impotence drug, apomorphine, is designed to be taken
under the tongue. In a study of 457 patients, 60 percent of men
taking a six milligram dose of the drug achieved an erection firm
enough for intercourse, reported Dr. Harin Padma-Nathan of the
University of Southern California Medical School.
</P>
<P>
"The most common adverse event was nausea, which was mild in
most cases and was associated with a high degree of habituation
people got used to it," Dr. Padma-Nathan said.

structure of automobile, machine-building, electronic and
metallurgical industries, and to produce more well-selling
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
The city has worked out policies to encourage large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises to upgrade traditional
industries with imported high-tech, and to raise technology of
industrial production and in-depth processing standards, said the

<HEADLINE> Xi'an Ups Investment to Ensure Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- This capital of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province has decided to increase investment to ensure that
it hits its economic growth target for this year.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, the largest city in Northwest China, has reported an
annual economic growth rate of more than 14 percent for six
consecutive years, and it aims for the same growth rate this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest official statistics show that Xi'an's gross
domestic product grew 10.6 percent in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the relative economic slowdown to
insufficient demand, and significant drops in exports and foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the successful realization of the targeted economic
growth rate, Xi'an will increase its investment in infrastructure
in the remaining months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The city's fixed-assets investment is planned at 14.8 billion
yuan for the April-December period, a surge of 26.6 percent over
the corresponding period of last year. Of this amount, 10.26
billion yuan will be invested in infrastructure facilities, the
rural economy and the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an has also decided to take measures to stimulate
consumption, with planned investment in real estate fixed at 2.24
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The capital of several dynasties, Xi'an also plans to receive
500,000 overseas tourists this year, with tourism-based foreign
exchange earnings targeted at 210 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Suspends Health Grants to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Danish government has
suspended grants worth 36 million U.S. Dollars to Uganda due to
the mismanagement of the funds.
</P>
<P>
An official in the health ministry was quoted by Wednesday's
New Vision paper as saying that the suspension is not true. But
Deputy Danish Ambassador to Uganda Jens K. Rasmussen confirmed
the suspension.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the grants will only be released till there
has been fundamental improvement in fund management in the
ministry of health.
</P>
<P>
"We have temporarily stopped our health sector grants because
we have been having problems with mismanagement which we are
trying to address. We hope for further dialog on the matter with
the ministry of health," he said.
</P>
<P>
The suspension is reportedly to have affected several big
national health programs and grants to some districts. An order
for drug kits for 1,400 clinics throughout the country has been
stopped.
</P>
<P>
The decision came at a time when the ministry of health is
grappling with mismanagement of the funds.
</P>
<P>
An internal audit, the report said, revealed that millions of
U.S. Dollars were spent on a conference in a hotel in Gulu
district which did not exist. But the bill was paid out of the
Danish funds.
</P>
<P>
Another audit said that the National Medical Stores (NMS)
could not account for some 1.2 million U.S. Dollars purportedly
banked between March 1996 and January 1998. And even some
transactions were conducted through a Dollar bank account which
did not exist in NMS records.

HARBIN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 125 people who were
comatose in northeast China's Heilongjiang province have recovered
the ability to speak and move, and even take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
Of them, four have returned to normal life and 29 have generally
recovered.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, doctors in the Heilongjiang Province Recovery Hospital
developed a special treatment for people who were injured in
various accidents.
</P>
<P>
They have treated comatose patients with a combination of
hyperbaric oxygenation, surgery, physiotherapy, acupuncture, and
massage.
</P>
<P>
The doctors say they usually bring the patients back to
consciousness within 40 days, even in seven days.
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients have lost consciousness and cannot move at
all except for the eyes. Doctors worldwide still have no effective
cure for such patients and some countries even opt for
euthanasia.

<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Guangzhao, a prominent
physicist who is Vice-Chairman of China's National People's
Congress Standing Committee, has told an academic congress of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) that scientists need to be
innovative and pioneering to support industrial development at the
turn of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who is president of the China Association for Science and
Technology, said that the 21st century will be a knowledge-backed
era and listed some major discoveries of Chinese scientists,
especially in physics.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe is building a large accelerator with
billions of U.S. dollars, but that China built an
electron-positron collider with much less money. The Beijing
collider is the best accelerator for research on charms, the basic
unit for forming an atom and a neutron. The U.S. has decided to
suspend work at an accelerator at Harvard and has asked some
scientists to work in China, Zhou says.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese scientists have shown how gravity pulled
the earth and the sun together and how gluons link up fundamental
particles. ( more)

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Russia to Act on Direct Export of Flowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Russia are working out
modalities to facilitate direct export of Kenya's flowers to
Moscow, the Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho has said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government was addressing the export policies with
Russia to solve obstacles which hinder the entrance of more local
products to the Russian market, Wednesday's Kenya Times quoted
Kamotho as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trade minister noted that the high quality flowers
produced in the east African country could gain a wider market in
Moscow and other cities in Russia if exported directly without
going through Holland.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he received a delegation led by Juriy
Kotow, President of the Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
who paid a courtesy call on the minister.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the trade volume between the two countries which
stands at the level of 16 million U.S. Dollars, the minister said
that it has been negligible compared with trade between Kenya and
her principle trade partners.
</P>
<P>
Kotow told the Kenyan minister that his delegation was in
Nairobi to explore business opportunities, saying that "we have
come to Kenya with projects and ideas to discuss with our Kenyan
counterparts."
</P>
<P>
He said that major Russian companies are studying the
possibilities of setting up joint ventures in assembly plants for
motorcycles, bicycles and other accessories.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is a potentially good market for Russian goods, said
Kotow, adding that his country is willing to supply Kenya with
drugs, trucks and drilling machines.
</P>
<P>
The current visit by the Russians followed last year's meeting
between Moscow Mayor Y.V. Luozkov and Kenyan former Foreign
Minister Kalonzo Musyoka.

XI'AN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Drinking water quality in Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, has been improved,

down or relocated and 179 low-level refineries have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
To deal with worsening water shortage caused by rapid economic
development, the city has launched a series of water-supply
projects. After the completion of the Heihe river aqueduction
project, an on-going 2.5 billion-yuan(about 300 million US
dollars) project, the city's water supply capacity will rise to
more than 1.72 million cubic meters each day.

Zhou said he believes that China is out in front superconductor
research and was only three months behind Japan in magnet
discoveries, and that the U.S.'s General Motors has transferred
its permanent magnet work to a CAS company.
</P>
<P>
Also, many top laboratories are buying nonlinear optical
crystals from China.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also mentioned important discoveries in other fields, like
the technique that uses highly poisonous white arsenic to treat
leukaemia and other kinds of cancers. Because of molecular
studies, Chinese scientists found that the white arsenic can alter
chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that, although China lags behind some
developed countries in the field of microelectronics, it can
develop new products with advanced chips from abroad, and a CAS
lab has developed a kind of telephone black box for Internet users.
</P>
<P>
He said that knowledge is shared by all of mankind in a
knowledge economy, but that China can only catch up with the rest
of the world by inventing things after using foreign ideas.

<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say that a
57-kilometer tunnel should be built in Bohai Bay to link the
Shangdong and Liaodong peninsulas.
</P>
<P>
The idea was put forth at a seminar held recently on using
subterranean space in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel would greatly shorten the distance between northeast
China and eastern and northern China and would help the balanced
development of the regional economy, "Economic Reference Daily"
quoted the scientists as saying.
</P>
<P>
They say that subterranean space should be combined with urban
development.
</P>
<P>
A seabed tunnel should also be built in the Qiongzhou Strait,
connecting the Leizhou Peninsula, in Guangdong Province, with the
island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Subway construction should be one of the key projects of this
space utilization program in the next century also.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The economic and technological
development zone of Dalian, a port city in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, has been practicing preferential policies to
develop high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
One preferential policy announced recently stipulates that
high-tech enterprises will be given a wide range of preferential
treatment, including tax rebates on added value if they market
their own commodities, and exemption from tax levies on business
earnings generated by technological activities such as
technological transfer, consultancy and other technological
service, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
To support industrialization of high-tech enterprises, the
development zone has also decided to earmark 20 million yuan
annually for a scientific and technological progress fund
beginning from this year.
</P>
<P>
It will also set aside one percent of its revenue each year for
a scientific and technological risk investment fund, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone, 27.5 km
away from the downtown area of Dalian City, covers a total area of
24 sq km. It was approved as a national-level economic and
technological development zone in September 1984 and began
construction in October of the same year.
</P>
<P>
By September 1997, businessmen from 40 countries and regions
have invested in the zone and have started more than 1,000
overseas-funded businesses, with the paid-in volume of overseas
investment amounting to 2.49 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are also more than 7,000 domestically-funded enterprises
in the zone, with their registered investment standing at 10.1
billion yuan, said local sources.

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Industry Gives Priority to Civilian Application (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear industry is
stepping up its shift from military production to civilian
application and is becoming a new powerhouse of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear industry is now operating under a new system
featuring a combination of military and civilian production,
development of nuclear electric power and a diversified economy,
with nuclear technology as the foundation, said a senior official
with the China Nuclear Industry Corp.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the nuclear sector has established a
large number of enterprise groups over the past few years in the
economically-developed coastal areas such as Shanghai in east
China and Guangdong province in south China, and has developed
more than 1,500 kinds of civilian products.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear industrial economy has been expanding in China by
maintaining a high growth rate in a succession of years, resulting
in remarkable improvement in the country's comprehensive economic
strength.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output of civilian products now makes up over 80
percent of China's nuclear industrial output, which is 20 times
the total when adjusting efforts first began.
</P>
<P>
Development of nuclear power is a major way for the industry to
make strategic adjustments, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station of east China's Zhejiang and
the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in south China's Guangdong
province have been operating safely.
</P>
<P>
The two nuclear power stations have not only alleviated
electric power shortages in east China and Guangdong, but also
have transmitted a large quantity of power to Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Cannabis Called Serious Problem in Northern NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Cannabis grown in Northland,
northern New Zealand, earns over 700 million New Zealand dollars
(370 million U.S. dollars) a year in street value and possibly
much more, a New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) report said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a study by Auckland University as claiming that
cannabis from the region generates a cash turnover much greater
than its dairy industry, which earned around 400 million dollars
(220 million U.S. dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The study also finds that many rural communities and towns in
Northland rely on cannabis money to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
Cannabis is a means of survival for many Maori families
struggling in poverty, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is common in Northland for children as young as 10 to smoke
cannabis. NZPA quoted a health worker in the region as saying that
of 56 children she spoke with in one school, 54 were cannabis
users.

The two nuclear power stations, which are now under commercial
operation, have both been economically viable. Per-capita annual
output of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station is more than 4
million yuan, while per-capita annual output of the first phase of
the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station exceeds 700,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Practice has proved that the investment return rate of nuclear
power is not lower than that of coal-burning electric power
stations. The nuclear industry with power development as its main
feature has become a new powerhouse of China's national economy.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the second and third phases of Qinshan, and the
Ling'ao and Lianyungang nuclear power stations are all in full
swing.
</P>
<P>
By early next century China's nuclear power generating capacity
should amount to 9.2 million kilowatts and, by then, earnings from
sales of nuclear power are expected to reach 30 billion yuan a
year. The industrial structure of the country's nuclear industry
will be further improved at that point, coupled with improved
economy and technology.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power now contributes one percent of China's total
power output, but nuclear power makes up 17 percent of the world's
total power output. Clean and highly efficient, nuclear power has
advantages in the market based on a range of factors such as
energy structure, the environment and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces of east China, Hainan
province of south China and Hunan province of central-south China
have all been active in making preparations for constructing their
own nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
In the next century, China is expected to have a significant
development in nuclear power. By the year 2010 China's nuclear
power-generating capacity will reach 20 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
And by 2020, China's nuclear power-generating capacity should
reach 40 million kilowatts and the proportion of nuclear power in
the country's total power production should increase to five
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities and colleges
have recently taken more measures to enhance students' confidence
in the country's future, the Education Ministry has said.
</P>
<P>
Most universities and colleges have offered Deng Xiaoping
Theory course to help students obtain correct understandings of
the country's reform and opening up process, ministry sources told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
A cadre of the Beijing University Committee of the Communist
Youth League said that the course is welcomed by many students
because "it explains what is socialism and how to build socialism".
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping Theory is a system that reflects the real
national situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many universities and colleges have held seminars on hot
subjects, such as Chinese economy and Sino-US
relations. Established economists, diplomats, journalists and even
senior government officials have been invited to give lectures.
</P>
<P>
"We are paying great attention to both Chinese and foreign
affairs, and most students like to read newspapers very much,"
said a student working for the Student Union of Beijing
University. "Now we are especially interested in President
Clinton's China tour," he said.
</P>
<P>
An Education Ministry official said that all Chinese
universities and colleges are making great efforts to improve
students' morale and develop campus culture.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, universities and colleges have launched campaigns
to spread the popularity of Beijing Opera. The move is expected to
enhance students' enthusiasm for traditional national culture.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that under the guidance of university
authorities, students' societies have become more popular.
</P>
<P>
The problem faced by many universities and colleges this year
is the pressure of unemployment. Officials said that they are
creating opportunities for students to find jobs, while persuading
them to give up out-moded job-seeking attitude.
</P>
<P>
Most universities and colleges have set up complete systems to
provide subsidies and loans for students whose families are
experiencing financial difficulties, Education Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Number Of Drug Addicts Down In Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of drug addicts in
China's Yunnan Province, which borders on the "Golden Triangle",
is down from 57,000 in 1990 to 40,000, which Jiang Pusheng, the
provincial public security department head, attributes to the
combined efforts of special drug teams, a drug publicity campaigns
rehabilitation centers, and halting the cultivation of opium
poppies in the Golden Triangle.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 147 special anti-drug teams, comprising
1,950 police officers and 2,000 other personnel. It spends some
150 million yuan annually on the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1997, the province dealt with 30,000 drug cases
and confiscated more than 25,000 kg of drugs. It has also spent
300 million yuan in recent years helping farmers in areas
bordering northern Myanmar to plant grain and cash crops to
replace opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
It has also had an anti-drug show, published anti-drug books,
and aired special TV programs. It has 85 compulsory rehabilitation
centers and 8 labor rehabilitation centers that attend to some
30,000 drug addicts annually.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming Rehabilitation Center, in a suburb of the
provincial capital, is the largest in eastern and southern
Asia. Zhang Yuzu, its head, says that it has developed a medicine
that helps addicts kick their habit, and now has a cure rate of 20
percent, which is higher than the world average.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Private Sector, Role Model for Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Building the private sector is the
right way to lead Uganda's economy out of chaos and it has proven
a role model for the rest of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said this when inaugurating
a 3.5-million-U.S.-Dollar Unilever Soap plant here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, Uganda, especially the National Resistance
Movement was the first to be convinced that the private sector is
more efficient ... we are pathfinders," Museveni said. "We are a
role model."
</P>
<P>
"The movement we have set in motion is growing in Africa. The
coming century will be Africa's century. This is because our
markets are still very underexploited," he added, quoted by a
press report.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the president cited the rapid rise of former
Soviet Union through liberalization of economy as an example that
should be followed by all other African countries.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, he said, Uganda has contributed a lot to the
intellectual liberation of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Unilever, a London-based multinational corporation, has a
global turnover of more than 51 billion U.S. Dollars. It
operates in 88 countries and sells its products in more than 150

NANJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A man who was in a coma for nearly
half a year and had been declared a hopeless case by doctors, has
regained consciousness in a hospital in the Chinese city of
Nanjing recently.
</P>
<P>
Forty-year-old Wang Chang had received a traumatic head injury

<HEADLINE> East China City Having Better Luck Dealing with Red Tide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A group has been set up in this
coastal city of east China's Fujian province to monitor the
appearance of the red tide.
</P>
<P>
The group consists of researchers from the Xiamen Environmental
Protection Bureau, the Xiamen environment monitoring center, and
an institute of the China National Oceanic Bureau, among others.
</P>
<P>
Water samples are taken three times a week near Baozhu
Island, the Dayu Sewage Treatment Plant, the beach at Xiamen
University, and Huli Mountain and results are reported to the
media in the hope that fishermen and aquatic farmers can respond
to warning signs.
</P>
<P>
The recent red tide disaster in Fujian and nearby Guangdong in
April gave the local people a bitter lesson. This "Ocean Cancer",
as local fishermen call it, caused by a sudden growth of
microscopic plankton because of weather changes, cuts off the
oxygen supply for shellfish.
</P>
<P>
The red tide can be caused by different types of algae. A small
amount of red tide made up of blue-green algae here last November
proved to be harmless.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen's coastal waters have diverse species of marine life,
all of which help the ecosystem work well, according to Dr. Zhen
Tianling, a member in the China Bureau of International Red Tide
Defense Work.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Former undisputed heavyweight
champion Riddick Bowe was indicted on Tuesday for allegedly
abducting his estranged wife and their five children.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, a U.S. District Court grand jury charged
him with interstate domestic violence. He faces up to 10 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Judy Bowe and the couple's five children were uninjured in the
alleged abduction on February 25, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Bowe ordered his wife and children into his car and began
driving toward his home. Bowe went some 200 miles before
stopping at a fast food restaurant, where Judy Bowe was able to
get to a telephone and call police.
</P>
<P>
Authorities decided they needed to conduct additional
interviews and consult state police as well as the FBI before
making a decision on whether to arrest Bowe.
</P>
<P>
Bowe retired in 1997, joined the Marine Corps Reserve late
that year to take three months basic training, but he dropped out
11 days later.
</P>
<P>
Bowe was unbeaten in 31 fights and at the top of his game when
he outpointed Evander Holyfield for the undispute heavyweight
championship on November 13, 1992. He lost the WBC title outside
the ring when he refused to fight Lennox Lewis of Britain.

<HEADLINE> Chinese "Anti-Fake-Goods Hero" Wins Another Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Wang Hai, who has become known as
the "anti-fake-goods hero" for his several-year crusade against
the sale of bogus goods, won another lawsuit recently.
</P>
<P>
But, this time he was not fighting shops that were involved in
selling counterfeit goods, but a company that used his name for an
advertisement that promoted its own products.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper in Chengdu, the capital of southwest China's
Sichuan Province, ran a series of ads in January that said, "Even
the 'Anti-Fake-Goods Hero' Wang Hai couldn't find any fault with
our products", so Wang sued the company, accusing it for having
used his name for commercial purposes without prior consent, and
for damaging his reputation as well.
</P>
<P>
In its final ruling, the Sichuan Provincial Higher Court
concluded that the ads did not hurt Wang's reputation but had
really infringed on his rights in using his name, and ordered the
company to pay 5,000 yuan (some 600 US dollars) in compensatory
damages.
</P>
<P>
This is reported to be one of the first instances in China of a
libel case related to the Advertising Law.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Reaches 35 Percent of the Year's Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's state budget balance of
payment recorded total gains in the first five months of this year
equal to 35.3 percent of the projected figure for the whole year,
said a report in the latest issue of the Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
State budget gains from foreign-invested companies fell by 3.6
percent during the first five months, while the government did
reap a 2.1 percent increase in tax payments from the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Profits from state-run enterprises met 33.6 percent of the
year's expectations. Profits from the foreign-invested sector were
equivalent to 33.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in tax payments of foreign-invested companies is
based primarily on the reduced price of crude oil, said economists
at the general department of statistics.
</P>
<P>
This means that cash obtained from oil and gas joint ventures
met only 81.1 percent of projected figures, despite an increase of
23.8 percent in crude oil exports.
</P>
<P>
The government gained an increase of some 9 percent in tax
payments from the non-state sector and a 0.8 percent increase from
import and export duties.

<HEADLINE> 2 Million People Live in Slums in Dhaka: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- At least two million people are
living in slums in Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka, national
news agency BSS reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka's population is nine million and it may shoot up to
nearly 20 million by the year 2020 due to the present trend of
urban population increase by 10 percent a year, a report of the
Habitat Council of Bangladesh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka's population in 1951 was only 3.36 million, in 1991 it
was seven million and in 1998 it stands at nine million. The
present rate of urban population increase is as high as five
percent in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Along with the increase of Dhaka's population, the number of
slum-dwellers would be around 10 million by the year 2020 in Dhaka
city alone, the report predicted.
</P>
<P>
Problems in the slums are already acute due to lack of minimum
facilities needed for livelihood, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has attached great importance to
reducing the number of city slum-dwellers by implementing several
projects with assistance from international bodies and agencies
including the United Nations Development Program and the Asian
Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> Croatia, Serb Republic Agree on Refugee Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Croatia and the Bosnian Serb
Republic reached an agreement Tuesday on a the return of refugees
which will be signed within one week.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was clinched Tuesday in talks between Bosnian
Serb Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and Croatian Prime Minister
Zlatko Matesa and Foreign Minister Mate Granic.
</P>
<P>
They focused their talks on the return of refugees, the
implementation of the Dayton peace accord and bilateral relations,
especially economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was based on "a man's right to choose where he
will live and be provided with conditions for a dignified living,"
Matesa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dodik said the Bosnian Serb Republic supported this approach
which allowed refugees to choose either to return or not.
</P>
<P>
"The Dayton agreement itself said that the rights to return,
compensation, or exchange of property are equal, and we want to
recognize the possibility that people choose one of these three
options," the Bosnian Serb prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that around 50,000 Croatian Serbs took refuge
in the Bosnian Serb entity during Croatia's military operation in
the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Official Croatian data say that more than 71,000 Croats were
expelled from the Serb Republic to Croatia at that time.
</P>
<P>
Next week the Croatian Embassy in Sarajevo will start holding
consular days in the Serb Republic's headquarters in Banja Luka,
where Croatian Serbs will be able to submit their requests for
return.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of heavy international pressure, Croatia recently
adopted a document enabling the unconditional return of Serb
refugees, despite fears that a mass Serb return might destabilize
the country.
</P>
<P>
Matesa told reporters he was very satisfied with his talks with
Dodik and hoped cooperation between Croatia and the Serb Republic
would develop in accordance with mutually acceptable principles.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also discussed issues on economic
cooperation, the establishment of all forms of transport and the
cleaning of the Sava River to make it fit for transport.
</P>
<P>
Croatia and the Bosnian Serb entity are in particular trying to
resume economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Dodik welcomed Croatia's recent revocation of visas for Bosnian
 citizens from the Serb Republic who have new Bosnia-Herzegovina
passports.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that Bosnian Serb citizens may enter and cross
Croatia without visas and also that the Serb Republic authorities
will guarantee the safety of Croatian citizens crossing its
territory," Dodik said.

<HEADLINE> Party Alliance Formed for Panama's President's Reelection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD) of Panama and three supporting political
parties signed a document here Tuesday to form an alliance of the
ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
The document, named "New Concept for Actions: 1999-2004," is
aimed at gaining reelection of President Perez Balladares, who is
general secretary of the PRD, in the May 1999 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The three other parties in the ruling alliance are the Unity
Party, the newly-formed National Liberal Party and the Democratic
Reforming Party.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will command a total of 400,000 party members, or
70 percent of the country's registered party members.
</P>
<P>
On May 18, the parliament amended the constitution to allow
immediate reelection of the president after his term expires and
decided that the amendment be voted on by a plebiscite on August
30.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the amendment, ruling and opposition parties
began heated campaigning over whether or not the amendment is
acceptable.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Plans Upgrade of 747 Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Boeing, the world's largest
civil airplane producer, has ruled out developing a new super
carrier in favour of upgrading the 747 jet.
</P>
<P>
The market for a new large aircraft was too small to justify
the cost of development, said Joe Ozimek, director of product
marking for the company.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the market demand for bigger planes was fewer than
500, while development costs would reach 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is now looking at design changes that would allow it to
build less-costly versions of the 747 with more seats and a longer
nonstop flying range.
</P>
<P>
The company has begun offering a stretched version to
airlines. One proposed model, the 747-400Y, would require inserts
to extend the wing length. It would have about 500 seats and fly
over 13,760 km. It is also planning an increased-gross-weight
747-400X that could fly about 14,080 km with 416 seats, according
to Ozimek.
</P>
<P>
But Europe's Airbus Company, which continues with plans for a
550- to 600-seat jetliner to compete with Boeing's 450-seat 747,
expects a market for more than 1,200, and puts development costs
at less than 10 billion dollars, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Other models of Boeing's commercial jets are also being eyed
for upgrades in the next century. Besides the next-generation of
737-600, -700, -800 and -900 now in its order book, Boeing is
looking at a convertible model that could be used to fly
passengers and, with seats removed, carry cargo. A combination
model that carries both passengers and cargo is also a
possibility.

<HEADLINE> Bean Output Increases with Imported Technique from US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The northernmost Heilongjiang
Province, China's leading bean producer, has succeeded in raising
the bean output by 20 percent thanks to advanced cultivation
methods imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed by a bean expert in the State of
Ohio, after the repeated experiments over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Agro-technicians in Heilongjiang further improved the imported
technique in compliance with specific local conditions and
introduced it to five counties on an experimental basis.
</P>
<P>
They adopt rational close planting of short-stock beans at
narrow intervals. And an increased amount of fertilizer and
herbicide were applied to guard against or control insect pests
and eliminate weeds.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the output of beans at the experimental plots is
20 percent higher than that in ordinary fields with the highest
output up 53 percent, said a local agro-technician.
</P>
<P>
To date, the method was spread to 69,000 hectares in 34
counties last year with per-hectare yield of 2572.5 kilograms,
14.4 percent more as compareed with conventional cultivating method.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Vietnam soared to its
highest rate of the year in May, triggering drastic price hikes on
food and other essential items, official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
The statistics revealed that inflation peaked in May at 8.8
percent, with food prices showing the sharpest rise at 18.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar rate against the Vietnamese dong in May was up
12.4 percent over its value in May, 1997, but decreased 0.1
percent over April's official rate.
</P>
<P>
The official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar stands at 12,985
Vietnamese dong.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists believed that the exchange rate of the
Vietnamese dong to the U.S. dollar is still overvalued on both
official and private markets.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Endeavors for Drug Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been doing its best to
eradicate narcotic drugs without losing momentum this year on the
basis of the achievements made in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of 1998, the Myanmar authorities
destroyed a dozen heroin refineries in Shan state following the
destruction of 33 in the state in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,600 kilograms of narcotics including more than 170 kg
heroin were also seized in the country by the enforcement agencies
with over 8,000 hectares of poppy plantations destroyed in the
same period, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the authorities confiscated a total of 15,146 kg of
narcotic drugs, including 1,401 kg heroin and 7,883 kg opium as
well as more than 5 million tablets of amphetamine stimulant,
taking action against 5,361 people in connection with 3,864
drug-related cases.
</P>
<P>
Following the surrender of former drug warlord Khun Sa and his
15,000-member Mong Tai Army in early 1996, Myanmar made another
achievement in 1997 for turning the Mongla region into an
opium-free zone under a six-year plan (1991-1997).
</P>
<P>
Similar efforts are being made to transform Kokang and Wa
regions into opium-free zones by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In its latest annual narcotic drugs destruction ceremony held
in the capital of Yangon in February, Myanmar set ablaze a total
of 5,759 kg seized drugs including 898 kg heroin and 4,587 kg
opium.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, Myanmar launched a three-month
nationwide campaign to collect baseline data on opium cultivation
and drug addicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent official report, more than 16,000
hectares of illicit poppy plantations in 17 townships of Shan
state were destroyed between November and January.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been cooperating not only with neighboring
countries but also those in the region in its drug control
efforts. The country has signed bilateral agreements on the move
with Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, the Philippines, Russia,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the United States and Japan have pledged grants
totaling 3.8 million U.S. dollars to help Myanmar eradicate poppy
cultivation in the border areas, implying that the U.S. has
resumed its aid to Myanmar in drug control.
</P>
<P>
A joint U.S.-Myanmar team also carried out a poppy yield survey
in the country's Shan state in February for the fourth time since
1993 under the two countries' anti-drug program.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also cooperating with the United Nations agencies in
drug eradication endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Three Myanmar-UNDCP projects of integrated rural development in
 eastern Shan state's Mongyang and Tachilek and Southern Wa
region's Wan Ho Tao were carried out since 1994 and successfully
completed in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The UNDCP is also reportedly planning to draft a global 10-year
 project for the elimination of poppy cultivation and development
of opium substitute undertakings involving Myanmar with an annual
allotment of 25 million U.S. dollars for the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has laid down two strategies of eradication of narcotic
 drugs -- designating drug eradication and prevention activities
as a national duty and gradual elimination of poppy cultivation by
promoting the standard of living of the national races.
</P>
<P>
A senior Myanmar drug control official said that Myanmar is
committed to doing its best for drug control, calling for
international participation in the country's drug eradication
endeavors.

<HEADLINE> Djukanovic's Coalition Wins Montenegro Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic's Coalition for Better Life won the parliamentary
elections this past weekend, unofficial results reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The media here said the results are unofficial because voting
has to be repeated for some 1,262 voters in two polling
stations. The official results are expected to be announced on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, according to votes already counted, Djukanovic's
coalition will receive 42 seats in the 78-seat parliament, and the
Socialist People's Party 29 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist People's Party was led by Djukanovic's main
rival, Momir Bulatovic, who is the former Montenegrin president
and now prime minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia consists of two republics, Montenegro and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Djukanovic issued a statement saying he hoped
Federal President Slobodan Milosevic would accept the results of
the election.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed the U.S.-backed Djukanovic's victory over
the pro-Belgrade Bulatovic will have a far-reaching influence upon
the political situation in both Montenegro and Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports Surge in First 5 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports during the
first five months of this year jumped 49 percent from the same
period last year to 2.79 million tons, a major English newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The value of rice exports rose by 103 percent in baht terms to
38.9 billion baht and 17 percent in dollar terms to 891 million
U.S. dollars compared with that of the same period in 1997, The
Nation said.
</P>
<P>
The exports in May alone amounted to 420,000 tons worth 5.5
billion baht (141 million dollars). Thailand exports an average of
500,000 tons of rice a month.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi as saying Tuesday that importers'
delayed shipments, in particular, to Indonesia and the
Philippines, lowered the growth of rice exports in May.
</P>
<P>
Although the demand for rice in the region has fallen, its
trading in the world market was still high, and is expected to
reach 22.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Many countries in the Middle East and Africa started to import
more rice. Japan also opened its domestic rice market under a
commitment to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was eyeing a 27.08 percent share of the total trade,
making it the world's largest rice exporter.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Tightens Security in Plantations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has tightened security
in the entire plantation sector following a predawn blast Monday
at Shanon Estate tea factory at Hatton in Central province.
</P>
<P>
A bomb which went off had been placed by two unidentified
youths causing damage to the shifting room of the factory, police
sources here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The entire area was cordoned off and searched by the police
later who asked estate workers to be more vigilant and help
safeguard estate property.
</P>
<P>
The sources said it was obvious that saboteurs wanted to
destabilize the country's main economy, the tea industry, and
cause havoc in the plantation sector.
</P>
<P>
Recently there have been as many as ten blasts of electricity
transformers and telecommunication facilities as well in different
parts of the country, indicating that the saboteurs wanted to
destabilize infrastructure too in the country.
</P>
<P>
As plastic devices had been used in the bombings, police
believe that this sabotage activity was attempted by the Tamil
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam who have been
engaged in a 15-year war against government troops for a separate
state.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Ready to Fight Akinwande </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield said he is
ready to fight Henry Akinwande in the WBA heavyweight boxing title
defense at New York's Madison Square Garden on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"People wonder if I can get up for this fight," Holyfield said
Tuesday at a press conference in New York. "They shouldn't. I'm up
for every fight."
</P>
<P>
Holyfield beat Michael Moorer last November to add the IBF
heavyweight title to the WBA crown he won from Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
Akinwande isn't considered by many to be a tough opponent to
Holyfield despite his imposing height and a 33-1-1 record ruined
only by a defeat to WBC champion Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
"They said the same thing about Holyfield before he fought
Tyson," Akinwande said at Tuesday's final pre-fight press
conference. "I've made a good living proving people wrong in this
sport."
</P>
<P>
Akinwande, by virture of his No. 1 ranking by the WBA, should
not be a hard nut for Holyfield to crack. But with Tyson still
sidelined and his camp unable to make a deal with Lewis for a
title unification, Akinwande is all he has to take.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield will earn some $10 million for the scheduled 12-round
fight. The purse will boost Holyfield's career earnings to some
$185 million.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield has to fight Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their
first fight.
</P>
<P>
Should Holyfield beat Akinwande, talks could begin again for a
Lewis fight that would probably take place sometime in the
spring.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Growth to Reach 4 Pct in 1999: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) growth could reach four percent next year if its
macroeconomic policies are fine-tuned and implemented with speed,
according to the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC)'s
annual report for 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
"If confidence returns and there is stability in the currency
markets, there are good prospects for Malaysia's recovery to gain
additional momentum in 1999," the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama reported Wednesday quoting the PECC's Pacific Economic
Outlook (PEO) released in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The PEO said the growth forecast assumed that macroeconomic
policies are fine-tuned to lessen the negative impact on business,
but the full impact of the devaluation of Malaysia's ringgit, the
wealth effect of the slump in the stock market, credit tightening,
and the fiscal austerity measures introduced last December have
not yet fully worked through the real side of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The PEO anticipated Malaysia's inflation to fall to five
percent and its current account deficit to reach 0.5 percent of
GDP by next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the PEO said, with currency markets still unsettled,
forecasting growth for 1998 and 1999 was problematic.
</P>
<P>
Taking all factors into account, growth is expected to slow to
about 2.0 percent in 1998 when inflation, as measured by the CPI
(consumer price index) would rise to about 7.5 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia's trade surplus is expected to increase and the
services deficit will decrease. The current account deficit in
1998 is anticipated to fall to about one percent of GDP compared
with 5.1 percent of GDP in 1997," the PEO said.
</P>
<P>
"The tight monetary policy stance and fiscal measures
introduced at the end of 1997 will dampen growth in 1998. Lending
to the broad property sector has been curtailed, and credit
growth will fall to 20 percent by the end of the first quarter of
1998, and to 15 percent by the end of 1998," the PEO projected.
</P>
<P>
The report said business closures and retrenchment of workers
would increase the unemployment rate to about five to six percent
from the 2.7 percent level in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, seriously affected by the regional financial crisis,
registered a decline of 1.8 percent in GDP growth in the first
quarter of 1998 as announced by Bank Negara (central bank) last
week.
</P>
<P>
However, the Malaysian government is still hopeful that the GDP
for the whole of 1998 will grow by 2 to 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Largest Exporter Aiming at High Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, China's
largest exporter, is making new efforts to achieve a 15 percent
growth in export this year.
</P>
<P>
The originally planned export increase was 10 percent, said
Liang Yaowen, deputy director of the provincial Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Commission. However, Guangdong has readjusted
the rate to 15 percent, encouraged by an average rise of 16.1
percent for the first four months.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the province began to restructure its foreign
trade sector, with greater efforts made to diversify export
markets and to develop ocean trade.
</P>
<P>
The efforts are paying off. During the first four months of the
year, exports to the United States rose by 36.3 percent, Japan,
by 58.9 percent, and European Union, by 22.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official also attributed the good performance to faster
rebates for export commodities, and this has greatly sped up
exporters' capital turnover.
</P>
<P>
The province is upgrading its labor-intensive exports mix, and
developing high value-added commodities in a bid to compete better
in the world trade market.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis is posing both challenges and
opportunities to the province's foreign trade sector. Relying on
light industrial and textile products for export, similar to
Southeast Asian countries, Guangdong is confronted with importers'
demand for price discounts or deferred payments, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's exports to Southeast Asian nations dropped by 24.6
percent during the first four months.
</P>
<P>
However, stable economic and political situation in China has
won over some European and American buyers, who had planned to
purchase goods from Southeast Asian countries. And Guangdong,
especially the Pearl River Delta area, is now receiving quite a
number of the returned orders.
</P>
<P>
The province provided more than 40 percent of the country's
total exports in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Launch First Home-made Satellite in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai people will be able to see in
the sky a "star" of their own as the first Thai-made
micro-satellite is ready for launch later this month.
</P>
<P>
Suchet Chandrarangsa, project manager, was quoted by
Wednesday's Bangkok Post as saying that the satellite was designed
and assembled by Thais, although the parts were imported.
</P>
<P>
The 50-kilogram satellite, called TMSAT, will be launched into
orbit 835 kilometers above earth from Baikanour Cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan on June 23, Suchet said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will serve as a communications and education tool
and supply environmental information on forest conditions, forest
fires, and water and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
TMSAT, worth more than 400 million baht (9.5 million U.S.
dollars), is the brainchild of University of Technology Mahanakhon
in collaboration with Thai Satellite Telecommunication and
Britain's University of Surrey.
</P>
<P>
Under the technology transfer scheme which started two years
ago, 11 university researchers and an engineer were taught how to
design and build a small satellite by Surrey University
scientists.
</P>
<P>
The success may enable Thailand to become the center of
small-scale satellite production in Asia, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite's orbiting course will be over the north-south
axes. It takes one and a half hours to complete an orbit. It will
pass Thailand three times a day for 30 minutes each time.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is expected to last 10 year, Suchet said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Mahanakhon University has an ambitious
plan to build a total of four satellites by 2000, which would make
an integrated telecommunications system.

SHANGHAI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The telecommunications industry in
this east China metropolis generated more than 4.6 billion yuan in
output value during the first quarter of this year, a 29 percent
rise over the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The industry saw a 41 percent rise in sales and a nearly 100
percent increase in pre-tax profits over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech industry turns out a large number of products,
including numerically program-controlled switchboards, optic-fiber
lines and cables, SDH transmission equipment, fax machines and
intelligent cards.
</P>
<P>
The output of numerically program-controlled switchboards in the
city during the first quarter of this year rose 37 percent over
the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-Bell Telephone Equipment Manufacturing Company, a
Sino-Belgian joint venture, invested nearly 400 million yuan in

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a center to develop telecom technology has been set
up in the city, at a cost of 18 million US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's inflation in
the first quarter of this year rose to 13 percent, said a report
of the Czech National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
While inflation increased, the average salary of workers
rose by only 10.9 percent compared with the same period last
year, a drop of 2.1 percent in real terms, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Rising inflation weakened purchasing power and retail sales
kept dropping in the first three months this year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the decrease in real income is the result
of a tighter economic policy adopted by the Czech government and
its failure to control inflation.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Prepared to Counter Yangtze Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's Hubei
Province is going all out to counter possible floods on China's
longest Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Located on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, Wuhan faces the
most serious challenge among China's large cities in countering
floods. The flood season generally runs from May through October.
</P>
<P>
Both the Yangtze and its major affluent Hanshui River run
through Wuhan. In normal years, the floodwater is often two meters
above the surrounding land. In 1954, when an exceptionally severe
flood hit Wuhan, the water level was six m above the land.
</P>
<P>
To counter possible floods this year, Wuhan has launched three
examinations of the embankments along the rivers since last
winter. So far this year, a total of 51 million yuan has been
invested to improve and reinforce the embankments.
</P>
<P>
Soil, stone and sand have been prepared, and radio and alarm
systems have been overhauled in anticipation of flooding,
according to a city official.
</P>
<P>
In addition, buildings totalling more than 7,480 sq m and other
obstacles have been removed to ensure smooth water flow in the
high-water season, he said, adding that flood-control teams are on
high alert.

<HEADLINE> 52 Tamil Rebels Killed in Fighting in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 52 Tamil rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were killed and over 200
injured during the course of a one-week fierce battle in the north
of Sri Lanka between the rebels and government forces.
</P>
<P>
The casualties among the government troops were 12 soldiers
dead and 25 others injured, security forces sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fierce fighting took place after the troops resumed their
advance last Wednesday to recapture the strategic Mankulam town on
its way to clear a 75-km supply route between the North and the
South launched in May last year.
</P>
<P>
While the troops were engaged in destroying rebel bunkers
northeast of Mankulam town, the rebels offered stiff resistance
firing mortars and artillery to stop the advancing troops, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Backed by air cover and using heavy artillery and mortars, the
troops were able to destroy six rebel bunkers and advance 1.5
kilometers towards the northeast of Mankulam town Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the rebel clandestine radio The Voice of the Tigers
announced they had lost 39 cadres with 150 more injured, the
security sources said that the troops would continue their advance
as they had been able to foil the stratagem adopted by the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Future Still Undecided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan, who is going to
play against the Utah Jazz in the first game of the NBA Finals on
Wednesday, said another championship or a loss won't be a
determining factor to his future.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the season, it's about evaluating where the
organization is and some of the decisions they have to think
through and base my decision on that," Jordan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For most of the season, Jordan has staked his future to the
return of coach Phil Jackson, who has declared he will quit the
position.
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen, one of the Bulls' leading scorer who will be a
free agent next year, has openly said he will make a leave after
this season.
</P>
<P>
Jackson has used a phrase of "Last Dance 98" to describe the
team's final season together.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said last month he would be
inclined to bring back all the team's major players should the
Bulls win their sixth championship and that he would give Jordan
ample time to make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
But Jordan insisted Tuesday that a win or a loss against the
Utah in the finals won't determine his future.
</P>
<P>
"I've lost at the end of the season before and continued to
play and won at the end of the season and continued to play,"
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
"If my hunger and my excitement for the game still continue and
I have the appetite for that at the end of the season, I will
continue to play," he added.

TIRANA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Albania may have to reconsider its
stand towards the Kosovo issue if the clashes there continue to
escalate, Prime Minister Fatos Nano said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since there is no indication that the Yugoslav government will
abandon its "violent means," Albania would reconsider its attitude
towards the parties involved in the clashes, said Nano at a

</P>
<P>
While still seeking a peaceful settlement, the Albanian
government feels that this policy should not stay rigid but hinge
on the situation and reality in Kosovo, Nano warned.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Nano also pointed out that ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo have taken up arms and got organized.
</P>

In the past few days, large-scale violence was going on in
Kosovo, during which dozens of people, including Serbian policemen

<HEADLINE> Austria Urges All-Out Effort to Tackle EU's Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- European Union states should give
top priority to reducing unemployment, especially among young
people, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the EU's high jobless rate as its "biggest mistake",
Klima told a meeting of international financial experts that there
was no "all-purpose key" to lowering unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Employment policies had to be coordinated on all levels --
within each state, Europe and the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit later this month will discuss employment plans of
member states, while the summit scheduled for the end of the year
is expected to comment and make amendments to the policies of EU
members.
</P>
<P>
Klima warned election results of some countries highlighted the
political need for better employment as jobless young people
without hope were more susceptible to extreme rightism.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of setting up a European social
model and called for the reestablishment of welfare states.
</P>
<P>
On the EU's enlargement, Klima said that Austria, with the
longest border line with eastern Europe, was especially concerned
about expansion.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the expansion should avoid the unprepared opening
of borders which would lead to panic.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank To Raise Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand is prepared to
raise short-term interest rates to support the baht, Bank Governor
Chatumongol Sonakul has announced.
</P>
<P>
The bank will increase interest rates through the bond
repurchase market to deter speculation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol made the announcement Tuesday following the
depreciation of the baht in the past few days, Bangkok Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The baht, which has ranged between 38 and 40 to the U.S. dollar
over the past few months, has fallen steadily in the past few days
amid increasing investor concern about the economic prospects for
the region.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trade Tuesday, the baht stood at 42.10/20 to
the U.S. dollar, against 41.85/95 one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said higher interest rates would theoretically help
spur demand for the baht as investors switched funds from foreign
exchange to enjoy higher margins in the repurchase market.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said higher interest rates were only a temporary
measure which would be eased once the baht stabilized.
</P>
<P>
He said regulators would intervene to ease volatility in
exchange rates, but would allow market forces to set rates and not
try to reverse trends.
</P>
<P>
A further depreciation of the baht would spur inflation and
worsen the debt burden of local corporations with foreign currency
exposure.
</P>
<P>
"The concern now is not that inflation will rise, but that the
recession will deepen. Even so, the central bank cannot lower
interest rates while foreign exchange rates remain a concern,"
Chatumongol said.

hospitals have stopped their operations after another 14,000

The Federation of Health Workers has called an indefinite

This indefinite strike has aggravated the crisis of the health

<HEADLINE> U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery Launched Into Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle Discovery was
sent into space Tuesday evening from Kennedy Space Center, Cape
Canaveral,Flo., carrying with it six crew members and the Alpha
Magnetic Spectrometer designed and made by scientists from China,
the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
During its 10-day space trip, the space shuttle will for the
first time place the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a 3.5 ton
particle detector, into space and carry out high energy physics
experiments.
</P>
<P>
The particle detector consists of five major elements: a
permanent magnet, the critical part of the detector made by the
Chinese Science Academy; time-of-flight scintillators; a silicon
microstrip tracker; anti-coincidence counters also made by Chinese
scientists; and the aerogel threshold Cerenkov counter.
</P>
<P>
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiments aim to answer two
questions in high energy physicis: first, if equal amounts of
matter and antimatter were produced at the beginning of the
universe as described by the Big Bang scenario, and the galaxies
we now see are made only of matter, where has the antimatter gone?
second, since the mass of a galaxy seems to be greater than the
visible mass of all its stars, gas and dust, is there dark matter
of a new kind that has eluded discovery?
</P>
<P>
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiments are an
international cooperation led by American-Chinese scientist and
1976 Nobel Prize winner Dr. Ding, and participated by scientists
from 37 research institutions in China, the United States, Russia,
France, Italy and others.
</P>
<P>
Discovery will dock with the Russian "Mir" space station and
take back the U.S. astronaut Andrew Thomas who has worked almost
six months on the Mir station. This is the ninth and the last
docking for U.S. space shuttle with the Russian Mir station.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. space shuttle will return to the ground on June 12.

<HEADLINE> Britain Takes Measures to Punish World Cup Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) - Britain has reached an agreement with
France which forbids British soccer fans who cause trouble at this
year's World Cup to return to France for the rest of the
tournament, Home Secretary Jack Straw announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Straw told a news conference that under the deal with France,
any British hooligan convicted of a soccer related offence at the
World Cup could face court action at home on their return in
addition to any punishment handed down by the French judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He said that English and Welsh courts could impose restriction
orders on top of punishment imposed in France.
</P>
<P>
"I have sought to ensure that we do everything we can help to
ensure that those who are decent and law-abiding are able to watch
football in safety and comfort," Straw said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that last year, Straw had encouraged judges to
use restriction orders when convicting anyone of a soccer-related
crime as one of the measures to prevent UK fans from causing
trouble.
</P>
<P>
At present 65 British soccer troublemakers have been imposed
restriction orders to prevent them from attending the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Straw said that he expected the number of orders to increase
before the World Cup begins on June 10 in France as many cases of
soccer violence are still underway in courts and some other
troublemakers may be arrested at other matches before then.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Australian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Public support for a goods and services tax has dropping
markedly in Australia but Prime Minister John Howard Tuesday urged
government backbenchers to hold their nerve in the face of a scare
campaign launched by the Labor party, the main opposition party in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia slid a further 1.2 billion U.S. dollars into debt
with the world, owing a record amount of 139 billion U.S. dollars
in foreign debt, as the Asian economic crisis crippled exporters'
ability to trade the country out of debt.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's One Nation party leader Pauline Hanson, who is
notorious for her anti-Asian immigration stance, launched a new
attack on Australia's aborigines in the federal parliament
Tuesday, reigniting the race issue in the lead-up to both the
Queensland state and federal election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian dollar plummeted to 12-year lows and the
sharemarket tumbled Tuesday, driven down by sliding gold and base
metal prices and concerns over the deepening economic crisis in
Asia.

<HEADLINE> Technology Shares Rebound in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks on Wall Street
rose sharply Tuesday, but the broad market again made little
progress.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average kept a marginal gain with
about an hour left to the session, but finished 31.13 lower at
8,891.24.
</P>
<P>
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index wiped out nearly
half of Monday's 32-point plunge, rising 14.97 to 1,761.79.
</P>
<P>
Even with Tuesday's gains, the Nasdaq composite sits about 150
points, or 8 percent, below April 22's closing record of 1,917.61.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.05 to 1,093.03, and the NYSE
composite index rose 0.21 to 565.35.
</P>
<P>
But the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.47 to
449.70, and the smaller-company dominated American Stock Exchange
composite index fell 1.21 to 706.30.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan May Develop Nuclear Warheads Soon: U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
that India and Pakistan could develop nuclear warheads for
medium-range missiles within one or two years.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon, in response to questions about
missiles being developed by India and Pakistan to carry nuclear
warheads, said, "Our best guess is that it would probably take
them a year or two to weaponize... by putting them onto warheads."
</P>
<P>
"Of course, that can depend a lot on how much they decide to
test, what the state of their current program is now, how much
security they want about whether it works," he added. "So there
are many, many variables."
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the United States was urging the two countries not
to "miniaturize" nuclear devices recently tested by India and
Pakistan so that they could be mounted on missiles to threaten
each other.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we're appealing to both countries to do is
not to weaponize their nuclear warheads," he told reporters. "We
would like them to stop testing. We would like them to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We would like them to sign the
fissile materials agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bacon described the situation in South Asia as "extremely
dangerous and volatile" because of the face-off between two
antagonists. "We are very, very concerned about the possibility of
miscalculation."
</P>
<P>
But Bacon would not call the situation "a hair-trigger stance."
He said the steps taken by India and Pakistan in the wake of their
tests had been mostly defensive in nature and skirmishing around
disputed Kashmir "is pretty much a fact of life."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Health Modernization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday approved
an interest-free credit equivalent to 24 million U.S. dollars for
an adaptable program loan to help finance the health sector
modernization program of the Nicaraguan government.
</P>
<P>
The health sector management program, of which this project is
the first phase, will improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and
equity of the Nicaraguan health system.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to implement sector reforms and targeted
investments over a period of nine years from 1998 to 2007 through
a phased approach, gradually and geographically expanding some
program activities to the whole country while deepening and
consolidating others.
</P>
<P>
The first phase from 1998-2002 will focus on developing pilot
sector reforms and priority programs and on building the
experience, knowledge, and capacity to expand them during the
second phase. The second phase will cover the period 2002-2007 and
will support full implementation and consolidation of the program.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the first phase is estimated at 32 million
dollars. The World Bank's credit, which will finance 75 percent of
the total cost, will come from the International Development
Association, the Bank's concessional lending wing for developing
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chrysler Corp., the third largest
automaker in the U.S., reported the best domestic sales month in
its 73-year history in May.
</P>
<P>
The company sold more than 250,000 vehicles in May in the

The American automaker reported Tuesday that the number of
vehicles it sold last month rose 27 percent from the year before.
Vans, pickups and sport utility vehicles surged 39 percent; cars
rose 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to the strong economy and the boom
on Wall Street, as well as price deduction and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are also expected to
report strong May sales Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among other automakers, Honda Motor Co. also set a May record

economic opportunities and raise rural incomes, strengthen
kecamatan (subdistrict) and village government and community
institutions, and build public infrastructure through labor
intensive methods.
</P>
<P>
The project's decentralized and community-based design limits
the need for direct government intervention. Technical assistance
for engineering and community facilitation is provided by private
sector companies and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 273 million
dollars. Apart from the World Bank loan, the Indonesian government
