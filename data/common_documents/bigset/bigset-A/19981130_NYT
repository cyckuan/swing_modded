MAMIIT STAYS HOT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Whn Steve Starleaf came up with the idea of
building the Burbank Tennis Center about a decade ago, he
envisioned a venue to showcase local players.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the final day of the second Challenger Series event
there, the center's director and others in the tennis community
found gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Mamiit, a product of Eagle Rock and USC, beat No. 9-seeded
David Nainkin of South Africa 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 to win the singles
title while the Bryan twins of Camarillo, Bob and Mike, defeated
the Nos. 1- and 2-seeded teams to win the doubles championship
before a crowd of 300 that amounted to a hometown advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit is the hottest player on the Challenger circuit.
</P>
<P>
   He has made three consecutive finals, winning two. He won on
Sunday even though he had to work overtime: He beat Ville Liukko in
a tough, two-hour semifinal match 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 two hours before
his finals match because rain washed out play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It had little effect against Nainkin, a six-year tour veteran
who played at UCLA for parts of two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit, who is generously listed at 5-foot-8, stuck to his
baseline game. He simply traded deep shots, waited for Nainkin to
make mistakes and chased down many of his opponent's best shots, a
style akin to Michael Chang's.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, although he seemed to be in trouble midway through
the first set and late in the second.
</P>
<P>
   He was leading 4-1 when he lost 17 of 22 points as Nainkin took
a 5-4 lead. He looked tired. However, Mamiit, who relies heavily on
his grit, seemed to steal the momentum on sheer determination to
pull out the set.
</P>
<P>
   Then, down 5-4 in the second set and Nainkin serving, he won 12
of the final 13 points _ including two aces _ to win his third
Challenger tournament before dozens of boisterous friends and
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Nainkin attributed the loss in good part to Mamiit's ballooning
confidence and lack of mistakes. And the fans didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd gave me so much energy,'' Mamitt said. ``I don't
usually get that on the tour in all these different places. It felt
so warm, like a college match. It made me so relaxed, so cool and
calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that Mamiit wondered whether he did the right
thing turning pro after winning the NCAA singles in title in 1996.
Now, none of the doubts linger.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the tournament at No. 151 in the world. After Sunday,
he expects to jump about 20 places _ to his highest position _ with
one more tournament to go, in Guadalajara, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Next year? He has dreams of cracking the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, my short-term goal is top 80. But I'm loose, I'm
confident, I have such a good feel for the game right now. We'll
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bryans, who also had a large number of supporters here, did
most of their work in the early match: They also played their
semifinal earlier in the day, beating No. 1 Brandon Coupe and Jared
Palmer 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 7-6 (10-8).
</P>
<P>
   In the final, No. 2 David DiLucia and Michael Sell, veterans who
have played together often, apparently were caught cold in the
dipping temperatures around 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   They warmed up in the second set but couldn't overcome the
rapidly rising 20-year-old rookies, losing 6-0, 7-6 (7-5). It was
the Bryans' second title in five Challenger tournaments as a
doubles team.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a splendid day for local tennis. The Bryans had the
only complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bob Bryan, with a smile: ``I think Cecil had more fans.''

BELANGER BRUINS' HARDEST SHOOTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Everyone knew he could fight. Everyone knew he could
hit. But who knew that forward Ken Belanger could fire a slap shot
more than 100 miles per hour? No one, including Belanger.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' big left wing unseated defenseman Hal Gill during
the annual Skills Competition at the FleetCenter Sunday, blasting
the puck 100.4 m.p.h. Gill won the event last year with 95.4 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the turning point,'' joked Belanger, who was
competing in his first such event. ``I scored on the breakaway
(relay) and won the hardest shot. I was curious what it was. I
never really had it clocked before.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few minutes, it didn't appear as if anyone would know just
how hard he could shoot the puck. His first two shots didn't
register on the radar gun. The first one that did was clocked at
95.4 m.p.h., which bested Joe Thornton's 94.5. Belanger's next one
proved to be the winner. Belanger believes he can do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can get a little higher with a few more shots,'' he
said. ``It's all about practice. It's like the longest drive in
golf. You have to keep it low and at the middle of the net so the
radar can read it directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger has been with the Bruins since Nov. 7, when he was
acquired from the Islanders for Ted Donato. He then missed two
games as a result of being struck in the face by a puck at
practice. He has played in the last five games and said he feels a
part of things now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a young group of guys, so everyone blends in well,'' he
said. ``Three weeks ago I didn't know anybody, but now I get along
with everybody here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first walk in, you get a little bit of an
uncomfortable feeling but it's such a good group of guys and they
make you feel really welcome. It hasn't been a big adjustment. It
was a big move, but they made it really comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Another first-time participant in the competition was forward
Shawn Bates, who has been a healthy scratch the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Bates edged Sergei Samsonov, last year's winner, for the title
of fastest skater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to be out there in front of the home crowd,'' said
Bates, who played at Boston University. ``I was pretty happy with
it. My biggest strength is my skating. I have to give credit to
(conditioning coach) Mike Boyle, who helped me during my college
career and since I've been with the Bruins. You just have to go out
there and give it all you have. I only beat (Samsonov) by two-10ths
of a second.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that with injured forward Peter Ferraro out of the
lineup, Bates could get the nod for Tuesday's game against the
Vancouver Canucks at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been practicing with the team for a couple of weeks now
and I'm learning a lot,'' he said. ``Obviously I'd like to play,
but I like where I am right now and all I can do is work hard every
day and maybe I can get another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Taylor won for the most accurate shooting and Rob Tallas won
the goaltending competition.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro attended the event but his left arm was in a sling to
immobilize the injured muscles in his chest. Ferraro said he
expects to be sidelined for at least a week as a result of a
crushing hit from Montreal defenseman Vladimir Malakhov in the
first period of Friday's matinee against the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like I'm going to be out at least a week or two,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I popped my chest out of place and then it popped back
into place, which is good. I knew he was coming really hard and
fast. It was a situation where I got the puck at my blue line, I
saw him coming out of the corner of my eye. I had to get to the red
line in order to dump the puck in. He's a big guy so I knew I was
going to take a pretty good hit, which I did. I just hoped it would
be a better outcome. Unfortunately, it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was happy the Bruins won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out about it at the hospital, which made it easier to
deal with at the time,'' he said. ``It was a clean hit and it's
just part of the game. It's very disappointing. I'm just going to
try to get back as quick as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Left wing P.J. Axelsson was the only other Bruin who didn't
participate. He is suffering from the flu.

DEFENSE POINTED WAY FOR UMASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE CHARLES, La. _ All season long, the offense has been the
focal point. Quarterback Todd Bankhead, wide receiver Jimmy Moore,
and running back Marcel Shipp have helped rewrite the University of
Massachusetts record book this season in leading the 9-3 Minutemen
to one of the nation's best turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   They're members of the unit that finished the season ranked
third in the nation in total offense. So impressive were the
efforts of the offense that the defense went virtually unheralded;
even when it shined and the offense struggled, people focused on
the latter unit's woes.
</P>
<P>
   But that may have changed following the Minutemen's 21-19
victory over McNeese State Saturday in the first round of the
Division 1-AA playoffs. When the offense stalled in the second half
after creating a 21-3 halftime lead, the defense withstood several
McNeese State rallies, limiting the Cowboys to one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   All other times, McNeese State either gave up the ball, lost it
on a turnover, or settled for a field goal attempt. It converted on
four, but missed a 52-yard try with 1:42 left, securing the first
postseason victory for the Minutemen in 10 years. Saturday UMass
hosts unbeaten Lehigh, a 24-23 winner over Richmond, in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   The other local team in the playoffs, UConn, showed off its
offense Saturday, as senior quarterback Shane Stafford scorched
Hampton's secondary for 294 yards and four touchdowns in a 42-34
victory at Storrs, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Next for the Huskies (10-2) is a trip to Statesboro, Ga., to
face No. 1 seed Georgia Southern (12-0), which defeated Colgate,
49-28.
</P>
<P>
   If UMass wins Saturday, it faces the Appalachian
State-Northwestern State winner; if UConn prevails, it faces the
Florida A&AMP;M-Western Illinois winner. UMass and UConn would not meet
until the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the McNeese State defense that entered the game against
UMass with impressive credentials. The Cowboys unit was third in
Division 1-AA, yielding only 83 yards rushing a game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was upstaged by a UMass unit that held its opposition to
one touchdown for the second consecutive week. The defense's effort
was so exceptional that by the fourth quarter it was evident the
Minutemen had not missed Shipp, who sat out the game with a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to the defense before the game and we told them they
were going to have to step it up because Marcel wasn't able to
play,'' said UMass coach Mark Whipple.
</P>
<P>
   All season, several players have excelled for the defense,
particularly linebacker Khari Samuel, who led the Minutemen
Saturday with 11 tackles (10 unassisted) and one pass breakup.
Linebacker Kole Ayi had seven tackles, a fumble recovery, and three
pass breakups. Strong safety Brian Smith had 10 tackles and two
pass breakups.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last couple of weeks we've been preaching to each other
to just step it up, and every time we go out on the field play the
best game we can,'' said Samuel. ``When each player sits down and
says he's going to play their best game, or at least try to, we
have good results.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a unit, their efforts have gone unnoticed because UMass
games this season have been point-pouring affairs, with the
Minutemen usually outgunning the opposition for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the unit began raising eyebrows Nov. 7 against Rhode Island.
The defense held off the scrappy Rams as the offense struggled,
then secured the victory when Samuel returned an interception for a
touchdown late.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's effort in the regular-season finale against UConn
was arguably its best to that point. It held one of the most potent
Division 1-AA offenses scoreless until the fourth quarter. But the
offense's seven turnovers and the special team's blunders made it a
mere afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. McNeese State, which returned most of its players
from last year's Division 1-AA runner-up, drove within the UMass 35
four of the five times it had possession in the fourth quarter.
Trailing by 15 points entering the quarter, McNeese State came up
with 13 (two field goals and a touchdown), but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   When UMass hosts Lehigh, it will mark the second time the teams
have met in postseason; Lehigh beat UMass, 30-23, in Amherst in the
1977 Division 2 playoffs. Tickets for the game go on sale this
morning at 8:30 at the UMass Athletic Ticket Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense has gained a lot of confidence over the last half
of the season,'' said Whipple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just came up big. We tried to stay under control and let
our defense win the game, and they were the ones who came up big in
the second half. They played super in our red zone defense.''

ORANGE PERFORM WITH SQUEEZE ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Give credit to Syracuse. With everything at stake _
primarily a $12 million Bowl Championship Series spot _ the
Orangemen played the way their fans hoped they would all season by
blowing away a good Miami team, 66-13, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The enigma of Syracuse is that it was good enough to come within
one play of beating Tennessee, but bad enough to lose to North
Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   That inconsistency is why the Orangemen are 8-3 and heading for
a slot in the Orange or Sugar bowls (most likely the Orange against
Florida State or Ohio State) instead of 11-0 or 10-1 and contending
for a national championship slot in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In this season, in which no superteam exists, the Orangemen have
proven they are as good as anyone on any given week. And they have
become the power in the Big East, winning or sharing the conference
title the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Donovan McNabb is arguably the best player in the
country and should have been a real Heisman Trophy contender _
maybe he still is, but it's probably too late _ but he picked a
nationally televised Thursday night game against North Carolina
State to have his worst game, and the voters and media turned him
off.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's effort ``was one of those games we hit on all eight
cylinders,'' said Orangemen coach Paul Pasqualoni, who has turned
even grayer when his team has squandered opportunities as it has
the past three years. ``You can never go into a game like this and
imagine it would turn out this way.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the perplexing part. With Syracuse you can't. When
the Orangemen are good, they are very good. When they are bad ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Notre Dame's 10-0 loss to Southern California Saturday,
pencil the Irish into the Gator Bowl against Georgia Tech. The
Irish obviously missed quarterback  &UR; Jarious Jackson &LR; . Freshman
 &UR; Arnaz Battle &LR; , &UR;  &LR; thrown into the lurch after Jackson suffered a
knee injury on the final play of last week's win over LSU while
taking a safety, did not complete a pass until the third quarter.
The Irish had almost as many turnovers (5) as completions (7) ...
Tennessee's 11-0 record is the best regular-season mark in school
history and its first perfect regular season since 1956. Throw out
some of those losses to Florida the past few years and the Vols
have been pretty much invincible, posting a 48-5 mark in their last
53 games ... Vanderbilt may have finished with a dismal 2-9 record,
but the Commodores can point to their grades. Thirty-seven players
on the roster had a 3.0 average or better during the spring
semester ... There still might be some doubt about who deserves the
Heisman. You can argue that players like Tulane's  &UR; Shawn
King &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Kansas State's  &UR; Michael Bishop &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and McNabb are more
valuable to their teams, and that someone like Kentucky's  &UR; Tim
Couch  &LR; had overwhelming numbers, but so did Texas running back
 &UR; Ricky Williams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who will win the award in New York in two weeks.
He also is the all-time NCAA collegiate rushing leader, breaking
 &UR; Tony Dorsett's  &LR; record with an eye-popping 259 yards in the
Longhorns' win over Texas A&AMP;M Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M can make the BCS muddle clearer if it upsets Kansas
State in the Big 12 championship game in St. Louis Saturday.
Neither Tennessee, which faces Mississippi State in the
Southeastern Conference title game in Atlanta Saturday, nor UCLA,
which plays at Miami Saturday in a makeup game, figures to have as
tough a time as Kansas State ... Poor Arizona. The Wildcats ended a
remarkable 10-1 season (losing only to UCLA) with a 50-42 win over
Arizona State Friday night and the Wildcats still have to wait
until after the UCLA-Miami game to find out if they are going to
the Rose Bowl for the first time. A UCLA loss or a shift in the BCS
standings likely will put the Bruins in the Rose against Wisconsin
and send Arizona to the Holiday Bowl against Nebraska ... Speaking
of remarkable seasons, how about Tulane's? The Green Wave are 11-0
after beating up Louisiana Tech and are going to the Liberty Bowl
to face BYU in what could be one of the most entertaining bowl
games. It could also be coach  &UR; Tommy Bowden's  &LR; last game before
taking a more high-profile job at somewhere like Mississippi,
Oklahoma, or Clemson ... If Boston College can be proud of anything
this season, it is its opening-game win over Georgia Tech. The
Yellow Jackets turned out to be one of the best teams in the
country, as their victory over Georgia Saturday proved. It was
Tech's first win over Georgia since 1990, including losses the last
three years by a combined 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cotton Bowl people must be doing handstands. They are going
to get an Arkansas-Texas rematch of the old Southwest Conference
days, with both teams coming off impressive wins in their last
games, and they'll have the Heisman winner as well ... LSU, the
preseason pick to finish first in the SEC West, finished 4-7, the
first losing season for coach  &UR; Gerry DiNardo  &LR; in four years ... How
important was Nebraska's 16-14 win over Colorado Friday? Oh, it
just prevented the Huskers from having their first four-loss season
since 1968, and marked the 30th consecutive year they have won at
least nine games in a season ... Hawaii made history Saturday
night. The Rainbows' 48-17 loss to Michigan gave them an 0-12 mark,
matching Colorado State in 1981 as the worst record for a season in
college football history ... The UMass and UConn victories in the
Division 1-AA playoffs mean the Minutemen's  &UR; Mark Whipple  &LR; and the
Huskies'  &UR; Skip Holtz  &LR; will move to the forefront of the young
coaches who will be called upon by Division 1-A teams in search of
a makeover. Hello Oklahoma, Iowa, South Carolina, and Clemson, are
you listening?

STEELE SHINES IN BC VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston College senior center Whitney Steele suffered
through a scoreless first half that included a seat on the bench
when she picked up her third foul against St. Joseph's Sunday at
Conte Forum.
</P>
<P>
   But when the game was on the line, Steele, with a big assist
from freshman guard Nicole Conway, made sure the Eagles' winning
streak remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   The pair combined for 11 points, 6 by Conway, during a 14-8 run
in the final six minutes that broke a 56-all tie and keyed a 72-68
victory that improved the Eagles record to 6-0, the best start in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating to be on the bench in foul trouble,''
said Steele, who entered the game as her team's leading scorer
(18.2) and rebounder (8.4). ``Especially since two of the calls
were offensive fouls, because I was just trying to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's (1-3) gave BC all it could handle, hitting on 9 of
22 3-pointers, including three by center Jana Lichnerova (19
points) and four by guard Melissa Coursey (12 points). Freshman
forward Susan Moran also gave the Eagles fits with her penetration,
which resulted in 15 trips to the free throw line, where she
converted a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Moran made six consecutive freebies during an 8-0 run that gave
the visitors a 56-55 lead with 7:45 to play. A Cal Bouchard free
throw tied it, and Steele finally broke the ice with a banker that
put her team ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   That hoop was followed by an Alissa Murphy (16 points) free
throw, two foul shots by Conway after an offensive rebound, another
free throw by Steele, and a Conway layup for a 64-56 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Moran (18 points) on the bench after fouling out,
St. Joe's made one last rush. An Angela Zampella 3-pointer closed
it to 64-61, then a Zampella steal and drive to the basket had the
crowd of 458 holding its collective breath. But the Hawks forward
was called for charging into defender Paula Bacso and Steele
followed with a driving layup for a 68-64 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Two St. Joe's turnovers later, a pair of Murphy free throws iced
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to be patient,'' said Steele, who reentered the
game with 12:23 to play and still wound up with as many rebounds
(five) as Lichnerova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think about a win until we had a 4-point lead
with a second to play,'' said Conway. ``In a close game like this,
I just tried to keep my composure.''
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Cathy Inglese said the loss of Steele was softened by a
balanced offense and hard work under the boards. Cocaptain Bouchard
and freshman backcourt mate Brianne Stepherson chipped in with 13
points each, Bacso had 10, while freshman Becky Gottstein had 7
points and a game-best 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first team that we've played in a long time that
looked more to slow it down and play a quarter-court game,'' said
Inglese, whose team never trailed or led by more than 8 points.
``We talked about that and about hitting the boards and we
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   BC, which outrebounded the Hawks, 41-30, thus ended a
four-games-in-eight-days stretch. The Eagles open their Big East
schedule Saturday at Miami, the first of four road games.

CRIMSON FALL SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Mississippi State women's basketball team proved
quicker than Harvard in Sunday's Harvard Invitational final, but
the Crimson went to a 2-3 matchup zone to try to counter that.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem _ not enough of Harvard's shots went
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought we would play this well,'' said Harvard coach
Kathy Delaney-Smith. ``Everybody I talked to was sort of laughing
at the matchup. I'm very proud, we could have won this game, but
our shots didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson connected on just 35 percent of their field goals
(19 of 54), while the Lady Bulldogs (4-0) made 44 percent of their
shots (12 of 27) in the second half on their way to a 64-51 win at
Lavietes Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in its 14th Harvard Invitational final in the 18 seasons
the event has been held, Harvard (2-3) couldn't get closer than 7,
that 46-39 margin coming with four minutes remaining on a Sarah
Russell putback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was close enough for me,'' said Mississippi State coach
Sharon Fanning. ``Winning this tournament was huge for us, the two
days in a row, the travel, it all takes a lot of focus. Plus, we're
a young team, with just one senior and three new starters.
Hopefully, our confidence is coming on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State promptly pushed its lead back to double
figures when guard Meadow Overstreet flipped in a 3-pointer from
the top of the key, making it 49-39 with 3:35 left.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Nitra Perry had 17 points for Mississippi State while
Overstreet, a sophomore, tossed in 16. Harvard had 13 points from
senior cocaptain Suzie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're 100 times more athletic,'' said Delaney-Smith. ``I'm
proud of our rebounding effort (Mississippi State had 44 to
Harvard's 34). Player for player, and quickness and jumping
ability, they probably had the edge, but I don't think they
dominated the game with their athletic ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The zone defense served Harvard well. ``It took their inside
game away and their rebounding in the first half, and in the second
half their shots were short, but the rebounds came out high and
they came up with the ball,'' said Delaney-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State grabbed its first lead on a Perry 12- footer
with 7:10 before the intermission, and held an 8-point lead at
halftime, 25-17, on an Overstreet 3-point jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, which had 15 turnovers at halftime but only three more
the second half, didn't get the ball inside to its frontcourt as
much as it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job of running down the clock,'' Delaney-Smith
said. ``This was a hard matchup, but I saw some signs that a month
from now we're going to be a strong team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wofford (1-3) won the consolation game, 70-69, in overtime, over
Ball State (2-3) when Meredith Denton made both ends of a
one-and-one with 25 seconds left.

KITNA SHINES IN BLEAK WEEK FOR SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He was addressing the events of Sunday afternoon at
the Kingdome when Jon Kitna unintentionally captured the region's
holiday week from hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things,'' he said, ``seemed real bleak out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the fact that the Seahawks apparently had
blown yet another game after the Tennessee Oilers went ahead 18-17
with 33 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Anacortes oil refinery explosion, the Aurora
Bridge bus tragedy and the death in his prime of a cherished civic
leader, John Stanford, bleakness was indeed out there, in
exponential numbers. Throw in the wettest November in local weather
history, and Thanksgiving sighs don't get much heavier here.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, what the Seahawks did or did not do Sunday was
utterly irrelevant. By the same token, emotional sunshine would be
taken, in any amount from any source, by a community unaccountably
battered.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna provided.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the quarterback, of course. The Seahawks' 20-18
victory was one of the broadest multiple-hero games in some time.
But Kitna's improbable story and even more improbable legerdemain
Sunday, replete with an Elway-like comeback for the game-winner,
are so wonderfully corny and warm that they take the dampness right
out of a soul.
</P>
<P>
   From reckless punk to Christian, from Central Washington to the
NFL, from Tacoma to Seattle by way of the World (League), from
third-string to first-string in one week, from the Seahawk 29 to
the Oiler 30 in 27 heart-jolting seconds ...
</P>
<P>
   If it were a script, Hollywood would reject it. Too
unbelievable. Besides, ``The Waterboy'' has been done.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna is such a great kid, and his story so cockamamy, that it
is hard to imagine the saga unfolding in the midst of the Seahawks,
who have been the NFL's dump site of the '90s for toxic stories.
</P>
<P>
   But he is here, coach Dennis Erickson's lone flower in the slag
heap. Even the vanquished opponent had to admit admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give Jon Kitna credit for finding a way to win this
ballgame,'' said Oilers coach Jeff Fisher. ``He was obviously the
difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That ordinary sounding observation is nevertheless a stunner. In
a week in which Erickson risked internal problems by benching the
venerable, popular Warren Moon, Kitna came out not as the weak link
in an already crippled offense, but as the guy to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that Moon, placed into Kitna's identical field
circumstances, wouldn't have done as well. But he has been in
similar situations this season, and he hasn't often delivered.
</P>
<P>
   It might be as simple as what Erickson said: ``Maybe Jon just
doesn't know enough to be rattled.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a little more complex, like the Seahawks emphasizing
pass plays for Kitna to the running back and tight end that are
lower risk and more easily blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe there's something bigger at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an aura about him in the huddle,'' said wide receiver
Mike Pritchard.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's cosmic or strategic or psychic, Kitna outdid a
superlative pair of Oilers, superstars-in-waiting Steve McNair and
Eddie George, and overcame the Seahawk offense's propensity for
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In his second career start. After 10 of the season's 11 weeks on
the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   That just doesn't happen in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But it did.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say if it will continue. He threw a bad pass to the goal
line that was intercepted, fumbled a snap, and nearly blew the game
when in the final drive he failed to get off a play in time,
costing a critical five yards on a delay penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But each time, he ignored his inexperience as well as the Oiler
defense, to find an answer. The last recovery was the most vital
and impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a third-and-five at the Tennessee 33-yard line with 12
seconds left, Kitna's delay penalty was followed by a false start
on guard Pete Kendall, preposterously hurling the Seahawks out of
field-goal range.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if a season of foolish errors was spasming into a
single perfect moment of imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna then turned his back on the gloomy expectations of a
two-thirds-filled Kingdome. He delivered, taking a shotgun snap and
finding Pritchard alone up the right side for the yardage necessary
to give kicker Todd Peterson a 48-yard field goal to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying that he reminds me of a young Brett Favre,''
said Pritchard, a teammate of the Packer great when both were in
Atlanta. ``His demeanor is the same. The confidence he has in
himself is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   A Favre successor, in Seattle? The elephant's graveyard of
quarterbacks? Given the club history at the position, and the
disappointment of this season, Kitna's remarkable 298-yard passing
day makes it easy to get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   He's not Brett Favre. But he is a wonderful story in a place
desperately short of them.

KITNA RESCUES SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seahawks did more than win a game that appeared
lost Sunday. They also rediscovered their offense.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the right arm of Jon Kitna, who completed 24 of 39
passes for 298 yards and two touchdowns in his first start of the
season and only the second of his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the hands of James McKnight, the drop-prone wide
receiver who caught five passes for a career-high 113 yards,
including a dazzling 59-yard TD pass play, exactly the kind of play
that had been missing from the dormant offense that struggled so
badly as the Seahawks lost six of their previous eight games.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the hands and feet of Ricky Watters, who had 123 yards
rushing and receiving.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, it was in the right leg of Todd Peterson, who
kicked a 48-yard field goal with one second remaining on the
Kingdome clock to give the Seahawks an improbable 20-18 victory
over the Tennessee Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   As Peterson's game-winner sailed through the uprights, Kitna
dropped to his knees and pointed heaven-ward; embattled coach
Dennis Erickson bounded onto the field, hugging anyone and everyone
in his path; the at-times docile crowd of 59,048 roared its
approval; and Oilers coach Jeff Fisher couldn't believe his team
had its playoff hopes crumpled for the third straight season by
losing to the Seahawks in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very disappointing loss for our club,'' Fisher said.
``We're running out of games. The walls are closing in on us.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Seahawks, it was only one win in a still-disappointing
season. But the victory over the now 6-6 Oilers was just the second
against a winning team in the past 27 games, and it also evened
Seattle's record at 6-6 entering next week's game against the New
York Jets in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of playoffs in the locker room? Hardly. But there wasn't
the morgue-like silence that followed recent losses to the Oakland
Raiders at home and the Raiders and Dallas Cowboys on the road,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been out of a game all year. We just haven't found
ways to win enough of them,'' guard Pete Kendall said. ``To finally
win one, we've still got a pulse. As much as people may want to
write us off, the vultures are still going to have to circle us.
We've still got a pulse in our carcass.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was the most obvious jump-start for an offense that had
scored just seven TDs in six losses and had converted only nine
third downs in the previous five games.
</P>
<P>
   Switching quarterbacks last Monday meant benching future Hall of
Famer Warren Moon and giving the impression the coaches were giving
up on the season.
</P>
<P>
   But after the way Kitna performed Sunday, perhaps this season is
just getting started for a team that possesses so much talent but
has done so little with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon gets an A-plus from me for everything he did today,'' said
Watters, who ran 14 times for 63 yards and matched that total on
seven receptions. ``He was very poised in pressure situations. He
was very excited. He came into the huddle and told us, `Hey, we're
going to score here.' That's contagious. That's the way to be.''
</P>
<P>
   After Del Greco had kicked his fourth field goal of the game _ a
42-yarder that put the Oilers up 18-17 with 33 seconds left to play
_ the Seahawks made the kind of mistakes that have been their
undoing in other close games, twice drawing penalties. But Kitna
was unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   The undrafted, second-year quarterback from Central Washington
University and Tacoma's Lincoln High School made the kind of
impromptu plays that seem to be his specialty:
</P>
<P>
   -- On the first play of the ensuing series, Kitna passed to
McKnight for 19 yards and gained another 15 yards when Oilers
defensive end Kenny Holmes was penalized for hitting Kitna in the
head after he threw. First down at the Oilers' 38-yard line with 20
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   -- Kitna then passed to Watters for 5 yards. Second-and-5 from
the Oilers' 33 with 16 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   -- Kitna went to McKnight along the sideline, but McKnight was
out of bounds as he made the grab. Third-and-5 with 12 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   -- Then came a delay-of-game penalty and a false start charged
on Kendall. Third-and-15 from the Oilers' 44.
</P>
<P>
   -- Kitna went to Mike Pritchard, who lunged out of bounds at the
Oilers' 30-yard line with six seconds left. After a timeout by each
team, Peterson coolly kicked the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the way the game was going there was a chance I might
get a kick to win it,'' said Peterson, who hit a 50-yarder in the
second quarter and also supplied the winning kick in the Seahawks'
win at Oakland last season in Kitna's only other start. ``Guys rose
to the occasion. That was the difference. We believed we would win
today, instead of just thinking we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks needed everything Kitna, Peterson, McKnight,
Watters and Joey Galloway could supply because the defense had a
dickens of a time containing the Oilers' 1-2 punch of quarterback
Steve McNair and running back Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 225-pound McNair completed 18 of 34 passes for 199
yards and ran eight times for 64 yards, including a 3-yarder for
the Oilers' only TD. The 6-3, 240-pound George ran for 76 yards and
caught five passes for another 64 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell if McNair was Eddie or Eddie was McNair,''
said defensive end Michael Sinclair, who had two sacks of McNair to
regain the AFC lead with 14. ``It's tough for one guy to bring
McNair down. You've got to rally to him. We bent a little bit
today, but we didn't break.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair and George _ or George and McNair, if you will _ were the
main reasons the Seahawks had to scratch back from deficits of 6-0
and 18-17.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, unlike so many other times this season, the
Seahawks fought back and did it by leading with their offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things seemed real bleak out there,'' Kitna said. ``You'd love
to run away with a 21-point win. But things just don't happen like
that in this league very often. We'll take them how we can get
them.''

BRONCOS TURN BACK THE CLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ That '70s Show wound down Sunday in San Diego in
time for us to catch the start of the television sitcom by the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you say that wasn't Don Shula standing on the Qualcomm
Stadium sidelines, Paul Warfield streaking for the end zone, Marv
Fleming sacrificing his body to catch a third-down pass from Bob
Griese or Earl Morrall, and Nick Buoniconti stuffing Chargers
runners?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you could have fooled us. The Denver Broncos of 1998, with
Mike Shanahan at the helm, John Elway and Bubby Brister (Bubby
Brister???) at the controls, Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe at
his disposal and Bill Romanowski and John Mobley at their defense,
resemble the Miami Dolphins of 1972 enough to be their progeny in
history's family tree.
</P>
<P>
   On the same field where they won their first Super Bowl
championship in January, the Broncos defeated a charged-up San
Diego squad 31-16 to extend their winning streak to 17 games and
become the fourth NFL team in history to start a season 12-0 (the
others were the 1934 Chicago Bears, the 1972 Dolphins and the 1985
Bears).
</P>
<P>
   To put the Broncos' winning ways in perspective, consider: Doug
Flutie was the crown prince of the Canadian Football League the
last time the Broncos lost, on Dec. 15, 1997 against the San
Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, now appearing as the savior of the Buffalo Bills, is as
heartening a story as has been written in the NFL this year. The
fairy-tale season, though, is being authored by the Broncos, who
clinched the AFC West title over San Diego linebacker Junior Seau's
dogged body.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a Super Bowl, it's hard to write an epilogue. And
yet the only ones at a loss for words so far are those trying to
find suitable superlatives to describe a team with a kicker who
doesn't miss, a quarterback who doesn't quit, a running back who
doesn't slacken, a defense that doesn't waver and a coach who
doesn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   How about place kicker Jason Elam? With two-thirds of the season
gone he has yet to miss a field goal or a PAT. His 18 field goals
have included a 63-yarder against Jacksonville last month that tied
Tom Dempsey's 28-year-old record.
</P>
<P>
   And is there a finer running back right now than Davis, a San
Diego native and the Most Valuable Player in Super Bowl XXXII? On
Sunday he became only the second player in NFL history (after
Detroit's Barry Sanders) to surpass the 1,500-yard rushing mark in
three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He is on pace to finish with 2,086 yards. That would make him
only the third running back to crack the 2,000-yard milestone,
after O.J. Simpson and Eric Dickerson. This despite sitting out
snaps in the late going of one-sided games, of which Denver's had a
few; the Broncos have outscored their opponents 401-206. (This
Denver team is so dominant, it has spent only 29 minutes, 11
seconds of its season playing catch-up.)
</P>
<P>
   If Dickerson's 14-year-old single-season record of 2,105 yards
is the destination, Davis comes across as an accidental tourist.
``It's really not something that's on my mind,'' Davis said
recently. ``If I wanted it, I could have easily convinced
(Shanahan) to keep me in a couple of games this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, a one-time Granada Hills High standout, has sat out 2{
games with nagging aches and pains, thus delaying the inevitable _
and incredible. Finally, on Nov. 22 he joined Miami's Dan Marino as
the only players to throw for over 50,000 yards in the first
quarter of a 40-14 win over Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   This is shaping up as Elway's worst season statistically since
his rookie campaign. As if he cares.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Elway had better individual numbers in his other
Super Bowl appearances but no more fulfilling moment than when he
held the Super Bowl trophy aloft in his fourth stab at the NFL's
grand prize.
</P>
<P>
   In the early going against the Chargers, Elway was
uncharacteristically sloppy, fumbling away the snap on the Broncos'
first play from scrimmage and throwing three interceptions in the
first half. But he also passed for three of his four scores in that
span. That and San Diego quarterback Craig Whelihan's three
misfires went a long way toward explaining Denver's 21-10 lead at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   As Whelihan readily can attest, the Broncos are, to borrow a
phrase used to describe the 1972 Dolphins, ``an acquisitive bunch
of opportunists.''
</P>
<P>
   That Miami team faced only two teams with winning records in the
regular season and struggled in the playoffs to beat Cleveland
(20-14) and Pittsburgh (21-17). The Dolphins' 17th game was at the
L.A. Coliseum, against a Washington Redskins team that went 11-3 in
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Are these Broncos better than those Dolphins? Are you kidding?
Time has been kind to the Dolphins, who weren't even considered the
best team on the Coliseum field until the final whistle sounded on
their 14-7 Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington should win by at least 10 points,'' opined one
scribe beforehand, ``and perhaps by as many as 21.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Broncos' four remaining regular-season opponents, only
Miami has a winning record. Something tells us the champagne
bottles the members of the 1972 Dolphins team uncork each season
when the last of the undefeated teams is beaten might be good and
chilled by the time they reach their lips.

ANOTHER LATE BLEDSOE TD LIFTS PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Doug Flutie couldn't wait to give the quote
of the day:
</P>
<P>
   ``Want the quote? Want to hear what these guys had to say on
that fourth-down play?'' said Flutie, calling over the first
reporter into the Buffalo locker room. He was referring to a Shawn
Jefferson ``catch'' on the Patriots' last drive that appeared to be
out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it wasn't a catch. And one official called it
that way. No catch. Then the second official came over with a dumb
look on his face. He made no call. Then another official says `Just
give it to them.' Imagine that. He says, `Just give it to them.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what the officials did to the Patriots
Sunday, they just gave it to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an embarrassment to the league and football,'' said
fuming Bills general manager John Butler outside the locker room 15
minutes after his team had a victory it deserved taken out of its
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this is disgusting. They (officials) are
ruining the game. They are taking all of the fun out of it. The
level of incompetence is getting worse each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Wade Phillips wasn't as animated as Flutie or
Butler. But he was right to the point when asked why he didn't send
his team back out for the final point-after attempt at the end of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point didn't make any differnce. They had already given
them the game,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   This was a bountiful week for New England as it enjoyed ``home
cooking'' three times. Home cooking is an expression used in the
NFL, and all pro sports, to describe game officials who appear not
to have the courage to make a call against the home team when the
game is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night against Miami, the Patriots drove for the winning
touchdown in the final seconds, much as they did Sunday, passing
the ball down the field, and not a single holding call was made
when the Miami pass rushers were being mauled.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as Drew Bledsoe courageously took his team down the
field for another fantastic finish with all passes, again there
were no holding calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were the officials when I was being mugged by some of
their linemen?'' asked Buffalo defensive lineman Marcellus Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outplayed them,'' said Phillips, ``and we should have won.
We deserved to win. We made big plays to come back and they took
the game away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Two plays drove the Bills nuts and will have them berating chief
of officials Jerry Seeman at NFL headquarters in New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo led, 21-17. New England had the ball on the Buffalo 36
with 11 seconds to play, and the Patriots had no timeouts. The
Patriots had a fourth and 9. Anything less than 10 yards and the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe went back to pass and threw to Jefferson in front of the
Buffalo bench. Jefferson caught the ball and appeared to be out of
bounds. Not only that, but he also appeared to be short of the
first down. Either way, the Bills would have won.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Flutie's first-hand view of the conversation once again:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no catch. The guy closest said no catch. Then a second
guy came in and he said he didn't know. Then another guy comes in
and says, `Just give it to them.' I mean, what is that? Why did it
happen? Because the place is filled. There's a lot of money on the
line. Why did that happen?''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were still alive. But there were only six seconds
left. Time for one play.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe threw a Hail Mary into the left side of the Buffalo end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   There was a gang of players from both sides in the area, pushing
and shoving for position. This always happens on this play, and
after watching hundreds of Hail Mary passes in 38 years, this
reporter can't recall a pass interference call.
</P>
<P>
   When the pass is in the air like that, it is a given that
players are going to jockey for position, crawling all over each
other trying to make the play. Unbelievably, Glenn, in the middle
of this mass of humanity, jumped, had the ball in his hands, and
dropped it. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, out came another flag against Buffalo. Pass
interference. New England got one more play, from the 1, and
Bledsoe threw a perfect touch pass to the back of the end zone to
Ben Coates for the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   To call interference on a play like that is simply absurd. No
official with any common sense would make that call. Players on
both sides could have been called for pass interference, and then
maneuvered into position, and when Glenn had a clean shot to catch
the ball, and simply dropped it, then it was doubly ridiculous to
make the call.
</P>
<P>
   The officiating marred another terrific football game.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe and Flutie gave all that one could ask for. Bledsoe once
again carried his team to victory.
</P>
<P>
   He had 246 passing yards, including three touchdowns, while the
New England running game produced just 44 yards. He had to go to
the air, and again, Coates and Glenn with 18 catches between them,
saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo outplayed the Patriots and deserved to win. After a
sluggish first half, Flutie played superbly down the stretch. He
threw for 339 yards, almost 100 more than Bledsoe, with four fewer
attempts. The Bills outrushed the Patriots, 99 yards to those 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots blitzed Flutie throughout, and in the second half
he showed why he is playing so well right now. There were a
half-dozen times he threw to receivers who were covered, but
somehow completed these passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their cornerbacks cover (man to man) with the backs to the
line of scrimmage a lot, so I threw the ball in there, giving my
guys a chance to make plays and they did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Bledsoe hung a ball up early for an interception, he threw
underneath and got rid of the ball more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, it became a game of catch-and-throw.
</P>
<P>
   All of the big plays came in the air. Bledsoe and Flutie passes.
And the officials' flags.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN DIEGO _ The Denver Broncos almost proved nobody's perfect, but
they overcame four first-half turnovers Sunday night to become only
the fourth 12-0 team in NFL history and the first since the 1985
Chicago Bears.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Broncos mauled the San Diego Chargers 31-16 to clinch the
AFC West title. They earned their 17th consecutive victory dating
to last season, when they won Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   Denver moved one step closer to achieving its goal of becoming
the NFL's first 19-0 team and joining the 1972 Miami Dolphins as
the league's only unbeaten and untied champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos survived John Elway's three interceptions and
fumbled snap in the first half to beat the Chargers for the second
time this season. It was the first time since 1995 Elway had been
intercepted three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we're bad, we're good,'' Broncos guard David
Diaz-Infante said.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for eight turnovers in the first half. The
first two quarters at Qualcomm Stadium showed how good and bad the
Broncos can be. They played their worst half of the season but led
by 11 points at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   How could the Broncos commit four turnovers and still lead
21-10? Because Elway threw three touchdown passes, including two
after Denver interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad when you can throw three interceptions and fumble
once and still be up 21-10,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers, who had won their past two games after quarterback
Craig Whelihan replaced No. 1 pick Ryan Leaf, also committed four
turnovers, including three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing our worst, and they were playing their best,
and we still won,'' Broncos receiver Rod Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Before this game, Denver had committed only nine turnovers,
including two fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the night to beat them,'' San Diego general manager
Bobby Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
   Elway and Tom Nalen mishandled the snap on the first play, and
linebacker Junior Seau recovered at the Broncos' 25. That led to
John Carney's 27-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   If not for San Diego's turnovers, the Broncos would have had
little to show for the first half because the Chargers' No.
1-ranked run defense threw a blanket over running back Terrell
Davis, who carried nine times for 32 yards in the first two
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Elway and Davis needed help from the defense to jump-start the
offense. When cornerback Darrien Gordon intercepted Whelihan and
returned it 17 yards to the San Diego 22, the Broncos scored for
the first time. Elway found receiver Ed McCaffrey for a 15-yard
touchdown. Jason Elam made it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's best drive came midway through the first quarter when
it covered 66 yards in five plays. Elway and McCaffrey combined for
the touchdown, this one going for 37 yards with 6:43 left in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared another Denver rout was on, but the Chargers
regained their composure, thanks to Whelihan. On an 81-yard drive,
he completed four passes for 56 yards. Running back Terrell
Fletcher scored on a 13-yard run to make it 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   On their next series, the Chargers looked as if they were going
to take the lead. They reached Denver's seven, but reserve running
back Kenny Bynum fumbled at the five. That was it for San Diego's
offense. From there, it became a comedy of errors with Elway and
Whelihan the featured performers.
</P>
<P>
   First, Elway was intercepted by cornerback Charles Dimry, who
returned it 30 yards to the Denver 41. The scoring chance was
squandered when Whelihan was intercepted by cornerback Darrius
Johnson at Denver's 49.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of that Denver series, Dimry intercepted Elway
again, but the Chargers could do nothing with it.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was intercepted on a third consecutive series when safety
Greg Johnson picked off a long pass at the San Diego two. Two plays
later, linebacker John Mobley intercepted Whelihan, and a San Diego
facemask penalty gave the Broncos a first down at San Diego's 19.
</P>
<P>
   Elway didn't waste this opportunity. On the second play, he
threw a perfect pass to the corner of the end zone, where Smith
caught the 13-yard touchdown, giving Denver a 21-10 lead with 49
seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate to be ahead 21-10,'' coach Mike Shanahan
said. ``I've got to credit our defense for hanging tough and John
for keeping his poise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos opened the second half with a drive becoming of the
defending Super Bowl champions. After stopping the Chargers on
three downs, Denver got the ball at its five. Fourteen plays, 95
yards and eight minutes, 20 seconds later, the Broncos had a 28-10
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Elway completed five passes on the drive. Offsetting penalties
rubbed out his 18-yard touchdown pass to Smith on third-and-seven.
No problem. On the next play, the Chargers rushed only three
linemen, and Elway had enough time to throw an 18-yard TD pass to
tight end Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe broke off his route and headed for the end zone when he
saw Elway scrambling and looking for a receiver. Sharpe caught the
ball in the back of the end zone with 4:34 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers scored their last touchdown when Whelihan threw a
47-yard pass to Bryan Still with 4:55 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing the Chargers did surprised us,'' Shanahan said.
``They're No. 1 in defense, and we knew going in it was going to be
a dogfight, and it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to be 12-0, but that was our goal. Now, our goal
is to be 13-0.''

ANOTHER LATE BLEDSOE TD LIFTS PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was a Flutie Finish.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Sunday, Bledsoe had his finger on the pulse of the
Patriots' life support. It wasn't enough that he worked a Doug
Flutie-like miracle in a dramatic victory over the Dolphins last
Monday night after breaking his right index finger in two places.
</P>
<P>
   This time he won the game and saved the season again, with no
time remaining in regulation, snatching the spotlight and a chapter
from Flutie folklore right out from under Flutie's nose with a
1-yard touchdown pass to Ben Coates that produced a 25-21 victory
over the Buffalo Bills. This came right after the Patriots received
what may have been a gift interference call charged to safety Henry
Jones on a Hail Mary pass from Bledsoe to Terry Glenn in the end
zone that ate up the final six seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I've never had anything good happen on a Hail Mary
pass,'' said Bledsoe. ``I've tried about eight of those things and
six of them have been intercepted.''
</P>
<P>
   On the play before the pass interference call, the Patriots
threw to Shawn Jefferson on a fourth and 9 from the Bills 36 with
11 seconds left. He caught the ball, but appeared to be out of
bounds, however the officials gave him the call.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, several Bills said they heard one official say
to another, ``Just give it to them.'' And so the play stood,
setting the stage for the next questionable call.
</P>
<P>
   Of the interference call made before the winning play, Bledsoe
said, ``They hit (Terry), and so it's pass interference. It was a
good call.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he should have caught the pass, as he turned back
toward the ball and saw it go right between his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hit right before the ball arrived,'' said Glenn. ``But I
should have caught the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Ty Law, the victim of two pass interference calls in what was a
tough performance by the Patriots' secondary (and perhaps a tougher
day for the officials), saw it differently and sympathized with the
Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything,'' said Law. ``That was one for the
boys. Everybody's jumping on those Hail Marys. They have a right to
be pissed. With all the bad calls we got, I think we deserved one.
But we can't make miracles happen every week. We've got to get our
act together on defense. We're better than what we're showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee Walt Coleman confirmed that the call was on Jones and
explained: ``The receiver went up to catch the ball. (Jones) just
went through the receiver and he was not playing the ball. He made
contact with the receiver and that's interference.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 21 penalties called, 12 on the Bills and nine on the
Patriots. But the one at the end sent Bills owner Ralph Wilson
through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst officiating I've ever seen,'' said Wilson.
``I'll take the fine. I don't care what it is. It's embarrassing to
the league. Don't get me wrong, the Patriots have a hell of a team,
but we got robbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen football for six decades,'' Wilson continued, ``I've
never seen anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The win improved the Patriots' record to 7-5, 4-3 in the AFC
East, and they are tied for third place with the Bills, a game
behind the New York Jets and Miami, who share the top spot at 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll said he let offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese call the final play. The Patriots lined up in a running
formation (and some Bills thought the Patriots were going to run
it) at the goal line, but Bledsoe stepped back and lofted the
winning pass to Coates, alone in the back of the end zone to the
right side, leaving linebacker Marlo Perry behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the play we would normally call if we're going to throw
it there,'' said Zampese. ``It was made to order. Drew and Ben have
developed this great rapport over the years, so when it comes to
crunch time like that, that's what we do. Ben really got himself
wide open and Drew ... this guy just amazes me week to week. He's
playing hurt. He's showed so much heart and soul the last two
weeks. It was an emotional win. It's an emotional situation for our
football team. To win two games like this has to do a lot for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates and fullback Tony Carter were Bledsoe's only two options
on the play, Carter along the goal line and Coates deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended with Adam Vinatieri running in for a 2-point
conversion after officials called both teams back on the field to
complete the scoring. But the Bills didn't come back, and holder
Tom Tupa pitched to Vinatieri, who padded his scoring totals.
</P>
<P>
   That ended an afternoon that looked as if it might end the way
so many envisioned it, with Flutie leading the Bills to a win in
his hometown. He had been 10-0 here before Sunday. He threw for 339
yards, an NFL career high, completing 21 of 39 passes with two
touchdowns. He had brought the Bills back from a 14-0 deficit to
within 14-12 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots put distance between them and the Bills on
Vinatieri's 44-yard field goal with 5:06 remaining in the third
quarter, ending the Bills' string of 12 unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bills got the ball back and Flutie drove them from their
33 to the Patriots' 4 before Steve Christie booted a field goal
from 22 yards to pull the Bills to within 17-15.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did a three-and-out as the third quarter ended and
the final period began. And then, Buffalo went on one of the
strangest drives, which consumed 8:28. It featured two critical
third-down penalties, one to Law for defensive holding and one on
rookie Tebucky Jones for illegal use of hands, and one big
second-down penalty on Steve Israel that put Buffalo on the New
England 5.
</P>
<P>
   On third and 4 at the 4, Flutie looped one over Jones's head to
Andre Reed, and the Bills had taken their first lead of the game,
21-17, with 6:14 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots made a couple of first downs on the ensuing drive,
with Glenn catching a 23-yard pass along the way. The drive stalled
at the Bills' 29 when Glenn dropped a slant, on which he was about
to get demolished, but the news got worse when Vinatieri missed a
47-yard attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills got the ball back at their 37 and tried to eat up the
clock. After Antowain Smith made a first down on runs of 8 and 3
yards, the Patriots' defense began to tighten. Flutie attempted a
keeper on third and 8 at midfield that was stuffed by rookie
defensive end Greg Spires.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills punted back to the Patriots after the two-minute
warning to the Patriots' 18, where the final drive began with 1:52
remaining. Bledsoe went 8 for 12 for 52 yards on the final drive,
connecting with Coates four times, but no pass went for more than
12 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew played a great game,'' said Flutie. ``He played with a
lot of heart. In the past two weeks he's won over a lot of
naysayers with his approach to the game. We played with the same
heart, but the officials had way too much control of the game.''

BILLS' OFFICIAL STANCE: THEY GOT ROBBED 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Doug Flutie couldn't wait to give the quote
of the day:
</P>
<P>
   ``Want the quote? Want to hear what these guys had to say on
that fourth-down play?'' said Flutie, calling over the first
reporter into the Buffalo locker room. He was referring to a Shawn
Jefferson ``catch'' on the Patriots' last drive that appeared to be
out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it wasn't a catch. And one official called it
that way. No catch. Then the second official came over with a dumb
look on his face. He made no call. Then another official says `Just
give it to them.' Imagine that. He says, `Just give it to them.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what the officials did to the Patriots
Sunday, they just gave it to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an embarrassment to the league and football,'' said
fuming Bills general manager John Butler outside the locker room 15
minutes after his team had a victory it deserved taken out of its
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this is disgusting. They (officials) are
ruining the game. They are taking all of the fun out of it. The
level of incompetence is getting worse each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Wade Phillips wasn't as animated as Flutie or
Butler. But he was right to the point when asked why he didn't send
his team back out for the final point-after attempt at the end of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point didn't make any differnce. They had already given
them the game,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   This was a bountiful week for New England as it enjoyed ``home
cooking'' three times. Home cooking is an expression used in the
NFL, and all pro sports, to describe game officials who appear not
to have the courage to make a call against the home team when the
game is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night against Miami, the Patriots drove for the winning
touchdown in the final seconds, much as they did Sunday, passing
the ball down the field, and not a single holding call was made
when the Miami pass rushers were being mauled.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as Drew Bledsoe courageously took his team down the
field for another fantastic finish with all passes, again there
were no holding calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were the officials when I was being mugged by some of
their linemen?'' asked Buffalo defensive lineman Marcellus Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outplayed them,'' said Phillips, ``and we should have won.
We deserved to win. We made big plays to come back and they took
the game away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Two plays drove the Bills nuts and will have them berating chief
of officials Jerry Seeman at NFL headquarters in New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo led, 21-17. New England had the ball on the Buffalo 36
with 11 seconds to play, and the Patriots had no timeouts. The
Patriots had a fourth and 9. Anything less than 10 yards and the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe went back to pass and threw to Jefferson in front of the
Buffalo bench. Jefferson caught the ball and appeared to be out of
bounds. Not only that, but he also appeared to be short of the
first down. Either way, the Bills would have won.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Flutie's first-hand view of the conversation once again:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no catch. The guy closest said no catch. Then a second
guy came in and he said he didn't know. Then another guy comes in
and says, `Just give it to them.' I mean, what is that? Why did it
happen? Because the place is filled. There's a lot of money on the
line. Why did that happen?''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were still alive. But there were only six seconds
left. Time for one play.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe threw a Hail Mary into the left side of the Buffalo end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   There was a gang of players from both sides in the area, pushing
and shoving for position. This always happens on this play, and
after watching hundreds of Hail Mary passes in 38 years, this
reporter can't recall a pass interference call.
</P>
<P>
   When the pass is in the air like that, it is a given that
players are going to jockey for position, crawling all over each
other trying to make the play. Unbelievably, Glenn, in the middle
of this mass of humanity, jumped, had the ball in his hands, and
dropped it. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, out came another flag against Buffalo. Pass
interference. New England got one more play, from the 1, and
Bledsoe threw a perfect touch pass to the back of the end zone to
Ben Coates for the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   To call interference on a play like that is simply absurd. No
official with any common sense would make that call. Players on
both sides could have been called for pass interference, and then
maneuvered into position, and when Glenn had a clean shot to catch
the ball, and simply dropped it, then it was doubly ridiculous to
make the call.
</P>
<P>
   The officiating marred another terrific football game.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe and Flutie gave all that one could ask for. Bledsoe once
again carried his team to victory.
</P>
<P>
   He had 246 passing yards, including three touchdowns, while the
New England running game produced just 44 yards. He had to go to
the air, and again, Coates and Glenn with 18 catches between them,
saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo outplayed the Patriots and deserved to win. After a
sluggish first half, Flutie played superbly down the stretch. He
threw for 339 yards, almost 100 more than Bledsoe, with four fewer
attempts. The Bills outrushed the Patriots, 99 yards to those 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots blitzed Flutie throughout, and in the second half
he showed why he is playing so well right now. There were a
half-dozen times he threw to receivers who were covered, but
somehow completed these passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their cornerbacks cover (man to man) with the backs to the
line of scrimmage a lot, so I threw the ball in there, giving my
guys a chance to make plays and they did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Bledsoe hung a ball up early for an interception, he threw
underneath and got rid of the ball more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, it became a game of catch-and-throw.
</P>
<P>
   All of the big plays came in the air. Bledsoe and Flutie passes.
And the officials' flags.

ARMSTRONG PREACHES CAUTION AMIDST EUPHORIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bruce Armstrong sat alone amidst the
rubble of the passing parade Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   His team had just pulled out a most improbable victory for the
second straight game and there was chaos around him. Young players
who didn't know any better were uplifted, voices rising in
excitement at what they had just won, which Armstrong understood
was nothing but a game unless better games followed it.
</P>
<P>
   Older hands, who maybe should have known better, were uplifted
as well, their gear lying in piles around the locker room as they
slapped hands, slapped backs, slapped anything they could think of
in the pure joy of unexpected victory.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was uplifted as well. After 12 years of NFL warfare,
he knew better than most how joyful the feeling was Sunday night
after Drew Bledsoe threw a touchdown pass to Ben Coates with no
time on the clock to beat the Buffalo Bills and keep the Patriots'
playoff hopes alive. But he also knew something had to be said to
his frolicking teammates right then, before the partying spun out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   What had to be said had to be said at that moment, in the midst
of the elation of victory, but how it was said might be as
important as that it was said at all, and Armstrong understood
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   So the six-time Pro Bowl tackle gently reminded his younger
teammates that, yes, this was a stirring 25-21 victory and yes, it
was nothing short of marvelous to have won in this fashion two
weeks in a row, but ... there's always a but in a circumstance such
as the Patriots are in now ... it would be unwise to continue to do
things in this manner much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great victory, but the fact is we're pretty much
all out of miracles,'' Armstrong explained, an hour after another
one had lifted his team to 7-5 and into a third-place tie with
Buffalo behind the Jets and Dolphins, who both won Sunday to remain
tied atop the AFC East at 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here just to win a few games and make some money. I'm
doing this for an opportunity to win the championship. It feels
good to win a game like this because I've been here a long time and
been on the wrong end of a lot of these kind of finishes, but we
know we've got to play better than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to go out and make that play (the 1-yard touchdown pass
to Coates with no time left and the 25-yard pass to Shawn Jefferson
a week ago with 25 seconds to play that beat Miami) is important.
It shows we've got a bunch of guys in here with a lot of heart, but
we can play better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made plays lately and it's given us a chance to win, but
we don't want to keep putting ourselves in position to have to win
this way. If you do, one day you don't win. That's indicative of
where we're at at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Patriots are at this moment is back in the race with a
month to go, back in a place where it did not look likely these
Patriots could reach two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   As they say in pool, there is still a lot of green between the
balls they have to knock into the pockets and their cue, but at
least they are alive again, which, frankly, did not seem likely
after they lost four out of five games before miracles started
happening as if they were playing on 34th Street this holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   Now they must go to a most difficult place next Sunday and do it
again. They must go to Pittsburgh, where they have lost six
straight dating back to 1986 and face the Steelers, to whom they
have lost seven of the last eight games, and they must win. If they
are wise, Armstrong knows, they will not go to Pittsburgh expecting
to have eight penalties called on the Steelers in the final two
drives of the day, as happened Sunday night to the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   If they are wise, they will not wait for the final seconds,
needing a miracle to stay alive. If they end up winning in as
dramatic a fashion as they did Sunday _ when they drove 82 yards to
victory in the final minute and 52 seconds to win _ Armstrong will
take it, but he is the ultimate realist and so he knows these are
not the Lourdes Patriots. This is not a team of constant miracle
workers _ no team can be.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years in the NFL, half ending with him drinking fresh
pineapple juice at the Pro Bowl, have taught Bruce Armstrong. He
understands pro football is a game in which the fantastic may
happen, but to rely on it is to court disaster.
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday night, as gently as he could, Armstrong reminded his
young teammates that drama sells, but too much drama can turn a
good story bad. Too much reliance on drama leads you not to the
championship game in January but to the golf course, and so he took
this win for what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here appreciating this, but the realist in me
knows we can't keep going out and doing this,'' Armstrong said. ``I
don't want to spoil the atmosphere or rain on anyone's parade, but
we have to play better to win the championship. That was addressed
as soon as we came in this locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried a lot a few weeks ago about where we were
headed. If you looked at all the numbers, it didn't look good. We'd
created a situation for ourselves that brought everything else into
play, like tiebreakers, instead of taking care of our own business,
but now we got a chance again if we realize what these last two
games did for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't win us anything. If we lost this game we would
have just been playing football games the rest of the year. We need
to understand that. This was a great win for us, but all it gave us
is a chance to make next week mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win there, then the next week could mean something. And
if we keep doing that and not making it so hard on ourselves, when
we get to the end we could really win something. That's what we
have to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, miracles are fine as long as you don't need one
too many.

FOR ONCE, FLUTIE ON SHORT SIDE OF SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The postgame attire was black. In fashion,
as in football, Doug Flutie is ever on target. The humor, too,
matched the attire.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie isn't usually the one who has to explain the
inexplainable defeat. He's the one who invites the superlatives.
He's the one who singularly turned ``Hail Mary'' into something
other than a prayer. He's the miracle worker, not the spurned
suitor.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular occasion, however, Flutie was on the losing
end. In 10 previous starts at Bob Kraft's Xanadu on Route 1, Flutie
had won 10 times. No. 11 seemed to be a formality after a
career-best 339-yard, two-TD performance against the Patriots. His
team led, 21-17, until the Patriots scored on the final play, with
no time left, beneficiaries of some truly controversial, bizarre,
and, in Flutie's view, gutless calls by the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was worth the price of admission, wasn't it?'' he
deadpanned to a sea of minicams. He then went on to say that
several Bills had overheard the officials discussing a critical
fourth-down play that kept New England's drive going.
</P>
<P>
   One official didn't know. The other wasn't sure. So, Flutie
said, one turned to the other and said, ``Just give it to them.''
They did. ``I'm not going to get fined for this, am I?'' Flutie
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a judgment call, make a decision and live with it,''
he said. ``It's frustrating. We missed a big opportunity. We played
well enough to win and it's frustrating to lose it the way we did
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard, almost impossible, to get Flutie to talk about The
Day. The Game. The Return. It all seemed so irrelevant to him. He
was his usual, accommodating self afterward, going so far as to
suggest the best possible backdrop for a television interview. (It
was the end zone.)
</P>
<P>
   It had been a decade since he last passed through here, soon to
be exiled to the Canadian Football League. There was a huge buildup
for his one and only appearance at Kraft's Shangri-La and he didn't
disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 21 of 39 passes with no interceptions. Two passes
went for touchdowns; an 84-yarder to Eric Moulds (great catch and
great run) and the erstwhile game-winning toss of 4 yards to Andre
Reed to cap a drive that took more time than the director's cut of
``Dances With Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also the obligatory escapes (five rushes for 30
yards) and, until the bitter end, the satisfaction of seemingly
winning a big division game, on the road, in front of many, many
closet Flutie fans, some of whom were brave enough to wear Flutie's
old No. 2 Patriot jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Flutie shrugged when told of the gaudy numbers. ``It's
not that satisfying, though. You want to put enough points on the
board and we didn't do it. I thought I played well. I played my
heart out. I'm not disappointed with that. I'm disappointed the way
it ended.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted the fans were supportive at the beginning, but as the
game wore on, they turned hostile. He said he expected that. ``Once
the game starts, they forget about all that other stuff and root
for their team,'' he said. But he also noted these were fans who
needed no convincing of his worth or ability. He may have had to do
it elsewhere, but not here.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who knew,'' he said. ``I didn't have to
prove anything to them.''
</P>
<P>
   These also were the people accustomed to watching Flutie win
games like this. They saw him direct the Bills on that interminable
fourth-quarter drive, abetted by some similarly controversial calls
against the Patriots. They saw Flutie connect with Reed on a must
third-down timing play to give Buffalo its first lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But they also saw Flutie fail to get that final first down that
would never have given the Patriots _ or the officials _ another
chance. He still regretted not making a cut that might have got the
necessary yardage.
</P>
<P>
   And he was like so many others in that final 1:52, a helpless
bystander. He has been on both sides of miracle wins, from his
``Hail Mary'' toss to beat Miami in 1984 to a Grey Cup loss when
his brother, Darren, made the winning catch.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there was some brief family time with his wife,
mother-in-law, and sister-in-law. There was some family pride in
knowing that his nephew, Billy, won the Punt, Pass &AMP; Kick
Competition. But there also was the sense of opportunity lost,
something Flutie and those who have watched him over the years
simply aren't used to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Laurie, probably summed it up best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was typical Doug,'' she said. ``It was unbelievable. He
played really well. He just couldn't do any more than he did.''

BLEDSOE'S FINGER BROKEN, BUT SPIRIT INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   These are the words that best describe what Drew Bledsoe in the
last seven days has done for his team, our region, and his own good
name.
</P>
<P>
   It took a broken bone, and a couple of impossible last-second
comebacks against Miami and Buffalo, but after what we saw in
Sunday's 25-21 win over the Bills, it's clear that Bledsoe is
finally ready to take his place in the pantheon of local sports
greats. In his sixth full season, already the greatest Patriot
ever, Bledsoe is poised to join Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski,
Bobby Orr, and yes ... Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   He'll need a championship or two to finish the job, but that
suddenly seems like part of his future now that we know Drew's got
the same stuff that drove Larry to dive on the floor and take the
last shot.
</P>
<P>
   It took a broken index finger and back-to-back miracles to bring
local fans and media critics on board. Bledsoe knew all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to be arrogant, but I haven't been surprised by any of
this,'' he said after throwing a 1-yard TD strike to Ben Coates
with no time on the clock. ``I've always enjoyed these situations.
It's the situation you live for when you play sports, from the time
you're playing ball at recess in grade school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the guy I've seen all along,'' said Pete Carroll, the
cheerleader/coach who has been pulled from the fire by his heroic
quarterback. ``I've seen the intensity. I've seen the
competitiveness. This is what he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently. But cynical/impatient/passionate/angry New
Englanders have been reluctant to fully embrace their young star
who passed for 20,000 yards quicker than any quarterback not
</P>
<P>
   named Marino. It's bothered us that he can appear so calm before
going into battle. We've decided that he doesn't have enough fire
and, like Roger Clemens before him, he can't win the big game.
</P>
<P>
   These last two games were practically franchise-savers. Since
owner Bob Kraft announced his intention to move the team to
Chernobyl-by-the-Connecticut in Hartford, the Patriots twice played
knowing that a loss almost certainly would eliminate them from
playoff competition. In both contests, Bledsoe drove them the
length of the field in the closing seconds despite playing with a
broken bone in his passing hand.
</P>
<P>
   Tough enough for you?
</P>
<P>
   Downright Larry-esque. That's what it was.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the great ones do. Against Miami Monday night,
Bledsoe was like a weary Luis Tiant, refusing to come out of the
game and throwing strikes from every angle to beat the Cincinnati
Reds in the fourth game of the 1975 World Series. Against the Bills
Sunday, he was like Bird in the 1991 playoffs, coming out of the
trainer's room in the second half to beat the Indiana Pacers after
smashing his face on the Garden parquet.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that there is a sports god with a fine sense of symmetry,
Bledsoe's finest hour came while local icon Doug Flutie _ who never
had lost at Foxboro Stadium _ stood on the sideline, unable to
perform any more miracles.
</P>
<P>
   When the Buffalo offense left the field for the last time, the
Bills led, 21-17, and the Patriots were stuck on their own 18 with
1:52 showing on the clock, no timeouts remaining, and a QB with a
broken finger.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bledsoe did what Flutie has done so many times. He took his
team down the field. And then he beat the Bills with ... a Hail
Mary pass. Beating Doug Flutie's team with a Hail Mary is like
beating Mark McGwire in Home Run Derby. Flutie copyrighted the
prayer pass against the University of Miami in 1984, but Sunday he
watched helplessly hoping as Bledsoe's 26-yard heave came down
under Terry Glenn. The pass was incomplete, but a pass interference
call gave the Patriots a final play from the 1 with no time
remaining in the game. Bledsoe made it count, finding Coates in the
back of the end zone near the far right corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Hail Marys I've thrown in my career, going back to the
eighth grade, I've never had anything good come out of any of
them,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Something good happened this time (though in Buffalo the play is
likely to be remembered as something akin to grand theft). And then
Bledsoe was able to finish the job with no time for consultation
from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Patriot season is saved. For now. And 6-foot-5-inch
Drew is finally bigger than 5-9 Doug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Drew is tired of hearing all that Flutie stuff,'' said
Bledsoe's backup, Scott Zolak. ``I think this is rather tasty for
him. I think maybe he's Massachusetts' top quarterback tonight,
instead of that other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. On this night Drew was Larry. And Doug never had a
prayer.

BILLS OWNER RIPS OFFICIATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson was already
wound up. He had stood livid Sunday in the visitors' locker room _
where the Bills thought they had been robbed of a game they had won
_ and railed about the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the locker room, he ran into quarterback Doug Flutie.
They talked for a minute and Flutie passed on the word that besides
the pass interference call in the end zone that led to the winning
Patriot touchdown, and a Shawn Jefferson catch along the sideline
that the Bills thought was clearly out of bounds, there was more.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the remote chance that Jefferson did make the catch
inbounds, Flutie was reporting, it looked like he didn't have
enough yardage to make the first down on fourth and 9. In other
words, the game should have ended a play earlier and the pass
interference play never should have happened.
</P>
<P>
   None of this changed Wilson's assessment of what he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst officiating I've ever seen,'' Wilson said.
``I'll take the fine. I don't care. I don't know what can be done
about it, but it was awful. It's embarrassing to the league. Don't
get me wrong. The Patriots have a heck of a team. But we got
robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the prevailing sentiment in an angry, irate locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen football for six decades and I've never seen
anything like that,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously upset about the outcome of the game, I think
it's ridiculous,'' said Buffalo coach Wade Phillips. ``A guy
catches the ball on the sideline, I think it's over then, and I've
never seen a pass interference call on a Hail Mary play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Sam Gash, once a Patriot and now a Bill, watched it
from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (things) that happened at the end was ridiculous,'' Gash
said. ``Two calls back to back. Ridiculous. Yeah, I feel like we
were robbed. That's the worst end of a game I've ever been involved
with in terms of officiating. The worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs Henry Jones and Thomas Smith and the rest of the
Bills defenders watched it all up close _ too close _ in the left
corner of the end zone. ``It was a mess out there,'' they said.
Smith said he heard someone say the pass interference call was on
No. 20 _ Jones. Jones said he still didn't know if the call had
been against him (it was).
</P>
<P>
   Smith's job was to jump and try to knock the ball away. Jones
was supposed to hang back and keep an eye out for deflections.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his arms were being held down as he got ready to jump
and there came Terry Glenn across and going up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always contact,'' Smith said. ``It's in the end zone,
it's a Hail Mary, people are jockeying for position. There are
about six people there in what is a little amount of space.''
</P>
<P>
   Contact? Oh yeah. Pass interference? No way, they all felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you supposed to do?,'' Smith said. ``How can you
cover anybody? How can you call it pass interference? I don't
understand it. I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy out there,'' he said. ``I don't think referees
should ever decide a game like that. It was unbelievable. I had
contact with somebody. I had contact with a couple of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But pass interference? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave them the ball at the 1-yard line,'' Jones said. ``I
don't know what to say. I could see it if someone pulled someone
down, or if they tackled him, or if they were holding him down and
he couldn't jump. That's one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This, they could not understand.
</P>
<P>
   But, Wilson said, he did see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that interference play, right before it, I turned to my
daughter and said they're going to throw it into the end zone and
the officials are going to call interference,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   To his horror, the play unfolded exactly as he had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could play the stock market like that,'' he said.

   KANSAS CITY _ Dear Eric:
</P>
<P>
   If you missed it, and you did, the Cardinals lost to the Kansas
City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the Chiefs. The Chiefs who had lost six in a row.
The Chiefs who lead the league in fumbles and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs who couldn't remember the last time they rushed for
100 yards might as well have worn a sign on their back Sunday that
read, ``Beat Us, Please.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Without its best player, the defense couldn't make a stop when
it needed to, when it had to, with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   With six minutes left and the Cardinals trailing by a touchdown,
Dave McGinnis paced the sideline, frantic, hands cupped to his
mouth. What was your coach shouting? Defensive signals or
encouragement?
</P>
<P>
   ``Both,'' McGinnis said later.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas were snatched from his lips, the words swept away by a
gusting prairie wind.
</P>
<P>
   Your teammates ``had'' to make a stand. But there was Rich
Gannon rolling out and tossing another pass for a first down. There
was Bam Morris bamming through the line. Fourteen yards. Six more
to the Cardinals' 1.
</P>
<P>
   Did you watch the game on TV?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he _ ``you'' _ did,'' Lomas Brown said, not unkindly.
The Cardinals tackle felt compelled to say what McGinnis can't say.
What he won't say. In the code of coaches citing injuries after a
loss is a cop-out. A crutch.
</P>
<P>
   So Brown said it. ``We need him. We need ``everybody.'' We're
fighting for the playoffs.'' The 14-year veteran buttoned his dress
shirt, knotted his tie. ``I don't think I'm saying anything out of
place.''
</P>
<P>
   No one blames this loss on you.
</P>
<P>
   To do so is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   It is as unfair as those who wonder if you're ``really''
hurting. ``I can't be in his body,'' Lomas said in the emptying
locker room. Only you can feel the soreness in your right knee.
Only one other person, our president, feels your pain.
</P>
<P>
   But it must hurt terribly.
</P>
<P>
   The pain must be excruciating for you to submit to another
operation _ the same procedure you had in October _ and miss the
Cardinals' playoff drive. It must hurt like hell.
</P>
<P>
   Redd Foxx as TV's Fred Sanford called it ``arthur-i-tis,'' but
it's not a laughing matter to those who are afflicted, and many
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got it in my wrist,'' said Michael Bidwill, the owner's
son, bending the joint. Bidwill feels stiffness and pain. But he
can't feel ``your'' pain.
</P>
<P>
   So team management relies on the expertise of its doctors. They
say you're suffering from arthritis in both knees. They say last
month's surgery _ a cleaning-out procedure called an arthroscopic
flush _ was successful. They contend you don't need another
surgery, that you're looking for ``a silver bullet'' _ a cure that
will make the pain go away. They are hoping before you have surgery
that you'll get a third opinion.
</P>
<P>
   How much pain can a player endure? That depends upon the
individual. At times during his Hall of Fame career, Larry Wilson
played with broken fingers on both hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always able not to think about it,'' Wilson once said.
``I can't tell you why.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be a heavy burden weighing your physical well-being
against the desire to compete and the obligation to your teammates.
You signed a five-year, $25 million contract. You're earning more
this season than seven or eight other defensive starters combined.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the coaches and players wanted you in the lineup
Sunday. Even though the Cards have won three of their last five
games, the defense obviously isn't the same without you.
</P>
<P>
   You are Eric Swann, 6 feet 5, 313 pounds, a Pro Bowl player, the
best defensive player on the team. You can dominate the middle. You
draw double-teams, freeing others to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobin downplays your absence. ``You hope one player
wouldn't be the breaking point of a whole defensive football
team,'' the coach said after this loss.
</P>
<P>
   But Lomas Brown is right. The Cardinals need you. Whatever you
can give.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not coming back,'' Jamir Miller said dismissively as he
left the locker room. ``He's done for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it true?
</P>
<P>
   If it is, and if your decision is as painful as your aching
knee, here is some advice, not that you asked for it. Say what's in
your heart. Tell your teammates how much you regret not being there
with them, for them. Tell the public, too. Everyone would feel a
little better. &QL;

CHIEFS MAKE CASE AGAINST CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Out of the kindness of his heart, Kansas City
Chiefs Coach Marty Schottenheimer had quarterback Rich Gannon take
a knee three straight times to end Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only way the Cardinals' defense was going to make a
stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals allowed 282 yards and 20 points in the second half
to fall, 34-24, before 69,613 fans at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Just when their offense finally gets going _ they've averaged 30
points in their past four games _ the defense goes into retreat.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals (6-6) fail to reach the playoffs, they can
blame their defense, which has been mauled the past three weeks.
They've given up 1,151 yards and 111 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has flipped on this team,'' outside linebacker
Jamir Miller said. ``The momentum has gone to the offense and we've
just stalled. Any time an offense scores (24) points, you should
win 85 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the second half, the Cardinals came within a
touchdown of the Chiefs but couldn't stop them, including the final
six minutes after Mario Bates' 1-yard touchdown run cut the lead to
31-24.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing kickoff, Bates was penalized for being offsides,
kicker Joe Nedney suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee that will end his season and punter Scott Player was
forced into action when the Cardinals had to kick again.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, who broke a six-game skid, went 66 yards in 10 plays
to put the game away on Pete Stoyanovich's 18-yard field goal with
1:57 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dominating like we used to,'' rookie defensive end
Andre Wadsworth said in the understatement of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In second halves the past two weeks, the Cardinals have allowed
seven touchdowns and two field goals and scores on 9 of 12 drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It completely baffles me after (Sunday's) first half,''
defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said. ``How many yards did they
have? What did they do? The first half, we got this thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs led, 14-10, at halftime, but both of their touchdowns
came on short drives. They took over on the Cardinals' 4 after
quarterback Jake Plummer was intercepted by cornerback James Hasty
in the first quarter. They started their next drive on the Arizona
37 thanks to a 62-yard kickoff return by Tamarick Vanover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the locker room at halftime and saw that (the
Chiefs) had about 12 carries for 30 yards,'' Miller said of a first
half in which the Cardinals allowed only 37 rushing yards on 13
carries. ``I looked up (at the scoreboard) again in the third
quarter, and three carries later, they had 15 for about 75 yards.
You can't do that and be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs gained 20, 15 and 16 yards on their first three runs
of the second half. They had 91 rushing yards in the second half
and finished with 128, their first 100-yard game in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an early scouting report from Cardinals defensive back
J.J. McCleskey on next week's opponent, the New York Giants. He
didn't have to be reminded that the Giants have rushed for 577
yards in beating the Cardinals by a combined score of 80-30 the
past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll come back at us in their regular old offense and try
to do what they did to us to beat us the last three times, just run
the ball at us,'' McCleskey said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Chiefs took a page out of Giants Coach
Jim Fassel's game plan and ran at the team's smallish right side of
the defense. They kept going at end Simeon Rice (260 pounds) and
outside linebacker Tony McCombs (246). That opened up the passing
game, and the Cardinals put little pressure on Gannon, who
completed 21 of 28 for 231 yards. Wide receiver Derrick Alexander
had six catches for 116 yards and two scores.
</P>
<P>
   The dreadful defensive performance ruined another big day by the
offense, which threw for 250 yards and rushed for 124.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer led the Cardinals on a four-play, 80-yard drive in the
third quarter that cut the lead to 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the game wears on, we feel we can't be stopped,'' center
Aaron Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the Cardinals also couldn't stop the Chiefs,
who then went 76 yards on 11 plays to extend their lead to 14
points, the touchdown coming on a 15-yard pass from Gannon to
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' offense again wasn't going to be denied. Plummer
directed it on an 80-yard, 10-play score.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Cardinals scored twice. A 37-yard touchdown pass
from Plummer to Rob Moore with 8:33 left was wiped out when the
officials ruled that Moore landed out of bounds. Replays showed it
was a legal catch. Six plays later, Bates scored, but the Cardinals
couldn't stop the Chiefs from getting the clinching field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get them turned away coming down the stretch, and
that is very disappointing,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``Good
football teams find a way to make plays when they have to make
them. We were close to making plays but didn't make them. We had
chances to knock passes down. We had chances to get sacks, and we
didn't do either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned that we're not playing well in the second
half and shutting the door on teams.'' &QL;

WILL  JOHNSON SELECT DIAMONDBACKS TODAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It appears to be close to a photo finish between the
Diamondbacks and Anaheim Angels in the four-horse race to capture
prize free-agent left-hander Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The long wait will end at mid-morning today, when the
35-year-old Johnson announces his choice from his Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   If Diamondbacks Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo already
knew the result, he wasn't tipping his hand Sunday night. But after
speaking earlier in the day with Johnson and his two agents, Alan
Nero and Barry Meister, Colangelo said, ``I feel very upbeat, very
positive. I feel pretty confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Four clubs, including the Los Angeles Dodgers and Texas Rangers,
had offered Johnson four-year deals in the $50 million range.
</P>
<P>
   During the past week, the Dodgers were said to have the highest
offer at around $52 million, but Arizona apparently raised its ante
from $51 million to about $54 million. Combine that with the fact
that Johnson would be able to remain at home year-round, and the
Diamondbacks might have the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Diamondbacks are showing that they want to win now, and
that has made Randy's decision tougher,'' Nero told the`` Los
Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Johnson would enable Arizona to become an
immediate contender in the National League West Division. Last
week, the team signed right-handed starters Todd Stottlemyre and
Armando Reynoso and previously signed veteran left-handed middle
reliever Greg Swindell. The Diamondbacks already had a solid
pitching nucleus with right-hander Andy Benes, left-handers Brian
Anderson and Omar Daal and right-handed closer Gregg Olson.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also made a recent bold move of their own when they
signed slugging first baseman Mo Vaughn to a six-year, $80 million
deal. Shortly after signing, Vaughn contacted Johnson in a
recruiting attempt, but recent calls apparently have gone
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Angels Manager Terry Collins, Dodgers General Manager Kevin
Malone and Texas General Manager Doug Melvin remained optimistic
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson began the 1998 season with Seattle and was 9-10 before
being traded to Houston on July 31. He was 10-1 with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a career record of 143-79. He won the American
League Cy Young Award in 1995, is a five-time All-Star and has led
the AL in strikeouts four times. &QL;

TYSON NEAR HIS MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A final piece to one very strange trip could be in place later
this week when Mike Tyson's comeback bout on Jan. 16 against Frans
Botha is officially announced in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, Tyson has appeared at more hearings
than a Clinton lawyer. Psychiatrists poked, prodded and then
published their evaluation of Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder Tyson appears to be content, if not relieved, to
be at Phoenix's gritty Madison Square Garden. There's nothing
pretty about the place, but there is some hard-edged honesty in
knowing that the surroundings are ruled by a well-placed punch
instead of parliamentary procedure.
</P>
<P>
   It's anybody's guess as to whether Tyson's new-found home will
help him rebuild his life and career. He says it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful to be alive, to be here and not be in the
penitentiary'' he said last week. ``A lot of people would have died
if they had lived my life. You know what I mean? I've abused my
life, sometimes. But, right now, I'm pretty much happy.''
</P>
<P>
   You only can speculate at what all the trouble has done to
Tyson's instincts. As history's youngest heavyweight champion more
than 10 years ago, he was without a hint of self-doubt. He went
about his business in a way that was both frightening and
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   But a prison stretch, followed by the humiliation of biting
Evander Holyfield's ears and public disclosure of his psychiatric
report, are elements that have had to alter the single-minded
purpose that characterizes great fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Distractions often defeat the best ones long before the first
punch ever lands.
</P>
<P>
   At 32, this looms as Tyson's last chance at redeeming his
career. And redemption is another mark of greatness. The defining
moment can come in the ring when a fallen fighter climbs off the
canvas and wins. Or, in the larger sense, it can come in a career
that appears finished. Tyson has met his moment.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the first hurdle is Botha. He's slow. He figures to be
there when Tyson stages one of his trademark assaults. But Botha is
in no Peter McNeeley, Tyson's first foe out of prison. Botha has
faced ranked heavyweights, including former World Boxing
Association champ Michael Moorer. What's more significant about
Botha, however, is an evident lack of fear. He will fight back. A
willingness to do so was the start to Holyfield's two victories
over Tyson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dueling news conferences: Two are scheduled for Thursday in Los
Angeles. One, for Botha-Tyson, is supposed to be at the Century
Plaza Hotel. On Sunday, Don King, Tyson's ex-promoter, decided to
stage one at the Grand Olympic Auditorium to announce
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis on March 13.
</P>
<P>
   A sparring partner, Salvador Jasso, for both Oscar De La Hoya
and Ike Quartey has this to say about their welterweight clash on
Feb. 13: ``Ike will knock you out with two or three punches, but
Oscar, he's fast and turns his hands at the last second so it
hurts. Oscar surprises you and then explodes in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   A Valley card is scheduled for Dec. 8 at Midnight Rodeo, a
west-side nightclub. A possibility is a 12-rounder between Mexican
bantamweight Oscar Calzada and American Francisco Rodriquez for a
minor title.
</P>
<P>
   Home Box Office did a nice bit on Michael Carbajal Saturday
night during a telecast of Kosta Tyszu's victory over Diobelys
Hurtado. The cable network said Carbajal did more for the lightest
weight classes than anyone ever has. It's no coincidence that
attention and purses for 108-to-122-pound fighters have shrunk
since the retirement of Carbajal, whose comeback is in limbo. He
had hoped to fight in late October, but the date has been delayed
repeatedly. &QL;

REF'S CALLS NEVER SEEM TO GO IN MOORE'S FAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Once again, the replay showed Rob Moore being
victimized by a bad call on a pass play in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals receiver seemingly had sliced between Kansas City
Chiefs cornerback Dale Carter and free safety Jerome Woods for a
37-yard touchdown reception from Jake Plummer that would have cut
the Chiefs' lead to 31-24 with 8:33 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the officiating crew, standing in front of the
play, raised his arms. After a huddle with his crew, referee Larry
Nemmers ruled that Moore was out of bounds and declared the pass
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed that Moore was inbounds. The Cardinals eventually
scored on the drive, but it took an additional 2:26 to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Two games earlier, with the Cardinals rallying from a 28-0
deficit against Dallas, Moore appeared to have been interfered with
in the end zone by cornerback Kevin Smith on the game's final play.
The replay confirmed it then, too. But there was no call. Instead
of getting one play from the 1-yard line to try to send it to
overtime, the Cardinals lost, 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that Rob landed out of bounds,'' Cardinals Coach
Vince Tobin said. ``That's not what people are telling me who saw
it on the replay. Obviously, we would have liked to have had that
2{ minutes back at the end of the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to score. If it truly was a score and you get it
taken away from you, you have to expend that much more energy to
score again. It just seems to be a series of plays the past few
weeks that have been very, very close _ and most of them have gone
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who banged up a shoulder and will have it x-rayed this
morning, didn't want to join in the ref-bashing. After making seven
catches for 75 yards and a touchdown in another losing effort, he
was drained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question that I caught it
inbounds,'' Moore said. ``The first thing I did was look down at my
feet. They were in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the coach I'm not going to complain, I'll let him do
it. I don't want them (the refs) to hate me any more than they
already do.''
</P>
<P>
   Streak intact &QL;  &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have only one more chance to beat an AFC West team
this season.
</P>
<P>
   They dropped to 0-3 against the AFC West after their 10-point
loss to the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   In September, they were routed, 33-14, by Seattle and beaten,
23-20, by Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals end the regular season at home against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Streak intact II &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the victory over the Cardinals, the Chiefs extended their
winning streak over NFC teams to 10 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Their last loss to an NFC team was on Thanksgiving Day 1995 at
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Short shots &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Ronnie Anderson, activated for the second
consecutive week, had his first career reception, an 8-yard grab
late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Kwamie Lassiter, who made his first start of the season at free
safety, forced a fumble. He has four interceptions, four forced
fumbles and one fumble recovery this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs' five sacks was their most since 10 against Oakland
in the season opener.

NEDNEY'S LOSS A KICK IN CARDS' TEETH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It's fourth and 4 and the Cardinals need a
45-yard field goal for a win that puts them into the playoffs for
the first time in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to kick it?
</P>
<P>
   It won't be Joe Nedney, who helped launch their midseason
turnaround with game-winning field goals at Detroit and against
Washington. Nedney on Sunday suffered what is believed to be a
season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in
the loss to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blocked and I just got twisted up,'' Nedney said. ``My
foot was planted, I got hit and my body went the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel a snap. It was more like paper crumpling. I can
put weight on it. It doesn't feel bad. They're saying it's worse
than it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedney will have a magnetic resonance imaging performed on his
knee today to confirm the diagnosis by Cardinals orthopedist
Russell Chick.
</P>
<P>
   So who will be the Cardinals kicker?
</P>
<P>
   It could be Pete Elezovic, the former Michigan kicker who was in
Tampa Bay's preseason camp before being released.
</P>
<P>
   Or Scott Blanton, who was released by the Redskins early this
season. He owns a career-long 53-yard field goal. Or Scott Bentley,
who was in the Cardinals training camp in 1997 and also spent time
with the Braoncos and Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Or veteran Eddie Murray, 42, who has big-game experience but
clearly is on the downside of his career. Murray was on the Dallas
Cowboys' 1993 Super Bowl team and Detroit's 1991 squad that played
in the NFC championship game. His weakness is distance on kickoffs.
There isn't anyone else on the roster who could perform kickoff
duties effectively. The new kicker will have to be able to do all
the placement kicks as well as kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney's is the latest in a growing list of critical setbacks
for the team during the stretch drive. Middle linebacker Ron
McKinnon, who is having the best season of his short career with
five pass interceptions, suffered a strained right knee. It won't
be known for a few days whether he will be able to suit up Sunday
when the Cardinals try once again to beat their former offensive
coordinator, Jim Fassell, and his New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon's backup, Mark Maddox, did not suit up for the second
straight week (knee). A weakness at middle linebacker wouldn't
escape the attention of Fassell, whose club has pounded the
Cardinals three straight times.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Rob Moore will have a shoulder x-rayed this
morning. His injury is not believed to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   And then there remains the question regarding defensive tackle
Eric Swann, who is contemplating another knee surgery that would
shelve him for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney, a left-footed kicker who made a 37-yard field goal
Sunday and then missed from 50 into a swirling wind, suffered his
injury on a kickoff after his extra point with 6:07 left cut the
Chiefs' lead to 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   An offside call against the Cardinals on the play forced them to
rekick. Scott Player, their punter who kicks ``five to 10 balls a
week'' to be ready for such emergencies, got the call. He squibbed
the kickoff down the middle of the field. The Chiefs fell on it at
their 33-yard line, then drove for a touchdown that iced the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was real quick,'' Player said of the turn of events.
``That's the first time I'd ever done it in a game at any level.
But they ended up with the ball where they'd been getting it all
day. It just functioned as a squib that took them out of a big
return.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals' defense had made the stop, and if their
offense had scored to make it a one-point game, Player would have
gotten the call for the extra-point try to send it to overtime,
according to Coach Vince Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done that, either,'' Player said. ``But I think I
could have made an extra point. A field goal, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-6, the Cardinals can afford no more than one more loss in
their quest for the playoffs. Given their wild finishes in the past
five games, they well could be in a pressure-cooker, late-game
situation that calls for a field-goal, or a kickoff to pin a foe
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge loss,'' special teams coach Al Everest said. &QL;

MIXED BAG AT CORNERBACK  
 CHAVOUS INTERCEPTS PASS IN DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Cardinals' defense offered non-stop
service to yet another destination on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Corey Chavous was given his first pro start at cornerback
in hopes of shoring up a secondary that was riddled the week
before. While Chavous' third-quarter interception against the
Kansas City Chiefs stopped a threat deep in Cardinals territory, it
was the Cardinals' only defensive stop of the closing half. The
Chiefs scored on four of their first five possessions to secure a
34-24 win.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, right cornerback J.B. Brown was the fall guy
when the Cardinals let Washington score on six successive
possessions that wiped out a 31-0 lead. The Cardinals survived,
45-42, but in the wake of the scare, Brown was out. Since Tom
Knight was not ready to play on his sore hamstring, Chavous, a
second-round draft pick, was in.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous described his debut as uneven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances to make plays late in the game, but we didn't
step to the plate defensively,'' Chavous said. ``We couldn't get
the ball back. I gave up a touchdown pass in a critical situation.
Playing corner here is a lot different than playing it in college,
but when you cover Frank Sanders and Rob Moore every day in
practice, you're going to be ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``As members of the defense, we're all accountable. The last
couple of weeks, we have not done the job sustaining and finishing.
Unfortunately, we're giving up too many big plays in critical
situations. We've got to do a better job getting off the field on
third down. We had trouble stopping the run, so that made the
play-action pass available to them the whole second half. We never
did stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Chiefs' second possession of the third quarter, Chavous
ended a scoring threat when he stepped in front of wide receiver
Andre Rison and picked off Rich Gannon's pass at the Arizona 4.
Chavous fell as he tried to return the interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he could have gotten up quicker, because it looked like
he had a lot of room to run,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals, who fell to 6-6 with the loss, are going to
challenge for an NFC wild-card playoff spot, the defense has to
regain the dominance it showed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he saw enough flashes in Chavous' play to make him
believe there are good days ahead for the Vanderbilt product.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made an excellent play on that interception,'' Tobin said.
``He released under the wide receiver and made the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got beat a couple of times, but anybody is going to get
beat at that position. For his first game there, he played well.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Chavous was in position to tackle Chiefs receiver
Derrick Alexander early in the fourth quarter. Instead, Alexander
faked Chavous and ran past him for a 15-yard touchdown pass play
from Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alexander became the Chiefs' first receiver in four
years to have more than 100 yards in back-to-back games (six
catches, 116 yards, two touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   Chavous wasn't entirely at fault. For the second straight week,
Pro Bowl left corner Aeneas Williams shared in the roast on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous, a second-round draft pick, played cornerback in
college, but his duty with the Cardinals had been at safety until
he was moved last week. &QL;

GEORGIA EDGES LONGHORNS IN LAST SECONDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ These days at Texas, progress on the basketball
court is measured by the degree of a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns, off to their worst start since opening 0-6 in
1974, failed to get off a decent shot in the waning seconds last
night and fell to once-beaten Georgia, 78-77, before 6,024 fans at
the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Texas (0-4) lost at No. 11 Arizona by 16 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a great effort for Georgia to beat us tonight,'' UT
coach Rick Barnes said. ``I really feel for these guys. They're
working hard and they're starting to understand. We've gotten
better the last two weeks. It's amazing. We're going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Short-handed Texas might not turn the corner as quick as Barnes
hopes. Forward Kris Clack, who suffered through a 3-for-18 shooting
performance, scored Texas' last two baskets, but dislocated his
right shoulder during the game's final sequence and will be
examined today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clack's bad night and the fact that 7-foot sophomore
center Chris Mihm continues to struggle, Texas had the ball and a
shot at winning after Georgia guard G.G. Smith sank two free throws
for the one-point lead with 9.3 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Muoneke, who scored a game-high 23 points, threw the
inbounds pass after Smith's second free throw to point guard Ivan
Wagner. He brought the ball downcourt and passed off to Clack as
designed. But Georgia, wary of the 6-5 senior after he twice gave
the 'Horns a one-point lead in the last minute with baskets in the
paint, quickly closed with three players.
</P>
<P>
   Clack dished back to Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut backdoor and felt like I had an easy layup _ until my
\Rleft\S shoe came off,'' Wagner said. ``I lost my balance and
couldn't regain it, so I just threw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   His desperate offering never cleared the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crusher,'' said Muoneke, whose 19.7-point average leads
Texas through four games. ``I love this team's performance. We've
worked extremely hard and we're starting to see the benefits. It
takes time to get acquainted to a new system where it becomes
second nature. But no one has his head down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm left the game with 3:22 with severe leg cramps after
scoring 12 points, but eight of those came from the free-throw
line. He had five rebounds _ but seven turnovers _ and Texas
actually played better with seldom-used Marlon Drakes, who made all
four of his shots.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore center Robb Dryden led Georgia with 22 points. Smith,
son of former Bulldogs and now Kentucky coach Tubby Smith, scored
16. Muoneke's defense helped limit star sophomore forward Jumaine
Jones to three points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think Texas is about to bust out and I told our
players that before the game,'' Georgia coach Ron Jirsa said.
``They played well enough to beat us tonight.''

BEAUMONT COUPLE EYE `QUIET' TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Carl Schrontz and his wife, Laurel,
entered their first horse in the NCHA Futurity last year, they
thought they would quietly maneuver through the cutting horse show.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't happen. Their mare, Some Kinda Memories, ridden by
Mike Mowery of Millsap, won the open division title in dramatic
fashion at the National Cutting Horse Association's premier show.
</P>
<P>
   The Shrontzes, of Beaumont, may not quietly leave the 1998
Futurity. During the first go-round last night at Will Rogers
Memorial Coliseum, Mowery, turned in an above-average score of 216
aboard Ravishing Ruby, the second horse that the Schrontzes have
entered in the Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that lightning doesn't strike twice, so we want to
progress through this show quietly,'' Laurel Schrontz said.
</P>
<P>
   The 216 `quietly' will advance Mowery and Ravishing Ruby to the
second round after the first round ends tonight. The second round
is scheduled tomorrow and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be solid,'' Mowery said of his first-round
run. ``I was trying to build confidence in my mare.''
</P>
<P>
   Mowery must advance Ravishing Ruby through two more rounds in
order to gain the final _ the second round and the Dec. 12
semifinal. With that in mind, Carl Schrontz said he isn't looking
too far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just glad to get every step of the way,'' he said.
``Every step is a milestone. Every point of elimination is big to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has never owned a horse that was eliminated at the
Futurity, Schrontz said competing in the show can build character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very humbling event,'' Schrontz said of the open
division, which features 499 horses. ``If you don't believe in
humility, cutting will teach it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schrontzes said they began investing in the cutting horse
business four years ago with the intention of competing in the
Futurity. But they declined to enter the show after they could not
find a suitable horse.
</P>
<P>
   When they shopped for a horse for last year's Futurity, Mowery
recommended Some Kinda Memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It indeed was some kind of memory,'' Carl Schronz said of
winning the Futurity and watching the mare earn approximately
$185,000 during the 1997-98 season. ``We came as the underdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   With NCHA Hall of Fame member Mowery on their 1998 Futurity
horse and their name in among the list of champions, the Schrontzes
have nowhere to hide.

NICE DAY FOR A DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 DRIVE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When New England offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese sent the perfect play down from the press box, and when it
was radioed to Drew Bledsoe in the huddle, and when the words
calling that final play came out of Bledsoe's mouth, Bruce
Armstrong felt good. As good as he's felt in six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that one play, and I know it's designed to roll to the
right and get a couple of people open to the right,'' said the
Patriot tackle. ``And one of those two is Ben ... and I'm always
feeling pretty good if it's going to go anywhere near Ben, because
Ben is going to make the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm betting my paycheck on a play, Ben's the guy I'm
betting on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an exquisite call, as Bledsoe tried to pull off his
second straight Drive. The numbers on the scoreboard clock were
down to ``:00'' and all was riding on one play to transform the
drive into The Drive. Chaos was everywhere but in the New England
huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were thinking run,'' said Patriots back Robert Edwards of
the Patriots' lining up in a strong run formation with two backs,
three tight ends, and no wide receivers. ``It was a strong run
formation and I knew it was a great call, because I knew they were
thinking run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had used the same play against New Orleans, when Ben scored
there, too, and when I heard the call I knew it was a great call.
Ben was wide open in the back of the end zone in New Orleans,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very composed in that huddle, sort of just like
practice,'' said fullback Tony Carter, the other Patriot who would
roll out to the right, along with Coates, as a potential receiver.
``You could tell by looking in everybody's eyes; everybody was
ready. And it happened ... just like practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith was one of the many Bills who was thinking ``run''
and Edwards was so determined to make his run fake look good ``that
I did it almost too good because I was trying to make it look like
a run so much their guy almost got by me, the guy I was blocking,
and he slid by me and he got to Drew's feet. But Drew had gotten
rid of the ball and ... ''
</P>
<P>
   And it was floating toward a wide open Coates in the deep right
corner of the end zone, yards clear of Buffalo linebacker Marlo
Perry. As usual, the Patriots' tight end said little after the
game, little to explain how he got open, but what he said was so
typical of the way he plays.
</P>
<P>
   Was he surprised at the call?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of .... sort of,'' said Coates. ``But (Bledsoe) called
it, it worked, and now it's time for me to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Patriots were explaining, Coates was told, that the play
was designed to go to two Patriots, Carter or Coates.
</P>
<P>
   Coates raised an eyebrow and responded, ``There's only one
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was one of the few, the very few, who never saw Coates
catch that final pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew there was one guy who wasn't going to get to Drew
on that play and I was locked up pretty good with that guy (Bruce
Smith) on the play,'' said the tackle. ``But ... I heard. I heard
that roar.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates's reception was preceded by what seemed to be the
Patriots' final play of the game. A Hail Mary pass from Bledsoe
toward three Patriot receivers in the left corner of the end zone,
26 yards between the end zone and the line of scrimmage. Terry
Glenn went up for the pass, it bounced off his pads, and the game _
briefly _ seemed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what happened, except I should have had
the ball,'' said Glenn. ``It was an open shot, an open opportunity
to make the play and I should have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry made a great effort to go up for that ball and I know he
wishes it was a play he would have made,'' said Bledsoe. ``So that
we wouldn't have had to have the last play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Terry go up for the ball,'' said Armstrong, some 30
yards from the play. ``And when he went for the ball, I saw Terry
get hit, and when he got hit, the hit changed his body position. He
was ready to catch it and when he got hit, the ball ricocheted off
his pads. No, I never saw the flag; I'm just thinking, `Damn, he
should have caught the ball.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Bills owner Ralph Wilson saw the flag. Just before that pass
to Glenn, said a furious Wilson, ``I told my daughter `They're
going to throw it in the end zone and the (officials) are going to
call pass interference.' I wish I could play the stock market like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he was aware that pass interference had been called
but he was too angry at himself to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I should have had that ball,'' said the receiver.
``I was happy they called that penalty but I should have made that
play.''
</P>
<P>
   So, back-to-back plays ending back-to-back-weeks with
last-minute game-winning drives have raised appreciation of Bledsoe
in New England. And this victory with a broken finger, this one
with Doug Flutie the miracle-maker on the other side, and now it
was Bledsoe, not Flutie, who had pulled out the miracle. Just as
last week it had been Bledsoe, and not Miami's Dan Marino, who had
signed onto the signature drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without sounding arrogant, no, I haven't surprised myself the
last two weeks,'' said Bledsoe. ``This is a situation that I've
always enjoyed and always loved and I expect to win games in these
situations. And when it doesn't happen, that's when it's a shock to
me. Talk about the Pittsburgh game in the playoffs last year, when
we didn't win that game, that was a shock to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And that it came with Flutie on the opposite sideline?
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the way Doug is appreciated around here and he
deserves it. And I'm not jealous of his popularity one bit,'' said
the Patriot QB. ``He's a legend here and he deserves that but, at
the same time, I'm the quarterback of the New England Patriots and
people who come to these games hopefully will cheer for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this could have happened without yet another
Shawn Jefferson fourth-down catch, this time it was unclear whether
Jefferson (a) actually had caught the pass inbounds on the right
sideline and (b) whether he had traveled far enough for a first
down. Flutie said several Bills heard the officials on the sideline
say, ``Just give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But, now, after back-to-back winning drives, nothing may have to
be given to Bledsoe in the final moments of games that have to be
won. If a new aura surrounds him, he has earned it.

   Kervokian Makes a Legal Point of Assisted Suicide  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man known as Dr. Death got what he wanted: a murder charge,
a legal showdown and perhaps another national debate on assisted
suicide and euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian was accused in Pontiac, Mich., of several
charges _ murder, criminal assistance to a suicide and delivery of
a controlled substance _ after he gave a lethal injection to Thomas
Youk, 52, who had a fatal neurological condition. The videotaped
death was broadcast last Sunday on CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Michigan juries have refused to convict Kevorkian. With no
state laws setting out the hows and whys of assisted suicide, a
fifth jury will decide if killing a person who wants to die is
murder.
</P>
<P>

world. And now, for some reason that would no doubt be clear only
if explained in French, they have given chapter and verse for what,
in fact, seem to be less than meticulous habits.
</P>

   A sampling (if you really want to know): Only 47 percent bathe
daily, just 60 percent of Frenchmen change their underwear daily
(women, no doubt, indignantly refused to answer), and just 60
percent wash their hands after using the bathroom (Germans, by the
way, buy more than twice as much hand soap as the French).

<P>
   That last point prompted one television personality to suggest
that if you run into the boss outside the office restroom, it would

   Kervokian Makes a Legal Point of Assisted Suicide  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man known as Dr. Death got what he wanted: a murder charge,
a legal showdown and perhaps another national debate on assisted
suicide and euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian was accused in Pontiac, Mich., of several
charges _ murder, criminal assistance to a suicide and delivery of
a controlled substance _ after he gave a lethal injection to Thomas
Youk, 52, who had a fatal neurological condition. The videotaped
death was broadcast last Sunday on CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Michigan juries have refused to convict Kevorkian. With no
state laws setting out the hows and whys of assisted suicide, a
fifth jury will decide if killing a person who wants to die is
murder.
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, Kevorkian says he will die a martyr's death
by going on a hunger strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, got
ready for a trip to Europe last week, he sent an advance party to
Belgium, his first stop, to seek assurances that there would be no
nasty surprises waiting _ an arrest warrant, for example. Kabila,
who seized power in a long march to Kinshasa in 1997 and who has
resisted all international efforts to investigate how many lives
may have been lost in massacres along the way, is now living in the
post-Pinochet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremble, tyrants!'' was the editorial message the Paris
newspaper Liberation sent to a list of dictators after a panel from
Britain's House of Lords, the country's highest legal authority,
ruled Wednesday that former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was
not entitled to immunity from arrest under a British law protecting
former heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83, was in Britain for back surgery when a Spanish
judge asked for his arrest on charges of mass murder and terrorism.
A democratic Chilean government, which argues that it has put the
Pinochet years behind it, is appealing. British Home Secretary Jack
Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to turn the general over.
</P>
<P>
   But however the case is finally resolved, the arrest of Pinochet
and the Lords' ruling upholding it may have opened a new era in the
practice of international human rights law. ``It is a decision
without precedent,'' said El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper. ``The
basis is beginning to be set for what can and should be justice
without borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision falls into what had been almost a legal vacuum,
making it all the more interesting to human rights specialists.
International norms have been laid down broadly in human rights
conventions, but there have been no universally agreed definitions
and procedures. In the case of Cambodia's Pol Pot, for example,
there is no unanimity that he could have been prosecuted for
genocide, though there is wide agreement that a charge of crimes
against humanity would stand up.
</P>
<P>
   What is important in the Pinochet precedent, said Jose Miguel
Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch,
is that a high court has ruled that crimes like extrajudicial
executions and torture ``do not qualify as legitimate acts of a
head of state,'' and therefore did not qualify for the immunity
extended to foreign government leaders in Britain. Vivanco said
that whether Pinochet is ultimately extradited or not, this case
has established a principle.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights,
hailed the ruling as one to ``hearten human rights defenders around
the world.'' No longer can generals and other authoritarians who,
having spent years persecuting real and imagined enemies, fly off
with complete assurance of immunity to Europe or the United States
for shopping or medical treatment. A medical emergency was the
reason given for allowing Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi to enter the
United States after he was overthrown in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement abroad, even when part of a political settlement that
rids a country of a dictator, may become more problematical for
those driven out of their pillaged countries. Among retired
dictators now living remarkably well somewhere else are Idi Amin of
Uganda (in Saudi Arabia) and Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier of
Haiti (in France). Last week a right-wing French politician,
criticizing the Pinochet decision, said that half the heads of
state heading for a French-African summit in Paris this weekend
``could end up in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some sleeper cases waiting to be heard. What if people
in East Timor, whose independence drive has been brutally repressed

waiting for the chance to hold India's Congress Party leaders
responsible for the massacres of several thousand Sikhs in New

More people died in that pogrom, Sikh leaders have been saying,
than all those killed in Chile in 17 years under Pinochet.

Criminal Court, a permanent body on call to deal with rogue leaders
in a systematic way so that a mastermind of death like the late Pol
Pot would not pose a jurisdictional problem if caught.

   Along with half a dozen other nations including Iraq and Libya,
the Americans voted against setting up the new court. The Clinton
administration, especially the Pentagon, feared that there were not
enough safeguards to prevent U.S. soldiers from being brought to
trial for acts committed in the line of duty abroad. A
Republican-led Congress would go farther, saying that no American
should even be subject to international legal proceedings. Suppose
Cambodians decided to indict Henry Kissinger on charges of ordering
the bombing of their country during the Vietnam War? Chances are
the United States would be quick to take a line of defense not
unlike Chile's, saying that history has rendered its judgment on
that war, people on the whole do not get tried for policies and
U.S. courts have dealt with those individuals who had committed
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. leaders have long been skittish about international courts
and covenants, and apprehensive that foreign political agendas
would run wild in international forums. The United States routinely
refuses to recognize decisions of the International Court of
Justice, which was set up to adjudicate among nations, not to try
individuals. That tribunal, known as the World Court, has been
used, government officials say, to score policy points such as
opposition to a U.S. embargo on Nicaragua during the Sandinista
years, or in favor of the outlawing of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Strong campaigns in the Third World against international
corporations, big banks and other symbols of Western-style
capitalism have already led to mock trials. Countries shaky on due
process have been minefields for years.
</P>
<P>
   In international human rights bodies, including the U.N. Human
Rights Commission and the General Assembly when it sits as a human
rights committee, the United States has been regularly attacked by
developing nations determined to prove Americans no better than
other nations in rights protection. U.S. officials call it a policy
of moral equivalency employed to deflect attention from abuses or
constraints on human liberty in countries as diverse as Cuba, Kenya
or Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Clinton administration has welcomed
international human rights investigators, hoping that openness will
dispel some criticism and demonstrate a willingness to deal with
problems that arise in law enforcement and the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture has sometimes backfired, however, as human rights
monitors _ often using American newspaper clippings _ portray
admitted shortcomings as gross violations of international human
right covenants, often phrasing the accusations in the language of
the covenants.
</P>
<P>
   A series of U.N. monitors and Amnesty International, based in
London, have issued tough reports on the United States in the last
year or two. Amnesty, using the code words for major offenders,
found ``a persistent and widespread pattern of violations.'' Across
the country, its report concluded, ``thousands of people are
subjected to sustained and deliberate brutality'' by police forces
and the federal government has to take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans fear an indictment one day of a U.S. president in a
foreign court, such fears are misplaced, said Vivanco of Human
Rights Watch, who noted how silent the Clinton administration was
when the Pinochet verdict was delivered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such exceptional cases, Vivanco said, are reserved for
perpetrators of war crimes or crimes against humanity who have not
been judged by their own courts. In those cases there is no normal
redress, as Spanish lawyers argued. ``At the domestic level, there
was no chance whatsoever to punish him,'' Vivanco said.

DICTATORS (AND SOME LAWYERS) TREMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, got
ready for a trip to Europe last week, he sent an advance party to
Belgium, his first stop, to seek assurances that there would be no
nasty surprises waiting _ an arrest warrant, for example. Kabila,
who seized power in a long march to Kinshasa in 1997 and who has
resisted all international efforts to investigate how many lives
may have been lost in massacres along the way, is now living in the
post-Pinochet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremble, tyrants!'' was the editorial message the Paris
newspaper Liberation sent to a list of dictators after a panel from
Britain's House of Lords, the country's highest legal authority,
ruled Wednesday that former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was
not entitled to immunity from arrest under a British law protecting
former heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83, was in Britain for back surgery when a Spanish
judge asked for his arrest on charges of mass murder and terrorism.
A democratic Chilean government, which argues that it has put the
Pinochet years behind it, is appealing. British Home Secretary Jack
Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to turn the general over.
</P>
<P>
   But however the case is finally resolved, the arrest of Pinochet
and the Lords' ruling upholding it may have opened a new era in the
practice of international human rights law. ``It is a decision
without precedent,'' said El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper. ``The
basis is beginning to be set for what can and should be justice
without borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision falls into what had been almost a legal vacuum,
making it all the more interesting to human rights specialists.
International norms have been laid down broadly in human rights
conventions, but there have been no universally agreed definitions
and procedures. In the case of Cambodia's Pol Pot, for example,
there is no unanimity that he could have been prosecuted for
genocide, though there is wide agreement that a charge of crimes
against humanity would stand up.
</P>
<P>
   What is important in the Pinochet precedent, said Jose Miguel
Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch,
is that a high court has ruled that crimes like extrajudicial
executions and torture ``do not qualify as legitimate acts of a
head of state,'' and therefore did not qualify for the immunity
extended to foreign government leaders in Britain. Vivanco said
that whether Pinochet is ultimately extradited or not, this case
has established a principle.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights,
hailed the ruling as one to ``hearten human rights defenders around
the world.'' No longer can generals and other authoritarians who,
having spent years persecuting real and imagined enemies, fly off
with complete assurance of immunity to Europe or the United States
for shopping or medical treatment. A medical emergency was the
reason given for allowing Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi to enter the
United States after he was overthrown in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement abroad, even when part of a political settlement that
rids a country of a dictator, may become more problematical for
those driven out of their pillaged countries. Among retired
dictators now living remarkably well somewhere else are Idi Amin of
Uganda (in Saudi Arabia) and Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier of
Haiti (in France). Last week a right-wing French politician,
criticizing the Pinochet decision, said that half the heads of
state heading for a French-African summit in Paris this weekend
``could end up in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some sleeper cases waiting to be heard. What if people
in East Timor, whose independence drive has been brutally repressed
by Indonesia, try to nail President Suharto next time he travels
abroad _ if the Indonesians ever let their ousted dictator travel.
</P>
<P>
   And Sikhs in Britain, Canada and the United States have been
waiting for the chance to hold India's Congress Party leaders
responsible for the massacres of several thousand Sikhs in New
Delhi and other cities in a few days following the 1984

 SMOKESCREEN: THE IFs AND BUTs OF THE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT  
(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's $206 billion settlement between the tobacco industry
and 46 states is supposed to put Big Tobacco on the run. The
agreement requires cigarette makers to compensate states for the
medical costs of treating smoking-related diseases. It's been
hailed as a triumph of the public interest over special interests.
But a closer look at the hard economics behind the agreement
reveals something quite different.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, economists and legal experts who have studied the
deal say, isn't that the damages won by the states are too small,
as leaders of the anti-smoking lobby complain.
</P>
<P>
   It's that 99 percent of the total settlement is really a
disguised tax hike.
</P>
<P>
   Taxing cigarettes more heavily may or may not be a good idea,
the critics say, but labeling as ``damages'' what is effectively a
sales tax is misleading and will create a boondoggle for trial
lawyers and a windfall for the smaller tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the Big Four tobacco producers will wind up
paying direct damages of at most 1 percent of the settlement total,
or $2.4 billion. That amount, calculated as a proportion of the
companies' current market value, is to be paid regardless of how
many packs of cigarettes they sell in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the $206 billion will be paid by smokers: Cigarette
prices are expected to climb by an average of about 35 cents a
pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people can disagree whether increasing the
cigarette tax is a good or bad idea,'' said Jeremy Bulow, the
incoming chief economist of the Federal Trade Commission. ``But the
reason that the attorneys general don't want to call it a tax is so
they can claim a political victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, investors thought the deal was worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 20, the day the attorneys general announced the
settlement, the stock of the leading tobacco companies soared.
Investors chose to disbelieve that an industry with profits of $5
billion a year would be paying $8 billion a year in damages for the
next 25 years. Instead, the investors gave credence to stock
analysts who believe that the profits of tobacco companies will
decline by a maximum of 10 percent. And cigarette producers wasted
no time in raising prices _ a day after the settlement was signed
on Monday, two major companies raised prices 45 cents a pack.
</P>
<P>
   The higher prices represent what is essentially an old-fashioned
sales tax, the very kind of tax that the Republican Congress shot
down a few months back as ``big government.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it a tax? The fact that the amount paid is to rise
and fall with the number of cigarette packs sold.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sales taxes, it is borne primarily by the consumer.
``Every single cigarette tax ever passed has been paid fully by the
consumer,'' said John Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and a former deputy Treasury secretary.
``There's no reason to think this will be any different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck . . .,'' Gruber
added. ``It's a tax because it's a set of payments made by tobacco
companies that depend on how many packs they sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most economists think it makes sense to use taxes to have
the price of cigarettes reflect their true social cost, though
some, like Bulow, have reservations because the taxes fall heavily
on the poor. And as tobacco companies have known for years, the
evidence is compelling that raising prices leads some smokers to
cut back and deters teen-agers from picking up the habit.
</P>
<P>
   But by disguising a de facto sales tax as damages, the critics
maintain, the states have agreed to a deal with unintended
consequences that are just hinted at in the joint news release
describing the 100-page settlement. By calling taxes damages, the
critics say, the states wound up agreeing to provisions that
Congress would never dream of if it passed a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, economists cite the huge contingency fees that the
200 or so trial lawyers who helped produce the agreement will
collect. Under the deal, the lawyers will divide $1.25 billion
initially and about $500 million a year thereafter. That's an $8
billion payout, or 20 times the biggest contingency fee ever paid,
the $400 million collected by a lawyer in the 1985 Texaco-Pennzoil
case.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber calls the legal fees ``huge, gross and disgusting.''
Bulow estimates that had the fees been calculated only on the basis
of actual damages, each lawyer would receive an average of about $1
million apiece, versus the $40 million apiece that the lawyers will
actually collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``By calling the settlement `damages' it makes it seem
reasonable to pay the lawyers a lot,'' said Paul Klemperer, an
economist at Oxford University. ``If you called it taxes, you
wouldn't expect to give lawyers a fraction of the tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers maintain they are being paid fairly for taking a
huge gamble. But for one thing, some states hadn't even got around
to filing suits against the tobacco companies, so the lawyers in
those states haven't done much of anything yet. And those lawyers
who have put in time did most of their work in the past year _
after it became clear that a broad settlement was a near-certain
bet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A second consequence of calling taxes damages is that the deal,
far from inflicting pain on all cigarette producers, actually
enriches a few of them. Take Liggett &AMP; Myers, which until recently
was valued at about $120 million and which hadn't turned a profit
in several years. Under the deal, Liggett will actually collect an
annual subsidy of about $100 million, courtesy of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how. A tax hike applies to all cigarette producers, big
and small, current and future. But the states can only collect
damages from the companies they are suing: in this case, the Big
Four: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco and
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But by limiting damages to the largest companies, the states
would be handing smaller tobacco producers like Liggett a cost
advantage of 35 cents a pack, since the Big Four would have to
raise their prices, while the little guys would not. Given that it
costs just 20 cents to manufacture a pack of cigarettes, that's a
huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   How did the states solve the problem? In effect, they told the
small companies that if they agreed to be ``taxed'' they would be
allowed _ up to a limit higher than their current sales _ to keep
the revenue they collected instead of turning them in to the
states. Thus, Liggett can match the higher prices charged by the
Big Four companies but doesn't have to hand over any of the extra
income except in the unlikely event that its sales exceed 400
million packs, or 125 percent of its current sales.
</P>
<P>
   Even assuming that Liggett loses some sales when it raises its
prices, Klemperer said, the subsidy it will collect still amounts
to $100 million a year, an amount equal to its recent market value.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Liggett gained even more from the tobacco agreement.
Because of agreements reached earlier with some states, Liggett
wasn't as vulnerable as the other companies to states' threats to
pass punitive legislation if it failed to climb aboard. To induce
Liggett to sign on, Philip Morris, eager to dispel the threat of a
firm that could potentially produce cigarettes at a 35-cent cost
advantage, paid three times the value of the entire company for 3
of Liggett's 14 brands. The contract stipulated that Philip Morris
would pay Liggett $150 million even if the Federal Trade Commission
shoots down the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Ayres, a professor at the Yale Law School, is among those
worried about the precedent set by the settlement. ``It's scary.''
he said.

SQUARING OFF, AT LAST, ON SOCIAL SECURITY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since it was created in 1935, Social Security has
been the centerpiece of the nation's social contract, an
intergenerational commitment to provide at least a subsistence
income to the most vulnerable of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment appears as solid as ever. But with Social
Security facing long-term financial problems, the means of making
good on it are now under serious debate for the first time since
Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed what would become the most enduring
of New Deal legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months after President Clinton said that shoring up the
system should become the nation's top domestic priority, he and
congressional leaders will begin examining the options in earnest
and probing for common ground at a two-day White House conference
in December, kicking off a process that could as easily end in
partisan gridlock as in the historic achievement both parties are
hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Should the country stick with the system it has used for 63
years and continue to levy taxes on current workers and their
employers to pay current retirees? Or, as the time draws near for
the vast baby boom generation to move onto Social Security, should
the nation shift to a system under which individuals would invest a
portion of their payroll taxes in private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that turns to some extent on the complexities of
actuarial tables, benefit formulas and other arcana. But in a
broader sense it encapsulates fundamental tradeoffs: between
individual and collective responsibility, market forces and
government, and maximizing rewards and minimizing risks. Indeed,
few issues have such a rich ideological backdrop or high political
stakes, a fact that promises to make the debate over Social
Security's future particularly contentious.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is rooted in inexorable demographic change. Because
there will be fewer workers paying taxes relative to the number of
retirees drawing benefits once the 76 million baby boomers leave
the workforce in coming decades, Social Security will take in only
enough revenue to pay 75 percent of its obligations starting around
2032.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach a solution are being framed in part by how the
world has changed since 1935. Life expectancy is shooting up, so
most people will spend far longer in retirement than anyone
envisioned six decades ago. Investing, long the province of the
elite, is now a routine part of middle-class life. Faith in
market-based capitalism, which probably hit a nadir around the time
of Social Security's creation, has long been on the rise, tested
though it has been by the recent bout of global financial turmoil.
At the same time, trust that government can deal with the big
issues has eroded since Vietnam and Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   To conservatives, such changes are a call to put more
responsibility in the hands of individuals and an opportunity to
put the power of the markets to work for everyone through private
Social Security accounts. If in the process the country scales back
the biggest of all government social programs, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the reasons the debate has been so fierce,'' said
Michael Tanner, the director of health and welfare studies at the
libertarian Cato Institute. ``There's a recognition, particularly
on the part of the left, that Social Security and Medicare are the
last programmatic links between the average citizen and the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   To liberals, though, the changes that have taken place do not
undermine the case for a collective approach to income security for
the elderly and other beneficiaries of Social Security, including
disabled workers and those left behind when a breadwinner dies.
</P>
<P>
   Most individuals, said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, do not do a very good job of planning for
distant or unlikely events like retirement or disability. Moreover,
he said, since many people are already exposed to the risks of big
stock market swings through 401(k) programs and Individual
Retirement Accounts, there is good reason to maintain Social
Security as a guaranteed benefit in which any investment or
economic risks _ as well as administrative costs _ are spread
across the generations and income levels. The wild gyrations in the
stock market this year underscore the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons that led the nation to adopt social insurance are
about as strong now as they ever were,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   There is some common ground. Many, though not all, Democrats
support looking to the returns available on Wall Street to help
plug the hole, just as Republicans do. But rather than resort to
the wholesale shift into private accounts advocated by Republicans,
many Democrats want the investing to be done by the government
itself, using the surplus that will build up for the next 15 years
as payroll tax receipts exceed what the system pays out in
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly every facet of any plan is likely to have as many
opponents as supporters. Increasing the retirement age to, say, 70,
would go a long way toward restoring the system's health, but is
vehemently opposed by organized labor. Eliminating or substantially
raising the cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax _ currently
$68,400 _ would solve much of the problem, but would amount to a
big tax increase on middle-and upper-income people.
</P>
<P>
   So it remains unclear whether it will be politically feasible to
piece together a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing understanding that this is a big issue out
there,'' said Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel, ``but I
must say I have yet to see any kind of consensus emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Success will depend to some extent on political calculations by
both parties. Congressional Democrats will have to decide whether
to compromise now or delay in the hope that they might regain
control of the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will have to decide whether to make a deal so they
can turn attention to what they see as a more potent issue, tax
cuts. And Clinton, more eager than ever after his travails this
year to leave a positive legacy, will have to decide whether to
take a bold stand or work behind the scenes to cobble together a
one-from-column-A, one-from-column-B solution.
</P>
<P>
   With more than three decades to go before the problem hits,
there would not appear to be much urgency. But economists say that
every year that goes by will make any solution more expensive to
taxpayers and beneficiaries alike. Perhaps more important, the
political and economic climate is as favorable now as it is likely
to be for years: a second-term president who does not have to worry
about re-election, a big federal budget surplus and a baby boom
generation that has a stake in keeping the system healthy for
another half century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reach a consensus on needed changes,'' said Michael
Boskin, who was the Bush administration's chief economist, ``adopt
them now and phase them in gradually before the demographic
transition overwhelms us economically and politically.''

 UNDATED: certain bet.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A second consequence of calling taxes damages is that the deal,
far from inflicting pain on all cigarette producers, actually
enriches a few of them. Take Liggett &AMP; Myers, which until recently
was valued at about $120 million and which hadn't turned a profit
in several years. Under the deal, Liggett will actually collect an
annual subsidy of about $100 million, courtesy of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how. A tax hike applies to all cigarette producers, big
and small, current and future. But the states can only collect
damages from the companies they are suing: in this case, the Big
Four: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco and
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But by limiting damages to the largest companies, the states
would be handing smaller tobacco producers like Liggett a cost
advantage of 35 cents a pack, since the Big Four would have to
raise their prices, while the little guys would not. Given that it
costs just 20 cents to manufacture a pack of cigarettes, that's a
huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   How did the states solve the problem? In effect, they told the
small companies that if they agreed to be ``taxed'' they would be
allowed _ up to a limit higher than their current sales _ to keep
the revenue they collected instead of turning them in to the
states. Thus, Liggett can match the higher prices charged by the
Big Four companies but doesn't have to hand over any of the extra
income except in the unlikely event that its sales exceed 400
million packs, or 125 percent of its current sales.
</P>
<P>
   Even assuming that Liggett loses some sales when it raises its
prices, Klemperer said, the subsidy it will collect still amounts
to $100 million a year, an amount equal to its recent market value.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Liggett gained even more from the tobacco agreement.
Because of agreements reached earlier with some states, Liggett
wasn't as vulnerable as the other companies to states' threats to
pass punitive legislation if it failed to climb aboard. To induce
Liggett to sign on, Philip Morris, eager to dispel the threat of a
firm that could potentially produce cigarettes at a 35-cent cost
advantage, paid three times the value of the entire company for 3
of Liggett's 14 brands. The contract stipulated that Philip Morris
would pay Liggett $150 million even if the Federal Trade Commission
shoots down the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Ayres, a professor at the Yale Law School, is among those
worried about the precedent set by the settlement. ``It's scary.''
he said.

   WASHINGTON _ Once upon a time, 1998 was going to be the year of
the electric car. In 1990 California announced that 2 percent of
the automobiles sold in the state by major manufacturers in 1998
would have to be nonpolluting. New York and Massachusetts soon
followed suit. The electric car was hailed as the route to clean
air and the antidote to dependence on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today the electric car seems an idea whose time has been put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the year it was all going to happen,'' said Nancy
Hazard, of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, a
nonprofit advocacy group in Greenfield, Mass. ``Obviously it is not
unfolding as they anticipated it to unfold.'' As the last of the
1998 models leave dealers' lots, very few of them are running on
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind electric car improves yearly, but the cars
themselves fail to attract buyers. Experts say the reason is they
are not as flexible as gasoline cars, so consumers are not lining
up, and policy makers have become reconciled to gasoline as engines
have become cleaner and oil cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hazard and others are still enthusiastic about the
electric vehicle because technology has created a gasoline-electric
car, with potentially huge implications for energy use and
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The nomenclature has changed, too. Specialists once called
electric vehicles EVs, but they now call them battery electric
vehicles, or BEVs, to distinguish them from hybrid HEVs, which use
internal combustion engines to charge the batteries and electric
motors to turn the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Before this hybrid appeared, something quite unexpected happened
to the old internal combustion engine. The century-old automotive
technology, thought by many experts to have reached its limits,
adapted.
</P>
<P>
   California, when it first called for the electric car in 1990,
also set standards for cleanliness in regular cars; the most
stringent was the ``ultra-low emission vehicle,'' or ULEV. But the
state, the toughest in the nation when it came to the environment,
underestimated the capacity of auto makers to respond. Toyota has
plans for a gasoline car that is four times cleaner than the ULEV;
Honda plans one that is 10 times cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   This new car, the ``super ultra low emission vehicle,'' quickly
acquired its inevitable acronym: SULEV. ``California ran out of
superlatives, so they had to start compounding them,'' said David
Hermance, general manager in charge of engines at the Toyota
Technical Center USA Inc., in Gardena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   California recently enabled auto makers to meet their LEV quotas
with SULEVs instead. Of course, the nonpolluting electric car does
not emit pollutants itself, but that doesn't mean it doesn't
contribute to fouling the environment; somewhere out there is a
plant producing power for charging batteries. California's electric
power system, though, is very clean, and pollution for charging
batteries is much lower than for the ULEV. With the introduction of
the SULEV, the difference grows smaller; the cost is modest.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in Japan, Toyota introduced a hybrid car called the
Prius, which cost about 10 percent more than a Corolla and is the
same size. Its factories, which make 2,000 cars a month, cannot
keep up with demand. In 2000 the Prius will be sold in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius, which does not idle, has a gas engine to charge its
batteries or power its wheels. The result is low emissions and fuel
economy of 66 miles a gallon. Today every other major car company
has a hybrid on the drawing boards or in research, generally with
an internal-combustion engine as an auxiliary power unit.
</P>
<P>
   And oil is a tough competitor. The Energy Information
Administration, the government's main energy forecasting group,
pointed out last week that oil costs $7 a barrel less than it did a
year ago. Because of the Asian economic meltdown, prices are not
expected to rise to pre-crisis levels until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The shift away from battery electric cars is disappointing to
purists and some engineers, partly because the vehicles can get
their energy from ``clean'' sources like the sun as well as from
coal, natural gas or oil. But efficiency alone is not enough to
sell products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, mass production of the hybrid means further improvements
in electric engines, paving the way for a pure electric car if
better batteries become available. In the meantime, Ms. Hazard
said, ``more and more, consumers are seeking information on
environmentally friendly automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the auto companies can produce a vehicle which meets their
driving needs, they will make that green choice,'' she said.

   The shift away from battery electric cars is disappointing to
purists and some engineers, partly because the vehicles can get
their energy from ``clean'' sources like the sun as well as from
coal, natural gas or oil. But efficiency alone is not enough to
sell products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, mass production of the hybrid means further improvements
in electric engines, paving the way for a pure electric car if
better batteries become available. In the meantime, Ms. Hazard
said, ``more and more, consumers are seeking information on
environmentally friendly automobiles.

<P>
   ``If the auto companies can produce a vehicle which meets their
driving needs, they will make that green choice,'' she said.

<P>
   Let's all share a sardonic chuckle over this cosmic paradox: At
the height of its global ascendancy, supposedly optimistic and
youth-obsessed America is now also increasingly fixated on death.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery: As the population ages, intimations of
mortality are focusing minds. This _ at the end of the millennium
no less _ helps to explain not just the vogue for mysticism and
attendant claptrap, but also why the folks at ``60 Minutes'' last
week figured that showing a mercy killing by Dr. Jack Kevorkian
after Sunday dinner would be good for ratings (followed by the
soothing otherworldly series ``Touched by an Angel'').
</P>
<P>
   America's No. 1 heartthrob, Brad Pitt, has been cast as the Grim
Reaper in ``Meet Joe Black.'' And Robin Williams, arguably the
country's funniest person, plays a serious dead guy who rescues his
dead wife from hell in the New Age tear-jerker ``What Dreams May
Come.'' The films may be bombs, but they affirm that Hollywood,
ever fond of bloody murder, is adjusting its mortal mix to try and
cash in on the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the fixation on mortality means a lot of trees have to die
too. And not just because of best-sellers like ``Tuesdays With
Morrie'' (Doubleday, 1997) by Mitch Ablom, about a sportswriter's
visits with his dying mentor; ``How We Die'' (Knopf, 1993) by
Sherwin B. Nuland, or the books of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, champion
of the hospice movement.
</P>
<P>
   When a subject is hot _ actually, cold, in this case _ the
publishing industry stands ready to serve it up for different
audiences. Here is a sampling from dozens of recent books on death
and bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 1: ``Living With the End in Mind: A Practical
Checklist for Living Life to the Fullest by Embracing Your
Mortality'' (Three Rivers Press, 1998) by Erin Tierney Kramp and
Douglas H. Kramp, with Emily P. McKhann.
</P>
<P>
   The gist, from the cover blurb: A life-affirming look at
preparing yourself and your loved ones for the inevitable. . . .
The inspiring couple who have co-authored this book have already
garnered widespread media coverage, from ``20/20'' to ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Sample Bit of Advice:
</P>
<P>
   Casually drive through the cemetery of your choice with your
children or grandchildren so it is familiar.
</P>
<P>
   We took our daughter to the cemetery on a beautiful, spring day
to talk about the burial process. A burial was taking place nearby,
and we pointed out the different stages of funerals. We said,
``Look, someone already went to heaven, and now they are burying
the body. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 2: ``The True Work of Dying: A Practical and
Compassionate Guide to Easing the Dying Process'' (Avon, 1997) by
Jan Selliken Bernard and Miriam Schnieder.
</P>
<P>
   The gist, from the cover blurb: This groundbreaking, holistic
guide presents rare insights and reassuring practical advice on how
to navigate the final weeks before death.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting coinage: Home deathing.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Just as a little bit of home has been brought to the
birthing room, we believe medical institutions and families should
make the same effort to bring ``home'' to the ``deathing room,''
wherever it may be.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 3: ``Then an Angel Came: A Family's Inspiring True
Story of Loss and Renewal'' (Kensington, 1997) by Carol Gino.
</P>
<P>
   The gist: An ``unforgettable true story'' (cover blurb) about a
grieving family saved by an angel _ a very large angel _ after an
infant's death.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing description of angel: ``I mean, she wasn't only big,
she was magnificent. Skyscrapers are big, but mountains have
something extra. Well, this angel was like the Himalayas, she was
like the Grand Canyon, she was like . . .''
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 4:``How Different Religions View Death and
Afterlife'' (2d edition, The Charles Press, 1998), edited by
Christopher Jay Johnson, Ph.D., and Marsha G. McGee, Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   The gist, from the cover blurb: The teaching and death beliefs
of the largest and fastest-growing religions in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling question answered: ``Is There a Hell and, if So, What
Is It Like?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the book's answers, by religion:
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholics: Hell designates a condition of self-chosen,
permanent alienation from God, who bestows all blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Jews: The assumption is that God's caring nature rules out a
sadistic punishment. The nature of hell is a mystery left alone by
the Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists: Most Southern Baptists believe in a place of
punishment as it is described in the Bible, characterized by outer
darkness, fire, torment and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhists: There are eight hot and cold hells, each associated
with a particular type of suffering. These tortures are described
in detail in order to develop compassion for the beings there as
well as to create an incentive not to engage in the types of
nonvirtuous behavior that will cause one to end up there.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims: Hell is described as a fire having seven levels. The
lowest crackles and roars with fierce boiling water, scorching wind
and wailing, wretched souls.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 5: ``What Happens When You Die, From Your Last Breath
to the First Spadeful'' (Citadel Press, 1995) by Robert T. Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The gist: Your handy guide to embalming and cremation, with
alternatives ``including mummification _ and much more'' (cover
blurb).
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling information: The book summarizes the major forms of
bodily decay, including dessication:
</P>
<P>
   Dessication: The drying of certain parts, such as the cornea of
the eye, is usually a sure indication of death. As the fluids sink
to the back of the eye, the cornea dries out, glazes over and
becomes wrinkled. This dryness may also be observed over abrasions
or wounds. The lips also become hard and reddish black in color.

JANET RENO, JOB SECURITY AND THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than any other attorney general, Janet Reno
has been bedeviled by the independent counsel law. In just five
years, she has ordered the appointment of seven independent
prosecutors and turned down requests for a number of others, and is
now considering two more investigations of Clinton administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Her decisions have, in turn, infuriated both the White House and
its Republican critics, and her tenure at the Justice Department
has been largely defined by how she has used _ or, to some, misused
_ the law.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to being a constant source of political trouble
for Reno, the statute, enacted after Watergate to keep politics out
of high-level corruption cases, has probably helped Reno keep her
job, which she might have lost long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Following President Clinton's re-election in 1996, there was a
push by administration officials to get rid of her; they felt stung
by her quickness to appoint independent prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the polarized arena of independent counsel politics, each
time either the Democrats or the Republicans seem ready to take aim
at Reno, they draw back, fearing a backlash against what could look
like attacks on the political independence of a popular attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, with White House officials barely concealing their
relief, Reno took the political heat again by refusing to seek an
independent prosecutor to examine Vice President Al Gore's campaign
finance activities. Reno's job once again seemed secure. There is
no longer any backstairs gossip that Clinton wants to dump her.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Republicans had little realistic hope of doing
anything about their frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., demanded Judiciary Committee hearings
into her reluctance to pursue investigations of campaign financing,
but there seemed little desire among his colleagues to summon Reno
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dynamics could shift again, and soon. Monday she
must decide whether an outside prosecutor should investigate
whether former White House deputy chief of staff Harold M. Ickes
lied to Congress about his dealings with the Teamsters Union, whose
financial support the Democrats were seeking in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And next week she must decide whether to pursue allegations that
Clinton and his aides illegally evaded federal election laws when
they spent millions of dollars of Democratic Party funds on
political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department aides insist that Reno is unconcerned about
the impact of her decisions on her own job or political standing.
They said she has neutrally exercised the law, unmotivated by
politics, and has consistently applied an unwieldy federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   But as her Republican critics, like Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah,
the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have pointed out,
she has blocked for more than two years any appointment of an
independent prosecutor to investigate campaign finance cases. She
has refused to seek an independent counsel even though FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former head of her campaign
finance team, strongly recommended that she send the case to an
outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Should Reno decide to go forward with an independent prosecutor
in either the Ickes or the Clinton campaign advertising matters, it
will be the Clinton administration's turn to be upset. During
Clinton's first term, Reno's apparent eagerness to refer cases to
independent prosecutors made her a serious irritant to the White
House, where officials never made a secret of their differences
with Reno. They routinely dismissed her as a cranky loner.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the complaints, however, was a more substantive issue.
She had sought a string of independent counsel inquiries into
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros; Ron Brown, the commerce secretary who died in a
plane crash in Croatia in 1996, and even a little known official,
Eli Segal, who headed the AmeriCorps national service program.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was White House officials themselves who had asked
Reno to bring in an outside prosecutor to investigate Whitewater.
Reno obediently named a respected New York lawyer, Robert Fiske, to
conduct the inquiry. The case was later taken over by Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides soon expressed exasperation when Reno
repeatedly expanded the scope of Starr's investigation into matters
like the mishandling of personnel files at the White House, the
abrupt dismissal of employees of the White House travel office and
the truthfulness of statements made at a congressional hearing by
Bernard Nussbaum, the former White House counsel and ally of
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when Clinton won re-election Reno appeared to be in
trouble. For weeks he left her in limbo about whether he would keep
her on the job at the Justice Department, passing up opportunities
to state clearly that she had his support. White House aides said
privately that Clinton's advisers wanted to ease her out of the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Clinton's aides said they concluded that if the
president fired a popular attorney general, he would face powerful
attacks from Republicans in Congress, who delighted in her
decisions to open independent investigations of Clinton's Cabinet
officers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, some of Clinton's aides expressed fears that ousting
Reno would allow Republicans to accuse the president of a Saturday
Night Massacre like the one that forced Attorney General Elliot
Richardson to resign rather than carry out President Richard M.
Nixon's order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.
In a city like Washington, that's job security.

JANET RENO, JOB SECURITY AND THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than any other attorney general, Janet Reno
has been bedeviled by the independent counsel law. In just five
years, she has ordered the appointment of seven independent
prosecutors and turned down requests for a number of others, and is
now considering two more investigations of Clinton administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Her decisions have, in turn, infuriated both the White House and
its Republican critics, and her tenure at the Justice Department
has been largely defined by how she has used _ or, to some, misused
_ the law.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to being a constant source of political trouble
for Reno, the statute, enacted after Watergate to keep politics out
of high-level corruption cases, has probably helped Reno keep her
job, which she might have lost long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Following President Clinton's re-election in 1996, there was a
push by administration officials to get rid of her; they felt stung
by her quickness to appoint independent prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the polarized arena of independent counsel politics, each
time either the Democrats or the Republicans seem ready to take aim
at Reno, they draw back, fearing a backlash against what could look
like attacks on the political independence of a popular attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, with White House officials barely concealing their
relief, Reno took the political heat again by refusing to seek an
independent prosecutor to examine Vice President Al Gore's campaign
finance activities. Reno's job once again seemed secure. There is
no longer any backstairs gossip that Clinton wants to dump her.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Republicans had little realistic hope of doing
anything about their frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., demanded Judiciary Committee hearings
into her reluctance to pursue investigations of campaign financing,
but there seemed little desire among his colleagues to summon Reno
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dynamics could shift again, and soon. Monday she
must decide whether an outside prosecutor should investigate
whether former White House deputy chief of staff Harold M. Ickes
lied to Congress about his dealings with the Teamsters Union, whose
financial support the Democrats were seeking in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And next week she must decide whether to pursue allegations that
Clinton and his aides illegally evaded federal election laws when
they spent millions of dollars of Democratic Party funds on
political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department aides insist that Reno is unconcerned about
the impact of her decisions on her own job or political standing.
They said she has neutrally exercised the law, unmotivated by
politics, and has consistently applied an unwieldy federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   But as her Republican critics, like Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah,
the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have pointed out,
she has blocked for more than two years any appointment of an
independent prosecutor to investigate campaign finance cases. She
has refused to seek an independent counsel even though FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former head of her campaign
finance team, strongly recommended that she send the case to an
outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Should Reno decide to go forward with an independent prosecutor
in either the Ickes or the Clinton campaign advertising matters, it
will be the Clinton administration's turn to be upset. During

   Two men approach each other on a street. They quickly realize
they are on a collision course. The first man, reading the body
language of the second, steps to the right, then sees that the
second man, attempting the same maneuver but responding a split
second too late, has made the same move. The first man tacks the
other way, but the second man has beat him to it. In an exquisite
choreography of misinterpretation, the two men run right into each
other on an empty sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   A Freudian would have no trouble interpreting the event. The two
men, although they thought they were trying to avoid each other,
were driven into each other's arms by a subconscious sexual
attraction. Non-Freudians, however, would recognize the workings of
an iron law governing human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The law has no name. It could be called the Uncertainty
Principle, if Heisenberg did not own the trademark. But it needs no
name to hold sway. Wherever a plan is hatched based on rational
expectations of other people's expectations, it rears its head,
decreeing that the very result that the plan is designed to prevent
will in fact come to pass, quickly and inevitably. Put more
scientifically, expectation of an expectation alters the expected
expectation. Call it the Petard Principle.
</P>
<P>
   The Petard Principle has been in effect lately. Most recently,
it put the whammy on the Federal Reserve. The Fed, making a
rational assessment, judged that a possible slowdown in the economy
could be averted with a half-point cut in interest rates. Shrewder
voices at the Fed then attempted to ward off the evil work of the
Petard Principle. A half-point cut, they argued, would send the
message that the Fed was deeply concerned about an economic
slowdown, causing conditions in the financial markets to
deteriorate. The Fed settled on a quarter-point cut. Markets
deteriorated, forcing the Fed to announce a second quarter-point
cut Oct. 15, and a third cut Nov. 17. Trying to anticipate the
Petard effect, the Fed faked itself out.
</P>
<P>
   The Petard Principle is not an economic law. Its ambitions go
far beyond that. Consider the release of Bill Clinton's videotaped
testimony before the grand jury charged with looking into the
Monica Lewinsky matter. It was generally considered to be a dead
certainty that once the American people got a look at Clinton on
the stand, he would be finished. His behavior was advertised by
unnamed insiders as being ``un-presidential,'' or worse. Television
viewers expected to see a performance comparable to one of Charles
Manson's appearances before the California parole board. They
didn't (although Clinton's eyes did begin spinning in their sockets
when the word ``cigar'' came up). Skewed expectations produced a
skewed result.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Petard Principle at work again, with an interesting
twist. Who skewed the expectations? Credulous observers might
assume that it was the President's enemies who spread the word that
a career-ending performance was in store. Students of the Petard
Principle know that savvy presidential advisers would have been
working double overtime to broadcast the message that Clinton's
most shameful hour was at hand, thereby leveraging defeat into
victory. OK, not victory, but at this late date, Clinton and his
supporters will settle for low-grade embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts have sliced, diced and minced the results of
the Minnesota gubernatorial campaign, desperately trying to explain
how it is that one of the most enlightened and well-educated body
of citizens in the United States decided that a professional
wrestler with a shaved head should manage their affairs. It was the
Petard Principle. Every voting Minnesotan entered the booth
convinced that Jesse Ventura was a fringe candidate, and every vote
cast for Ventura was done in that what-the-heck spirit that keeps
so many Vegas wedding chapels busy. Every Ventura voter pulled the
lever fully confident that no more than a handful of his or her
fellow Minnesotans were doing the same. Surprise!
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, too, wrestles constantly with the powerful but sneaky
influence of the Petard Principle. Until this summer, the wise guys
thought they had it beat. Studying audience behavior, the studio
marketers saw that the mere expectation of a film's success could
help insure success. By marketing a film as though it were destined
to gross $80 million its first weekend, they could make audiences
believe that a film was already a hit, and that they had better
move fast and get it while it was hot.
</P>
<P>
   Like a smart virus, the Petard Principle adjusted. The summer of
1998 will be remembered as the season when the blockbusters
flopped. Nothing could have been bigger than ``Godzilla,'' either
the film itself, about a beast with a foot bigger than Donald
Trump's hat size, or its advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, audiences ran to ``Something About Mary,'' a film that
canny studio marketers recognized as having megahit potential _ it
has taken in more than $170 million at the box office so far _ but
chose to advertise almost as though it were a quirky independent
film. Faked out by an underplayed ad campaign, filmgoers nourished
the illusion that buying a ticket to the film made them part of a
small, independent-minded community making a creative choice.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like those Minnesota voters.

SUDDENLY, SADDAM FEELS ALONE IN THE ARAB WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the uneasy calm that has followed President
Clinton's decision to call off the bombing of Iraq, diplomats
watching for Saddam Hussein's next move sense something profoundly
different in the Iraqi air. While clues do not add up to
conclusions, some Arab and Western experts have seen signs that
Saddam is more isolated in his own region than at any time since
his 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which drove fellow Arab nations into
backing the U.S.-led coalition in the subsequent Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling of Arab relations with Iraq has diverse causes.
Contributing to the trend is the finally tangible (however slow)
progress in peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
President Clinton's forceful and sustained role in the Wye
Plantation talks was widely noticed in Arab nations, a Mideast
envoy said. Relatively small events, like the opening last week of
the Palestinians' first international airport at Gaza, are ``a
tremendous psychological boost'' to better feelings about the
United States, the diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats say that Iraq appears to be convinced that Syria,
an old rival, has been lured by Washington into believing that its
concerns about Israel and its demand for a return of the Golan
Heights could be dealt with next. The subtext in the message is
that Syria would do well to distance itself from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, recent U.S. efforts to feel out Iran, however
tentative and cautious they have been, can be interpreted by Iraqis
as cover for the Iranians should they choose to make trouble for
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Even the collapse of world oil prices to the lowest level in a
decade plays a part in distancing the Arabs and Iranians from Iraq,
since other oil producers in the region are not eager to see Iraq
free to export petroleum at this point _ a principal Iraqi aim in
seeking a relaxation of United Nations sanctions. Iraq produced
3.14 million barrels a day in 1990 under an OPEC quota. Now,
although under strict U.N. regulation, Iraq has already averaged
2.4 million barrels a day over the last four months, and exports
about 1.8 millions barrels of it, an Iraqi oil ministry official
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But exasperation with Saddam's defiance of the United Nations,
fears that he will bring destabilizing destruction down on the
region by sooner or later provoking a U.S. attack, and concern for
the fate of the Iraqi people appear to be turning Arab opinion
against him. His willingness to push Iraqis into the range of U.S.
missiles and bombers has also disturbed some U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab people are able to separate their sympathy for Iraqis
from their attitudes toward Saddam,'' an Arab envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats wager that the Clinton administration may have
sensed this mounting disenchantment with Iraq and made it a
calculation in two decisions two weeks ago. The first was the
decision not to alienate Arabs anew by killing Iraqis after Saddam
appeared ready to capitulate and allow international inspectors to
work. The second was Clinton's public call to the Iraqi opposition
to overthrow Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Having to watch his back, is the Iraqi president now more
vulnerable at home? Western diplomats and officials who would like
to believe that he is say that, nevertheless, they have no strong
new evidence that he is in danger. Still, there is known to be some
dissent within the Iraqi army. ``Soldiers have families too and
they see what this man is doing to people,'' an exile who was
afraid to give his name said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how secure Saddam is arose in new force last
week when his second-in-command, Izzat Ibrahim, escaped
assassination in the southern Shiite city of Karbala. In the days
that followed, Iraqi newspapers hinted that Iran, with its Shiite
leadership and a centuries-long enmity with Sunni-led Iraq, might
have been behind the grenade throwers who tried to kill Ibrahim,
the president's deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council. Iraq
had been trying to build better relations and more commercial ties
with Iran, as it has been doing with Arab nations. The success of
those ventures appears to be mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For several days last week, Iraqi leaders and the controlled
Iraqi media were pleading openly with the Arab world not to abandon
Iraq ``and damage the Arab nation.'' The call came, diplomats said,
as the importance of an Arab warning to Saddam several weeks ago
began to sink in. On Nov. 12, two days before Iraq withdrew its ban
on arms inspections, eight Arab nations _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Syria among them _ said in a public statement that resounded around
the Middle East that if the Americans struck, Saddam would bear the
responsibility for exposing the Iraqi people to new levels of
misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arabs have a strange relationship with Iraq,'' a Middle
Eastern diplomat said. In 1990, after the invasion of Kuwait, a
summit meeting of Arab leaders in effect gave the go-ahead to the
U.S.-led coalition to wage war on Iraq. But Arab nations, most of
which have authoritarian governments that are wary of coups and
revolutionary movements, have always stopped short (at least
publicly) of advocating the overthrow of Saddam. The idea of a
Western nation, the United States or Britain, ousting an Arab
leader is inflammatory in itself, and stirs up too much history.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was not
afraid to talk about a change of regime in Iraq as long as it came
from within and not from British and U.S. intelligence agencies.
``Let's be realistic,'' Mubarak said in an interview with the
French newspaper Le Figaro. ``These projects won't get anywhere.
Anyone who knows Iraq knows that no action will succeed if it isn't
led from the interior, by people living in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat said that the world was probably still far
from seeing any organized resistance emerge in Iraq to topple
Saddam, at least not in a decisive way. More likely, some Western
experts fear, would be a messy collapse into brutality _ ``like the
end of Ceaucescu in Romania,'' a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no orderly succession evident. Saddam has
allowed no other Iraqi to build a political base. His two sons,
Uday and Qusay, are by wide agreement despised. Abbas Mehdi, an
exile who is active in democratic Iraqi dissident movements in the
United States, said that if Saddam were to die today, naturally or
violently, ``Within 30 minutes, his sons would be chopped into
10,000 pieces.''

   Book publishers seem unable to keep from printing more and more
coffee table books about less and less. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago you'd get big books called something like ``An
Illustrated History of the World'' that would pretty much describe
everything important from Piltdown Man to the Great Society. (Oh, I
know Piltdown Man was a fraud, but much the same has been argued
about the Great Society. And what is history if not a recounting of
how humans have defrauded one another?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays no topic is too small to be excluded from being the
subject of a book all by itself. Thus for holiday giving this year
we can find such books as ``The Year of Liberty: The Great Irish
Rebellion of 1798.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying this late 18th century uprising of Irish
Catholics wasn't an important landmark in the history of human
miscalculation and violence and not worth recounting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All I'm saying is that this new book by Thomas Pakenham (which I
haven't read and may never) is more proof that the focus of more
books is getting narrower. In the case of this Irish rebellion, the
focus is one year, though no doubt in the book Pakenham goes back
to, say, 1795 and the founding of the Orange Society and such. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, given this funneling trend, I think it's possible to
predict some of the coffee table books we may see offered the
future. Here are some of the titles I expect to see next year: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Irish Elk Fossils: What They Say About Antler Size.'' This
richly illustrated $49 volume will answer for all time nearly every
still-unresolved question about genus Megaloceros. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Comprehensive Atlas of Kamloops Maps.'' Here for the first
time _ and for just $75 _ the editors have collected the historical
maps showing the development of the city of Kamloops in southern
British Columbia, from 1813 to 1862. Volume II, covering 1863 to
1946, is expected within a year. Publication of Volume III, from
1947 to the present, is dependent on the sales of the first two
volumes (which should be high, given this vital plug). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Diabetic Dogs of Bernardo Alberto Houssay.'' The world
has long been waiting for details of the dogs this Argentine
physiologist turned diabetic by excision of their pancreases in
experiments from 1924 to 1937. This $125 volume reveals the entire
story. Also available on tape and CD. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Compleat Book of Pickerelweed.'' Although this aquatic
plant of the Pontederiaceae family is common in the eastern part of
North America, not until publication of this $45 scratch-and-sniff
volume has such an exhaustive look been offered. It contains an
accurate and up-to-date list of pickerelweed-related Web sites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Oxpeckers: Africa's Yellow- and Red-Billed Tickbirds.''
Haven't we all admired how oxpeckers cling to large African animals
and remove ticks and maggots from their hides? Here, for only $89,
is a graphically pleasing volume describing what makes them tick
(and, for that matter, what makes them tickbirds). Some proceeds
from each sale will go to the International Oxpecker Preservation
Society. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Inspector General Years of Jean-Gaspard-Felix Lacher
Ravaisson-Mollien.'' Finally we get the details of the time this
19th century French philosopher spent as France's inspector general
of higher education. The book includes the 1892 self-portrait of
Ravaisson-Mollien that hangs in the Louvre and the very short list
of people who have both seen it and known who he is. &QL;

SUDDENLY, SADDAM FEELS ALONE IN THE ARAB WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the uneasy calm that has followed President
Clinton's decision to call off the bombing of Iraq, diplomats
watching for Saddam Hussein's next move sense something profoundly
different in the Iraqi air. While clues do not add up to
conclusions, some Arab and Western experts have seen signs that
Saddam is more isolated in his own region than at any time since
his 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which drove fellow Arab nations into
backing the U.S.-led coalition in the subsequent Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling of Arab relations with Iraq has diverse causes.
Contributing to the trend is the finally tangible (however slow)
progress in peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
President Clinton's forceful and sustained role in the Wye
Plantation talks was widely noticed in Arab nations, a Mideast
envoy said. Relatively small events, like the opening last week of
the Palestinians' first international airport at Gaza, are ``a
tremendous psychological boost'' to better feelings about the
United States, the diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats say that Iraq appears to be convinced that Syria,
an old rival, has been lured by Washington into believing that its
concerns about Israel and its demand for a return of the Golan
Heights could be dealt with next. The subtext in the message is
that Syria would do well to distance itself from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, recent U.S. efforts to feel out Iran, however
tentative and cautious they have been, can be interpreted by Iraqis
as cover for the Iranians should they choose to make trouble for
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Even the collapse of world oil prices to the lowest level in a
decade plays a part in distancing the Arabs and Iranians from Iraq,
since other oil producers in the region are not eager to see Iraq
free to export petroleum at this point _ a principal Iraqi aim in
seeking a relaxation of United Nations sanctions. Iraq produced
3.14 million barrels a day in 1990 under an OPEC quota. Now,
although under strict U.N. regulation, Iraq has already averaged
2.4 million barrels a day over the last four months, and exports
about 1.8 millions barrels of it, an Iraqi oil ministry official
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But exasperation with Saddam's defiance of the United Nations,
fears that he will bring destabilizing destruction down on the
region by sooner or later provoking a U.S. attack, and concern for
the fate of the Iraqi people appear to be turning Arab opinion
against him. His willingness to push Iraqis into the range of U.S.
missiles and bombers has also disturbed some U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab people are able to separate their sympathy for Iraqis
from their attitudes toward Saddam,'' an Arab envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats wager that the Clinton administration may have
sensed this mounting disenchantment with Iraq and made it a
calculation in two decisions two weeks ago. The first was the
decision not to alienate Arabs anew by killing Iraqis after Saddam
appeared ready to capitulate and allow international inspectors to
work. The second was Clinton's public call to the Iraqi opposition
to overthrow Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Having to watch his back, is the Iraqi president now more
vulnerable at home? Western diplomats and officials who would like
to believe that he is say that, nevertheless, they have no strong
new evidence that he is in danger. Still, there is known to be some
dissent within the Iraqi army. ``Soldiers have families too and
they see what this man is doing to people,'' an exile who was
afraid to give his name said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how secure Saddam is arose in new force last
week when his second-in-command, Izzat Ibrahim, escaped
assassination in the southern Shiite city of Karbala. In the days
that followed, Iraqi newspapers hinted that Iran, with its Shiite
leadership and a centuries-long enmity with Sunni-led Iraq, might
have been behind the grenade throwers who tried to kill Ibrahim,
the president's deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council. Iraq
had been trying to build better relations and more commercial ties
with Iran, as it has been doing with Arab nations. The success of
those ventures appears to be mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For several days last week, Iraqi leaders and the controlled
Iraqi media were pleading openly with the Arab world not to abandon
Iraq ``and damage the Arab nation.'' The call came, diplomats said,
as the importance of an Arab warning to Saddam several weeks ago
began to sink in. On Nov. 12, two days before Iraq withdrew its ban
on arms inspections, eight Arab nations _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Syria among them _ said in a public statement that resounded around
the Middle East that if the Americans struck, Saddam would bear the
responsibility for exposing the Iraqi people to new levels of
misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arabs have a strange relationship with Iraq,'' a Middle
Eastern diplomat said. In 1990, after the invasion of Kuwait, a
summit meeting of Arab leaders in effect gave the go-ahead to the
U.S.-led coalition to wage war on Iraq. But Arab nations, most of
which have authoritarian governments that are wary of coups and
revolutionary movements, have always stopped short (at least
publicly) of advocating the overthrow of Saddam. The idea of a
Western nation, the United States or Britain, ousting an Arab
leader is inflammatory in itself, and stirs up too much history.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was not
afraid to talk about a change of regime in Iraq as long as it came
from within and not from British and U.S. intelligence agencies.
``Let's be realistic,'' Mubarak said in an interview with the
French newspaper Le Figaro. ``These projects won't get anywhere.
Anyone who knows Iraq knows that no action will succeed if it isn't
led from the interior, by people living in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat said that the world was probably still far
from seeing any organized resistance emerge in Iraq to topple
Saddam, at least not in a decisive way. More likely, some Western
experts fear, would be a messy collapse into brutality _ ``like the
end of Ceaucescu in Romania,'' a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no orderly succession evident. Saddam has
allowed no other Iraqi to build a political base. His two sons,
Uday and Qusay, are by wide agreement despised. Abbas Mehdi, an
exile who is active in democratic Iraqi dissident movements in the
United States, said that if Saddam were to die today, naturally or
violently, ``Within 30 minutes, his sons would be chopped into
10,000 pieces.''

GERMANY SEARCHES FOR `NORMALITY'

   BERLIN _ Germany is whole and free. The Allied and Russian
troops have long since left Berlin. Next year, with Poland's entry
into NATO, the country will be surrounded by allies for the first
time in its modern history, and the German parliament will return
to the Reichstag. A cycle has been completed, it would seem, a
chapter closed, 53 years after the fall of Hitler's Reich.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Germany is anything but tranquil at the dawn of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's rule. In recent weeks, a former
president, leading writers and prominent Jews have been drawn into
a fierce debate about the place of memory and the shame, if any,
that young Germans should feel for the crimes of their forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has broached such issues before, but in its scope,
openness and vitriol, the discussion appears to be without
precedent. Behind it lies a growing exasperation at what is seen by
some as a commercial exploitation of the Holocaust. Also apparent
are a thirst for normality in a society that has repeatedly tried
to confront Auschwitz and anxiety over freedom of speech in what is
an established democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps, in the long run, it is good that a debate has been
engendered, however painful,'' said Fritz Stern, a history
professor at Columbia University. ``For always, beneath the
surface, there has been the wish to be normal in Germany, the wish
not to be reminded all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began in October when Martin Walser, a prominent
writer, used an acceptance speech for Germany's top literary award
to say something that he said made him ``tremble'' at his audacity:
Auschwitz should not become a ``routine threat, a tool of
intimidation, a moral cudgel or just a compulsory exercise.'' Nor,
he added, should German shame be ``exploited for present
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Response was overwhelming and electric because the challenge
came not from the rightist fringe but from a man of the
intellectual and moral center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental arson,'' declared Ignatz Bubis, the leader of Germany's
small but growing Jewish community, who accused Walser of
encouraging neo-Nazi groups, stimulating a new intellectual
nationalism and betraying the memory of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to Walser's defense, the writer Monika Maron said that
he had not gone far enough. ``I, for my part, neither think nor
feel that young Germans must carry the shame of their nation,'' she
wrote in the newspaper Die Zeit. ``For me, young Germans are as
little incriminated as young Danes or young French.''
</P>
<P>
   She wondered how ``we can convince other countries of our
normality if we ourselves deny that claim?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maron ended with a troubling confession: ``Now that I defend
Walser, I am also trembling a little bit. Why? Where do I live that
I am afraid even to say what I think?''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 1945, Germany has been a country where the voicing of
nationalist, or even strongly patriotic, sentiment has been
suspect, and freedom of expression in mainstream debate has not
extended to questioning ``the exploitation'' of the Holocaust.
Perhaps Germany is only now lifting the last taboos bequeathed by
Hitler and going through the final throes of its confrontation with
Hitler's Reich.
</P>
<P>
   After the death camps, after the destruction of European Jewry,
Germany has more recently been dealing with the issues of slave
labor at many of its corporations and the cooperation of many banks
and insurance companies with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taboos have all been lifted at last, and the complicity of
most sectors of German society revealed,'' said Arno Mayer, a
historian at Princeton University. ``But once you do that, of
course, you want to move forward, get beyond it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the very moment when this desire to move on has
apparently crystallized, the Holocaust has become more omnipresent
than ever, brought to the public by the movie ``Schindler's List,''
popularized in American television series, argued over in claims
against Swiss banks and used as a regular ingredient of New York
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans' growing belief that American popular culture has
turned the Holocaust into the sole event of World War II and their
sharpened desire to put a terrible century behind them seem to lie
at the heart of the current furor.
</P>
<P>
   Walser was careful not to say who was doing the exploiting. But
in another long defense of him, Klaus von Dohnanyi, a former mayor
of Hamburg and a man whose own father was killed by the Nazis
because of his acts of resistance, was explicit.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who helped
force the Swiss to settle Jewish claims, as an example of the
``political instrumentalization'' of the Holocaust, complained of a
``Holocaust industry'' and suggested that visitors to concentration
camps today increasingly seemed driven by idle curiosity.
``Remembrance must not become comfortable routine,'' von Dohnanyi
said. ``This is the danger Walser came out against.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Dohnanyi also compared his own situation with that of Bubis,
the Jewish leader. Relatives of both men were killed by the Nazis.
Both bore no responsibility for these crimes. Yet, there the
similarities ended. While Bubis was naturally, and rightfully,
exonerated, von Dohnanyi felt compelled to accept the ``historic
guilt'' of the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   This was naturally a difficult role, and von Dohnyanyi said
Walser's speech should be seen as the ``complaint of a personally
innocent German, who feels caught in the disgrace of crimes of
preceding generations which he did not commit, but for which he
nevertheless has to feel responsible. It was the understandable,
even necessary complaint of a conscientious non-Jewish German about
the difficult fate of being such a German today.''
</P>
<P>
   But when, if ever, will that fate become a lighter one? Perhaps
the very fact of so open a debate suggests a society that is
opening up and outgrowing its fears.
</P>
<P>
   The resentments alluded to by Walser are widespread _ he has
received enormous support _ and could grow sharper if the new
government or the European Union fail to offer Germans the more
unburdened identity they clearly crave.
</P>
<P>
   One man clearly worried is former President Richard von
Weizsacker. Writing in the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung last
week, he accused Walser of ``cutting provocation,'' warning that,
``It must not go on like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice was authoritative but with a ring of the past. Germany
seems to want to talk about its demons, once and for all.

PALESTINIANS GRAPPLE WITH RUNNING THE ECONOMY WITHOUT A COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When their gleaming new international airport opened
in the Gaza Strip last week, Palestinians saw it as one more step
toward the national statehood their leaders have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening Monday morning in Washington of a U.S.-sponsored
gathering of international aid donors to the Palestinians is a
reminder of how far they have to go before assuming real control
over their affairs _ and of the peculiar challenges of running a
non-state state that hovers limbo-like between dependence and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian National Authority, midwifed into existence five
years ago by the Oslo peace negotiators, has effective internal
jurisdiction over an expanding territory. It polices streets,
patrols borders, runs schools and hospitals, manages ministries of
trade and finance and foreign affairs. But it isn't in charge of
its own destiny _ or finances.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact of a ``donor's conference'' hosted by a foreign
government highlights the limits of the Authority's authority. A
poor country in need of aid would directly petition multilateral
lenders and friendly governments, as hurricane-ravaged Honduras is
now doing. But the Palestinian National Authority has no
independent standing in the multilateral agencies, and no formal
diplomatic relations with major Western aid donors. And it has few
immediate prospects of commercial funding.
</P>
<P>
   Convened by the Clinton administration, Monday's meeting is
intended to secure firm pledges of multibillion-dollar support for
the Palestinian National Authority over the next three to five
years. After Oslo, it was assumed that by 1999 the Palestinians
would achieve something close to full sovereignty, and foreign
assistance promised in late 1993 for an envisioned five-year
transition is now running out.
</P>
<P>
   But now, under pressure from the United States, Palestinian
leaders have backed away from their long-announced intention to

about postponing any final Palestinian declaration of independence
for several years more, as discussions continue on security issues,
the repatriation of refugees, and the heatedly disputed ``final
status'' of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the Palestinian National Authority, meanwhile,
remains unchanged. Still subsumed economically within the state of
Israel, it cannot print money, impose import duties, draw down
loans from the International Monetary Fund, or float notes in the
sovereign bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   There are of course some advantages to international financial
virginity. There is no vulnerable local currency for London traders
to attack, no massive foreign debt to service, no IMF budget
overlord to placate. But this is the Middle East, the birthplace of
the double-edged sword. And it is the era of trade, not aid, when
the engines of world capitalism are expected to drive progress.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually in the developing world, the Palestinians have no
legacy of binge borrowing or debt defaults. This may sound like an
unalloyed blessing, but that is not how things work in global
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every tiny Third World capital there is a cluster
of Western bankers doggedly seeking some sliver of profit, some
credible investment opportunity, no matter how checkered the local
financial history. But you don't find dealmakers from Morgan
Guaranty hanging around the juice bars of Gaza City, or Ramallah.
The Palestinian National Authority is not unlike a steadily
employed, bill-paying consumer who has carefully avoided mortgages
and Visa cards but suddenly needs a loan. To a banker, this is a
non-person.
</P>
<P>
   Even for an incipient nation-state, having no credit history is
worse than having a bad credit history. Making matters harder
still, the Palestinians have no dollar reserves or other sovereign
assets to act as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   So for the moment the Palestinians have little choice but to go
to Washington, kaffiyeh in hand, and hope for more aid. In the
Monday conference the Clinton administration is expected to
increase U.S. funding, perhaps doubling it to some $150 million
yearly; the European Union nations _ by far the biggest donors _
have pledged a new multi-year package of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even giving money away gets complicated when the recipient
is not yet a government.
</P>
<P>
   The European Investment Bank promised $300 million to the
Palestinians five years ago, but has delivered not a penny, as it
tries to find a way around its own requirements for repayment
assurances from a sovereign borrower. The U.S. Overseas Private
Investment Corp. pledged $125 million in credit guarantees to
American business ventures in Gaza and the West Bank, but has
provided a scant $6 million, in good part because there is no
history of U.S. corporate investment under a Palestinian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Atypically of Third World aid programs, most funding for
Palestinian programs bypasses local authorities entirely and goes
to projects managed by the donors themselves. The United Nations
alone has 26 different agencies dispensing aid and running
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Palestinians welcome the aid, they find its
distribution suffocatingly paternalistic.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for Palestinian self-determination is often portrayed
as an issue of national pride, of rewards that are more psychic and
symbolic than hard-headedly practical. But for Anis al-Qaq, the
Palestinian National Authority deputy minister who oversees foreign
assistance receipts, achieving something closer to national status
is above all a managerial imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and others should look at the Palestinian
Authority as a state,'' he said, ``so that they can leave us to
cope with our deficits and our financial planning by ourselves.''

PALESTINIANS GRAPPLE WITH RUNNING THE ECONOMY WITHOUT A COUNTRY

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When their gleaming new international airport opened
in the Gaza Strip last week, Palestinians saw it as one more step
toward the national statehood their leaders have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening Monday morning in Washington of a U.S.-sponsored
gathering of international aid donors to the Palestinians is a
reminder of how far they have to go before assuming real control
over their affairs _ and of the peculiar challenges of running a
non-state state that hovers limbo-like between dependence and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian National Authority, midwifed into existence five
years ago by the Oslo peace negotiators, has effective internal
jurisdiction over an expanding territory. It polices streets,
patrols borders, runs schools and hospitals, manages ministries of
trade and finance and foreign affairs. But it isn't in charge of
its own destiny _ or finances.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact of a ``donor's conference'' hosted by a foreign
government highlights the limits of the Authority's authority. A
poor country in need of aid would directly petition multilateral
lenders and friendly governments, as hurricane-ravaged Honduras is
now doing. But the Palestinian National Authority has no
independent standing in the multilateral agencies, and no formal
diplomatic relations with major Western aid donors. And it has few
immediate prospects of commercial funding.
</P>
<P>
   Convened by the Clinton administration, Monday's meeting is
intended to secure firm pledges of multibillion-dollar support for
the Palestinian National Authority over the next three to five
years. After Oslo, it was assumed that by 1999 the Palestinians
would achieve something close to full sovereignty, and foreign
assistance promised in late 1993 for an envisioned five-year
transition is now running out.
</P>
<P>
   But now, under pressure from the United States, Palestinian
leaders have backed away from their long-announced intention to
proclaim statehood next May. And Israeli negotiators are talking
about postponing any final Palestinian declaration of independence
for several years more, as discussions continue on security issues,
the repatriation of refugees, and the heatedly disputed ``final
status'' of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the Palestinian National Authority, meanwhile,
remains unchanged. Still subsumed economically within the state of
Israel, it cannot print money, impose import duties, draw down

KURD'S ARREST SLOWS TURKEY'S PATH TO EUROPE

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk remembers
that when he was growing up in the 1950s and '60s, there was one
sure way to end any argument about how to do something: ``You just
had to say `This is how they do it in Europe' and that was final.
If things were done a certain way in Europe, then by definition
that was the right way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For generations, even for centuries, Turks have debated how to
relate to Europe and, by extension, the Western world. It was
fundamental for Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the Turkish
Republic in 1923, that Turkey was a European nation and should
strive to be ever more so. But the marriage of Turkish and European
values has not proven easy to consummate, and in recent weeks it
has been set back again, this time by a dispute over the fugitive
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Most Turks consider Ocalan a paragon of evil who combines the
most despicable qualities of Hitler and Caligula. After he was
arrested in Italy on Nov. 12, the prospect of him being brought
home in chains sent Turks into paroxysms of ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Italians, however, refused to extradite him. They said they
could not because their constitution forbids extraditing anyone to
countries that practice the death penalty. Several Italian
politicians also noted that European accords forbid sending
criminal suspects to places where they might face torture. Armando
Cossuta, whose Party of Italian Communists is part of the ruling
coalition, went so far as to call Ocalan ``the leader of an
oppressed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Turks were furious, saying Italy was embracing terrorism and
threatening to punish it with economic boycotts. Their outrage may
have been justified, but to Europeans it seemed strident and
immature. ``Any undue pressure on the Italian government, including
unilateral threats, is inappropriate and must be avoided,'' sniffed
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans sympathize with the Kurds as a stateless people
victimized by a succession of empires, kingdoms and nations. Some
have allowed this sympathy to lead them to support for Ocalan's
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. They see it as a liberation
movement, even in light of a report issued this month by Human
Rights Watch that enumerated 25 massacres it has perpetrated since
1992. This romanticism fits not only with Europe's image of the
Kurds as tragic heroes, but with its image of the Turks, who are
seen by some as brutes and whose less than sterling human rights
record tends to confirm the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema was probably sincere last
week when he urged Turkey to ``find a solution to this long and
bloody conflict by following the examples of Northern Ireland and
the Basque country.'' So, no doubt, was the chairman of the foreign
affairs committee in Germany's parliament, Hans-Ulrich Klose, who
called Ocalan's capture ``a good opportunity for solving the
country's problems with the PKK and making the necessary reforms in
Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Turkish government's reaction is overblown and takes
Turkey very far from its target, Europe,'' Klose asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But for an array of historical and psychological reasons, Turks
abhor any suggestion that they should begin a dialogue with Kurdish
nationalists. Anyone who makes such a suggestion is considered
abysmally ignorant or worse. Many Turks now see Europe in that
category.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost exactly a year since the European Union
slammed its door in Turkey's face by pointedly excluding Turkey
from a list of 11 possible candidates for membership. In the
interim, several European leaders have recognized that they may
have acted too harshly.
</P>
<P>
   In November the European Union issued a new report that took a
much more encouraging tone. ``Turkey is eligible to become a
candidate,'' Hans van den Broek, the Union's external affairs
commissioner, said as he issued the report. The Union's
representative in Ankara, Karen Fogg, called it ``a very positive
indication,'' and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said, ``The
EU Commission's definition of Turkey as the 12th candidate for full
membership has opened the way for improvement in bilateral
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The election of a left-leaning government in Germany last month
seemed to give another boost to Turkey's European ambitions.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged after taking office that he
would support measures ``bringing Turkey still closer to the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ocalan affair and Turkey's reaction to it, however, have
confirmed European stereotypes about Turkey as a country that has
not yet learned the rules of civilized discourse. Even some Turkish
leaders seemed to acknowledge that Turkey's language might have
become too strident. President Suleyman Demirel urged Turks to ``be
well contained and not undermine the country's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the wake of the collapse of Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz's government Wednesday, politicians will probably crank up
their patriotic denunciations of Europe with an eye to the
forthcoming election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks, including the entire political elite, believe that
Ocalan is such a hideous war criminal that there can be no debate
over the justice of Turkey's demand for his extradition. But in
Europe, everything is supposed to be open to debate. The contrast
suggests to some European leaders that Turkey is still in the grip
of a distinctly un-European tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just reached the point of telling Turkey that its
application to join the EU would be considered on the same basis as
every other application, and then this happens,'' a European
ambassador lamented. ``Now there will be a period of silence, at
best. Turkey is not making it easy for us. They're not helping
their own image.''

<P>
   Linda Tripp, who last summer tremulously told the nation ``I'm

empathetic Everyman who runs his nightly broadcast on CNN like a
kind of national bartender, listening to the stories of friends and
strangers, happy and sad.
</P>
<P>
   And Monica Lewinsky, the star-struck former intern who started
it all, spurned cash for class, choosing modern broadcasting's
original million-dollar woman, Barbara Walters, who did not grow up
in Beverly Hills but has herself dated a famous politician, Sen.
John Warner, R-Va. ``No one is giving her credit for doing this
interview out of desire to maintain her credibility and for turning

smoke while a worker watched her.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, shaping up as perhaps the nation's biggest
political pariah since Richard M. Nixon, chose Diane Sawyer,
herself a first-hand expert on the perils of impeachment as someone
who helped Nixon with his memoirs in those dark post-resignation
days at San Clemente. Under Ms. Sawyer's questioning, the
independent counsel conceded that the current occupant of the Oval
Office was ``extraordinarily talented, wonderfully empathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, who last summer tremulously told the nation ``I'm
just like you,'' is talking about talking to Larry King, the
empathetic Everyman who runs his nightly broadcast on CNN like a
kind of national bartender, listening to the stories of friends and
strangers, happy and sad.
</P>
<P>
   And Monica Lewinsky, the star-struck former intern who started
it all, spurned cash for class, choosing modern broadcasting's
original million-dollar woman, Barbara Walters, who did not grow up
in Beverly Hills but has herself dated a famous politician, Sen.
John Warner, R-Va. ``No one is giving her credit for doing this
interview out of desire to maintain her credibility and for turning
down millions, millions,'' Ms. Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bill Gates, Earth's richest mortal, couldn't resist
choosing a fellow entrepreneur recently for a rare interview in
pastel shades. His mouthpiece? The nation's reigning life-style
mogul, Martha Stewart.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 27, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moved in `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The problem with the $206 billion
tobacco settlement, say economists and legal experts (as opposed to
anti-smoking advocates), is that 99 percent of the $206 billion is
a disguised tax hike. Taxing cigarettes more heavily may be a good
idea, but labeling a tax on consumers as ``damages'' being paid by
Big Tobacco is fraudulent. The deal forces citizens of modest means
to subsidize well-heeled lawyers and wealthy owners of cigarette
companies. By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-REVIEW (Washington) _ The upcoming effort by Congress and
the Clinton administration to reform Social Security could as
easily end in partisan gridlock as in the historic achievement both
parties are hoping for. The debate encapsulates fundamental
tradeoffs: between individual and collective responsibility, market
forces and government, and maximizing rewards and minimizing risks.
By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-CARS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Once upon a time, 1998 was
going to be the year of the electric car. But now it seems an idea
whose time has been put on hold. The technology behind electric
cars improves yearly, but the cars themselves fail to attract
buyers. Experts say the reason is they are not as flexible as
gasoline cars, and policy-makers have become reconciled to gasoline
as engines have become cleaner and oil cheaper. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ At the height of its global
ascendancy, supposedly optimistic and youth-obsessed America is
also fixated on death. A sampling of recent books on death and
bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   RENO-COUNSELS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The independent counsel law,
enacted to keep politics out of high-level corruption cases, has
been a constant source of political trouble for Attorney General
Janet Reno, but it has probably helped her keep her job. By David
Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   EXPECTATIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Wherever a plan is hatched based
on rational expectations of other people's expectations, it rears
its head, decreeing that the very result that the plan is designed
to prevent will in fact come to pass, quickly and inevitably. Put
more scientifically, expectation of an expectation alters the
expected expectation. By David Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   INTERVIEWERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The recent batch of electronic
interviewers and celebrity subjects drawn together by the Lewinsky
affair sometimes seems like a parody of Spy magazine's gallery of
improbable doppelgangers, ``Separated at Birth'' By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Moved in `i' category
</P>
<P>
   DICTATORS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ The arrest of Chile's
Augusto Pinochet and the British ruling upholding it may have
opened a new era in the practice of international human rights law.
The decision falls into what had been almost a legal vacuum, making
it all the more interesting to human rights specialists.
International norms have been laid down broadly in human rights
conventions, but there have been no universally agreed definitions
and procedures. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-MIDEAST-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Diplomats watching for
Saddam Hussein's next move sense something profoundly different in
the Iraqi air. Some Arab and Western experts now see signs that he
is more isolated in the region than at any time since his 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which drove fellow Arab nations into backing
the U.S.-led coalition in the Gulf war. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-GUILT-REVIEW (Berlin) _ A fierce debate has erupted
about the place of memory and the shame, if any, that young Germans
should feel for the crimes of their forebears. Germany has broached
such issues before; but in its scope, openness and vitriol, the
current discussion appears to be without precedent. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIANS-AID-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Monday's opening of a
U.S.-sponsored conference of international aid donors to the
Palestinians is a reminder of just how far they have to go before
achieving economic independence. By William A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-EUROPE-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ For generations, even for
centuries, Turks have debated how to relate to Europe and, by
extension, the Western world. In recent weeks the issue has been
brought to the fore again, this time by an extradition dispute over
a fugitive Kurdish rebel leader. By Stephen Kinzer.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Nov. 21,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Democracy, at a snail's pace, wavers
 &HT;    (For release Dec. 2, 1998.)
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is obvious that democracy doesn't work everywhere, not
quickly, anyway. And not without a lot of help from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a poll showed that 51 percent of Romanians feel life
was better under their previous Communist government _ a government
so harsh that one of the first things Romanians did after gaining
their freedom from communism was to try and execute their former
Soviet-buttressed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
</P>
<P>
   Only 43 percent of the Romanians questioned said life was better
since communism was torn down in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   This example is not unique. A host of former Communist nations
of Eastern Europe are struggling with their new lives, embroiled in
ethnic clashes and economic quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the days after the close of World War II when the United
States rushed in with a humanitarian Marshall Plan to rebuild the
destruction and rejump the economy of a battered Germany, but only
the Western Sector, the former Communist states are more left on
their own to restructure.
</P>
<P>
   This is not so much because of a change of economic heart by the
U.S., but because there are so many of them. Switching overnight
from a Communist to free-market economy is like learning to eat
with your right hand after eating with the left all your life.
</P>
<P>
   The dissatisfaction with instant democracy is not confined to
Romania. A dismembered Yugoslavia, no longer under the benevolent
dictatorship of Tito, rips itself into ethnic pieces that are
incapable yet of understanding the formula that a good economy can
cure almost all that ails you; just ask Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The states of the former Soviet Union, particularly Russia, are
reeling under democracy. Russia's economy is unstable and the
Russians who see prices skyrocket with each sunrise begin longing
for the days when bread was plentiful, prices paltry and the only
real price you had to pay was to stay clear of the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   I recall a person I met in what then still was East Germany just
several weeks prior to the rejoining of the two Germanys. She was
frightened of the future. She was going to lose her stipend as a
teacher under the Communist system and her salary was going to be
lowered. Yet, her rent was about to be doubled and food prices
increased.
</P>
<P>
   The denominator of life for her was economy. How would she
survive?
</P>
<P>
   I will presume she has because she was a bright woman, but would
she be one of those who longs for a return to a life that was no
better than spartan but at least dependable?
</P>
<P>
   This week Romania celebrates, under duress, 80 years of
unification, although much of that history was served under the
Soviet heel. There is a question as to what to celebrate. Reforms
are slow, privatization of industry is undergoing a reluctant
metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Constantinescu, the democratically elected president, has
not been able to deliver what he promised: speedy reform. And
because he has not, there is grumbling _ and a longing for the bad
old days of Ceausescu, on the premise that a loaf of bread in the
hand is a decent price to pay for loss of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It is a growing concern among the struggling nations of Eastern
Europe, not insignificantly in Russia, where parades of red banners
are becoming larger and more frequent these days.
</P>
<P>
   The American economy may be sailing along in a spacious suite,
but well to the east and to the south, things are hardly as rosy.
An Eastern Europe, economically stagnant for close to half a
century, is beginning to look backward. And to the south,
particularly since the vast destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch,
the economic needs of impoverished people are overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   How can we help all of them? That's a good question. We, as a
nation, need to sit back and look at our new surpluses and wonder
if it does better for us to keep them in our hands or use them to
brace and vitalize wavering democracies that still are teething on
the system.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Barring kids from cyberporn is no offense to Bill of
Rights
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now here's a nice puzzle for those of us who fancy ourselves
First Amendment absolutists, or something so close to it the
difference hardly counts.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Virginia, in the first-ever such ruling, has
held that a public library cannot install computer filters to keep
kids away from Internet pornography, because doing so has the
collateral effect of denying adult library patrons the same access.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional principle is long established that publishers
and sellers can't be forced to meet a juveniles-only standard of
appropriateness, but while that is unquestionably sound at the
creative and production end, is the same principle still valid at
the access end?
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment, bless it, does magnificent but limited
work. It prevents government from interfering with an open exchange
between publishers, artists, filmmakers and the like and their
willing patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, however, is just as important in what it does not
do. It does not require booksellers, for instance, to stock all
books or oblige them to cater to clamorous clienteles if they don't
wish to, whether it's the local libertine league or Millenarians
for a Better Doomsday. And libraries are not required to buy every
book; they routinely decide which ones not to shelve. None would
buy the porno that thrives on the Internet if it were tendered in
book form.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seems a great constitutional affront, then, for
libraries to make similar judgments on Internet access, especially
when children are at the mouse. As long as full access is continued
for adults, setting aside limited-use terminals for juveniles is
only prudent.
</P>
<P>
   Libraries should be the last places parents are afraid to send
their kids to, and librarians shouldn't have to serve as fire
brigades, rushing buckets of cold water to giggle-and-gasp clusters
of the newly pubescent.
</P>
<P>
   Except for worthy policing against child porn, legislative
efforts to sic the vice squad on the Internet have so far flopped.
Congress's latest attempt has recently been put in abeyance by a
federal judge in Philadelphia, and just as well.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of control Congress wants does offend the First
Amendment. And is hopeless anyway: The Internet is beyond policing.
A simple word-search click in Yahoo turns up 296 ``sex'' sites,
most with links to more sites, in expanding multiples offering
everything from mere babe- and boy-watching to -- well, everything.
(Looking for mail-order ``furniture'' for your home dungeon? Is
Chippendale an option?)
</P>
<P>
   Libraries have got themselves into a muddle over the Internet in
part by extruding the American Library Association's current,
dubious blurring of the traditional distinction between adult and
juvenile collections. But the risks of a kid plowing too young
through Henry Miller's wild-man prose are compounded beyond measure
by the hairier outre a quick hand can find in cyber raunch.
</P>
<P>
   The freedom to publish and exhibit is not diminished but is
enhanced when the public can be confident bookstores, libraries and
theaters retain the right to select their wares according to their
own standards.

MONET WATERLILY AT BOSTON MUSEUM IS CALLED PLUNDERED ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Monet waterlily on loan for the ``Monet in the 20th
Century'' exhibition at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was almost
certainly plundered in 1941 by Hitler's art looters from French
Jewish collector Paul Rosenberg, whose family is now poised to
claim the valuable artwork, the Globe has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Petropoulos, an expert in Nazi art looting, was even
able to pinpoint where the painting was during the war. Petropoulos
said the painting at the MFA is identical to a Monet that was part
of the plundered art collection put together for Nazi Foreign
Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted to the evidence by the Globe, MFA director Malcolm
Rogers Sunday night issued a statement saying he will consult with
the French museum system, which loaned the painting for the
exhibition. Rogers said the MFA plans to retain the painting as
part of the exhibition, which concludes Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hayes Tucker, the curator for the MFA show and a Monet
expert, confirmed Sunday that the photo of von Ribbentrop's Monet
in Petropoulos's book, ``Art as Politics in the Third Reich,''
matches the waterlily on exhibit in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jackson, the research director in London for the Art Loss
Register, used a Rosenberg family photo of the missing work in
mid-September to match it to the Monet, which is normally housed in
the collection of a French museum in Caen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tucker, without having seen the Rosenberg family photo, said
the evidence disclosed this weekend ``leads me to believe that the
painting in the exhibition had been confiscated from the Rosenberg
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting's tainted history came to light after the Globe
reported on Saturday that the MFA had not disclosed on its
exhibition label that the signature Monet waterlily was one of
1,955 artworks now in French custody that were in German hands
during the war; most of the 1,955 artworks are believed to have
been confiscated or sold under duress. The MFA had referred to the
Monet only as ``recovered after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Rogers declined to say whether the MFA would now add
more detailed information to the painting's label.
</P>
<P>
   One clue that the painting at the MFA was looted appears in
lists of unrecovered French wartime losses from the National
Archives, copies of which are in the Globe's possession. They
include a record of the looting of a Monet waterlily owned by Paul
Rosenberg, with dimensions of 35 by 36 inches. That matches the
dimensions of Monet's ``Water Lilies 1904'' on exhibit here.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to the MFA, Rosenberg's American descendants were
alerted by Jackson of the Art Loss Register that the Monet painting
they have long sought was in the custody of the Musee des
Beaux-Arts at Caen, in Normandy. The Caen museum loaned it to the
MFA.
</P>
<P>
   The family had asked the Register, an art industry-created
agency that catalogs art thefts, to help locate 58 missing
paintings. After Jackson's discovery, the family has yet to
lodge &UR;  &LR; its claim, nor had it said anything about the painting until
after the Globe contacted Petropoulos on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the painting, according to art experts, is
likely to be a major embarrassment for France at tomorrow's opening
of a 45-nation conference in Washington that will focus on
unrecovered Holocaust-era assets, including how to identify and
restitute the thousands of artworks that remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the World Jewish Congress has said it will demand at
the conference that France sell the 1,955 artworks, whose owners it
has been unable to locate, and donate the proceeds to Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But French officials have acknowledged making no serious effort
to find the owners after the artworks were retrieved from Germany
at war's end, and farmed the artworks out to various public
museums, including the one at Caen.
</P>
<P>
   If a Monet from such a prominent collector as Rosenberg could
remain unidentified for a half-century, that is likely to add
weight to the views of dissenting art experts. They believe that
the remaining works should not be sold because many owners or their
heirs may still be found.
</P>
<P>
   Willi Korte, an art investigator who has uncovered many looted
artworks in recent years, said the news about the Monet find also
represents an embarrassment for American art museums. Though the
MFA and other major art museums have pledged to comb their
collections for looted paintings and to refuse loans of suspect
paintings, Korte said, ``This case proves once again that American
museums are much more interested in acquiring and exhibiting
beautiful artworks than they are in insuring that those artworks do
not have questionable backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monet, if proven to be Rosenberg's, will be among the most
important looted artworks discovered in the United States since the
war, and one with an exotic wartime pedigree: In addition to von
Ribbentrop, Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering and Hitler amassed
collections of plundered art, many of them taken from prominent
Jewish collectors like Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos, a historian at Loyola College in Baltimore, said
that when he saw a photo of the painting on the front page of
Saturday's Globe, he recognized it instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos had included a photo of the painting, from German
archives of von Ribbentrop's illicit wartime collection, in his
book. The painting in Petropoulos's book is identical to the work
on exhibit at the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt from the records that this painting was
looted and was in the hands of the Third Reich's foreign minister
during the war,'' Petropoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   The Monet represents yet another case where Petropoulos,
Jackson, and other researchers have often been able to find
archival records pointing to stolen artworks _ rec-ords that many
museums did not know existed until recently.
</P>
<P>
   This Friday, for instance, the National Archives is holding a
seminar, in conjunction with the international conference, on how
researchers can use its archives to find records of wartime thefts.
Last week, a National Archives official said the MFA is one of the
few art museums not sending a representative.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the archives, several scholars have chronicled the
looting of the Rosenberg collection, one of Europe's finest. The
scholars include Lynn Nicholas, writing in her ground-breaking
book, ``The Rape of Europa''; and Hector Feliciano in ``The Lost
Museum,'' which focuses principally on looting in France.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain last night what course the painting may take on
its apparent voyage back to the Rosenbergs. The Monet exhibition is
scheduled to go on to the Royal Academy of Arts in London when the
Boston show ends. Art law specialists said the family might choose
to file a claim against the MFA, to keep the painting in the United
States. But since the French museum system does not claim to own
the ``heirless'' painting, such an action seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau threw
the art world into turmoil when he subpoenaed two Egon Schiele
paintings from an Austrian loan to the Museum of Modern Art after
descendants of the artworks' Jewish owners asserted they were
looted during the war. The case is tied up in the courts, and the
paintings remain in storage at MoMA.
</P>
<P>
   The Monet now on loan to the MFA was apparently among five
Monets in a group of 162 valuable Rosenberg paintings that were
stored in a bank vault in Libourne in southern France to hide them
from the Nazis, according to ``The Rape of Europa.'' According to
an account in Feliciano's book, the Nazis seized the artworks in
September 1941, and then shipped them to Paris, where Goering and
other Nazi leaders looked them over.
</P>
<P>
   But with such masterpieces at stake, the German art looting
unit, known as the ERR, had competition from German diplomats
seeking their own share of the plundered art. Chief among those,
according to Nicholas's book, was Otto Abetz, Germany's ambassador
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, citing archival documents, said Abetz kept 74
paintings from the looting unit. Twenty-one of those, including
``works by Utrillo, Monet, Degas, Bonnard, and Bracque, were
reserved `for decoration of the house and offices of the Foreign
Minister.''' Petropoulos, in his book, cited records showing that
Abetz took control of several Jewish art collections.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos, who researched German records of the collections of
officials like von Ribbentrop and Goering, found evidence that von
Ribbentrop and his wife acquired two Monets, including the painting
``Water Lilies 1904.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Petropoulos said there is documentation
that the von Ribbentrops bought some of their paintings before the
war. But, he said, there is no documentation they purchased either
Monet. ``That's suggestive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Ribbentrop was executed for war crimes on Oct. 16, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Griffin, the MFA spokeswoman, insisted that there was no
embarrassment for the museum in having an apparently looted artwork
as part of such a blockbuster exhibition. More than 350,000 people
have seen the Monet show since it opened in September. Another
120,000 tickets have already been issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing but positives associated with every aspect of
this show, including this discovery,'' Griffin said. Rogers, in his
statement, said he was ``delighted that the rightful owners of this
masterwork may have been found.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, the curator, said he saw no risk in taking the work on
loan, despite its unknown and potentially troubling past. ``This
painting has been in the public realm, and often on loan,'' he
said, including to the Art Institute of Chicago for a 1995 Monet
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it seemed legitimate for us to accept it. To me, it seemed
unfettered by the darkness that surrounds other paintings in that
category,'' Tucker said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where exactly is the Oval Office in the White House complex?
I believe it is now on the first floor of the West Wing, not in the
main house. It used to be on the second floor of the main building,
overlooking the South Lawn. When and why was it moved? _J.C.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Southeast corner, West Wing office building.
</P>
<P>
   The Oval Office was never in the White House per se, notes
William Bushong,historian at the White House Historical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Oval Office was built in 1909 in the West Wing office
building, in the center of the southern extension. The only office
the president occupied previously was on the second floor of the
White House (a rectangle, not an oval room). The West Wing offices
were constructed when Teddy Roosevelt came into office complete
with a large family. The shape of the new office was based on the
tradition of oval walls _ suitable for formal introductions.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidency grew, so did the need for more space. In 1934,
during President Franklin Roosevelt's administration, the West Wing
office building was expanded and the Oval Office moved to the
southeast corner.Q: Osama bin Laden is always referred to as a
``multi-billionaire.'' What is the source of these riches? _Olin D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bin Laden is a construction engineer whose father gave him a
starter bankroll _ part of a $5 billion inheritance he shares with
his siblings. Bin Laden is one of 52(count 'em) children of a Saudi
construction and oil billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the shelf life of those little ketchup and mustard
packets you get at fast-food joints? We have got tubs of them here
at work, and some must be ancient. _Steve B.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Heinz consumer line at (412) 237-5740, most
of these packets should probably go. The ketchup package has a
shelf life of six months; mustard, eight. No date is on the packet;
it is on the packet box. Doesn't do much for the fast-food muncher.
</P>
<P>
   Condiment king Henry Heinz began with bottled horseradish while
still keeping his day job as a brickmaker. According to ``So Who
the Heck was Oscar Mayer,'' Heinz developed his famous ``57
Varieties'' slogan after seeing an advertisement on a New York
elevated train for ``21 styles'' of shoes.Q: In which years was
Eddie LeBaron the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   _J. Jones
</P>
<P>
   A: (No, J. Jones is not Jerry Jones.) Edward Wayne LeBaron Jr.
attended high school in Oakdale, Calif., and college at the
University of the Pacific. The diminutive (5' 9'', 168 lbs.) passer
led the Cowboys from their inaugural year, 1960, through 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In June the television show ``Interior Motives'' featured
slipcovers. This was for seasonal changes using bedsheets without
the expense of re-covering furniture. The decorators used
innovative techniques including tools to tuck and pleat material.
Is there any written information available from that show? Where
can I purchase tools to re-cover a couple of old chairs I have? _L.
Rebstock
</P>
<P>
   A: Slipcover instructions are not available from ``Interior
Motives.'' But I did find a simple set of instructions from Nancy's
Notions to share with you and readers. (Send a stamped,
self-addressed envelope to Nancy's Notions, P.O. Box 683, Beaver
Dam, Wis. 53916, attention: slipcover instructions.) The
instructions advise using sheets or wide-width fabrics and include
illustrations for all-thumbs girls like me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the District of Columbia was created as the home of the
federal government, it was a perfect square, roughly half given by
Maryland on the north side of the Potomac and the southern part
donated by Virginia. At some point Virginia reclaimed its part (now
Fairfax County), leaving what we have now. When and why did
Virginia take its land back? _J.C.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: The site for the 10-mile square District of Columbia was
selected by George Washington and donated by Virginia and Maryland.
The Virginia portion remained part of the District for more than 50
years, according to the Virginia Historical Society. In 1846,
Congress retroceded (gave back) the Virginia portion, returning
Alexandria _ both the city and county _ to the state of Virginia.
District residents living south of the Potomac River voted in favor
of the change. Historians note there was concern over the
abolitionist movement gaining strength in the nation's capital as
well as the Old Dominion's need to finance construction of the
Alexandria Canal, says Becky Ballou of the Perry Castaneda Library
reference desk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the news last spring I heard about a local lady who had
very old stocks that turned out to be worth a good sum of money. My
grandmother passed away and left many old stock certificates I
would like to find out about. Could you help?
</P>
<P>
   _A.R.
</P>

   A: Many stockbrokers could help you. But it sounds like you need
a stock search company like R.M. Smythe. Send a photocopy of the
front of the certificate and a check for $75 per issuing company
(not per stock) or a credit card number to 26 Broadway, Suite 271,
New York, N.Y. 10004, Attn.: Caleb. There is a 20 percent discount
for five or more companies. In about a week you will have an
answer. Even if the stock is no longer valid, they may have value

   Q: I have three American Airlines tickets issued in July 1996.
The tickets are in three different names and state ``no
refund/change fee of $50 plus fare difference.'' Are these tickets
still exchangeable according to the above restrictions? Can anyone
use them or only the people whose names are listed on the tickets?
Can another family member use them? Or combine all three for a
single, higher priced ticket? _K.T.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Most of our non-refundable tickets are reusable and have
been since 1992,'' says spokesman Tim Smith. The value of the
ticket may be applied to a future itinerary minus the change fee
(presently $75). Smith said if the change fee American Airlines
placed on the ticket is $50, it will be honored. No, you may not
change the name on the ticket, nor can one person combine the three
and go to Europe.Q: I would like to have an address for director
Lynda Obst, who lives in Fredericksburg. I have a World War II
story I would like to send to her. _C.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: The executive producer of ``Sleepless in Seattle'' and
producer of ``One Fine Day'' vacations in the Hill Country and has
many friends in Fredericksburg. Write to her, however, in care of
Lynda Obst Productions, 10201 W. Pico Blvd., Building 43, Los
Angeles, Calif. 90035. Proceed with caution regarding any idea you
plan to share. Many producers do not accept unsolicited ideas.
Document anything you send (certified letter) for your own
records.Pet stain guru Jane Fish of Source Menagerie says one of
the best tools for blotting up Fido/Garfield misses and messes is
bed underpads, like the ones made by Depends. Pick up a box in the
incontinence section of the store. This is absorbent material.
Makes sense. Keep some sort of absorbent material at the ready _
perhaps under a chair cushion in every room. Cloth diapers work
well. These are handy to attack a spill or accident as soon as it
happens.

 &HT;    Consumer questions
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where exactly is the Oval Office in the White House complex?
I believe it is now on the first floor of the West Wing, not in the
main house. It used to be on the second floor of the main building,
overlooking the South Lawn. When and why was it moved? _J.C.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Southeast corner, West Wing office building.
</P>
<P>
   The Oval Office was never in the White House per se, notes
William Bushong,historian at the White House Historical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Oval Office was built in 1909 in the West Wing office
building, in the center of the southern extension. The only office
the president occupied previously was on the second floor of the
White House (a rectangle, not an oval room). The West Wing offices
were constructed when Teddy Roosevelt came into office complete
with a large family. The shape of the new office was based on the
tradition of oval walls _ suitable for formal introductions.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidency grew, so did the need for more space. In 1934,
during President Franklin Roosevelt's administration, the West Wing
office building was expanded and the Oval Office moved to the
southeast corner.Q: Osama bin Laden is always referred to as a
``multi-billionaire.'' What is the source of these riches? _Olin D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bin Laden is a construction engineer whose father gave him a
starter bankroll _ part of a $5 billion inheritance he shares with
his siblings. Bin Laden is one of 52(count 'em) children of a Saudi
construction and oil billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the shelf life of those little ketchup and mustard
packets you get at fast-food joints? We have got tubs of them here
at work, and some must be ancient. _Steve B.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Heinz consumer line at (412) 237-5740, most
of these packets should probably go. The ketchup package has a
shelf life of six months; mustard, eight. No date is on the packet;
it is on the packet box. Doesn't do much for the fast-food muncher.
</P>
<P>
   Condiment king Henry Heinz began with bottled horseradish while
still keeping his day job as a brickmaker. According to ``So Who
the Heck was Oscar Mayer,'' Heinz developed his famous ``57
Varieties'' slogan after seeing an advertisement on a New York
elevated train for ``21 styles'' of shoes.Q: In which years was
Eddie LeBaron the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   _J. Jones
</P>
<P>
   A: (No, J. Jones is not Jerry Jones.) Edward Wayne LeBaron Jr.
attended high school in Oakdale, Calif., and college at the
University of the Pacific. The diminutive (5' 9'', 168 lbs.) passer
led the Cowboys from their inaugural year, 1960, through 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In June the television show ``Interior Motives'' featured
slipcovers. This was for seasonal changes using bedsheets without
the expense of re-covering furniture. The decorators used
innovative techniques including tools to tuck and pleat material.
Is there any written information available from that show? Where
can I purchase tools to re-cover a couple of old chairs I have? _L.
Rebstock
</P>
<P>
   A: Slipcover instructions are not available from ``Interior
Motives.'' But I did find a simple set of instructions from Nancy's
Notions to share with you and readers. (Send a stamped,
self-addressed envelope to Nancy's Notions, P.O. Box 683, Beaver
Dam, Wis. 53916, attention: slipcover instructions.) The
instructions advise using sheets or wide-width fabrics and include
illustrations for all-thumbs girls like me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the District of Columbia was created as the home of the
federal government, it was a perfect square, roughly half given by
Maryland on the north side of the Potomac and the southern part
donated by Virginia. At some point Virginia reclaimed its part (now
Fairfax County), leaving what we have now. When and why did
Virginia take its land back? _J.C.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: The site for the 10-mile square District of Columbia was
selected by George Washington and donated by Virginia and Maryland.
The Virginia portion remained part of the District for more than 50
years, according to the Virginia Historical Society. In 1846,
Congress retroceded (gave back) the Virginia portion, returning
Alexandria _ both the city and county _ to the state of Virginia.
District residents living south of the Potomac River voted in favor
of the change. Historians note there was concern over the
abolitionist movement gaining strength in the nation's capital as
well as the Old Dominion's need to finance construction of the
Alexandria Canal, says Becky Ballou of the Perry Castaneda Library
reference desk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the news last spring I heard about a local lady who had
very old stocks that turned out to be worth a good sum of money. My
grandmother passed away and left many old stock certificates I
would like to find out about. Could you help?
</P>
<P>
   _A.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Many stockbrokers could help you. But it sounds like you need
a stock search company like R.M. Smythe. Send a photocopy of the
front of the certificate and a check for $75 per issuing company
(not per stock) or a credit card number to 26 Broadway, Suite 271,

my sister. _Peggy L.

 &HT;    Wrestling world may be fake, but it's so much fun to watch
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mattresses had been pulled off my son's bunk bed and placed
strategically on the floor. A chair was stationed a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The television was blaring.
</P>
<P>
   There was a wrestling match on the screen and one in his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of Nitro. There's Monday Nitro, Thursday
Nitro and Saturday Nitro. Joaquin, who is 12, tells me we could
have even more if we'd only upgrade our cable service.
</P>
<P>
   We used to call it ``rasslin'' back when it was on TV only on
Saturday night after the news or when a tour materialized at the
high school gym.
</P>
<P>
   They've prettied it up a lot. Now it's diversified, modernized
and glamorized.
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados can cheer wrestlers aligned with WWF, NWO, NWO Black
and White and NWO Wolf Pack.
</P>
<P>
   My son and his buddies are diehard fans. The summer evening when
I discovered the mattresses on the floor, he and Ryan were
practicing their leaps from the chair onto the mattresses.
Telephone conversations between the two do not concern girls, but
big sweaty guys with names like Goldberg, Sting and Disco Inferno.
</P>
<P>
   They have their own moves. A fellow called The Raven uses ``DDT
The Evenflow.'' You place your opponent in a headlock and then fall
backward and, Joaquin said, ``it kind of crunches their neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. Makes Fritz von Erich's Sleeper Hold seem pretty lame.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlers may also fall victim to moves such as Outsider's Edge,
Scorpion Deathlock, the Pile Driver and the Diamond Cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Many girls disdain wrestling. Joaquin says his female classmates
waste their time watching music videos. His sisters rag on him.
``Why do you watch this? It's fake.''
</P>
<P>
   His elucidating response: ``So?''
</P>
<P>
   His comments to his mom's gentler questioning: ``It looks like
it's real sometimes, and sometimes it really looks fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it's apparently entertaining teen-age boys and adult
males as well. Though few care to admit it, the signs are there.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's dad seems awfully willing to host the boys for
Pay-Per-View matches. Another dad consented to drive a group to a
wrestling exhibition in Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   And Joaquin's dad has participated in tag team watching.
</P>
<P>
   Because Joaquin and Ryan both love wrestling and also have
parents who demand homework be done, they have discerned a watching
strategy since school started.
</P>
<P>
   TV wrestling is like a soap opera. If you miss one match, you
might miss the beginning of a new feud or the reconciliation of
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, I asked if Joaquin's reading was complete, and
he informed me he would finish it at 8.
</P>
<P>
   Why not now?
</P>
<P>
   Because Joaquin's wrestling watch was from 7 to 8 while Ryan
finished his homework, I was informed. Then, Ryan's watch was from
8 to 9 while Joaquin finished his.
</P>
<P>
   A shower had to be taken before 8, though, and Joaquin assigned
his dad to watch and make sure that The Warrior, a newcomer and
probably future star, didn't make his entrance while he was in the
shower. Instructions were to call him immediately if the
trench-coated Warrior showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing I heard was a commotion. ``Something's happening,
Joaquin!''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the television crowd was in an uproar, as was the
crowd at my home.
</P>
<P>
   The Warrior had appeared.

 &HT;    Checkbook a symbol against complexity
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At some point, our heads are just going to explode. We
will reach a point where we will have to remember so many
passwords, phone numbers, deadlines and e-mail addresses that our
skulls won't have any room left. We'll try to cram in one last Web
site address and our brains will blow up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is not medically possible, but I can't think of any
other outcome. The pace of human evolution cannot keep up with our
need for more brainpower. A cranial eruption seems more likely than
an awakening in the corporate world, which refuses to see that
consumers can't absorb any more complexities.
</P>
<P>
   Our nervous systems were built to deal with the pressures of
finding bananas and hiding from big animals in the prehistoric
wilderness. We were not wired to spend hour after hour trying to
comprehend the details of natural-gas utility deregulation to
choose the cheapest provider.
</P>
<P>
   But here we are, wandering through an economy that demands far
too much of us. Increasingly, we are running up our white flags.
For example, millions of Americans have given up preparing their
own taxes, or even changing the oil in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   We don't understand our computers or video recorders, and now
our phones require elaborate owners manuals. The formerly simple
task of paying the phone bill has turned into an IQ test. I have a
local bill, a long-distance bill and a cell-phone bill. I study
them each month to determine whether I'm getting ripped off _ and I
never really know.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, the Georgia Public Service Commission
will rule on a rate case that may lower electric bills and lay the
groundwork for deregulation of the industry. If competition comes,
rates will go even lower. That will be good for my purse. But for
my overworked brain, deregulation will bring another bewildering
array of choices.
</P>
<P>
   When I first started working, paying bills took maybe five
minutes once a month. I'd pay the rent (which included utilities)
and the phone bill. Now, a blizzard of bills blows at me
constantly, with white envelopes and six-page billing explanations
piling against the back of my desk like snowdrifts. The typical
middle-class family has bills for cable TV, Internet access,
pagers, cell phones, two or three vehicles, insurance, the
mortgage, the mortgage insurance and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Last week The Wall Street Journal wrote about growing consumer
resistance to this billing complexity. The banks would like for us
to begin paying for goods and services with online banking, smart
cards, debit cards and other electronic devices. The story noted
that 15 years ago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta published an
article entitled ``Displacing the Check.'' The report predicted
that check writing would virtually disappear in the 1990s as
consumers switched to electronic payments.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of disappearing, checks are growing in number. This
year, 65 billion checks will be written, twice as many as 20 years
ago. I believe people write checks because checks make sense: You
write down the name of the person who gets the money and fill in
the amount. You don't have to remember more passwords or use new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   For a while longer, we may cling to our checkbooks as a protest
against complexity. But in the end, we won't win. Banks will boost
checking fees so high that eventually, we'll switch to
electronic-payment vouchers. And the deregulation of electricity,
natural gas, phone service and cable will bring more bills to pay
with these more sophisticated devices.
</P>
<P>
   Our only hope may be duct tape. Maybe if we can wrap the tape
tight enough, our heads won't burst.

   1. THE EXECUTIONER'S TRAIL For five years Michael McQueen tried
to uncover sufficient evidence to bring to trial Aleksandras
Lileikis, head of the Lithuanian security police in the Vilnius
province under the Nazis. Lileikis, a retired printer now living in
Massachusetts, was one of the worst mass murderers of World War II.
Finally, on a 1993 trip to Lithuania, McQueen found the
incriminating documents he was seeking. Steven Levingston tells the
tale of the relentless efforts of MacQueen and others to bring
Lileikis, who is standing trial in Massachusetts this month, to
justice. From The Boston Globe Magazine. Full-length (4,900 words)

 &HT;    Society needs better handle on pharmaceutical fixes for
childhood
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Another day at Apothecary Elementary. Jason,
George, Alex, Samantha and Sandy are on Ritalin. Mary is on
lithium. Thomas is on Welbutrin. Horace is on Luvox.
</P>
<P>
   An observer is left to wonder if the harried school nurse is the
one who needs medication the most.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar tells his teacher, ``I need my medicine to control
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry gets frantic at noon one day when it's time for his
Ritalin and the nurse, who's tending to a playground wound, hasn't
a free hand to get into the locked medicine cabinet. Jerry's state
of anxiety is not due to chemical withdrawal but the fact that his
parents have convinced him that without his pill he will be a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I have heard a student
desperate to take his or her medication at the exact time it has
been prescribed because if it is late, 'I won't be able to be
good,' or 'I won't be able to keep myself from doing bad things,'''
related a Waco educator.
</P>
<P>
   There's no sense jumping to any conclusion about Jerry or any
students like him. The clinical consensus is that some children
need medication to deal with severe behavior problems. For some
children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
other clinical problems, medicine is a godsend. For others
misdiagnosed or mildly afflicted, however, a pill may doing a poor
job of what counseling, parental discipline or, maybe, decent
nutrition, basic nurturing and stability at home would.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked on Ritalin
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, unlike the popularity of breakthrough remedies that
assure more people get treated for medical conditions and fewer
suffer, the escalating number of American children on Ritalin is
cause for concern rather than for relief.
</P>
<P>
   The global breakdown of Ritalin use may be the most telling flag
raised on this issue. Ninety percent of the Ritalin prescribed on
the planet is used in this country. That's whole continents that
deal with the same problems American parents face in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Experts who gathered in Bethesda, Md., to discuss Ritalin use
came away with the consensus that Ritalin does work.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is the difficulty of diagnosing the problem
for which Ritalin is the answer. Parents are urged to seek multiple
opinions from physicians before turning to medication to solve a
child's behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   Too often underlying events are society's quick-fix penchant:
the pining for a magic pill to make things better.
</P>
<P>
   Making the medication fit the need is only one challenge within
the scope of the uniquely American condition, highlighted on the
cover of last week's Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk
</P>
<P>
   The other issue is informing and involving parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and children need to be educated about the 'power' of
mood-altering medication,'' said the educator to whom I spoke.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that as a prerequisite for a school nurse assuming
responsibility for medicating their children on a daily basis,
parents be required to attend a workshop featuring a medical expert
or, at minimum, a talk by the school nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The key purpose of such a workshop would be to convince the
parents that medication alone can't be the cure-all for behavior
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A talk from a professional would be a useful experience for the
parents who participated. Those who didn't would have to come to
school to medicate their children. So doing, they would get an
eye-opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``A visit to the nurse's office in any elementary school around
noon would give an idea of the huge number of children lining up,''
she said.

 &HT;    A little pressure goes a long way
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weekend after Thanksgiving is often filled with
football, shopping and leftovers. You may not think it the best
time to worry about tire pressure, but this is the time when the
last thing you need is tire failure or an accident. Either will put
a significant dent in your holiday budget.
</P>
<P>
   During two days of torrential rains recently, I made a trip to
Nashville. The vehicle I was driving had the same brand and model
tires I have on my personal vehicle. When I found the tires were
more than willing to hydroplane on a moment's notice, I made a
mental note to check tire pressures at my next stop, knowing this
was not the norm with these tires. A quick look led me to believe
they were a bit on the low side, and the tire gauge proved me
right.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers don't know what an enormous impact just seven
pounds of air pressure can make in a vehicle's performance. Aside
from the tendency to hydroplane, the car started to push or
understeer out of one corner. This should never happen at
reasonable speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, to get a car to understeer as much as the one I was
driving would require a speed in triple digits. The other major
effect of under-inflated tires is a loss in braking capability.
With much standing water, I found that under moderate-to-heavy
braking, my vehicle actually felt like it was floating forward.
</P>
<P>
   What caused all these problems? Just a few pounds of air
pressure. When you combine low pressure with heavy rain and a
surface that is well oiled from traffic, much less than seven
pounds will make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   When a tire is under-inflated, the tread _ whose main purpose is
to disperse water _ is pushed up off the road by water pressure.
This makes the tires' contact area, the part that actually rests on
the pavement, more concave than flat, so the car is riding on a
small stream. When the contact patch is pushed up, the treads are
pushed together like when you clamp your fingers together. This
provides a broad, flat area for the water to run under and greatly
accelerates hydroplaning action. This is also why under braking, my
car felt as if it were floating. It pretty much was.
</P>
<P>
   When tire pressures are set on the high side, it spreads the
tread apart like stretching your fingers apart. The larger space
between the treads results in increased water dispersion.
</P>
<P>
   Proper air pressure also establishes the correct sidewall
strength. Under heavy cornering, a soft sidewall will roll under,
which results in push or understeer. Look at the sidewalls of a
police car. They will be almost vertical, and the contact patch is
a bit crowned. That is because law enforcement vehicles usually
increase the recommended pressure by as much as 10 pounds to reduce
understeer in high-speed situations.
</P>
<P>
   Your owner's manual will suggest the proper tire inflation for
your vehicle usually in a range, say 32-36 psi. The higher psi will
give you a slightly more harsh ride, but it will improve your car's
steering and reduce the risk of hydroplaning.
</P>
<P>
   I adjusted the air pressure in the vehicle I was driving to two
psi over the recommended amount. The result was an entirely new
vehicle. No hydroplaning, no understeer and perfectly straight and
narrow braking. There is a small downside, however. Moderate
over-inflation can cause tires to wear prematurely in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, your tires are the instruments through which all
communications between your vehicle and the road surface take
place. One of the best gifts you can give yourself and your family
is safety. Proper tire pressures only take a second and can help
save a lifetime.

 &HT;    Auto-related gifts can fit the individual
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ready, set, CHARGE!
</P>
<P>
   It's here at last, the biggest shopping season of the year.
Millions of people will embrace the thrill of holiday gridlock
traffic, followed by the chance to implement their keenest
mall-parking-lot battle strategies. Whether you choose to be a
player or an observer of this seasonal American sport, no one has
been granted immunity from the pregame hype that has been around
since Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   While I make it a rule never to pass a Salvation Army pot
without leaving a contribution, the seasonal bell ringer at the
membership warehouse caught me by surprise last week.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store, the aisles displayed this year's solutions to
gift-giving dilemmas. Amid the talking wreaths and dancing Santas,
automotive accessories (after all, nearly everyone has a car, don't
they?) made a prominent showing.
</P>
<P>
   I browsed through the prepackaged car gifts section thinking how
generic they all seemed. If I were going to give a car gift, I
would want it to be practical yet personal, fitting the needs of
the individual. Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   For those with vehicles having altered suspensions, either
raised or lowered, a set of tires is nice. These vehicles cannot be
correctly aligned, so they wear out tires. Of course wheel bearings
and axle (CV) joints tend to self-destruct at an equally rapid
rate, but the repair of these items normally requires professional
intervention. Let them pay for the repairs. Tires can be
gift-wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Add-on accessories, including high-output sound systems or light
kits, keep a vehicle's original equipment electrical system living
on the edge. Their insatiable electrical appetites _ added to
normal winter use of wipers, heater, rear window defroster and
headlights _ inevitably will turn on the little red ``Bat'' or
``Alt'' light on the dash.
</P>
<P>
   When this electrical collapse occurs, wouldn't it be nice to
have the parts handy to make the repairs (until the next time)?
Some of the discount parts places sell lifetime alternators. These
come in an easy-to-wrap box, and when it quits again, it can be
exchanged for a new one. (Be sure to include the receipt.)
</P>
<P>
   Auto parts stores also sell batteries, cables and repair manuals
with instructions on how to change the parts. This thoughtful gift
will be remembered year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know someone whose vehicle leaves a fluid-leak calling
card whenever it is in your driveway? How about giving them a drip
pan? These large, shallow pans also are available at auto parts
stores. Insist that they carry it in the trunk and use it when
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my personal favorites are wiper blade inserts, a bottle
of Rain-X, pocket magnets and pocket screwdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   So you really don't need prepackaged car gifts. Use your
imagination. Match the gift to the personality. Besides, you have a
much better chance of finding a parking space at the auto parts
store.

 &HT;    Woodworking and the Internet
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I get regular messages from readers who want to know
what this rec.woodworking thing from which I'm always quoting is,
where to find it and how to participate in it.
</P>
<P>
   So this column will not be about woodworking, but about
computers.
</P>
<P>
   First, the basics. The newsgroup, or usegroup, called
rec.woodworking is part of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Within that vast, chaotic sea of information and misinformation
called the Internet, rec.woodworking is part of the Usenet. It has
nothing to do with the World Wide Web. Nor is it a chat group.
</P>
<P>
   It is a newsgroup where people interested in woodworking post
messages, sort of like a bulletin board. Let's say you're a novice
and you want to get a new router. You might go to rec.woodworking
to seek the advice of the old hands.
</P>
<P>
   You would do that by posting a message containing your question.
Everybody who visits the newsgroup will see your question. Those
who wish to give you the benefit of their wisdom, or lack of it,
will post replies. Their replies may engender responses from other
visitors who agree with them, or who think they're full of sanding
dust.
</P>
<P>
   This exchange of messages in response to an original post is
called a thread. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Most of my
correspondents on this matter appear to be on the Internet, but
they have apparently never heard of the Usenet.
</P>
<P>
   If you can access the World Wide Web, you should be able to look
at any newsgroup.
</P>
<P>
   If you are browsing the Web with Netscape or Microsoft Explorer,
you can use either of them to get into newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is optimal, but they'll certainly work, and a lot of
people use them for that purpose. If you have a dedicated
newsreader such as Eudora, use it.
</P>
<P>
   I am not going to tell you how to do this with Explorer, because
I do not use that program. It is an excellent program, to be sure,
but I have an involuntary reaction to have something thrust down my
throat, which is what Microsoft is trying to do with Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   So I use Netscape, and I expect Explorer will work much the
same.
</P>
<P>
   First, the program must be set up properly. If you pull down the
Options menu in Netscape, you will see a choice labeled Mail and
News Preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Select that, which will bring up a tabbed box. Pick the Servers
tab.
</P>
<P>
   Here you tell Netscape where to go to get your e-mail, if you
wish it to do that, and, more to the point here, where to go to
find newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't tell you what to put in these blanks.
Your Internet service provider _ the outfit to which you pay money
every month in order to reach the Internet _ can tell you that.
Call its help line.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've got that done, close Netscape and then reopen it. Go
to the the Window menu and select Netscape News.
</P>
<P>
   This will bring up a window that looks a lot like the original
Netscape window, but it's the one you'll use to access
rec.woodworking.
</P>
<P>
   If you pull down the file menu, you'll see a choice called Add
newsgroup. If this is grayed out, look in the subwindow
(windowpane?) titled News Server, and highlight the selection that
has the same name that you entered as the server in preferences.
Now the Add Newsgroup selection under the File menu should be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Select it, and you'll get a dialogue box. Into this box, type
``rec.woodworking'' _ without the quotes. In a few moments, the
current messages in the group should appear in the upper right
pane. Select one, and it will appear in the wide bottom pane.
</P>
<P>
   Newsgroups are an amazing source of information, but try not to
ask people for stuff you can find out just as easily for yourself.
You can ``subscribe'' to rec.woodworking. All you need do is
right-click on the newsgroup's name, and select subscribe. Then
every time you ask for a newsgroup window, rec.woodworking will be
there.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a lot of kindred souls hanging out there.

 &HT;    Help available for handling holiday traffic
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like many metropolitan areas, Atlanta's roads and
freeways are often filled to the point of gridlock. And now that
the holiday season is beginning, travel is even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the Web can help. In some cases, you'll be
able to avoid a trip altogether by visiting a store or organization
using your computer. Other Web sites can give you traffic and
weather information that will make your trip less stressful.
</P>
<P>
   One of the complications of getting around a large city is
locating your destination. Even people who have lived in Atlanta
for years occasionally need a map or driving directions. One of the
best ways to find almost any address is by going to Yahoo!'s
excellent map site at http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py. You will
get a small but usable map, and you can also get turn-by-turn
driving directions.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how to get there is just part of the equation. If
traffic is heavy, you may decide to postpone the trip or take
another route. One way to check traffic is to blunder forth
blindly, listening to the traffic reports on the radio as you go.
Then, when you get stuck in an impossible traffic jam, you will
have the rich satisfaction of knowing why you aren't moving. Or,
before you leave home or work, you can check one of the traffic
cameras that update every minute or so and provide a live view of
traffic conditions at several locations. One good one is maintained
by WSB-TV at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.accessatlanta.com/wsbtv/trafficcams.html.
</P>
<P>
   One little slip or extra push of the gas pedal can earn you an
unexpected meeting with the Atlanta police, which maintain a page
at http://www.atlantapd
</P>
<P>
   .org/. You'll find telephone numbers for various units of the
police and contact information. Or, if you're just nosy, you can
click on the link called Busted and find the names of people
arrested for drug- and sex-related offenses. The theory here,
according to the Web page, is ``the age-old method of public
embarrassment. The message is simple: Anyone caught buying or
selling drugs or sex in Atlanta risks seeing their name here.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frustrating trips in town can be attempting to
drive to Hartsfield International Airport and then find a parking
space. You'll get some help at the airport's official site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.atlanta-airport.com/index2.html. Not only will you
find information about parking conditions, you'll also be able to
get a live camera view of traffic around the airport. And if you
are planning a trip by air, or picking up a traveler, you can use
the link on the Hartsfield page to get the latest flight
information, or you can go directly to the page at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.infaxinc.com/WebFIDS/ATL/.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's easy to take the train, whether you're going to
the airport or just to one of the shopping malls. You'll be able to
get schedule and route information from the official page of MARTA,
the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority at
http://www.itsmarta.com/. You'll find an excellent system map as
well as all you'll ever need to know about the rail system.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, you can always walk. If you'd like to learn

 &HT;    OS 8.5 fixes problems with system
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've heard that it's faster. You've heard it has a
much more powerful search engine. But did you know OS 8.5 will
automatically check your hard disk for problems and fix any ones if
found?
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of the many small but important improvements
Apple Computer has added to the latest version of the software,
called the operating system, or OS. Some have likened the purpose
of an OS to a computer's central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Mac's OS was getting a little unstable. But with
each incremental improvement during the past two years, the OS has
gotten stronger and stronger. OS 8.5 is the strongest enhancement
yet.
</P>
<P>
   I've written about the big improvements, including the powerful
new find system and speed enhancements. Now I'm going to address
some of the smaller yet important improvements and additions in OS
8.5.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more significant of those is an automatic problem
detection system. Whenever you start up your Mac, the OS now checks
your hard drive for any damage to files or directories and, if it
finds problems, it tries to repair it. Such preventive maintenance
can prevent small problems from becoming big ones that might bring
down your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   In OS 8.5, Apple Computer has added a popular feature pioneered
by Netscape Navigator. You can add favorite files, folders and Web
sites to a handy list and quickly jump to them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Apple Menu is a folder titled Favorites. Add items to
this folder by holding down the Apple command key and clicking the
mouse. Up will pop a menu of commands, which includes an Add to
Favorites item. Highlight and release this command to add stuff to
the favorites folder.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.5 makes it easy to see what application is currently
running and switch among various applications. It does this through
a new feature called Application Switcher.
</P>
<P>
   The name of any active application is now displayed in the upper
right-hand corner of the menu bar with OS 8.5. Drag and drop that
name onto the desktop, and it turns into a little panel. Listed in
the panel are icons representing any running applications.
</P>
<P>
   To switch among applications, you click on its icon in the
panel. You can also cycle through running applications by pressing
the Command and Tab keys.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything with OS 8.5, Application Switcher is easy to
customize.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, OS 8.5 only works on PowerPC-based Macs. Those of
you with earlier models are out of luck. OS 8.5 retails for $99.

 &HT;    Mac experts pick CDs suitable for giving
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What's a good Macintosh CD to give as a gift? The
December issue of MacWorld has some ideas. This issue contains the
magazine's annual holiday roundup of the best reference and
entertainment software for the Mac. Among its recommendations is
the Complete MasterCook Suite, an interactive cookbook. Another
pick is Kid Pix Studio Deluxe, the venerable computer art program.
And, for young kids, MacWorld recommends ``Pajama Sam 2: Thunder
and Lightning Aren't So Frightening.'' This is a learning game from
Humongous Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season is a hot time for new computer CDs. Companies
tend to issue lots of new titles to take advantage of the big
buying season. Not all, however, are games. Nor are all of them on
CDs. This year you'll be seeing more DVDs _ the trendy new digital
versatile disc format that holds much more data than a CD. Because
these discs can store more than twice the amount of data, it's
possible for them to do a better job with multimedia functions.
Among the new DVD titles are IBM's ``World Book Discoveries: The
Student's Multimedia Guide to World History.'' It features 5,400
images, seven hours of sound and more than 900 animations. The disc
lets you search, copy, export and print text and images. ``World
Book Discoveries'' is designed as a homework aide for kids. It's
available only for PCs running either Windows 95 or Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In the game department, Microprose is releasing another ``Top
Gun'' title, ``Hornet's Nest.'' This is a combat flight simulator.
You play a maverick young navy pilot flying an F/A-18 fighter jet.
There are 30 missions and three overall campaigns. Play against the
computer or others online. ``Hornet's Nest'' is available only for
PCs running Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Parents, are you looking for a kid site not driven by one of the
big entertainment companies? Then check out Kids On-Line America,
or the KOLA Network. It's commercial but directed toward kids,
education and teachers. The site's content is screened carefully.
You'll find all kinds of stuff here, including chat rooms, bulletin
boards and e-mail features. The site is divided into six
communities: junior, kids, teen, senior, parents and teachers.
You'll find KOLA Network at http://www.kola.net.

 &HT;    A fitting room just like home

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You're caught in the middle: You hate holiday season
mall traffic but you like even less the idea of buying clothes you
haven't tried on. If that describes you, a Web site that belongs to
Lands' End might have your answer.
</P>
<P>
   New to the site at http://www.landsend.com this year is a
feature called Your Personal Model, which lets women create a model
somewhat tailored to their body size. You can use the virtual model
to ``try on'' clothes, seeing how they lay across a body type
similar to yours.
</P>
<P>
   The option is only available to women, because Lands' End found
women were more likely than men to want to see how something fits.
Return shoppers can store their personal model dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   For men, there is a feature called Oxford Express, which lets
men sort through hundreds of dress shirt options. They can
customize their search based on size, color, fabric, collar and
style.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lands' End, most of the people who buy from the
company's online site do so while at work. The peak time is
Wednesday. The top shopping day for catalog shoppers is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A site that examines interest
</P>
<P>
   They do it for Beanie Babies, so why not mortgages?
</P>
<P>
   MortgageAuction.com is a site where you can see if you can get a
better mortgage rate than the banks are offering, at least
according to the folks who run the site. Interest rates are the
lowest they have been in years, so there is a lot of interest in
interest these days.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 10 minutes to fill out the forms on this site.
Then you are notified within 48 hours if your application is
accepted. Little pain, some potential gain.
</P>
<P>
   Call up http://www.mortgageauction.com and the site walks you
through five steps, including filling out a mortgage profile, a
personal financial information form, property and loan information,
and your monthly expenses. Then the information is sent off for
competitive bidding among mortgage lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The site is free. All information is protected with encryption.

<P>
   Some hot tips on e-mail
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail, a free Web-based e-mail company, is offering a few tips
for sending and getting safer e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Tips include:
</P>
<P>
   Change your e-mail password often. Using a combination of
letters and numbers is best.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds obvious enough, but they recommend not sharing your
password. Most system administrators will not ask for your
password, nor should you give it to anyone who asks over the phone
or via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Don't open attachments from people you don't know. Attachments
can bear computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to log out when you're done. Do not reply to spam
e-mail. The folks at Hotmail recommend you take it one step further
and forward the unsolicited e-mail to the customer service
department of the sender's Internet access provider. This name is
usually in the domain part of the e-mail address. Most Web-based
e-mail services offer ways to weed out unwanted e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Use an up-to-date browser. Newer versions include security
features.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they suggest using common sense. Be careful not to
reveal personal information, such as your home address or phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   The pointers can be seen online at http://www.hotmail.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing online
</P>
<P>
   You've seen the college kid order one from his dorm room on the
television ad. Now, the Fall 1998 issue of Money.com offers tips on
how to make sure you get a good deal on a car you buy on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The article says 25 percent of all new-car buyers use the Web to
gather information during the shopping process. Internet car buying
sites only account for 1 percent of all new-car purchases. General
Motors is expected to have a Web site up in 1999 that will let
customers get price quotes and check inventories. Sites for online
car shopping include http://carsmart.com,
http://www.carpoint.msn.com and http://www.autobytel.com.
</P>
<P>
   To help guide your purchase, Money.com offers these tips:
</P>
<P>
   Check the manufacturer's site. It saves time and lets you gather
information you normally would have to go to a dealership to find.
</P>
<P>
   Look at consumer guide sites, such as http://www.edmunds
</P>
<P>
   .com or http://www.kbb.com.
</P>
<P>
   Decide how many options you want, look for rebates and pick your
target price.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the magazine suggests getting financing approved first.
It helps you stick to your target price.

 &HT;    A little pressure goes a long way
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weekend after Thanksgiving is often filled with
football, shopping and leftovers. You may not think it the best
time to worry about tire pressure, but this is the time when the
last thing you need is tire failure or an accident. Either will put
a significant dent in your holiday budget.
</P>
<P>
   During two days of torrential rains recently, I made a trip to
Nashville. The vehicle I was driving had the same brand and model
tires I have on my personal vehicle. When I found the tires were
more than willing to hydroplane on a moment's notice, I made a
mental note to check tire pressures at my next stop, knowing this
was not the norm with these tires. A quick look led me to believe
they were a bit on the low side, and the tire gauge proved me
right.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers don't know what an enormous impact just seven
pounds of air pressure can make in a vehicle's performance. Aside
from the tendency to hydroplane, the car started to push or
understeer out of one corner. This should never happen at
reasonable speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, to get a car to understeer as much as the one I was
driving would require a speed in triple digits. The other major
effect of under-inflated tires is a loss in braking capability.
With much standing water, I found that under moderate-to-heavy
braking, my vehicle actually felt like it was floating forward.
</P>
<P>
   What caused all these problems? Just a few pounds of air
pressure. When you combine low pressure with heavy rain and a
surface that is well oiled from traffic, much less than seven
pounds will make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   When a tire is under-inflated, the tread _ whose main purpose is
to disperse water _ is pushed up off the road by water pressure.
This makes the tires' contact area, the part that actually rests on
the pavement, more concave than flat, so the car is riding on a
small stream. When the contact patch is pushed up, the treads are
pushed together like when you clamp your fingers together. This
provides a broad, flat area for the water to run under and greatly
accelerates hydroplaning action. This is also why under braking, my
car felt as if it were floating. It pretty much was.
</P>
<P>
   When tire pressures are set on the high side, it spreads the
tread apart like stretching your fingers apart. The larger space
between the treads results in increased water dispersion.
</P>
<P>
   Proper air pressure also establishes the correct sidewall
strength. Under heavy cornering, a soft sidewall will roll under,
which results in push or understeer. Look at the sidewalls of a
police car. They will be almost vertical, and the contact patch is
a bit crowned. That is because law enforcement vehicles usually
increase the recommended pressure by as much as 10 pounds to reduce
understeer in high-speed situations.
</P>
<P>
   Your owner's manual will suggest the proper tire inflation for
your vehicle usually in a range, say 32-36 psi. The higher psi will
give you a slightly more harsh ride, but it will improve your car's
steering and reduce the risk of hydroplaning.
</P>
<P>
   I adjusted the air pressure in the vehicle I was driving to two
psi over the recommended amount. The result was an entirely new
vehicle. No hydroplaning, no understeer and perfectly straight and
narrow braking. There is a small downside, however. Moderate
over-inflation can cause tires to wear prematurely in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, your tires are the instruments through which all
communications between your vehicle and the road surface take
place. One of the best gifts you can give yourself and your family
is safety. Proper tire pressures only take a second and can help
save a lifetime.

 &HT;    Grolier encyclopedia serves its purpose well
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 1999 Grolier multimedia encyclopedia has its share
of problems, but on the whole it is a very useful reference work.
</P>
<P>
   The interface, while easy enough to use, also allows the user to
easily miss some features. I've grown used to encyclopedias that
use little icons to show you when a photo, video or sound is
available. Grolier's doesn't do that _ ancillary stuff is included
in a pull-down menu.
</P>
<P>
   However, a quick look at the little manual or a glance at the
help screens will prevent this kind of problem.
</P>
<P>
   A two-disc encyclopedia, it can behave very strangely if you
don't change discs just the way it tells you to, and my text
windows had an unfortunate tendency to come up in a nearly
unreadable script font.
</P>
<P>
   My usual checks revealed no insurmountable problems.
</P>
<P>
   The article on flamenco is exceedingly brief, and online
articles yield little more.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reference to the Three Guardsmen _ Deputy U.S.
Marshals Bill Tilghman, Heck Thomas and Chris Madsen _ or to Bill
Doolin, their greatest nemesis. There is, curously, a paragraph on
Cat Thompson, a three-time All-America basketball player for
Montana State in the 1930s. Grolier is big on sports.
</P>
<P>
   The article on bullfighting is quite adequate to the
encyclopedia's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Music is a mixed bag. Composers do not seem to be awarded aural
samples according to their stature; Mozart is represented only by a
smidgen of Eiene Kleine Nachtmusik, execrably presented via
synthesizer. The presentation of the music is also random; an
excerpt from the first movement of Beethoven's 5th symphony is
played by orchestra, while excerpts from the 6th are done,
inaccurately, on a synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine why publishers continue to let this happen. How
much more can it cost to acquire a snippet of orchestral music than
the same snippet butchered on a synthesizer? Presumably it requires
more space to store _ but I believe students would benefit more
from a few bars of Beethoven's 6th played the way he wrote it on
the instruments he intended than they would from a biography of Cat
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Articles on the major composers, however, are quite generous,
and there are brief synopses of the plots of major operas.
</P>
<P>
   The panoramic scenes are plentiful, and reasonably well
realized. The list of videos includes most of the old standbys.
</P>
<P>
   Articles are well written and appear to contain more than enough
material to satisfy the needs of high school students. Authors are
cited for major articles.
</P>
<P>
   The two-disc encyclopedia itself sells for about $50; the
version I looked at came as the Grolier Multimedia Reference Suite,
with three other disks; the Wall Street Journal Almanac, a Hammond
atlas, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and, for some reason, a
thin, hardbound grammar text.
</P>
<P>
   The Bartlett's is in an ``Expanded Multimedia Edition,'' a
bizarre thing in which pictures and even musical excerpts are
strewn among the quotations, but have absolutely nothing to do with
them.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, that's multimedia.

 &HT;    Auto-related gifts can fit the individual
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ready, set, CHARGE!
</P>
<P>
   It's here at last, the biggest shopping season of the year.
Millions of people will embrace the thrill of holiday gridlock
traffic, followed by the chance to implement their keenest
mall-parking-lot battle strategies. Whether you choose to be a
player or an observer of this seasonal American sport, no one has
been granted immunity from the pregame hype that has been around
since Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   While I make it a rule never to pass a Salvation Army pot
without leaving a contribution, the seasonal bell ringer at the
membership warehouse caught me by surprise last week.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store, the aisles displayed this year's solutions to
gift-giving dilemmas. Amid the talking wreaths and dancing Santas,
automotive accessories (after all, nearly everyone has a car, don't
they?) made a prominent showing.
</P>
<P>
   I browsed through the prepackaged car gifts section thinking how
generic they all seemed. If I were going to give a car gift, I
would want it to be practical yet personal, fitting the needs of
the individual. Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   For those with vehicles having altered suspensions, either
raised or lowered, a set of tires is nice. These vehicles cannot be
correctly aligned, so they wear out tires. Of course wheel bearings
and axle (CV) joints tend to self-destruct at an equally rapid
rate, but the repair of these items normally requires professional
intervention. Let them pay for the repairs. Tires can be
gift-wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Add-on accessories, including high-output sound systems or light
kits, keep a vehicle's original equipment electrical system living
on the edge. Their insatiable electrical appetites _ added to
normal winter use of wipers, heater, rear window defroster and
headlights _ inevitably will turn on the little red ``Bat'' or
``Alt'' light on the dash.
</P>
<P>
   When this electrical collapse occurs, wouldn't it be nice to
have the parts handy to make the repairs (until the next time)?
Some of the discount parts places sell lifetime alternators. These
come in an easy-to-wrap box, and when it quits again, it can be
exchanged for a new one. (Be sure to include the receipt.)
</P>
<P>
   Auto parts stores also sell batteries, cables and repair manuals
with instructions on how to change the parts. This thoughtful gift
will be remembered year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know someone whose vehicle leaves a fluid-leak calling
card whenever it is in your driveway? How about giving them a drip
pan? These large, shallow pans also are available at auto parts
stores. Insist that they carry it in the trunk and use it when
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my personal favorites are wiper blade inserts, a bottle
of Rain-X, pocket magnets and pocket screwdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   So you really don't need prepackaged car gifts. Use your
imagination. Match the gift to the personality. Besides, you have a
much better chance of finding a parking space at the auto parts
store.

MONET WATERLILY AT BOSTON MUSEUM IS CALLED PLUNDERED ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Monet waterlily on loan for the ``Monet in the 20th
Century'' exhibition at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was almost
certainly plundered in 1941 by Hitler's art looters from French
Jewish collector Paul Rosenberg, whose family is now poised to
claim the valuable artwork, the Globe has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Petropoulos, an expert in Nazi art looting, was even
able to pinpoint where the painting was during the war. Petropoulos
said the painting at the MFA is identical to a Monet that was part
of the plundered art collection put together for Nazi Foreign
Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted to the evidence by the Globe, MFA director Malcolm
Rogers Sunday night issued a statement saying he will consult with
the French museum system, which loaned the painting for the
exhibition. Rogers said the MFA plans to retain the painting as
part of the exhibition, which concludes Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hayes Tucker, the curator for the MFA show and a Monet
expert, confirmed Sunday that the photo of von Ribbentrop's Monet
in Petropoulos's book, ``Art as Politics in the Third Reich,''
matches the waterlily on exhibit in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jackson, the research director in London for the Art Loss
Register, used a Rosenberg family photo of the missing work in
mid-September to match it to the Monet, which is normally housed in
the collection of a French museum in Caen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tucker, without having seen the Rosenberg family photo, said
the evidence disclosed this weekend ``leads me to believe that the
painting in the exhibition had been confiscated from the Rosenberg
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting's tainted history came to light after the Globe
reported on Saturday that the MFA had not disclosed on its
exhibition label that the signature Monet waterlily was one of
1,955 artworks now in French custody that were in German hands
during the war; most of the 1,955 artworks are believed to have
been confiscated or sold under duress. The MFA had referred to the
Monet only as ``recovered after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Rogers declined to say whether the MFA would now add
more detailed information to the painting's label.
</P>
<P>
   One clue that the painting at the MFA was looted appears in
lists of unrecovered French wartime losses from the National
Archives, copies of which are in the Globe's possession. They
include a record of the looting of a Monet waterlily owned by Paul
Rosenberg, with dimensions of 35 by 36 inches. That matches the
dimensions of Monet's ``Water Lilies 1904'' on exhibit here.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to the MFA, Rosenberg's American descendants were
alerted by Jackson of the Art Loss Register that the Monet painting
they have long sought was in the custody of the Musee des
Beaux-Arts at Caen, in Normandy. The Caen museum loaned it to the
MFA.
</P>
<P>
   The family had asked the Register, an art industry-created
agency that catalogs art thefts, to help locate 58 missing
paintings. After Jackson's discovery, the family has yet to
lodge &UR;  &LR; its claim, nor had it said anything about the painting until
after the Globe contacted Petropoulos on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the painting, according to art experts, is
likely to be a major embarrassment for France at tomorrow's opening
of a 45-nation conference in Washington that will focus on
unrecovered Holocaust-era assets, including how to identify and
restitute the thousands of artworks that remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the World Jewish Congress has said it will demand at
the conference that France sell the 1,955 artworks, whose owners it
has been unable to locate, and donate the proceeds to Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But French officials have acknowledged making no serious effort
to find the owners after the artworks were retrieved from Germany
at war's end, and farmed the artworks out to various public
museums, including the one at Caen.
</P>
<P>
   If a Monet from such a prominent collector as Rosenberg could
remain unidentified for a half-century, that is likely to add
weight to the views of dissenting art experts. They believe that
the remaining works should not be sold because many owners or their
heirs may still be found.
</P>
<P>
   Willi Korte, an art investigator who has uncovered many looted
artworks in recent years, said the news about the Monet find also
represents an embarrassment for American art museums. Though the
MFA and other major art museums have pledged to comb their
collections for looted paintings and to refuse loans of suspect
paintings, Korte said, ``This case proves once again that American
museums are much more interested in acquiring and exhibiting
beautiful artworks than they are in insuring that those artworks do
not have questionable backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monet, if proven to be Rosenberg's, will be among the most
important looted artworks discovered in the United States since the
war, and one with an exotic wartime pedigree: In addition to von
Ribbentrop, Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering and Hitler amassed
collections of plundered art, many of them taken from prominent
Jewish collectors like Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos, a historian at Loyola College in Baltimore, said
that when he saw a photo of the painting on the front page of
Saturday's Globe, he recognized it instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos had included a photo of the painting, from German
archives of von Ribbentrop's illicit wartime collection, in his
book. The painting in Petropoulos's book is identical to the work
on exhibit at the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt from the records that this painting was
looted and was in the hands of the Third Reich's foreign minister
during the war,'' Petropoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   The Monet represents yet another case where Petropoulos,
Jackson, and other researchers have often been able to find
archival records pointing to stolen artworks _ rec-ords that many
museums did not know existed until recently.
</P>
<P>
   This Friday, for instance, the National Archives is holding a
seminar, in conjunction with the international conference, on how
researchers can use its archives to find records of wartime thefts.
Last week, a National Archives official said the MFA is one of the
few art museums not sending a representative.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the archives, several scholars have chronicled the
looting of the Rosenberg collection, one of Europe's finest. The
scholars include Lynn Nicholas, writing in her ground-breaking
book, ``The Rape of Europa''; and Hector Feliciano in ``The Lost
Museum,'' which focuses principally on looting in France.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain last night what course the painting may take on
its apparent voyage back to the Rosenbergs. The Monet exhibition is
scheduled to go on to the Royal Academy of Arts in London when the
Boston show ends. Art law specialists said the family might choose
to file a claim against the MFA, to keep the painting in the United
States. But since the French museum system does not claim to own
the ``heirless'' painting, such an action seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau threw
the art world into turmoil when he subpoenaed two Egon Schiele
paintings from an Austrian loan to the Museum of Modern Art after
descendants of the artworks' Jewish owners asserted they were
looted during the war. The case is tied up in the courts, and the
paintings remain in storage at MoMA.
</P>
<P>
   The Monet now on loan to the MFA was apparently among five
Monets in a group of 162 valuable Rosenberg paintings that were
stored in a bank vault in Libourne in southern France to hide them
from the Nazis, according to ``The Rape of Europa.'' According to
an account in Feliciano's book, the Nazis seized the artworks in
September 1941, and then shipped them to Paris, where Goering and
other Nazi leaders looked them over.
</P>
<P>
   But with such masterpieces at stake, the German art looting
unit, known as the ERR, had competition from German diplomats
seeking their own share of the plundered art. Chief among those,
according to Nicholas's book, was Otto Abetz, Germany's ambassador
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, citing archival documents, said Abetz kept 74
paintings from the looting unit. Twenty-one of those, including
``works by Utrillo, Monet, Degas, Bonnard, and Bracque, were
reserved `for decoration of the house and offices of the Foreign
Minister.''' Petropoulos, in his book, cited records showing that
Abetz took control of several Jewish art collections.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos, who researched German records of the collections of
officials like von Ribbentrop and Goering, found evidence that von
Ribbentrop and his wife acquired two Monets, including the painting
``Water Lilies 1904.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Petropoulos said there is documentation
that the von Ribbentrops bought some of their paintings before the
war. But, he said, there is no documentation they purchased either
Monet. ``That's suggestive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Ribbentrop was executed for war crimes on Oct. 16, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Griffin, the MFA spokeswoman, insisted that there was no
embarrassment for the museum in having an apparently looted artwork
as part of such a blockbuster exhibition. More than 350,000 people
have seen the Monet show since it opened in September. Another
120,000 tickets have already been issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing but positives associated with every aspect of
this show, including this discovery,'' Griffin said. Rogers, in his
statement, said he was ``delighted that the rightful owners of this
masterwork may have been found.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, the curator, said he saw no risk in taking the work on
loan, despite its unknown and potentially troubling past. ``This
painting has been in the public realm, and often on loan,'' he
said, including to the Art Institute of Chicago for a 1995 Monet
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it seemed legitimate for us to accept it. To me, it seemed
unfettered by the darkness that surrounds other paintings in that
category,'' Tucker said.

 &HT;    Help available for handling holiday traffic
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like many metropolitan areas, Atlanta's roads and
freeways are often filled to the point of gridlock. And now that
the holiday season is beginning, travel is even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the Web can help. In some cases, you'll be
able to avoid a trip altogether by visiting a store or organization
using your computer. Other Web sites can give you traffic and
weather information that will make your trip less stressful.
</P>
<P>
   One of the complications of getting around a large city is
locating your destination. Even people who have lived in Atlanta
for years occasionally need a map or driving directions. One of the
best ways to find almost any address is by going to Yahoo!'s
excellent map site at http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py. You will
get a small but usable map, and you can also get turn-by-turn
driving directions.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how to get there is just part of the equation. If
traffic is heavy, you may decide to postpone the trip or take
another route. One way to check traffic is to blunder forth
blindly, listening to the traffic reports on the radio as you go.
Then, when you get stuck in an impossible traffic jam, you will
have the rich satisfaction of knowing why you aren't moving. Or,
before you leave home or work, you can check one of the traffic
cameras that update every minute or so and provide a live view of
traffic conditions at several locations. One good one is maintained
by WSB-TV at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.accessatlanta.com/wsbtv/trafficcams.html.
</P>
<P>
   One little slip or extra push of the gas pedal can earn you an
unexpected meeting with the Atlanta police, which maintain a page
at http://www.atlantapd
</P>
<P>
   .org/. You'll find telephone numbers for various units of the
police and contact information. Or, if you're just nosy, you can
click on the link called Busted and find the names of people
arrested for drug- and sex-related offenses. The theory here,
according to the Web page, is ``the age-old method of public
embarrassment. The message is simple: Anyone caught buying or
selling drugs or sex in Atlanta risks seeing their name here.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frustrating trips in town can be attempting to
drive to Hartsfield International Airport and then find a parking
space. You'll get some help at the airport's official site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.atlanta-airport.com/index2.html. Not only will you
find information about parking conditions, you'll also be able to
get a live camera view of traffic around the airport. And if you
are planning a trip by air, or picking up a traveler, you can use
the link on the Hartsfield page to get the latest flight
information, or you can go directly to the page at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.infaxinc.com/WebFIDS/ATL/.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's easy to take the train, whether you're going to
the airport or just to one of the shopping malls. You'll be able to
get schedule and route information from the official page of MARTA,
the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority at
http://www.itsmarta.com/. You'll find an excellent system map as
well as all you'll ever need to know about the rail system.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, you can always walk. If you'd like to learn
about a few short hikes in and around Atlanta, check out the
Gorp.Com Web site at

 &HT;    OS 8.5 fixes problems with system
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've heard that it's faster. You've heard it has a
much more powerful search engine. But did you know OS 8.5 will
automatically check your hard disk for problems and fix any ones if
found?
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of the many small but important improvements
Apple Computer has added to the latest version of the software,
called the operating system, or OS. Some have likened the purpose
of an OS to a computer's central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Mac's OS was getting a little unstable. But with
each incremental improvement during the past two years, the OS has
gotten stronger and stronger. OS 8.5 is the strongest enhancement
yet.
</P>
<P>
   I've written about the big improvements, including the powerful
new find system and speed enhancements. Now I'm going to address
some of the smaller yet important improvements and additions in OS
8.5.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more significant of those is an automatic problem
detection system. Whenever you start up your Mac, the OS now checks
your hard drive for any damage to files or directories and, if it
finds problems, it tries to repair it. Such preventive maintenance
can prevent small problems from becoming big ones that might bring
down your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   In OS 8.5, Apple Computer has added a popular feature pioneered
by Netscape Navigator. You can add favorite files, folders and Web
sites to a handy list and quickly jump to them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Apple Menu is a folder titled Favorites. Add items to
this folder by holding down the Apple command key and clicking the
mouse. Up will pop a menu of commands, which includes an Add to
Favorites item. Highlight and release this command to add stuff to
the favorites folder.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.5 makes it easy to see what application is currently
running and switch among various applications. It does this through
a new feature called Application Switcher.
</P>
<P>
   The name of any active application is now displayed in the upper
right-hand corner of the menu bar with OS 8.5. Drag and drop that
name onto the desktop, and it turns into a little panel. Listed in
the panel are icons representing any running applications.
</P>
<P>
   To switch among applications, you click on its icon in the
panel. You can also cycle through running applications by pressing
the Command and Tab keys.

 &HT;    Bad hair days go beyond teen-age years
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's 7:30 _ much too early in the morning and
too late in my life to have to put up with the foolishness a bunch
of 13-year-olds lay on me five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``OOO! Gross!'' Cindy giggles and points to my head. ``Ms.
Schuett, your hair is sticking out!'' She appears to be amazed when
I don't head for the nearest mirror and leap into corrective
action. ``Aren't you going to fix it?'' I ask what she has in mind
short of half-a-day at the Beauty Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno,'' she allows, ``but if my hair stuck out like that, I
wouldn't come to school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they pay me the big bucks,'' I remind her, ``so I
have to show up no matter what's sticking out.'' She gapes, so I
add, ``...within reason of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Now would be one of those ``teaching moments'' that educators
who educate educators love to extol. It would be an ideal time to
do the lecture thing about values, but it's too early in the
morning and I have too much to do. The parable will have to wait.
Instead I tell her to relax and suggest that maybe ``sticking out
hair'' is not the end of the world as we know it. Of course, that
doesn't mean I can't remember when I thought it was.
</P>
<P>
   As I go about responding to a brace of irrelevant memos the
office can't seem to live without, and hastily scratch a regrets
note to the organizers of a pot luck lunch informing them that the
last time I took a dish to such a function, the school suffered the
highest faculty absence rate in its history, I can't help
chuckling. This kid doesn't know from bad hair. I grew up in Bad
Hair City, USA - Miami, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: It's bedtime, 1948, and a scrawny, wild-maned
13-year-old sits cross-legged on her bed peering into a mirror she
has propped against the pillow. It's decision time - homework or
hair. No contest. She begins fiddling with her hair. Up? Down? Over
one ear? One eye (it works for Veronica Lake)? Both eyes?
</P>
<P>
   She has no recourse. It's either the Dippity-Do (gelatinous pink
hair setting glop) and pincurl routine or social ruin. She drips.
She slathers. She twists and pins. The whole time she prays to the
god of teenage hair. ``Oh please, Lana
</P>
<P>
   Turner, make my hair look just like yours when Clark Gable saved
you from the enemy tank in `Homecoming.' And if you can't do that,
please make it last at least until after second period when I have
algebra with that gorgeous guy in the red shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Every night it was the same routine. Every morning, the same
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The best I could hope for was twenty minutes of curls - and that
was on a good day in the winter when the humidity unpegged itself
from the total saturation point. Before I could walk the two blocks
to the bus stop, my hair would have returned to the wild. I would
slouch onto the bus, pretending to be a woman of mystery,
self-absorbed and other worldly. Anything was better than admitting
I was a kid with stupid hair.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as I could remember, all I asked of life was a
portable phonograph for slumber parties, and some curls. My mother
had curls. My father had curls. Even the neighbor's dog had curls.
WHY NOT ME?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bug out,'' I tell the giggling adolescent hanging over my
desk, ``I have more
</P>
<P>
   important stuff to do than put up with your foolishness.'' I
waggle my hand in the direction of the door and can't hide the
chuckle welling in my throat. The kid I'm picking on thinks exactly
the way I did 50 years ago - only now there's no excuse for it.
</P>
<P>
   When I was her age, girls were supposed to be all curly and cute
and you could definitely tell the sexes apart by the length and
style of the hair. Today, there's so much latitude in hair styles
that girls can keep their cool whether they choose long and lank,
or a '90s version of Crewy Lou in the old Dick Tracy comic strips.
I was born half-a-century too soon.
</P>
<P>
   My diminutive tormentor scoots out to the hall to find a few
friends before the bell rings. Probably to share a good giggle
about the condition of the teacher's hair. A quick glance around
the room ensures me I'm alone. I whip open the bottom desk drawer,
prop a little mirror against my Riverside Shakespeare, and reach
for the standard tools of the trade - a spray bottle of water and a
hairbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Squirt. Brush. I can hardly believe it. Fifty years later, and
I'm still going ten rounds with the bad hair beast.

 &HT;    Grolier encyclopedia serves its purpose well
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 1999 Grolier multimedia encyclopedia has its share
of problems, but on the whole it is a very useful reference work.
</P>
<P>
   The interface, while easy enough to use, also allows the user to
easily miss some features. I've grown used to encyclopedias that
use little icons to show you when a photo, video or sound is
available. Grolier's doesn't do that _ ancillary stuff is included
in a pull-down menu.
</P>
<P>
   However, a quick look at the little manual or a glance at the
help screens will prevent this kind of problem.
</P>
<P>
   A two-disc encyclopedia, it can behave very strangely if you
don't change discs just the way it tells you to, and my text
windows had an unfortunate tendency to come up in a nearly
unreadable script font.
</P>
<P>
   My usual checks revealed no insurmountable problems.
</P>
<P>
   The article on flamenco is exceedingly brief, and online
articles yield little more.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reference to the Three Guardsmen _ Deputy U.S.
Marshals Bill Tilghman, Heck Thomas and Chris Madsen _ or to Bill
Doolin, their greatest nemesis. There is, curously, a paragraph on
Cat Thompson, a three-time All-America basketball player for
Montana State in the 1930s. Grolier is big on sports.
</P>
<P>
   The article on bullfighting is quite adequate to the
encyclopedia's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Music is a mixed bag. Composers do not seem to be awarded aural
samples according to their stature; Mozart is represented only by a
smidgen of Eiene Kleine Nachtmusik, execrably presented via
synthesizer. The presentation of the music is also random; an
excerpt from the first movement of Beethoven's 5th symphony is
played by orchestra, while excerpts from the 6th are done,
inaccurately, on a synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine why publishers continue to let this happen. How
much more can it cost to acquire a snippet of orchestral music than
the same snippet butchered on a synthesizer? Presumably it requires
more space to store _ but I believe students would benefit more
from a few bars of Beethoven's 6th played the way he wrote it on
the instruments he intended than they would from a biography of Cat
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Articles on the major composers, however, are quite generous,
and there are brief synopses of the plots of major operas.
</P>
<P>
   The panoramic scenes are plentiful, and reasonably well
realized. The list of videos includes most of the old standbys.
</P>
<P>
   Articles are well written and appear to contain more than enough
material to satisfy the needs of high school students. Authors are
cited for major articles.
</P>
<P>
   The two-disc encyclopedia itself sells for about $50; the
version I looked at came as the Grolier Multimedia Reference Suite,
with three other disks; the Wall Street Journal Almanac, a Hammond
atlas, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and, for some reason, a
thin, hardbound grammar text.
</P>
<P>
   The Bartlett's is in an ``Expanded Multimedia Edition,'' a
bizarre thing in which pictures and even musical excerpts are
strewn among the quotations, but have absolutely nothing to do with
them.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, that's multimedia.

MONET WATERLILY AT BOSTON MUSEUM IS CALLED PLUNDERED ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e, a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Monet waterlily on loan for the ``Monet in the 20th
Century'' exhibition at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was almost
certainly plundered in 1941 by Hitler's art looters from French
Jewish collector Paul Rosenberg, whose family is now poised to
claim the valuable artwork, the Globe has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Petropoulos, an expert in Nazi art looting, was even
able to pinpoint where the painting was during the war. Petropoulos
said the painting at the MFA is identical to a Monet that was part
of the plundered art collection put together for Nazi Foreign
Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted to the evidence by the Globe, MFA director Malcolm
Rogers Sunday night issued a statement saying he will consult with
the French museum system, which loaned the painting for the
exhibition. Rogers said the MFA plans to retain the painting as
part of the exhibition, which concludes Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hayes Tucker, the curator for the MFA show and a Monet
expert, confirmed Sunday that the photo of von Ribbentrop's Monet
in Petropoulos's book, ``Art as Politics in the Third Reich,''
matches the waterlily on exhibit in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jackson, the research director in London for the Art Loss
Register, used a Rosenberg family photo of the missing work in
mid-September to match it to the Monet, which is normally housed in
the collection of a French museum in Caen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tucker, without having seen the Rosenberg family photo, said
the evidence disclosed this weekend ``leads me to believe that the
painting in the exhibition had been confiscated from the Rosenberg
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting's tainted history came to light after the Globe
reported on Saturday that the MFA had not disclosed on its
exhibition label that the signature Monet waterlily was one of
1,955 artworks now in French custody that were in German hands
during the war; most of the 1,955 artworks are believed to have
been confiscated or sold under duress. The MFA had referred to the
Monet only as ``recovered after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Rogers declined to say whether the MFA would now add
more detailed information to the painting's label.
</P>
<P>
   One clue that the painting at the MFA was looted appears in
lists of unrecovered French wartime losses from the National
Archives, copies of which are in the Globe's possession. They
include a record of the looting of a Monet waterlily owned by Paul
Rosenberg, with dimensions of 35 by 36 inches. That matches the
dimensions of Monet's ``Water Lilies 1904'' on exhibit here.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to the MFA, Rosenberg's American descendants were
alerted by Jackson of the Art Loss Register that the Monet painting
they have long sought was in the custody of the Musee des
Beaux-Arts at Caen, in Normandy. The Caen museum loaned it to the
MFA.
</P>
<P>
   The family had asked the Register, an art industry-created
agency that catalogs art thefts, to help locate 58 missing
paintings. After Jackson's discovery, the family has yet to
lodge &UR;  &LR; its claim, nor had it said anything about the painting until
after the Globe contacted Petropoulos on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the painting, according to art experts, is
likely to be a major embarrassment for France at tomorrow's opening
of a 45-nation conference in Washington that will focus on
unrecovered Holocaust-era assets, including how to identify and
restitute the thousands of artworks that remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the World Jewish Congress has said it will demand at
the conference that France sell the 1,955 artworks, whose owners it
has been unable to locate, and donate the proceeds to Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But French officials have acknowledged making no serious effort
to find the owners after the artworks were retrieved from Germany
at war's end, and farmed the artworks out to various public
museums, including the one at Caen.
</P>
<P>
   If a Monet from such a prominent collector as Rosenberg could
remain unidentified for a half-century, that is likely to add
weight to the views of dissenting art experts. They believe that
the remaining works should not be sold because many owners or their
heirs may still be found.
</P>
<P>
   Willi Korte, an art investigator who has uncovered many looted
artworks in recent years, said the news about the Monet find also
represents an embarrassment for American art museums. Though the
MFA and other major art museums have pledged to comb their
collections for looted paintings and to refuse loans of suspect
paintings, Korte said, ``This case proves once again that American
museums are much more interested in acquiring and exhibiting
beautiful artworks than they are in insuring that those artworks do
not have questionable backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monet, if proven to be Rosenberg's, will be among the most
important looted artworks discovered in the United States since the
war, and one with an exotic wartime pedigree: In addition to von
Ribbentrop, Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering and Hitler amassed
collections of plundered art, many of them taken from prominent
Jewish collectors like Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos, a historian at Loyola College in Baltimore, said
that when he saw a photo of the painting on the front page of
Saturday's Globe, he recognized it instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos had included a photo of the painting, from German
archives of von Ribbentrop's illicit wartime collection, in his
book. The painting in Petropoulos's book is identical to the work
on exhibit at the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt from the records that this painting was
looted and was in the hands of the Third Reich's foreign minister
during the war,'' Petropoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   The Monet represents yet another case where Petropoulos,
Jackson, and other researchers have often been able to find
archival records pointing to stolen artworks _ rec-ords that many
museums did not know existed until recently.
</P>
<P>
   This Friday, for instance, the National Archives is holding a
seminar, in conjunction with the international conference, on how
researchers can use its archives to find records of wartime thefts.
Last week, a National Archives official said the MFA is one of the
few art museums not sending a representative.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the archives, several scholars have chronicled the
looting of the Rosenberg collection, one of Europe's finest. The
scholars include Lynn Nicholas, writing in her ground-breaking
book, ``The Rape of Europa''; and Hector Feliciano in ``The Lost
Museum,'' which focuses principally on looting in France.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain last night what course the painting may take on
its apparent voyage back to the Rosenbergs. The Monet exhibition is
scheduled to go on to the Royal Academy of Arts in London when the
Boston show ends. Art law specialists said the family might choose
to file a claim against the MFA, to keep the painting in the United
States. But since the French museum system does not claim to own
the ``heirless'' painting, such an action seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau threw
the art world into turmoil when he subpoenaed two Egon Schiele
paintings from an Austrian loan to the Museum of Modern Art after
descendants of the artworks' Jewish owners asserted they were
looted during the war. The case is tied up in the courts, and the
paintings remain in storage at MoMA.
</P>
<P>
   The Monet now on loan to the MFA was apparently among five
Monets in a group of 162 valuable Rosenberg paintings that were
stored in a bank vault in Libourne in southern France to hide them
from the Nazis, according to ``The Rape of Europa.'' According to
an account in Feliciano's book, the Nazis seized the artworks in
September 1941, and then shipped them to Paris, where Goering and
other Nazi leaders looked them over.
</P>
<P>
   But with such masterpieces at stake, the German art looting
unit, known as the ERR, had competition from German diplomats
seeking their own share of the plundered art. Chief among those,
according to Nicholas's book, was Otto Abetz, Germany's ambassador
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, citing archival documents, said Abetz kept 74
paintings from the looting unit. Twenty-one of those, including
``works by Utrillo, Monet, Degas, Bonnard, and Bracque, were
reserved `for decoration of the house and offices of the Foreign
Minister.''' Petropoulos, in his book, cited records showing that
Abetz took control of several Jewish art collections.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos, who researched German records of the collections of
officials like von Ribbentrop and Goering, found evidence that von
Ribbentrop and his wife acquired two Monets, including the painting
``Water Lilies 1904.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Petropoulos said there is documentation
that the von Ribbentrops bought some of their paintings before the
war. But, he said, there is no documentation they purchased either
Monet. ``That's suggestive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Ribbentrop was executed for war crimes on Oct. 16, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Griffin, the MFA spokeswoman, insisted that there was no
embarrassment for the museum in having an apparently looted artwork
as part of such a blockbuster exhibition. More than 350,000 people
have seen the Monet show since it opened in September. Another
120,000 tickets have already been issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing but positives associated with every aspect of
this show, including this discovery,'' Griffin said. Rogers, in his
statement, said he was ``delighted that the rightful owners of this
masterwork may have been found.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, the curator, said he saw no risk in taking the work on
loan, despite its unknown and potentially troubling past. ``This
painting has been in the public realm, and often on loan,'' he
said, including to the Art Institute of Chicago for a 1995 Monet
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it seemed legitimate for us to accept it. To me, it seemed
unfettered by the darkness that surrounds other paintings in that
category,'' Tucker said.

  TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR Monday Nov. 30 
 By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three of the leads address a common theme: strengthening
patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today leads with a new proposal by the federal government
that would solidify patients' protections against being refused
hospital treatment on financial grounds. The New York Times goes
with word that President Clinton will propose expanding Medicaid
and Medicare to allow those with disabilities to continue receiving
benefits even if they work. And the Los Angeles Times lead states
that the next Congress is well positioned to pass new controls on
managed health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post leads with a focus on the latest industrial
giants to be suspected of profiting during World War II from the
Nazis' use of slave labor _ Ford and GM.
</P>
<P>
   USAT explains that new Health and Human Services regulations
coming out this week would make it clear that hospitals cannot
delay care while awaiting coverage approval from a patient's
insurance company. The paper says it's unclear how many cases there
have been of this sort of insurance-based ``dumping,'' but adds
that during the 1998 fiscal year, HHS noted a total of 54 dumping
cases. The story says that hospital officials insist they already
treat all emergencies, and that the real, continuing problem not
addressed by the new guidelines is what to do about patients who
present at emergency rooms for routine primary care.
</P>
<P>
   The Times says the Clinton disability proposal _ similar to a
bipartisan bill that didn't make it to a floor vote in this
Congress _ is designed to correct the feature of current law under
which the disabled usually have to choose between working and
keeping their health insurance _ particularly perverse in the many
cases when it's precisely the insurance that provides the therapy
and/or medicine that allows the person to hold a job. Currently, 8
million disabled people of working age receive more than $50
billion a year from Social Security and Supplemental Security
Income, says the paper, and fewer than 1 percent of them work.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT cites a signal reason why prospects for federal health
care reform are looking up: the new Republican House leadership
looks more favorably on it than Gingrich and company did. Indeed,
Speaker-elect Bob Livingston was a co-sponsor of a defeated bill
that would have allowed a patient to sue an HMO for damages when
the plan's withholding of authorization was linked to harm he or
she suffered. Some such provision is likely to be revisited, says
the LAT, in this next Congress. One vote-getting compromise
mentioned is that patients would be allowed to sue their HMO only
after they've exhausted all the plan's internal administrative
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Post says some of the information in its Ford/GM story was
first revealed in a 1974 congressional inquiry, but is relevant
again now and is being augmented with additional evidence because
of new class-action suits being filed on behalf of former slave
laborers, in the wake of recent similar and successful legal moves
against Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that both companies had large German
subsidiaries, nor that these subsidiaries provided ample
slave-labor-produced materiel to the Nazi war effort. GM was the
largest producer of trucks for the German Army and Ford was No. 2.
The primary issue to be litigated, says the Post, will be how much
knowledge and control the automakers had with respect to their
German operations after Pearl Harbor. Virtually none, say the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a jury will probably be interested to learn that as late
as the summer of 1938 both Henry Ford and his GM counterpart
received the highest Nazi medal. One defect in the story: It says
that Chrysler's role in the German rearmament effort in the '30s
was ``much less significant'' than that of the other two companies.
But a little elaboration is required _ after all, Chrysler is now
joined at the balance sheet with longtime German auto colossus
Daimler.
</P>
<P>
   Online advertising, reports a front-pager at the Wall Street
Journal, appears to be taking off. Some say more than 80 percent of
the Net's 1997 ad slots went unsold, but first-half 1998 U.S.
spending for cyber ads totaled $774 million, double the year
before. Plusses of the new ad medium: It's excellent for start-ups,
where online commerce is often stressed, and online sites seem more
accommodating to advertisers than print or broadcast, especially
regarding old-line church-and-state issues about blurring the line
between editorial and advertising content. Big negative: Still-high
per-consumer-reached costs.
</P>
<P>
   There's a curious lapse in today's effort by the WP's generally
excellent media reporter Howard Kurtz. Kurtz somewhat breathlessly
reports that Suzanne Daley, South African bureau chief of the NYT,
was mortified when right in front of her, Nelson Mandela made a
sexist remark about her to her boss, the Times' Joseph Lelyveld.
But this is hardly a scoop and in any case, not Kurtz's scoop. He
neglects to mention that the story was published more than six
weeks ago over Daley's byline in the NYT.

   AIDSVAX _ ATLANTA _ Dan Flinchum doesn't much like needles, but
he is about to become the first volunteer in Atlanta to be
inoculated with AIDSVAX, the first vaccine for the AIDS virus to be
widely tested in the United States. He watches calmly as nurse Gail
Kropf prepares a syringe from an innocuous vial the size of her
thumb. He rolls up his left sleeve. This is not the end of AIDS,
not even close. The vaccine may not work. Even if it does, it will
take years of further testing and tweaking before it is approved
for widespread use. Flinchum knows this, and Kropf knows this, and
they try not to attach too much significance to the tiny vial
marked VAX004. (Kim , Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTO.

   AIDSVAX-TESTS _ Perhaps Dr. Edward Jenner swallowed hard when he
steadied the syringe containing the deadly virus smallpox, just

Jenner must have been acutely aware that he was deliberately
imperiling the boy's life. The date was July 1, 1796, and Jenner
was performing a daring experiment that, if reproduced today, would
shock and outrage our 1990s sensibilities. Jenner was lucky. HIV
vaccine researchers know they will need luck, too, if they are to
meet President Clinton's goal of developing a working HIV vaccine
by 2007 _ a goal some believe is impossible, or at least highly
implausible. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH GRAPHIC

 &HT;    COLUMN: A UPS delivers cheap insurance against power surges
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Either computers are getting more delicate or my readers live
especially highly charged lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, the number of reports I've received from
readers about electrical damage to computers _ mostly through
lightning strikes to the home, but often just from voltage surges
or unknown causes _ has greatly increased. Honestly, a week seldom
goes by without learning of some newly fried computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, owning a good voltage surge protector was
almost considered overkill. But nowadays, the really prudent
computer user uses a device called a UPS _ uninterruptable power
supply _ to protect a computer.
</P>
<P>
   By now you may know what a UPS is, but both a joy and handicap
of this column is to be sentenced to teach first grade year after
year. The notion is to treat fairly complex technical problems
without forcing you to learn a word of technobabble. The handicap
of all that is the necessity to just hit the high points of a topic
and to explain things that many of you already know.
</P>
<P>
   So let's start by making sure you know just what a UPS is. Think
of it as a big battery, equipped with circuitry that turns the DC
power into the AC current that your computer needs. Add to that
bundle the ability of the gadget to sense when the regular AC goes
out and to quickly (we're talking milliseconds here, less time than
it takes you to blink) switch from house current to power from the
UPS.
</P>
<P>
   If that's all a UPS did (and it is about all that very early
units were capable of doing), then a UPS would still be a terrific
device. You'd never lose any data when the lights went out.
Instead, you'd have time to save the information you were working
on and to shut down the computer normally. A UPS was never intended
to be a long-term source of power for home computer users. If the
unit furnishes even 10 minutes of backup power, that's plenty of
time to shut down your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there have been two big improvements in the kind of UPS
a home user is likely to buy. For one, these units now include
protection from the kind of power problems that are a lot less
dramatic _ and a lot more likely _ than a blackout. I'll give you a
few ``for instances,'' but there are so many types of power
glitches you'll either have to do research on your own or just take
my word _ there are a lot of unseen gremlins crawling around the
power grid. One type of problem, maybe the most common, is a
voltage sag. That's caused when a device that uses a lot of current
when it starts up _ think of a refrigerator compressor, for
instance _ pulls the voltage level down. Air conditioners do the
same thing. In an extreme case, the lights will lower, but often
you never even see these potentially harmful sags.
</P>
<P>
   But you probably have seen the results of a sag. A big one can
literally freeze your screen and _ over time _ reduce the life span
of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the opposite end of the spectrum, there's the spike.
That's a big jolt of electricity that suddenly zaps down the line.
One cause could be a lightning strike so far away that you never
hear the thunder from it. But your computer can feel it and be
destroyed or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   So the first big improvement is the built-in filtering you'll
find in almost any UPS you find at the computer store. The second
big improvement is the one that makes it possible for me to
recommend that you buy a UPS. Prices have dropped dramatically.
Even three or four years ago, you would pay $400 or so for a good
UPS. While that was probably still a sensible thing to do, the high
price tag made a UPS difficult to recommend.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, you can find a decent UPS for $100 and _ even for
a really fine unit _ you'll pay $200 or less.
</P>
<P>
   It's some of the best money you'll spend on computing. And,
unlike that fancy PC of yours, your UPS won't go out of date. You
may eventually have to replace the battery, or even buy a new unit,
but it's the cheapest insurance available for computing today.

   But you probably have seen the results of a sag. A big one can
literally freeze your screen and _ over time _ reduce the life span
of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the opposite end of the spectrum, there's the spike.
That's a big jolt of electricity that suddenly zaps down the line.
One cause could be a lightning strike so far away that you never
hear the thunder from it. But your computer can feel it and be
destroyed or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   So the first big improvement is the built-in filtering you'll
find in almost any UPS you find at the computer store. The second
big improvement is the one that makes it possible for me to
recommend that you buy a UPS. Prices have dropped dramatically.
Even three or four years ago, you would pay $400 or so for a good
UPS. While that was probably still a sensible thing to do, the high
price tag made a UPS difficult to recommend.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, you can find a decent UPS for $100 and _ even for
a really fine unit _ you'll pay $200 or less.
</P>
<P>
   It's some of the best money you'll spend on computing. And,
unlike that fancy PC of yours, your UPS won't go out of date. You
may eventually have to replace the battery, or even buy a new unit,
but it's the cheapest insurance available for computing today.

JANE HORROCKS: 'LITTLE VOICE,' BIG TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Jane Horrocks in
``Little Voice.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was such a plum role that the ultra-hot Gwyneth Paltrow had
her eye on it. But British actress Jane Horrocks _ a virtual
unknown in Hollywood _ beat her to the punch.
 &HT;    As a result Horrocks has become a dark-horse Best Actress Oscar
contender for ``Little Voice,'' a British-made fable in which the
spotlight falls directly on the 34-year-old actress, best known for
her role as the ditzy Bubble in TV's U.K. comedy import
``Absolutely Fabulous.''
 &HT;    ``They were going to switch the film from England to America
with Gwyneth Paltrow, but it didn't work out,'' Horrocks said, her
voice brimming with happiness, in a telephone interview from New
York. ``So suddenly the part came back to me.''
 &HT;    In ``Little Voice,'' (opening Dec. 4 in New York, San Francisco
and Los Angeles, and on Christmas Day elsewhere) Horrocks is the
shy daughter of Brenda Blethyn (nominated for an Oscar for
``Secrets and Lies''), fearful of leaving the safety of her room
and her precious record collection. They call her Little Voice but
the girl packs a big talent. She can belt out a song and sound
exactly like Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Bassey or
Marlene Dietrich _ to name a few.
 &HT;    It's a miraculous feat: Before your eyes Miss Meek is
transformed into a series of charismatic nightclub singers.
 &HT;    ``They had other people in mind for the lead,'' says Horrocks,
``but Jim Cartwright, who wrote the play, insisted he wanted me.''
In fact, she notes, Cartwright penned the play from which the movie
is drawn with her in mind.
 &HT;    ``I was in another play by him and we became friends,'' she
recalls. ``We were in my back garden one day and the subject of
impersonations came up. So I did a few for him. He said he would
write a play around me _ and two years later he did. I was
horrified and frightened to death to do the voices on stage. At the
time I hoped some disaster would come and take it away. But I did
the play for eight months, first at the National Theater then in
the West End.''
 &HT;    In the movie, Little Voice has to contend with her crude, rude
and hard-drinking mother (Blethyn), and with Michael Caine as the
sleazy agent who wants to exploit her talent. Ewan McGregor plays
her telephone repairman boyfriend.
 &HT;    What will astonish moviegoers is that Horrocks actually sings in
the voices of the legendary ladies; no tricks or miming are used.
``It was important to me and Mark Herman (the
screenwriter-director) that I actually sang because if the audience
thinks for a moment that the character is miming then you've lost
them.''
 &HT;    While she was impressive as an anorexic teenager in Mike Leigh's
``Life Is Sweet'' (1991) and has had roles in ``Memphis Belle''
(1990), ``The Witches'' and a slew of TV including her own British
comedy show ``Never Mind the Horrocks,'' the tiny Jane first caught
everyone's attention as the flaky PR girl in ``Ab-Fab.''
 &HT;    She auditioned first for the role of one of the character's
daughter but because she was too old for that part they hired her
to play Bubble. The show featuring the addled antics of a pair of
dipsomaniacs, quickly became a cult hit, and when it came to the
end of its run its devoted fans mourned. Of its future Jane says,
``Maybe they'll do a one-off special,'' using the British term for
a one-time TV presentation. ``The shows work well for 30 minutes
but I think they'd die in a two-hour movie.''
 &HT;    Her part as the dumb Bubble has had a considerable impact on her
career. ``It's made me more of a semi-household name, and given me
a lot of attention. But I'm not massively famous in the U.K. People
sometimes come up to me in the street and say, 'Oh, you're
So-and-so.' But it's not out of control. It's at a very nice
level.''
 &HT;    Unlike Bubble, Jane is no airhead. She lives in suburban London
with writer Nick Vivian and is expecting their second child. She's
not in favor of marriage, explaining: ``It doesn't appeal to me.
I'm happy as I am and feel if it ain't broke why fix it.''
 &HT;    She seems astonishingly natural on- and off-screen, but it
doesn't come as easily as all that. ``Like my character in the film
I'm a sort of reticent performer,'' she says. ``I don't feel
comfortable doing it. I don't consider myself an impersonator. I'm
an actress really. I began doing impersonations when I was about 9.
My parents had all these Shirley Bassey and Cilla Black records and
I was able to imitate them. Friends thought it was amazing so I
became this little party act. Garland and Monroe and Dietrich came
much later. ''
 &HT;    Now almost five months pregnant, (Dylan, her son with Vivian is
l8 months old) she says: ``I don't enjoy working as much as I used
to. I'd like to have more time for the momhood than the work. I'm
very fortunate because at home I've been able to do supermarket TV
commercials which doesn't take me away from home and pays the
bills. I'd love to retire.''
 &HT;    She says that however much she's been praised for her
impersonation, her son Dylan is often less than impressed. ``When I
did a Judy Garland for him he screamed his head off. He much
prefers my Julie Andrews.''

HONEY, I BRIBED THE KIDS
</HEADLINE>
  By MARGERY D. ROSEN 
 c.1998 Child 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jessica, 3, is a flower girl at the wedding of her father's best
friend. To ensure that she makes it all the way down the aisle
without succumbing to myriad distractions, the matron of honor
strikes a deal: There's a chocolate Tootsie Roll Pop waiting for
her when she reaches the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Matt's parents believe that good manners are
critical. Whenever Matt is introduced to one of their
acquaintances, he earns a later bedtime on Friday nights if he
shakes hands and politely says, ``It's nice to meet you.''
</P>
<P>
   If these scenes sound familiar, you have lots of company. One of
parenting's dirty little secrets is that everyone (OK, almost
everyone) bribes their kids. Not always, but sometimes. Most of us
sheepishly admit that we feel guilty resorting to bribes and wish
our kids would do the right thing simply because they want to.
</P>
<P>
   But here's another little secret: While they don't advocate
bribery, many childrearing experts believe that positive
reinforcement in the form of incentives or rewards _ used
judiciously _ can be a powerful discipline tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``If dangling a treat or a toy in front of your child becomes a
habit _ if you can't persuade him to consistently use good manners,
clean up his room, or leave Toys' R Us unless you buy him a fire
truck _ then the system won't work,'' says Dr. Charles Scott,
assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California
at Davis. ``But parents needn't feel guilty if they use rewards
once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, many parents find the distinction between
bribery and positive reinforcement hard to make. ``There's a big
difference,'' says Dr. Harold Koplewicz, director of the New York
University Child Study Center in New York City. ``A bribe is giving
your child something he doesn't deserve. When you bribe a child, he
doesn't really feel responsible for his behavior, he'll do
something because there's a payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, positive reinforcement is given because of
hard work or a change in behavior noted over time. ``An incentive
acknowledges consistent progress. A reward marks achievement,''
Koplewicz explains. ``The difference _ and it's a critical one _ is
that the child has earned it.'' He'll eventually realize that
cooperating makes him feel good about himself, so good that the
behavior becomes automatic and you can eliminate the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Positive reinforcement can also help children understand that
sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do, things that are
boring or difficult. ``If a 7- year-old is struggling with math
problems, he may lose all interest in trying to solve them,'' says
Koplewicz. ``There is nothing wrong with using a carrot to get the
donkey moving again.'' In this way, you may be able to kindle a
child's interest long enough for him to reach the real goal: his
personal pleasure and pride in mastering a subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rewards and incentives both require time, perseverance, and a
well-thought-out plan that's followed consistently,'' notes
Koplewicz. ``Unfortunately, most parents either use rewards
indiscriminately or fail to stick with the program long enough for
a child to incorporate the new behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, not every behavior can be modified by using
rewards. ``Toilet training and getting a child to eat healthy meals
are critical for parents, but a child must be developmentally ready
to accept responsibility for her own body and be able to recognize
that she has the internal control to do so,'' says Patricia
Henderson Shimm, associate director of the Toddler Center at
Barnard College in New York City. ``Prompting a reluctant eater to
finish her peas by promising her some dessert afterward, or trying
to get a toddler to use the potty by offering her 'big girl
panties,' may set you up for a power struggle later on. When it's
more the parent's issue than the child's, rewards will not work.''
</P>
<P>
   While you're the one who decides whether (and how) to use
rewards, the following guidelines will help you set up an approach
that works for your family:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider what's really important to you. For Joanne, a
Baltimore mother, what's important is that her sons, ages 4 and 6,
be gracious when they visit her in-laws, ``or when we're going to a
family event where I know that my kids and my parenting skills are
on view. I want my mother-in-law in particular to see that I'm
doing a good job,'' she says. ``So I tell my kids that if they make
an effort to talk to their grandparents instead of zoning out in
front of the TV, then the next day we'll get the new video they've
been asking for. I know it's more for me than for them, but it's
the only time I do it, and I've decided it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Identify an appropriate reward. ``Many parents lament, 'He
wants for nothing,''' says Koplewicz. ``But simply spending time
with a child, going Rollerblading in the park, playing a board game
or baking cookies can be a potent incentive for even the most
gadget-laden children. Hugs, kisses, and words of praise _ you
can't really beat parental approval and recognition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Devise a system to track progress. Toddlers, preschoolers and
school-age children respond well to visual cues. Charts with stars
and stickers or a jar that gradually fills with checkers are
concrete signs of progress. Once the new behavior becomes routine,
the pride your child takes in mastering a difficult task will
trigger intrinsic feelings of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't overdo it. ``I used to be a drill sergeant in the
morning, and my harangues were totally unproductive,'' says Claire,
a clinical social worker in Washington, D.C., and the mother of
Sam, 7, and Jessica, 5. ``Often, the only way I got the kids out of
the house on time was to promise one thing or another. And I
resented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she had an insight: ``I realized I wasn't respecting their
needs,'' she says. ``Sam's priority was to play Nerf basketball,
and Jessica wanted to color.'' Enlightened, Claire was able to
reframe her requests. She told her kids, ``We're a team, so we need
to work together. Here's the deal: If you can be ready to go by 8
o'clock, then you can have 10 minutes to do whatever you want.'' It
worked.
</P>
<P>
   If you've become an inveterate briber, stop immediately.
Whenever your child demands a reward, make it clear that good
behavior and extra effort will be rewarded sometimes, but not
always, and never on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that rewards and incentives are only two of
the strategies you can use to instill cooperation in your child.

THE LOST VIRTUES OF HEADGEAR
</HEADLINE>
  By ANNE HOLLANDER 
 c.1998 Slate 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hats arouse fully as much feeling as hairstyles--or they would
if enough of them were being worn. For 30 years we have been living
in the Bareheaded Age, worrying intensely about our hair. Many of
us don't even remember the time when people would no more go
outdoors without a hat than they would without shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The exact character of your hat mattered a lot then, much as the
look of your hair does now. Your hat confirmed your outfit, putting
the final seal on whatever else you wore, crowning your image and
arming your ego for social and professional life--or just for
itself. During the summer in the country, my grandfather would put
on his hat to go down to the end of the driveway and get the
letters out of the mailbox. I would laugh at him, free of the
requirement myself; but in his youth, even kids wore hats whenever
they went outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Hair rose up and drove out hats in the 1960s--rose up, spread
out, and flowed down in merciless torrents, sweeping away
conventional hats as if they represented all that was loathsome in
civilized life. A few cute hats, most of them faintly satirical,
costumey, and historical, were worn by a few cute people for
momentary effect. But the old hat rule was swiftly abolished. Off
came the top hat at the opera and the elegant homburg or fedora for
street wear, along with the whole range of casual hats and caps for
men.
</P>
<P>
   Swept away, too, were all the charming, infinitely various
feminine hats that once made women feel charming and infinitely
various themselves. Common usage once allowed hat makers to find
markets for many heterogeneous styles, for much discreetly
suggestive fantasy in shape and trim. Absurdity was the obvious
risk then, given the vast scope of hat design for women. Danny Kaye
once sang of ``The little ones, the big ones, the sat-on-by-a-pig
ones,/
</P>
<P>
   The foolish ones that perch, and the ghoulish ones that lurch.''
</P>
<P>
   But a man might still be seduced by an irresistible feminine
brim, curving and dipping to offset a meaningful glance. The
desired effect appeared in the movies on the heads of Greta Garbo
and Marlene Dietrich and their glamorous colleagues, such as Gene
Tierney in Laura in her scene at the Algonquin with Clifton Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Along with much else, women's hats are no longer a normal part
of the mating game. Women's hats are out there, but they're all
optional, and the range has shrunk. They come in very few basic
shapes (like dresses), and nobody gets any basic training in hat
choice or hat management, since real allure is felt to reside in
hair, not in hats. Real absurdity, too, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But winter is coming. The Hair Revolution was no help in bitter
weather, and for a while everybody but Floridians and Californians
simply froze above the neck. Lately healthy, utilitarian hats have
returned in force, along with athletic footgear and down jackets,
and there's even a certain limited stylishness in recent examples.
Fur is back, too, as are delicious pile fabrics, so that luxury can
be combined with utility. Meanwhile thousands of watch caps,
ear-flap caps, and wool berets are available from street vendors to
provide instant warmth for passers-by without much regard for
expressive charm. In this day of virtual uniformity, it's curious
that whenever a woman wears any hat at all, somebody is bound to
say, ``I love your hat!''--as if out of subliminal nostalgia for
the truly great days.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says this to men about their baseball caps, the ubiquity
of which has reduced choices for men just as general hatlessness
has diminished the possibilities for women. What are old-fashioned
hat-loving men to do? Classic hats appear pretentious and
dandified. But such men could never wear--can barely
stomach--headgear with the inelegance, the laddishness, the
rakishness, the nerve of a baseball cap, especially one worn
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, let us hope that the Return of the Hat is at hand,
inaugurated by men in their baseball caps, just as the strongest
and longest-lasting fashion changes always have been inspired by
men. The hat itself was a male invention and a male privilege until
women got tired of coifs, veils and wimples in the Renaissance.
Then they daringly adopted hats to profit from the erotic charge
male elements always add to feminine modes. Many women have done
this again in the last decade or so, usually sticking to masculine
sports hat shapes, baseball caps among them, or east European
rabbinical effects to combat the cold blast.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a fine example of that kind of winter hat. It surrounds
my head in a warm nimbus of fake fur, my brow, ears, and nape
encompassed by golden foxy fleece, my pate upholstered with plushy
leopard pelt, my beardless face mitigating the rabbinical flavor.
I've also acquired a neat hat that makes a black, furry sphere out
of my whole skull, leaving some wisps of my hair to curl up my
cheeks and down my forehead, Russian heroine style. More risky,
since I'm not tall, is my cavalier hat in silvery, streaked brown
and black velvet, with a biggish mobile brim for folding up and
down at will, fore and aft or amidships.
</P>
<P>
   Short, small women have to remember that they can quickly
resemble a mushroom in anything too big or a child in anything too
cute. Medium-sized or large and tall women have no such problem and
tend to look good in any kind of hat. They only have to remember to
let enough of their face show and not to let the hat flatten them
on top, so that their full-sized, shapely head and speaking eyes
will support the hat's dashing impact, and the hat itself won't
appear to jam a lid on the body's expressive means.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to all: Study the older royals for the way they manage
good proportions, especially the British Queen Mum, and don't
forget to study your own full-length hatted reflection--front,
back, and profile--before hitting the street. Absurdity forever
lurks.

SODOMY LAW INFRINGES ON PRIVACY SAYS GEORGIA COURT

 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, the Georgia Supreme Court did for its state what the
U.S. Supreme Court would not do for the nation _ it tossed law
enforcement officials out of the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court in Bowers vs. Hardwick
upheld the constitutionality of Georgia's law criminalizing sodomy
_ under the high court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.
It was a 5-4 decision that revealed an unsettling peek at the
homophobia of some of the members of the court.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer had entered Michael Hardwick's Atlanta
apartment, looked into the bedroom and found Hardwick having sex
with another male. Hardwick was arrested and charged under the
state's sodomy statute. The law reads, in part: ``a person commits
the offense of sodomy when he performs or submits to any sexual act
involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth and anus of
another.''
</P>
<P>
   When the charge was dropped, Hardwick filed a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of the law in federal court _
hoping the U.S. Constitution would protect his right of privacy in
his own bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The law, itself, makes no distinction on whether an act of
sodomy is committed by homosexuals or heterosexuals; it's still a
felony. Presumably, a husband and wife could have been charged
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's high court, in a decision written by Justice Byron
White, states that no right of privacy found in the U.S.
Constitution includes ``a fundamental right to engage in homosexual
sodomy.'' Notice that the court's focus is only on homosexual
sodomy. The court makes it clear in a footnote to the decision that
the justices were not ruling on the constitutionality of the
Georgia law as it applies to heterosexual sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Warren Burger, in his concurring opinion, adds:
``To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as
a fundamental right would be to case aside millennia of moral
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the federal Constitution does not explicitly grant a
fundamental right to engage in sodomy _ or any other sex act. The
question that the court should have answered, the real issue behind
the set of facts in that case: Does the federal Constitution
recognize the right of privacy surrounding the most intimate of
human activity, sex between consenting adults?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell wrote a lukewarm
concurring opinion that he would later regret. He provided the
crucial fifth vote to uphold the sodomy law. After Powell retired,
he publicly declared that the Hardwick decision was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, on Nov. 23, the Supreme Court of Georgia in
Powell vs. The State corrected the mistake _ for Georgians, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony San Juan Powell was charged with rape and aggravated
sodomy in regard to sexual conduct involving him and his wife's
niece. Powell testified that he had sex with the young woman
including cunnilingus _ with her consent. After Powell's admission,
the judge added the charge of sodomy. The jury acquitted Powell of
rape and aggravated sodomy, believing that the woman had given her
consent, but found him guilty of sodomy. In the sodomy law, consent
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Powell appealed to the state's highest court _ contending that
the law criminalizes acts of sodomy committed by consenting adults
in private and thereby violates the right of privacy guaranteed to
all Georgia citizens by their state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia high court agreed. In a strongly worded 6-1
decision, the court struck down the state's sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was written by Chief Justice Robert Benham. He
notes that ``the right of privacy has a long and distinguished
history in Georgia.'' In 1905, the state's highest court recognized
that Georgia citizens have a ``liberty of privacy'' guaranteed by
Georgia's Bill of Rights. The Georgia Supreme Court, in fact,
recognized privacy rights long before any other state appellate
courts or the U.S. Supreme Court did. And now, according to Benham,
Georgia recognizes that the right of privacy has ``a value so
essential to individual liberty in our society that its
infringement merits careful scrutiny by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote, Benham adds: ``Privacy rights protected by the
U.S. Constitution are not at issue in this case.'' And thus, he
points out, Bowers vs. Hardwick is not applicable to the
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1905 Georgia case, Pavesich vs. New England Life
Insurance, the court found ``the right of privacy to be `ancient
law,' with `its foundations in the instincts of nature ... making
it immutable and absolute.''' This liberty includes ``the right to
live as one will, so long as that will does not interfere with the
rights of another or of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Benham strikes the key issue in the Powell case: ``We cannot
think of any other activity that reasonable persons would rank as
more private and more deserving of protection from governmental
interference than consensual, private, adult sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   He closes his argument: ``The only possible purpose for the
((sodomy)) statute is to regulate the private conduct of consenting
adults, the public gains no benefit, and the individual is unduly
oppressed by the invasion of the right to privacy. Consequently, we
must conclude that the legislation exceeds the permissible bounds
of the police power.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan,
dismayed at how the nation's highest court had begun to renege on
individual rights in its reading of the federal Constitution,
called on state courts to ``step into the breach'' and interpret
their own state constitutions more expansively in the service of
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia high court has righted a grievous wrong. Other state
courts should follow its lead _ in the service of freedom.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a cramped hallway, about eight tiny reindeer
lengths from the Diplomatic Room fireplace, White House cooks were
merrily stamping out gingerbread men on an autumn afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every slow day is a day we use for Christmas preparation,''
explained pastry chef Roland Mesnier, guiding a visitor past this
culinary assembly line. ``If there is an empty corner in the White
House, you will find somebody rolling cookies there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Santa's elves, some White House staffers regard Christmas
preparation as a never-ending job.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday (Dec. 7), First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will
unveil the 1998 Christmas theme and decorations at the White House,
beginning a traditional round of seasonal tours and parties at the
presidential home.
</P>
<P>
   During the following three weeks, about 15,000 guests will
marvel at Christmas trees laden with 50,000 lights and handmade
ornaments from across America, hear seasonal songs of musicians
from every state, and consume 50,000 cookies, half a ton of
fruitcake and 250 gallons of eggnog.
</P>
<P>
   Such festivities take a tad of forethought. The fruitcake, for
instance, was baked in June and stacked in refrigerators in
two-pound blocks to await the holiday parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, right now I'm making mental notes for next year of
what didn't work very well this year,'' said Nancy Clarke, head
florist at the tiny flower shop beneath the North Portico. ``When
Christmas decorations are still up, we start talking as a group
about next Christmas because that's the best time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a year-long project,'' agreed Capricia
Marshall, the social secretary in charge of all White House events.
``We start in early January thinking about the theme for that
year's Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of a theme for the official Christmas tree in the
Blue Room was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961. The first theme
was the ``Nutcracker Suite.'' Last year's theme was ``Santa's
Workshop,'' and ornament designer Christopher Radko served as an
artist coordinator to carry the theme throughout the White House.
</P>
<P>
   This year's theme is a secret, but Marshall hinted that it was
``super sweet'' and noted that New York cake designer Colette
Peters is the coordinating artist.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was chosen in February after a series of meetings
between White House staffers and Mrs. Clinton. Mesnier was
consulted on how to portray the theme in the gingerbread house he
makes each Christmas. Clarke envisioned ornaments for the Blue Room
tree. Mrs. Clinton had the final say.
</P>
<P>
   Then the White House enlisted creative people from around the
country _ everything from glass blowers to fashion designers to
needlepoint artists _ to come up with ornaments and decorations.
Governor's spouses helped select artists from their state.
</P>
<P>
   By early summer, Mesnier had begun to prepare the Christmas
party fare. Fruitcake is first because it keeps well in
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fruitcake recipe that was designed for the White
House,'' said Mesnier, who was born in France and was working at
the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia when he was hired by
Rosalynn Carter in 1980. ``It has been changed every year since
I've been here. We always try to make it more earthier, if you
will, by reducing the sugar content, the calories and all that. ...
We use naturally dried fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have come to me who swear that they hate
fruitcake. They detest it. But when they taste this one, they
absolutely love it,'' said Mesnier.
</P>
<P>
   Also months ahead of time, an assortment of unbaked Christmas
cookies is cut out and frozen raw. During the party season, ``we
bake them as we go along to serve fresh,'' the chef explained.
</P>
<P>
   Other traditional White House Christmas treats are completed
months ahead and put in freezers. Yule logs are made of coffee
mousse with walnuts and coated with chocolate. There are Christmas
cakes _ a raspberry and chocolate combination, pumpkin cake, double
applesauce cake, and an orange cake similar to pound cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all, there will be 120,000 cookies or pieces of cake
served,'' Mesnier estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for this year's gingerbread house were finished in August.
The sheets of gingerbread were baked in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gingerbread must be very dry,'' said Mesnier. ``I do not
use any support that is not food. Many people use cardboard or
plastic to support the house. This house is totally food _
gingerbread, chocolate, sugar icing. It weighs close to 150
pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Florist Nancy Clarke can't freeze her creations for later
presentation, but plans decorations down to the last red bow and
poinsettia.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, she focused her digital camera on all the public
White House rooms. The digital images were converted into
computerized stage sets where the virtual furniture could be moved
around and would-be decorations inserted or removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the easiest way to do it. We have an instant visual,''
she explained. Then she and Marshall, the social secretary, made a
presentation to Mrs. Clinton on proposed Christmas decorations for
each room.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady ``is very hands-on in the entire process,'' said
Marshall. Once the presentation is made, Mrs. Clinton ``starts
tweaking it. She has wonderful ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke oversees a staff of four fulltime floral designers and 11
part-timers. They are reinforced by 60 volunteers to decorate the
White House for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volunteers come in the Monday after Thanksgiving. They go
to our warehouse in Riverdale, Md., and start working on bows and
all of the arrangements and getting everything prepared,'' said
Clarke, who was a White House volunteer herself for several years
before being hired by Nancy Reagan in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is readied to move into the White House on the Friday
before the Kennedy Center Honors feting prominent artists, which
are always held on a Sunday (this year on Dec. 6). The decorating
is finished on Saturday night, and the next afternoon the First
Family welcomes the Kennedy Center honorees to a White House
freshly decked out in holiday finery.
</P>
<P>
   This busy weekend requires some precision. Wreaths are ordered
from a company in Oregon _ 168 small wreaths, 92 larger ones. Last
year, 486 feet of garland were draped inside the White House and
another 862 feet on the grounds. The official Christmas tree in the
Blue Room, chosen by the National Christmas Tree Association, has
more than 6,000 lights and 2,000 ornaments. There are a dozen or so
other Christmas trees in the White House and on the grounds. The
traditional White House creche has 47 figures. The decorations will
include over 1,000 bows.
</P>
<P>
   All must be in place for about 50 official parties and for
thousands of visitors who will go through on special holiday tours.
</P>
<P>
   Menus and guest lists are planned months in advance, said
Marshall. About 2,500 entertainers are recruited from around the
country for three weeks of activities. Security checks must be
completed on everyone long before they actually enter the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall attends all the parties, making sure everything goes as
planned and taking mental notes on how to do the 1999 holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``And oh, yes, there's the Christmas card,'' remembered
Marshall. In February or so, Mrs. Clinton selects an artist to
paint the traditional White House card. They talk about what to
depict _ the First Lady picks the scene _ and the finished cards
will be mailed out Monday (Dec. 7).
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure this time of year,'' conceded chef
Mesnier. ``I wake up in the middle of the night and think of
Christmas.''

   LASER-POINTERS (San Francisco) _ To prepubescent boys, they're
the coolest gadgets on the market. To school teachers, they're a
vexatious distraction. To unsuspecting drivers, they're a hazard.
And to cops on the street, they are a serious threat. The battle
over laser pointers _ which can beam a red light as far as 1,500
feet _ is no longer child's play. By DIANA WALSH.

   CALIF-CLEMENCY (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Although California

INGRAHAM.

   NORMAN-ROCKWELL (Stockbridge, Mass.) _ Ye denizens of uber-cool
galleries and jiggy art happenings, admit it you like Norman
Rockwell. It's OK. Rockwell is no longer a guilty pleasure of the

which possess an authenticity and insight comparable to the Old

   HIP-HOP (San Francisco) _ More white kids may buy rap records,

George _ hip-hop's prolific chronicler _ despite wishes by some

<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Every time I hear another
Republican echo the Bush brothers and speak of the GOP becoming the
party of ``compassionate conservatism,'' the same image comes to
mind: A group of white folks (wearing very nice clothes and pained

 &HT;    Society needs better handle on pharmaceutical fixes for
childhood
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Another day at Apothecary Elementary. Jason,
George, Alex, Samantha and Sandy are on Ritalin. Mary is on
lithium. Thomas is on Welbutrin. Horace is on Luvox.
</P>
<P>
   An observer is left to wonder if the harried school nurse is the
one who needs medication the most.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar tells his teacher, ``I need my medicine to control
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry gets frantic at noon one day when it's time for his
Ritalin and the nurse, who's tending to a playground wound, hasn't
a free hand to get into the locked medicine cabinet. Jerry's state
of anxiety is not due to chemical withdrawal but the fact that his
parents have convinced him that without his pill he will be a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I have heard a student
desperate to take his or her medication at the exact time it has
been prescribed because if it is late, 'I won't be able to be
good,' or 'I won't be able to keep myself from doing bad things,'''
related a Waco educator.
</P>
<P>
   There's no sense jumping to any conclusion about Jerry or any
students like him. The clinical consensus is that some children
need medication to deal with severe behavior problems. For some
children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
other clinical problems, medicine is a godsend. For others
misdiagnosed or mildly afflicted, however, a pill may doing a poor
job of what counseling, parental discipline or, maybe, decent
nutrition, basic nurturing and stability at home would.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked on Ritalin
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, unlike the popularity of breakthrough remedies that
assure more people get treated for medical conditions and fewer
suffer, the escalating number of American children on Ritalin is
cause for concern rather than for relief.
</P>
<P>
   The global breakdown of Ritalin use may be the most telling flag
raised on this issue. Ninety percent of the Ritalin prescribed on
the planet is used in this country. That's whole continents that
deal with the same problems American parents face in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Experts who gathered in Bethesda, Md., to discuss Ritalin use
came away with the consensus that Ritalin does work.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is the difficulty of diagnosing the problem
for which Ritalin is the answer. Parents are urged to seek multiple
opinions from physicians before turning to medication to solve a
child's behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   Too often underlying all of this is society's quick-fix
penchant: the pining for a magic pill to make things better.
</P>
<P>
   Making the medication fit the need is only one challenge within
the scope of the uniquely American condition, highlighted on the
cover of last week's Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk
</P>
<P>
   The other issue is informing and involving parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and children need to be educated about the 'power' of
mood-altering medication,'' said the educator to whom I spoke.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that as a prerequisite for a school nurse assuming
responsibility for medicating their children on a daily basis,
parents be required to attend a workshop featuring a medical expert
or, at minimum, a talk by the school nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The key purpose of such a workshop would be to convince the
parents that medication alone can't be the cure-all for behavior
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A talk from a professional would be a useful experience for the
parents who participated. Those who didn't would have to come to
school to medicate their children. So doing, they would get an
eye-opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``A visit to the nurse's office in any elementary school around
noon would give an idea of the huge number of children lining up,''
she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was something of the Soviet era about this week's
television film from Boris Yeltsin's hospital suite. Russia's
president, stricken with fever, pneumonia and perhaps other
ailments, gesticulated mechanically at his Chinese visitor, Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the two men were ``reaffirming the principle of a
multipolar world,'' which is code for grumbling about America's
far-reaching influence. But no soundtrack accompanied the footage.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's handlers presumably do not want the world to hear the
incoherence into which Russia's first elected leader has lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin courtiers down the centuries have realized that czars in
their dotage and decrepit party bosses have their uses. They can be
starved of information and cajoled into scrawling their signatures
on documents they hardly understand _ even declarations of war.
</P>
<P>
   The longer a ruler can be kept alive, the longer his cronies can
hang on. And at times when all the alternatives seem worse, people
outside Russia have often concluded that indecision and drift in
the Kremlin, under a moribund monarch, is a state of affairs they
can live with.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Yeltsin this calculation no longer holds. The
murder of Galina Starovoitova, one of the liberal politicians who
taught Yeltsin what democracy meant, suggests that Russia cannot
drift much longer.
</P>
<P>
   So does the refusal of the Communists who dominate Russia's
parliament to censure one of their number for an anti-Semitic
tirade.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became totally enfeebled a few months ago, Yeltsin
himself gave warning that the forces of authoritarian chauvinism
were growing in Russia. Russia urgently needs a steadier hand than
his to keep those forces at bay and lead it through the economic
dangers ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of power need not be as scary as some outsiders
fear. If Yeltsin steps down, the presidency will go automatically
for three months to Yevgeny Primakov, the prime minister, before a
new presidential election is held.
</P>
<P>
   He is already in practice Russia's most important politician,
although he would acquire huge powers over foreign and defense
policy as president.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, westerners would have been horrified by the
prospect of this former cold warrior and spymaster taking charge of
Russia. But, since becoming prime minister in September, Primakov
has won cautious international approval.
</P>
<P>
   He has calmed the febrile atmosphere of Russian politics, and
temporarily eased _ though certainly not resolved _ the economic
crisis. He has resisted pressure to throw nonexistent public funds
at industry or the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   After some hard bargaining with provincial governors, the
prospect of regions declaring total economic independence has
receded, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy too, things could be worse. Primakov is a
friend of Saddam Hussein and has opposed the use of force against
Iraq, but he has not created insuperable obstacles to western
policy in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The realism he has shown in recent dealings with the West is in
line with his record as foreign minister after 1996: loud
complaints about NATO's enlargement plans eventually gave way to
grudging acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, a Russia under President Primakov would be less
dangerous than a Russia with no real president at all.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that, if he were then to run for election,
Primakov stands a good chance of being confirmed as president. But
his own appetite to stay on is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The other front-runners _ Yuri Luzhkov and Alexander Lebed _
have more obvious defects.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has a deep grasp of market economics (although they both
claim to support the idea) and perhaps neither can be trusted to
resist the temptations of populism or assertive nationalism.
However, these men are at least partly known quantities, with their
own records of pragmatism and success.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Moscow, Luzhkov has presided over a frothy expansion
of the city's economy, albeit flawed by crime and cronyism. Lebed
can, and often does, claim to have stopped two wars _ by
engineering a cease-fire in Moldova and by negotiating a dignified
exit for Russia's troops from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   He is running his province badly. In the past, his professions
of admiration for Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and
his occasional outbursts of religious and ethnic prejudice, have
caused alarm. But many westerners consider him clumsy rather than
sinister, and a quick learner of the facts of international life.
</P>
<P>
   This assessment may understate the risks of a Lebed presidency.
But these have to be weighed against the risks of Russia limping on
with a president in name only.
</P>
<P>
   What matters more than the identity of Russia's leader is the
principle that the next head of state should be chosen by due
constitutional process. A democratic transfer of power would be a
remarkable landmark.
</P>
<P>
   In a country as unpredictable as Russia, it is mildly reassuring
that most people seem at present to assume that Yeltsin's successor
will be freely elected. The sooner this process begins, the
better. &QL;

on documents they hardly understand _ even declarations of war.
</P>
<P>
   The longer a ruler can be kept alive, the longer his cronies can
hang on. And at times when all the alternatives seem worse, people
outside Russia have often concluded that indecision and drift in
the Kremlin, under a moribund monarch, is a state of affairs they
can live with.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Yeltsin this calculation no longer holds. The
murder of Galina Starovoitova, one of the liberal politicians who
taught Yeltsin what democracy meant, suggests that Russia cannot
drift much longer.
</P>
<P>
   So does the refusal of the Communists who dominate Russia's
parliament to censure one of their number for an anti-Semitic
tirade.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became totally enfeebled a few months ago, Yeltsin
himself gave warning that the forces of authoritarian chauvinism
were growing in Russia. Russia urgently needs a steadier hand than
his to keep those forces at bay and lead it through the economic
dangers ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of power need not be as scary as some outsiders
fear. If Yeltsin steps down, the presidency will go automatically
for three months to Yevgeny Primakov, the prime minister, before a
new presidential election is held.
</P>
<P>
   He is already in practice Russia's most important politician,
although he would acquire huge powers over foreign and defense
policy as president.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, westerners would have been horrified by the
prospect of this former cold warrior and spymaster taking charge of
Russia. But, since becoming prime minister in September, Primakov
has won cautious international approval.
</P>
<P>
   He has calmed the febrile atmosphere of Russian politics, and
temporarily eased _ though certainly not resolved _ the economic
crisis. He has resisted pressure to throw nonexistent public funds
at industry or the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   After some hard bargaining with provincial governors, the
prospect of regions declaring total economic independence has
receded, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy too, things could be worse. Primakov is a
friend of Saddam Hussein and has opposed the use of force against
Iraq, but he has not created insuperable obstacles to western
policy in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The realism he has shown in recent dealings with the West is in
line with his record as foreign minister after 1996: loud
complaints about NATO's enlargement plans eventually gave way to
grudging acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, a Russia under President Primakov would be less
dangerous than a Russia with no real president at all.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that, if he were then to run for election,
Primakov stands a good chance of being confirmed as president. But
his own appetite to stay on is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The other front-runners _ Yuri Luzhkov and Alexander Lebed _
have more obvious defects.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has a deep grasp of market economics (although they both
claim to support the idea) and perhaps neither can be trusted to
resist the temptations of populism or assertive nationalism.
However, these men are at least partly known quantities, with their
own records of pragmatism and success.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Moscow, Luzhkov has presided over a frothy expansion
of the city's economy, albeit flawed by crime and cronyism. Lebed
can, and often does, claim to have stopped two wars _ by
engineering a cease-fire in Moldova and by negotiating a dignified
exit for Russia's troops from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   He is running his province badly. In the past, his professions
of admiration for Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and
his occasional outbursts of religious and ethnic prejudice, have
caused alarm. But many westerners consider him clumsy rather than
sinister, and a quick learner of the facts of international life.
</P>
<P>
   This assessment may understate the risks of a Lebed presidency.
But these have to be weighed against the risks of Russia limping on
with a president in name only.
</P>
<P>
   What matters more than the identity of Russia's leader is the
principle that the next head of state should be chosen by due
constitutional process. A democratic transfer of power would be a
remarkable landmark.
</P>
<P>
   In a country as unpredictable as Russia, it is mildly reassuring
that most people seem at present to assume that Yeltsin's successor
will be freely elected. The sooner this process begins, the
better. &QL;

   There was something of the Soviet era about this week's
television film from Boris Yeltsin's hospital suite. Russia's
president, stricken with fever, pneumonia and perhaps other
ailments, gesticulated mechanically at his Chinese visitor, Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the two men were ``reaffirming the principle of a
multipolar world,'' which is code for grumbling about America's
far-reaching influence. But no soundtrack accompanied the footage.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's handlers presumably do not want the world to hear the
incoherence into which Russia's first elected leader has lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin courtiers down the centuries have realized that czars in
their dotage and decrepit party bosses have their uses. They can be
starved of information and cajoled into scrawling their signatures
on documents they hardly understand _ even declarations of war.
</P>

<P>
   Everything has changed, and nothing has changed. On Nov. 3,
America's voters made it clear that, whatever Bill Clinton might
have done to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky, they did not
want him removed from office for it.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19 the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, admitted to
the House Judiciary Committee that his inquiry had come up dry on
Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, and all the other vaguely
malodorous dealings that seemed to suggest a ``pattern and
practice'' of criminal behavior by the president.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the impeachment inquiry, never hale, is dying. And
yet, as Starr laid out in compelling detail, the crimes he has
judged impeachable remain just as felonious as before.
</P>
<P>
   Should a man _ especially a man charged by his office
``faithfully to execute the laws'' _ be allowed to lie to a grand
jury, obstruct justice and tamper with witnesses?
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has taken the view that, once caught out in such
blatant lying, Clinton should have shown some shame and respect for
his office by resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was clear that he felt no such shame, we settled for
impeachment as the constitutionally acceptable way for Congress to
investigate, and if necessary remove, an erring chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed possible that the House Judiciary Committee, under the
eminently decent Henry Hyde, would carry out a careful inquiry that
would tie up some of Starr's loose ends and even uncover new
evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened has been very different, though not, alas,
unforeseeable. Impeachment is always a political process as much as
a judicial one: it is a dangerous course when public opinion is not
behind it, and more so when only one political party supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that they may be digging their own political graves,
Republican committee members are scrambling to finish the inquiry
in the two and a bit weeks that are left in the legislative year.
</P>
<P>
   This is absurd. Starr took four years and $40 million to uncover
what he did; and, though this was vastly too long and vastly too
expensive, serious inquiry requires much more effort from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the committee called Starr as first witness in a clear
attempt to cut the process short; and, by failing to question him
with any incisiveness, showed that its chief interest was to score
what political points it could, and then shut up shop.
</P>
<P>
   A shambles like this brings the process of impeachment into
disrepute. That the affair is ending this way is deplorable, but
there it is: shutting up shop now looks the best option.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways to bring to book a president who has broken
the law. But all of them become harder, if not impossible, once an
impeachment has been tried and rejected, as this one would be. In
that sense, an impeachment inquiry of this tepid sort simply plays
into the president's hands. Its failure will look like a victory
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Democrats agree that there should be punishment of some
sort for the contempt for his office that Clinton has displayed.
Censure is often mentioned, and would be easy to get through
Congress, requiring only a simple majority in both houses. But it
is probably unconstitutional: Congress can censure its own members,
but not members of another branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   When it was last used against a president (Andrew Jackson in
1834), the censure was quickly overturned. Besides, censure is an
empty gesture. It exacts no further penalty, and would also
probably immunize the president from subsequent prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that the White House seems to be angling for a
compromise involving censure makes the point plain: it wouldn't
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But a trial would. Presidents, once out of office, are liable to
prosecution in the courts like any other citizen. Such a trial
would be unprecedented, but far from impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence has been gathered; the special prosecutor (who has
the power to bring charges in an ordinary criminal trial) is more
than ready; and, as early as January 2001, ex-President Clinton
could be called to answer for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The chief crime with which he would be charged, perjury before a
grand jury, is not one that courts take lightly _ still less when
the perpetrator was, at the time, the guardian of the country's
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a court appearance in 2001 _ in the Paula Jones case
_ was exactly what Clinton was expecting before the Supreme Court
ruled, unwisely in retrospect, that the suit should be brought
forward.
</P>
<P>
   This reckless and mendacious man knew he would have to be held
to account eventually. There seems no reason why he and the country
should not wait a little longer for the punishment to come. The
only intolerable outcome would be if he were allowed to get away. &QL;

injection or gas pellet will actually be guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A conference this November at Northwestern University Law School
in Chicago highlighted a striking fact related to capital
punishment: since 1976, 75 American men and women have been
convicted of capital crimes, sentenced to death, and later found
innocent _ roughly one for every seven prisoners who have been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day conference brought together 30 of those released
from death row, some of whom came within hours of their appointment
with the executioner.
</P>
<P>
   How do innocent men and women end up on death row? Most of the
75 were accused of heinous crimes for which prosecutors, who are
elected officials, were under pressure to find someone to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors were more than overzealous in the case of
Rolando Cruz, who spent ten years on death row in Illinois for the
rape and murder of a 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was put on trial and convicted despite the fact that a
repeat sex offender and murderer had already confessed to the
crime; and he was freed only after a police officer admitted that
he had lied under oath about a key piece of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities fare particularly poorly in capital cases. Studies
have consistently found that blacks are more likely than whites to
draw death sentences for similar crimes; blacks who harm whites
fare worst of all. Clarence Brandley, one of the men on stage in
Chicago, is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Brandley was one of five caretakers who were considered suspects
when a 16-year-old white girl was raped and murdered in a Texas
high school. But he was the only black.
</P>
<P>
   When a Texas police officer interviewed Brandley and another
caretaker on the day of the murder, he supposedly said, ``One of
you two is going to hang for this.'' He then turned to Brandley and
said, ``Since you're the nigger, you're elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that hairs found on the body suggested a white killer
was withheld from the defense, and Brandley spent ten years on
death row before his sentence was overturned; the evidence and
testimony at his trial were proved unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Being poor does not help. At best, public defenders are
underpaid and overloaded with cases; at worst, they are
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers dealing with tax and patent issues need special
qualifications; lawyers defending death-penalty cases do not. Most
states, although they put massive resources into prosecuting
capital cases, put virtually none into guaranteeing an adequate
defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the highest reimbursement a public defender can
receive in a capital case, including all the time spent on
preparation and the trial, is $2,000. When the Alabama legislature
passed a bill this year raising the cap, Governor Fob James vetoed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the process of selecting a jury in death-penalty cases has
a bias against the innocent. Potential jurors who oppose the death
penalty are excused, creating ``death-qualified'' juries.
</P>
<P>
   Discharging such people skews the jury pool towards those who
are more rule-bound, trusting of authority, and likely to convict.
And once an individual is convicted, the appeals process focuses on
questions of procedure rather than guilt, often making it difficult
to introduce new evidence that points to innocence.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Americans seem unbothered by all this. The Death
Penalty Information Center has found that 77 percent of Americans
favor capital punishment. But death-penalty opponents see subtle
changes in public opinion lurking beneath such data.
</P>
<P>
   When the same people are asked whether they think murderers
should be given the death penalty or life in prison without parole,
slightly more Americans choose prison (44 percent) than death (41
percent).
</P>
<P>
   And the Death Penalty Information Survey records that nearly 60
percent of respondents felt at least some doubts about capital
punishment when _ as at the conference in Chicago _ they were made
to consider that men and women sentenced to death might be found
innocent later.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the death penalty, accepting that it is most
unlikely to disappear, would at least like to increase the
resources available to defendants in capital cases, and require
some minimum level of competence from lawyers and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   They would also require confessions to be audiotaped or
videotaped; at least ten death-row inmates in Illinois say they
were tortured into confessing.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers want the appeals process to be more open to bona fide
claims of innocence. Illinois took a step in this direction last
year when it passed a law guaranteeing death-row inmates access to
technology, such as DNA analysis, that was not available at the
time of their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, death-penalty critics would exclude or limit evidence
provided by prison informers, many of whom have learned to milk the
system for privileges by relaying ``confessions'' overheard in
prison. &QL;

AUTHORITIES SEE RED OVER LASER-POINTER MISCHIEF 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To young boys, they are the coolest gadgets on
the market. To school teachers, they are a vexatious distraction.
To unsuspecting drivers, they are a hazard. And to police officers,
they are a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Laser pointers _ the pen-sized devices that can beam an intense
red light as far as 1,500 feet _ are no longer child's play.
Several jurisdictions on the East Coast have already restricted the
sale of laser pointers and now the mayor of San Ramon, Calif.,
hopes his town will be the first on the West Coast to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Byron Athan said several drivers have complained recently
about being the target of red-dotting, a not-so-funny game in which
youngsters aim the laser pointers at passing cars, often focusing
on the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are getting to be a nuisance,'' Athan said. ``We want to
do something before we have any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Athan has asked the city attorney to draft legislation making it
illegal for children under 18 to use the laser pointers unless an
adult is present. The full City Council is expected to review the
proposal sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictions have already been passed in Westchester
County, N.Y., Ocean City, Md., and Chicago Ridge, Ill. Proposed
restrictions are under review in New York City and before the New
Jersey Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Some restrictions have made it illegal for children to possess a
laser, even if their parents gave it to them, while others have
banned the sale of the devices to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Pen-sized laser pointers, invented as a visual aid for
boardrooms and classrooms, became a toy of choice for adolescents
as the price of the devices dropped from $300 to as low as $8.
Manufacturers have targeted the preteen market by designing
interchangeable attachments that beam red hearts, basketballs, or
naked girls.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters who own lasers say they are just having a little fun
aiming the lights at the ceilings of their darkened bedrooms or at
outside walls after dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light kind of amazes us that it goes so far,'' said Jake
Cohen, 12, of San Francisco, who received a laser pointer as a
birthday present earlier this month. ``We shine it outside and see
how far it can go on buildings. It can go at least three or four
blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cohen limits his aim to trees and other inanimate
objects, red dots are showing up on movie screens, at football
games, school dances, on women's breasts, younger siblings and
occasionally the eye of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one in my desk drawer right now,'' said Judy Dong,
assistant principal at Hoover Middle School in San Francisco, when
asked whether students take them to school. ``When we see them, we
confiscate them.''
</P>
<P>
   While many red-dot antics are harmless, some are not.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration and the American Academy of
Ophthalmology have issued alerts to parents and school officials
about the risk to eyesight from laser light.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is unlikely that anyone would be injured by a brief
flash from a laser pointer, it is apparent that children may misuse
them. It is important that parents and school officials realize
that pointers are not toys,'' said Dr. Martin Mainster of the
American Academy of Ophthalmology. ``Adults need to take laser
pointers seriously and not allow children to play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen school bus drivers in Florida filed complaints
after being hit directly in the eye by lasers while driving
students.
</P>
<P>
   In Alameda County, Calif., several truck drivers, motorists and
a deputy sheriff reported being unsettled by someone who flashed a
laser onto their cars and sometimes into their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a dazzling effect on the pupil. You get these flashing
lights in your head and it blinds you,'' said Lt. Dave Hoig of the
Alameda County Sheriff's Department. ``If someone gets it in their
eyes and they are operating a two-ton vehicle and can't see ... the
likelihood of an accident or near-accident is great.''
</P>
<P>
   The police say they are unnerved when they are targeted by a red
dot because the dot is identical to the aiming devices attached to
rifles.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dean DeJesus, who owns a retail kiosk in San Francisco, stopped
carrying the lasers earlier this month despite brisk sales. He said
he has many friends who are police officers who told him they were
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision not to carry them so that my (police)
friends wouldn't fear for their lives,'' he said, ``and because I
couldn't have it on my conscience, as remote as the possibility may
be, that a cop sees the beam and retaliates against a (kid) who was
just out having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed to me that the fun factor was outweighed by the
safety factor,'' DeJesus said.

   CHICAGO _ Some time between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the
United States will execute its 500th prison inmate since the death
penalty was reinstated in 1976.

   TEXARKANA, ARK. _ Two cities with one name _ one in Arkansas,
the other in Texas _ meet invisibly in the middle of State Line
Avenue. Texarkana, Arkansas, and Texarkana, Texas, share an
airport, chamber of commerce and a library; the federal courthouse
and post office is in the center of the avenue, displaying both
state flags.
</P>
<P>
   But the two cities have different mayors, different sheriffs and
two sets of city government. Streets are numbered differently, so
that drivers, crossing State Line Avenue at 14th Street on the
Texas side, wind up on 12th Street in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In the bi-state Justice Building on the same avenue, the Bowie
County, Texas, sheriff's department has its headquarters on the
Arkansas side; the Arkansas-side city police department is in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   These Siamese-twin cities, 143 miles from Little Rock and 181
miles from Dallas, are also divided into a world of haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor stores, pawn shops and fast-food restaurants clutter the
Arkansas side; the Texas one booms with banks, restaurants,
department stores, car-dealers and the city's only shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   The two worlds of Texarkana sadly sum up an unintended lesson:
Arkansas's century-old usury law is not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas is a state with a populist tradition of limiting the
powerful, and especially of regulating the size and clout of
financial institutions. The state banned multibank holding
companies until 1983; and, since 1874, it has restricted interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Although most other states have some limits on interest rates
and fees, none is as restrictive as the Arkansas usury law, and no
other state has such a law as part of its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest incarnation, the interest-rate ceiling on consumer
loans is restricted to 5 percent above the Federal Reserve's
discount rate _ the amount the Fed charges banks for overnight
loans. At present, with the discount rate at 4 percent; 9 percent
is the most an Arkansas bank can charge.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law consider it a cornerstone of consumer
protection in Arkansas. Bankers argue, on the contrary, that the
law strangles economic growth by limiting credit and forcing money
to leave Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   It also hurts those who cannot put down the total price of a car
or a stove, since banks _ if they cannot adjust their rates
according to the credit risk _ simply will not take on loan-seekers
who may have a bad credit history.
</P>
<P>
   The poor must then turn to local loan sharks who illegally
charge interest rates of as much as 300 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   In order to compete a bit with Texarkana, Texas, a 1977 Arkansas
law exempts Texarkana, Ark., from the Arkansas state income tax.
Texas does not have such a tax at all. As a tradeoff for the
exemption, the Arkansas side collects a 1 percent higher state
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the income-tax exemption is obvious: if
Texarkana, Ark., had to pay the state income tax, residents and
business would have even more reason swiftly to move to Texas. Yet
even with the tax break, Texarkana, Ark., still cannot compete with
Texas because of the usury law.
</P>
<P>
   And that is unlikely to change any time soon. Since the usury
cap was an amendment to the state's constitution, only a statewide
referendum or federal legislation, which would override the state's
constitution, can abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   But Arkansans soundly rejected usury referendums in 1988 and
1990. On that last occasion, more than 65 percent of voters turned
down an amendment that would have raised the interest-rate ceiling
to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Arkansans continue to think they are being wise in the
short-term, the end result could be the demise of many of the
state's locally owned banks.
</P>
<P>
   It could also spell still worse times for Texarkana, Ark. As
out-of-state banks, like the ones in Texarkana, Texas, offer more
flexible credit packages, businesses and owners of expensive homes
will continue to decamp to the Texas side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Already, big business stays away from Texarkana, Ark., because
consumers prefer shopping on the Texas side. As a result, it is
getting easier every day to tell these Siamese-twin cities apart. &QL;

   Liquor stores, pawn shops and fast-food restaurants clutter the
Arkansas side; the Texas one booms with banks, restaurants,
department stores, car-dealers and the city's only shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   The two worlds of Texarkana sadly sum up an unintended lesson:
Arkansas's century-old usury law is not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas is a state with a populist tradition of limiting the
powerful, and especially of regulating the size and clout of
financial institutions. The state banned multibank holding
companies until 1983; and, since 1874, it has restricted interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Although most other states have some limits on interest rates
and fees, none is as restrictive as the Arkansas usury law, and no
other state has such a law as part of its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest incarnation, the interest-rate ceiling on consumer
loans is restricted to 5 percent above the Federal Reserve's
discount rate _ the amount the Fed charges banks for overnight
loans. At present, with the discount rate at 4 percent; 9 percent
is the most an Arkansas bank can charge.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law consider it a cornerstone of consumer
protection in Arkansas. Bankers argue, on the contrary, that the
law strangles economic growth by limiting credit and forcing money
to leave Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   It also hurts those who cannot put down the total price of a car
or a stove, since banks _ if they cannot adjust their rates
according to the credit risk _ simply will not take on loan-seekers
who may have a bad credit history.
</P>
<P>
   The poor must then turn to local loan sharks who illegally
charge interest rates of as much as 300 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   In order to compete a bit with Texarkana, Texas, a 1977 Arkansas
law exempts Texarkana, Ark., from the Arkansas state income tax.
Texas does not have such a tax at all. As a tradeoff for the
exemption, the Arkansas side collects a 1 percent higher state
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the income-tax exemption is obvious: if
Texarkana, Ark., had to pay the state income tax, residents and
business would have even more reason swiftly to move to Texas. Yet
even with the tax break, Texarkana, Ark., still cannot compete with
Texas because of the usury law.
</P>
<P>
   And that is unlikely to change any time soon. Since the usury
cap was an amendment to the state's constitution, only a statewide
referendum or federal legislation, which would override the state's
constitution, can abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   But Arkansans soundly rejected usury referendums in 1988 and
1990. On that last occasion, more than 65 percent of voters turned
down an amendment that would have raised the interest-rate ceiling
to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Arkansans continue to think they are being wise in the
short-term, the end result could be the demise of many of the
state's locally owned banks.
</P>
<P>
   It could also spell still worse times for Texarkana, Ark. As
out-of-state banks, like the ones in Texarkana, Texas, offer more
flexible credit packages, businesses and owners of expensive homes
will continue to decamp to the Texas side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Already, big business stays away from Texarkana, Ark., because
consumers prefer shopping on the Texas side. As a result, it is
getting easier every day to tell these Siamese-twin cities apart. &QL;

   BAGHDAD AND IRBIL _ An alleged assassination attempt on his
deputy, a powwow in London for 15 opposition groups hoping to
topple his regime, a call for him and his lieutenants to be tried
for war crimes, and yet another row with U.N. weapons inspectors:
on the face of it, the past week has brought nothing but bad news
for Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Is he losing sleep?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the place where Hussein sleeps each night, let alone
the quality of the sleep he gets, is a tightly guarded secret. But,
on closer examination, the events of the past week showed not how
tenuous his grip on power has become, but rather how far
international efforts to loosen it have yet to go.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money in Baghdad says Hussein is sleeping like a baby.
</P>
<P>
   That is not how the various Iraqi opposition groups assembled in
London on Nov. 23 saw things. The Iraqi regime is not as entrenched
as it seems, insisted Shia Islamists and secular nationalists
alike, doubtless salivating at the prospect of the $97 million that
America has said it will spend on groups trying to bring down
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans looked for likely candidates for their largesse
and the British mused about setting up a war-crimes tribunal on
Iraq, akin to the Bosnian model. But the opposition wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella group
claiming to represent all the opposition, told both American and
British officials that it would need some sort of territorial base
within Iraq, protected by foreign air power, from which to work for
the government's demise.
</P>
<P>
   America has tried this method once before, when it set up the
INC in Irbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish enclave in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the CIA, and with American and British aircraft
keeping the Iraqi air force at bay, the INC was supposed to swoop
down from the hills at the head of an army of baggy-trousered
peshmerga and sweep the Iraqi authorities away. Instead, the INC
found itself the victim of factional fighting between the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), one of the two main Kurdish
militias, asked Hussein for help against its rival, the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK). He gladly provided it, overrunning Irbil
in the process and forcing INC activists and the CIA to flee the
country or face his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kurdish factions now scoff at the thought of any
non-Kurdish opposition returning to the area. In the cool air of
their hilltop fastnesses, the toings and froings on the
Mesopotamian plain are distractions from the serious business of
building a viable Kurdish entity.
</P>
<P>
   Having signed a peace deal under American auspices in September,
the two sides are now bickering over its implementation. With the
maple leaves already fluttering to the ground, and the snow
spreading down the mountainsides, there will be no more fighting
before April.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the mustachioed warriors of Iraqi Kurdistan will pay
more attention to the battle unfolding on and across their northern
borders between the Turkish army and Turkey's own Kurdish rebels
than to any new adventures in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish factions depend on Hussein, both for cheap fuel and
for the smuggling business he encourages across northern Iraq.
Should any attempt at insurrection misfire, they point out, it
would be the people of Irbil, not the conference-goers in London,
who pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, they feel more secure with Hussein's weakened
regime at the center, and the American protection they enjoy so
long as it endures, than with the unpredictable outcome of an
internal coup. So the two main Kurdish parties sent only junior
representatives to the London meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Kurds, the Iraqi opposition looks flimsy. The
presence of so many groups in London illustrates how fractured and
ill-coordinated Hussein's enemies are.
</P>
<P>
   A senior KDP man says that inside Iraq, Ahmad Chalabi, the INC's
head, ``represents nothing.'' Although ordinary Iraqis do not dare
speak about the opposition to a foreigner, Chalabi's checkered
career both as a banker and a revolutionary is unlikely to impress
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds apart, few of the groups have any organization on the
ground. Even if the Shia Muslim rebels have retained their network
in southern Iraq after the brutal suppression of their insurrection
against Hussein in 1991, they have nothing to rival the Iraqi
army's tanks and artillery. Moreover, their Iranian backers are
refusing to work with America for Hussein's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Shias demonstrated their continued rebelliousness _ but also
their incompetence _ on Nov. 22, when someone in Kerbala, a
southern Shia city, tried to assassinate Izzat Ibrahim, Hussein's
deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).
</P>
<P>
   The assailant threw two grenades at Ibrahim's entourage, driving
through the dusty plaza that the Iraqi regime created when in 1991
it bulldozed the rebels' hideouts in the old souk.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim was not hurt, but bystanders were, allowing the regime
to denounce the ``cowardly crime that targeted the lives of
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the botched assassinations of Uday, Hussein's son, in 1996,
and Tariq Aziz, his mouthpiece, in 1980, the attack will probably
result in a police crackdown on the supposed perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Iraqi leadership has responded calmly. Aziz,
himself a member of the RCC, made a public appearance the next day
at a poetry festival where honey-tongued bards concocted unctuous
rhymes in praise of the regime. Neither in Baghdad, nor in Kerbala,
was there any sign of extra security on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers made brief mention of the attack before gliding
on to their daily tirade against Richard Butler, the head of
UNSCOM, whose job it is to disarm Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This ``enraged bull,'' as the local press puts it, has caused
Hussein far more bother than any opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   After the Iraqis bowed to the imminence of American bombs and
agreed to resume cooperation with UNSCOM, Butler demanded that they
produce a slew of documents deemed vital to UNSCOM's work.
</P>
<P>
   Risking renewed threat of American attack, the Iraqis wheeled
out official after official, looking fairly enraged themselves, to
argue that the papers had either already been handed over, or had
been destroyed, or never existed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis promised to show only one new document to UNSCOM, and
that in the presence of monitors from the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A badly split council issued a noncommittal statement that
reiterated its support for Butler without demanding that Iraq hand
over the disputed papers. But it also renewed the oil-for-food
deal, whereby Iraq sells oil to buy humanitarian goods, for six
months instead of the two the Iraqis think it should take to
complete the arms-control work.
</P>
<P>
   These differences will come to the fore during the
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's obligations promised by the
Security Council as soon as UNSCOM was up and running again.
</P>
<P>
   With Iraq demanding an end to sanctions, and America, its
bombers at the ready, refusing to countenance any such thing, there
could indeed be sleepless nights to come. &QL;

representatives to the London meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Kurds, the Iraqi opposition looks flimsy. The
presence of so many groups in London illustrates how fractured and
ill-coordinated Hussein's enemies are.
</P>
<P>
   A senior KDP man says that inside Iraq, Ahmad Chalabi, the INC's
head, ``represents nothing.'' Although ordinary Iraqis do not dare
speak about the opposition to a foreigner, Chalabi's checkered
career both as a banker and a revolutionary is unlikely to impress
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds apart, few of the groups have any organization on the
ground. Even if the Shia Muslim rebels have retained their network
in southern Iraq after the brutal suppression of their insurrection
against Hussein in 1991, they have nothing to rival the Iraqi
army's tanks and artillery. Moreover, their Iranian backers are
refusing to work with America for Hussein's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Shias demonstrated their continued rebelliousness _ but also
their incompetence _ on Nov. 22, when someone in Kerbala, a
southern Shia city, tried to assassinate Izzat Ibrahim, Hussein's
deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).
</P>
<P>
   The assailant threw two grenades at Ibrahim's entourage, driving
through the dusty plaza that the Iraqi regime created when in 1991
it bulldozed the rebels' hideouts in the old souk.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim was not hurt, but bystanders were, allowing the regime
to denounce the ``cowardly crime that targeted the lives of
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the botched assassinations of Uday, Hussein's son, in 1996,
and Tariq Aziz, his mouthpiece, in 1980, the attack will probably
result in a police crackdown on the supposed perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Iraqi leadership has responded calmly. Aziz,
himself a member of the RCC, made a public appearance the next day
at a poetry festival where honey-tongued bards concocted unctuous
rhymes in praise of the regime. Neither in Baghdad, nor in Kerbala,
was there any sign of extra security on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers made brief mention of the attack before gliding
on to their daily tirade against Richard Butler, the head of
UNSCOM, whose job it is to disarm Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This ``enraged bull,'' as the local press puts it, has caused
Hussein far more bother than any opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   After the Iraqis bowed to the imminence of American bombs and
agreed to resume cooperation with UNSCOM, Butler demanded that they
produce a slew of documents deemed vital to UNSCOM's work.
</P>
<P>
   Risking renewed threat of American attack, the Iraqis wheeled
out official after official, looking fairly enraged themselves, to
argue that the papers had either already been handed over, or had
been destroyed, or never existed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis promised to show only one new document to UNSCOM, and
that in the presence of monitors from the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A badly split council issued a noncommittal statement that
reiterated its support for Butler without demanding that Iraq hand
over the disputed papers. But it also renewed the oil-for-food
deal, whereby Iraq sells oil to buy humanitarian goods, for six
months instead of the two the Iraqis think it should take to
complete the arms-control work.
</P>
<P>
   These differences will come to the fore during the
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's obligations promised by the
Security Council as soon as UNSCOM was up and running again.
</P>
<P>
   With Iraq demanding an end to sanctions, and America, its
bombers at the ready, refusing to countenance any such thing, there
could indeed be sleepless nights to come. &QL;

   HONG KONG _ As a morning rush-hour crowd passes, a lone worker
changes the signs at one of Hong Kong's subway stops: the Victoria
Park/Daimaru exit is becoming just Victoria Park.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, four Chinese day tourists at Ocean Park, a
Hong Kong amusement park, chat happily over the lunch they have
brought with them, a rice and fish-ball meal wrapped in dried
banana leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Together these two small scenes tell a terrifying story about
the city's _ and the region's _ tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong used to be a favorite destination for Japan's
free-spending tourists, who came for cheap shopping, a glimpse of
colonial Britain and the city's fabled nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the 2.3 million Japanese visitors to Hong Kong accounted
for more than a fifth of the city's tourists, more than any other
country; and they spent more per visit (nearly $1,000 on average)
than anyone but the few rich Arabs. Five Japanese-owned retail
chains opened huge department stores to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hong Kong returned to China in July 1997, it lost its
colonial appeal. The region's simultaneous decline into economic
crisis left the Japanese poorer and Hong Kong, one of the few Asian
economies not to devalue its currency, one of the most expensive
spots in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese visitors dropped by a half over the next year, and the
consequences have been felt across the city. Next month Daimaru,
one of the Japanese department-store chains, will become the third
to close its doors in Hong Kong since the handover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the picture had appeared to brighten. Since
July, Hong Kong's tourist figures have been growing again, after
more than a year of decline.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Hong Kong's shops, most of these new tourists
are not returning Japanese but mainland Chinese, bused in on budget
day-excursions, lunch in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Average per-capita tourist spending in the first nine months of
the year was down 28 percent; even with the slight increase in
arrivals, total tourism income has fallen by more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is visible all over Southeast Asia. In recent years
tourism has accounted for more than 10 percent of the region's GDP
and an even bigger share of foreign-exchange earnings and jobs.
Nowhere has been hit as hard as Hong Kong, but over the past year
most destinations have seen tourist arrivals fall by 15-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The World Tourism Organization reckons that Asia will get 5
million fewer tourists this year than last, and send 7 million-8
million fewer tourists to Europe and North America, cutting at
least a percentage point off global tourism growth rates (to as
little as 1.5 percent this year, compared with 2.8 percent in 1997
and 5.6 percent in 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Most countries have not released tourism earnings numbers for
this year, but the crisis-hit second half of last year is a hint of
the carnage to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's arrivals were down 1.3 percent last year, but
tourism earnings fell by 14 percent. Thailand and Indonesia both
saw visitor numbers rise slightly, but revenues fell by 20 percent
and 16 percent, respectively. To a lesser extent, the same trend
blights Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   These figures all relate to dollar income from tourism. Currency
devaluations muddy the waters, but Hong Kong, with the statistical
clarity of an unchanged currency, is a good yardstick: Malaysians
are spending half what they did a year ago, Indonesians and Thais
two-thirds, Singaporeans and Filipinos three-quarters. This is a
bigger change than poor tipping.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the rest of the region, visitors will probably start
to relax their grip on their wallets as the economy improves. But
Hong Kong's tourism industry may never fully recover. The colonial
mystique is gone for good, as are many of the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland visitors were by far the fastest-growing group in
October, up by nearly a fifth, as Hong Kong relaxed a visa quota
instituted in a panic about illegal immigration after the handover.
Most stay in cheap hotels, or return before nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate Hong Kong, once Asia's tourist capital, will soon
be known as a cut-price theme park for Guangdong day-trippers. &QL;

BOOKS CAN BE DECORATIVE EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT READ ALL OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Coffee-table books are hardly ever read
cover-to-cover, but nonetheless, even though they are dust
collectors or sometimes conveniently hide a table scar, they can
add a touch of class to any room in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The size of a coffee-table book is tantamount to seeing a movie
on the big screen. The pictures are bigger and more lush than in
the average-sized hardcover book.
</P>
<P>
   Meals always look more appealing in a coffee-table book. Art
books are sometimes the next best thing to owning the actual works
of art that are beautifully captured between the covers. You almost
can smell the fresh paint and feel the fabrics in interior design
books and see what's outside the windows in architectural books.
Photography books keep you mesmerized for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   And animal books warm your heart.
</P>
<P>
   There's a coffee-table book on just about every subject or fad
with prices ranging from $25 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee-table books also come in oversized softcover, which is
the fastest-growing segment of publishing's quality paperback
market, according to one bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee-table books add an aesthetic touch to a room,'' said
Susan Novotny, owner of the Bookhouse in Guilderland, N.Y.. ``They
are also a kind of status thing, especially if they are
out-of-print. Print runs on coffee-table books are often low, with
as few as 6,000 published for the whole country, so that publishing
houses, especially the smaller ones, are not stuck with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffee-table book sales soar like Santa's sleigh around the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make great, lasting holiday gifts, because they often
reflect what the buyer perceives as the recipients' tastes,''
Novotny said. ``If someone is global, they might get `National
Geographic Windows on the World' featuring fabulously curious
pictures. If they collect ephemeral things such as posters, they
might receive a copy of `The Milk Book,' which is a collection of
all the milk ads with famous people wearing the white milk
mustache. Last year, it was `The Vodka Book,' with all of the vodka
ads. A very popular book among the Generation X-ers.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Tannenbaum, owner of The Bookstore in Lenox, Mass., said
people often will save up to buy a coffee-table book.
</P>
<P>
   ``They often justify the expense, because they do buy it as a
Christmas gift,'' Tannenbaum said. ``Coffee-table books aren't
usually a spur-of-the-moment purchase. It's something people think
about buying, especially if it's connected to an historical event,
happening or great art exhibit. The anniversary collectors book of
`Gone with the Wind' came in a slip case. Art exhibit catalogs in
hard cover, like those held at major museums, look great on the
coffee table and can be appreciated for generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no set rule-of-thumb when it comes to giving a
coffee-table book, but etiquette guru Peggy Post, the great
granddaughter-in-law of the late Emily Post, offered her personal

   ``I like to give coffee-tables books if they are on a subject
that someone I know either has an interest in or something they
like to do, such as gardening, travel, decorating, dance or other
artistic expression,'' Post said from her home in Connecticut.
``Coffee-table books make a lovely keepsake gift, because it's
often something that most people don't go out and buy for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior designers also love coffee-table books. They like to
use them as room accessories, which either speak to the owners
intellectual taste or color scheme of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for them,'' said interior designer George W. Orton
III, owner of Orton &AMP; Orton in Lee, Mass. ``Coffee-table books are
very decorative and interesting on a coffee table. Two or three
books will do the trick. They can be informative or decorative.
Nothing looks as good on a coffee table as oversized colorful
and/or picturesque books.''

<P>
   Man is by nature a political animal, said Aristotle, who argued
further that the public life of a ``good'' society must reflect the
nature of its members. Many of the great Macedonian's assertions _
that the slave is ``naturally'' inferior to his master, the female
to the male, the ``barbarian'' to the Greek _ now seem absurd. And
yet Aristotle's basic proposition still rings true. The present
travails of three leading political figures - Bill Clinton, Saddam
Hussein and Augusto Pinochet - reveal how deeply we believe in
natural justice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's probable escape from his domestic pursuers
can be ascribed in part to his foes' astonishing folly. He has been
lucky in his enemies: the sex-crazed, mealy-mouthed Kenneth Starr
and his backers on the Christian Right, who remind us that
``fundamentalism'' is a term born in the USA; Newt Gingrich, who
overplayed a winning hand and lost his shirt; and Linda Tripp, the
wicked witch of the wire, who, like Nixon, didn't understand that
by bugging herself she would only prove her own villainy, even with
the expletives deleted.
</P>
<P>
   When an ancient force _ puritanical fanaticism _ combines with
the contemporary tabloid dogma that public figures have no right to
privacy, and when the Washington political and media elites work
themselves up into a mighty pompous froth, even the President rocks
on his throne.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton survives, because he has human nature on his side.
Human nature distinguishes between sexual dalliance and political
misconduct. It can be brutal; asked to take a view about Monica and
Paula, the American people replied that they just didn't care. They
have come to know Bill Clinton far more intimately than they
normally know their leaders, and he, of course, has always known
them better than any other politician. Clinton is winning his fight
because he is like his people; because, you could say, he's a
natural.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Iraq, however, the US administration's
understanding of human nature has been deficient, to say the least.
The notion that bombing raids might provoke a coup against Saddam
was always an improbable hypothesis. On the whole, people do not
see as allies those who are dropping large quantities of high
explosives on them from the sky. Like Yossarian, the hero of
``Catch-22,'' they take the bombs personally.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to bomb and then not bombing has the advantage of
killing fewer people, but the disadvantage of making oneself look
silly. Apparently some Iraqis seriously believe that Paula Jones
and Monica Lewinsky were pawns in an international Zionist
conspiracy designed to make Clinton bomb Baghdad. The recent
aborted American-British attack may demonstrate the declining
international influence of these two ladies, but otherwise plays
right into Saddam's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Those voices advocating a rapid end to sanctions, and a
subsequent opening up of the Iraqi market to Western goods and
ideas, may not find much favor with America's military analysts,
but an Iraq freed from the privations of the embargo and the threat
of aerial attack is more likely to think of the West as a friend.
The best way to topple Saddam Hussein may be to help bring into
being an Iraq in which his tyrannies are not only hateful but also
anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the month's other ``unnatural'' figure ought to be
getting easier. Pinochet, after all, has earned the right to be
called the most evil man now alive on earth. (Sorry, Saddam.) The
British law lords have decreed that he is not immune from
extradition. The crucial principle of universal accountability has
thus been upheld. Atrocity is not to be excused by the occupancy of
high office. All this has become very clear in the past days.
</P>
<P>
   Why then has the British Home Secretary asked for extra time to
decide Pinochet's future? The ex-tyrant was well enough to hang out
with Lady Thatcher just the other day, but now claims that the
pressure he's under has provoked a stress-related mental ailment.
The families of the dead must be disgusted by this ruse. Pinochet
must not escape on such flimsy ``compassionate'' grounds. Jack
Straw should confirm at once that for the mass murderers of the
world, there can be no compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature exists, and it is both deep and highly
structured,'' writes Edward O. Wilson, the biologist and writer
whom Tom Wolfe calls ``a new Darwin.'' If it did not _ let us be
clear _ then the idea of universals _ human rights, moral
principles, international law _ would have no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fact of our common humanity that allows most of us to
forgive Bill Clinton his faults, that will not allow us to agree
that bombing innocent Iraqis is the right way to punish Saddam
Hussein, and that makes us want to see Pinochet brought to justice.
A world that hounded Clinton but turned a blind eye to Pinochet
would indeed be a world turned upside down.

decide Pinochet's future? The ex-tyrant was well enough to hang out
with Lady Thatcher just the other day, but now claims that the
pressure he's under has provoked a stress-related mental ailment.
The families of the dead must be disgusted by this ruse. Pinochet
must not escape on such flimsy ``compassionate'' grounds. Jack
Straw should confirm at once that for the mass murderers of the
world, there can be no compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature exists, and it is both deep and highly
structured,'' writes Edward O. Wilson, the biologist and writer
whom Tom Wolfe calls ``a new Darwin.'' If it did not _ let us be
clear _ then the idea of universals _ human rights, moral
principles, international law _ would have no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fact of our common humanity that allows most of us to
forgive Bill Clinton his faults, that will not allow us to agree
that bombing innocent Iraqis is the right way to punish Saddam
Hussein, and that makes us want to see Pinochet brought to justice.
A world that hounded Clinton but turned a blind eye to Pinochet
would indeed be a world turned upside down.

 &HT;    Memories of Holocaust survivors combine with aging in painful
process
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The boy Tibor Farkas remembers was as
skinny as a stick. Skinny for a 12-year-old and skinnier still
because Nazi guards didn't feed Jews too well in Austrian work
camps.
</P>
<P>
   They called him ``Beanpole,'' Farkas remembers. One day,
Beanpole asked to take Farkas' place on the next day's trip to
fetch milk for the camp commander, and Farkas hesitated. Whoever
made the trip got a slice of bread and glass of milk from the owner
of the store.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny boy died of starvation before Farkas made up his
mind. And Farkas _ 15, tubercular, lice-ridden and emaciated _
walked out of a Viennese detention center at the end of the war and
into a state of psychological repression that would last through
his entire professional life. In more than 50 years as a scientist
studying the behavior of the brain, he virtually never thought
about the war, or Beanpole, or how he died.
</P>
<P>
   But now Farkas is retired, and like thousands of survivors, he
is finding that the past and present are colliding. With time on
his hands and absent distractions, Beanpole, the guards and the
torture have invaded his days and taken over his nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I never dreamt about any of it,'' Farkas, 68,
said recently in his North Palm Beach apartment. ``Now, I wake up
in the middle of the night and I remember details down to the names
of guards. More and more each day the past wells up. You think
about it and one memory triggers another one until you have almost
total recall ... It alters the present, it turns the days into
nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural process of aging, difficult for the most
well-adjusted, is often debilitating for Holocaust survivors who
equate the ability to work with survival, counselors who work with
survivors say. The phenomena is especially true for
concentration-camp victims who lived through the ordeal as
children, before they developed mature psychological defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people, when they retire, all hell breaks loose,''
said Dr. Marvin Lipkowitz, who chairs the psychiatry department at
Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, where hundreds of Holocaust
survivors have been treated. ``They work in order to avoid dealing
with things and when they no longer can, it can be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has not been studied closely in the United
States, where mental-health facilities and even most Jewish homes
for the aged don't track survivors among their residents. But it is
the subject of growing research in Israel, where Holocaust
survivors number about 300,000 _ almost 10 percent of the country's
Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   There, sociologists and mental health professionals have found
that the population of patients in mental health facilities is
nearly double what would be expected given their proportion of the
Israeli population.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly any survivors suffered mental breakdowns directly after
the war, according to John Lemberger, the executive director of
Amcha, an Israeli organization that cares for survivors. ``Today,
however, what we are seeing is the recurring trauma (or
post-trauma) relating to their Holocaust experiences, coming
together with the normal and difficult process of aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 percent of survivors in Israel, Lemberger said, have
shown signs of mental deterioration related to their wartime
trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas said he felt virtually immune from the effects of the war
throughout his life. He consistently worked 14- and 15-hour days,
and that obsession paid dividends: He ultimately won international
acclaim for his work pioneering brain scans. And even when he
underwent psychoanalysis as part of his early training, delving
deep into his subconscious, his experiences in the war almost never
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this slightly stooped, gentle man who still keeps his
papers in the precise stacks of a scientist lives in what he calls
a social Siberia: Too sick to visit friends in other parts of the
country, he knows almost no one in Florida. The combination of
isolation and depression has become agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Weiss, a counseler who works with survivors in Palm Beach
County, has seen the sudden transformation before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for most (survivors) it's like a film playing in the
back of their minds,'' Weiss said. ``It was always there but they
didn't have to focus in on it and they had other things to think
about. But when those things are gone, it comes back into focus.''
</P>
<P>
   In the vast field of Holocaust research, delayed mental
breakdowns among survivors has altered thinking about the survivors
themselves. Once it was believed that those who survived the camps
persevered because they were stronger then those who perished. It
helped explain the high achievement of many of the victims after
the war and helped a growing Israel build its image as a strong
country populated by tough Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But the trauma, it is now understood, was often internalized and
hidden until the anchors of everyday life are removed, as they are
in old age, said John Garfinkel, a psychologist with Jewish Family
and Children Services in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The most stark portrayal is found in those who suffer from
dementia, when they mentally return to their days in the camps and
endlessly repeat a 50-year-old nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Helthgot remembers walking to his mother's house in South
Florida when she was suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's
disease. The table was set for 12. Behind each plate was a
photograph of a relative, most of whom had died in the war. On each
plate was a bowl of steaming soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was having a dinner party,'' said Helthgot, from his home
in Los Angeles. ``And when I walked in and asked her who was
invited, she pointed to all the pictures. When she got to me (a
picture of Helthgot as a small boy) I said `But I'm Joseph.' She
just sort of looked at me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Helthgot said, his mother would spend hours crying
and occasionally fly into violent rages, cursing the Nazis who
killed two of her children. Ultimately she had to be taken out of a
Boca Raton nursing home because she became dangerous to other
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is the fixation. The other part is that you don't
have the resources anymore to stave off the bad feelings,''
Helthgot said. When you're young ``you can't think about your kids
getting killed because you have to go on. You have to be able to
put that on a shelf somewhere and compartmentalize. Once you get
older you lose that ability, you can't keep it on a shelf and it
invades your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as nursing homes and hospitals can be daunting
triggers for even the most well-adjusted survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any feeling that they're being held against their will will
bring back these memories,'' Lipkowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in West Palm Beach, an 81-year-old woman suffering
from Alzheimer's was so convinced she was back in the camps she
scaled an eight-foot fence to escape a nursing home. She took a bus
to Boston before she was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a survivor and she thought we were trying to kill
her,'' said Carol Stevens, a nurse at the Four Seasons Nursing Home
at the time. ``She was just a little, itty bitty woman. She stacked
boxes up against the fence to get out. I can't imagine how she did
it, except that she must have been very desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure-all, no balm, caretakers say. But
institutionalized survivors tend to feel more comfortable when
being taken care of by Jews, said Michael Brodie, the director of
assisted living care at the Miami Jewish Home and Hospital, which
has 600 residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, when they're being cared for by someone not in
their own racial or ethnic group they don't respond well,'' Brodie
said. ``There is some paranoia, and some feeling of being
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, Weiss said, the best treatment is to create situations
where survivors can be around other survivors _ not necessarily to
talk about their experiences, but just to share their company.
</P>
<P>
   As educated as he is, Farkas has yet to take that step. And
though he knows the guilt he harbors about Beanpole makes no sense,
he also knows logic doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irrational to think a piece of bread and a glass of milk
would have made a difference,'' Farkas said. ``He was already
dying. But guilt is irrational. The whole war was irrational.''

<P>
   These past weeks I've been trying to step into Agosto Pinochet's
shoes, trying to figure out what must be going on inside him.
</P>
<P>
   The former Chilean dictator, of course, has now been denied
immunity from prosecution, and faces possible extradition from
London to Spain for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet had arrived in London in September, taking residence in
a five-star hotel in the posh district of Mayfair, not far from the
gardens of Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   London had always been the city of his dreams,``the ideal city
to live in'' _ as he had said publicly more than once. But the need
for back surgery necessitated a change in his routine during this
last trip.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, since 1990 when he stepped down from the presidency of
Chile, Pinochet has traveled to London at least once a year. His
visits were discreet and private. Each time Margaret Thatcher _ a
woman he devoutly admires _ invited him to tea. He usually went
shopping in the morning _ his favorite store is Burberry's _ and
then had lunch with friends in Fortnum &AMP; Mason.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most unchanging rituals was a visit to the Army
National Museum, and another to Madame Tussaud's wax museum, where,
deep in thought, he would spend hours in front of Napoleon
Bonaparte's figure.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is deeply moved by everything related to Napoleon.
During this last visit he bought half a dozen books about the
emperor and was planning to go to Paris again to visit the tomb in
Invalides.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon put an end to those happy
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the notion of empires was always in Pinochet's mind. As
have other dictators of his kind, Pinochet thinks of himself as an
envoy of Providence, someone who is Goodness incarnate and has been
destined to exterminate Evil, whatever that means. It's the same
feeling of omnipotence felt by the ayatollahs, Pol Pot and hundreds
of fanatical fundamentalists at large in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet's case is more pathetic because once out of Chile,
and away from the glow of his wealthy Latin American supporters, he
suddenly looks like a tainted mortal.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for London, Pinochet agreed to talk in Santiago
with a correspondent for The New Yorker magazine, Jon Lee Anderson,
author of a much-praised biography of Che Guevara. The interview
was arranged through the efforts of Pinochet's daughter Lucia. She
thought that if an honest and well-meaning journalist talked with
her father, it might put to rest the malicious talk about his old
regime.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of what Pinochet told Anderson allows us to really
understand him for the first time. Pinochet, for instance, is still
seeing Marxists everywhere, as did the brutal commandants of the
Argentinean military juntas.
</P>
<P>
   For Pinochet, the world is divided into two irreconcilable
halves, the Marxists and the Christians, a notion that presupposes
that a war between them is unavoidable. For Pinochet, this is a
matter of life and death, and anything goes. You don't defeat the
enemy: You destroy him. The only possible way to deal with the
enemy is extermination: concentration camps, slavery, torture.
</P>
<P>
   I expect that the nastiest thing Pinochet must be feeling right
now is his total incomprehension of why he was arrested. To his way
of thinking, he didn't do anything wrong: the blood, the exiles,
the brute force, all those were ``necessary actions.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how he reconciles this with the fact that the great
newspapers of the Christian nations say it's unthinkable that his
crimes should go unpunished merely because he was chief of an
illegitimate government, or because he enjoys a diplomatic immunity
conquered at bayonet's point. No doubt he thinks the world is in
the hands of the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the time Pinochet seized power in 1973, he hadn't done
anything, either brilliant or terrible. He was a mediocre man, very
conservative, never noticed by anybody anywhere. But like Francisco
Franco, his most admired leader, after Napoleon and Thatcher, he
gained absolute power. Now, to his surprise, Pinochet has found out
that another power, a lot less absolute _ that of justice _ wants
to seize him. He must think this is an inexplicably sarcastic act
of God.
</P>
<P>
   At 83 years old, Pinochet has stopped wearing dark glasses, like
he did in his violent years. But it's as though he has kept on
using them. In his later years in Chile he would rarely look people
in the eye. His blue pupils would appear to be fixed on the beyond,
which for him maybe is empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never was a dictator, only an aspirant to dictator,'' he
told Anderson. ``As every man interested in history knows, I've
learned that dictators never end well.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Pinochet think then of this twist of life, this fate
that keeps him locked in a hospital room, waiting for the sort of
democratic institutions he never trusted _ chambers of
representatives, stewards of the law _ to decide his fate? If he
returns to Chile _ and he will, no doubt about it, dead or alive _
he won't be able to leave his country again.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet failed to learn that exile is no longer what it was in
the 1970s, during the heyday of Latin American dictatorships. Today
the exile of dictators is of a singular kind: They are condemned
not to leave the country they so tormented. The moment they go out
into the world, the world traps them. It's a laughable destiny, but
not unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Pinochet will have his last glimpse of London, but his
victims will keep on seeing him, endlessly.

<P>
   The arrest and detention of Augusto Pinochet is serving a
purpose, far beyond warming the hearts of the thousands of friends,
relatives and colleagues of his victims _ men and women who have
waited nearly a quarter of a century for justice and solace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its ethical and legal implications, the dictator's
detention reveals many of the contradictions and deeper truths
about how societies move from authoritarian to democratic rule, and
how they settle scores with a past that never should have existed.
</P>
<P>
   Both in general and in specific reference to Chile, Pinochet's
predicament raises far more questions than answers _ questions that
years ago should have been asked in Chile and Latin America, and in
countries as dissimilar as Mexico and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called transitions to democracy in Latin America during
the 1980s, in eastern Europe in the late '80s and early '90s, as
well as in Asia and Africa, all rested on a few basic premises that
at the time seemed self-evident. Dictatorships do not just fade
away; military rulers do not simply walk into the sun when they get
bored or tired.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving their departure and the overall dismantling of their
regimes, as of one-party systems, implied providing them with a way
out: a safe departure, to a safe haven, for a safe future.
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, the political golden handshake of amnesty or
tacitly letting bygones be bygones was accompanied by a desire to
know, if not to punish. Truth Commissions, Never Again Commissions,
White Books and the like were created and supported.
</P>
<P>
   But the understanding always was that the personal safety and
financial integrity of the dictators remain protected and that
details of their policies _ economic in some cases, geopolitical in
others _ be preserved by their democratic successors.
</P>
<P>
   This was the deal in Chile, in Argentina, in Uruguay, in a
certain sense initially in Nicaragua, in South Korea, South Africa
and even in some places in eastern Europe. It was formal and
institutionalized in some cases, de facto in others, but it made
democracy possible. It seemed a small price to pay, a pill not too
bitter to swallow, a necessary and sufficient condition for moving
on.
</P>
<P>
   But too many questions simply went unanswered. Who made the
deals? With whom did the political leaders consult? How freely did
the leaders and the led consent to the agreements and how well
informed were the countries' citizens? Would the arrangements
withstand international and historical scrutiny, particularly of a
passionate and critical nature? Would the amnesties resist the test
of time, further investigations and new revelations?
</P>
<P>
   By now, South Africa's Truth and Amnesty Commission has released
its findings _ albeit, amid the tensions and discomfort of all the
political parties and even of two old friends and heroes who are
true role models for transitions everywhere: Nelson Mandela and
Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for disenchantment with the South African
commission's report, one clearly stands out. The idea that inspired
its creation was that the spirit of national reconciliation guiding
the shift from apartheid to majority rule in South Africa should
also prevail in dealing with the country's past. But this is no
longer as relevant or widespread as when the commission was set up.
</P>
<P>
   What then seemed fair, prudent and tolerant, today appears
callous and cynical. What today is deemed unacceptable and
insensitive then felt cautious and moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly for Mexico. The country is painfully, desperately,
slowly proceeding with its move toward democratic rule, and while
settling scores with the past is certainly not the most pressing
task, it is one of the most delicate ones. From the student
massacre in Tlatelocolo in 1968 to the localized ``dirty war'' of
the 1970s to the electoral fraud of the 1980s and the corruption of
the 1990s, the legendary ruling party has a great deal to answer
for.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile and elsewhere, many believe, sincerely, that the best
solution is to bury the past, the dead and the bank accounts _ and
move forward. Others think that some degree of accountability and
punishment is indispensable to ensure that impunity cease being a
leitmotif of political life.
</P>
<P>
   But no one really knows the cost of each option: whether
forgiving and forgetting is possible, or if burrowing into the past
is unavoidable. The Chilean precedent confounds everyone willing to
think the matter through.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chile has left its friends and its people perplexed,
perhaps undeservedly. For the past decade, the conventional wisdom
about the country was simple. Moderation and sensibility had
prevailed, national reconciliation had been achieved, successful
economic policies had been pursued. The past decades of
revolutionary turmoil and bloody repression had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know that while Chile is a more prosperous nation than
before, it is as unequal in wealth and income distribution as ever,
and the polarization of its society is as acute as 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the country's left, and center, and sympathizers and allies,
as well as for much of international public opinion, Pinochet is
the personification of evil: The man with the dark glasses is as
bad as they come. Yet for a large minority of the population, he is
still the saviour of a nation threatened by heathen communism and
inflationary socialism.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably preferable for Chileans to have uncovered this
split of opinion, and for the rest of the world to begin to grasp
that dealing with the past is a very complicated matter, and that
easy solutions, as brisk and painless as they may seem, generally
do not work.
</P>
<P>
   We can thank the dictator for this, but for nothing else.

 &HT;    PARIS _ The instinctive reaction to word that Chile's Augusto
Pinochet has been denied immunity in London and faces extradition
to Spain is: Good, at least one bloody dictator can be held to
account.
 &HT;    But it isn't a simple issue, and the simple answer can have very
bad consequences.
 &HT;    It is no accident that the French government congratulated
itself on having foreseen possible embarrassment and refused
Pinochet a visa before his ill-fated London trip. Nor is it
surprising that Spain's Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar initially
commented that ``the best outcome would be if the government
doesn't even have to decide.''
 &HT;    A jumble of issues is now provoked by the collision of demands
for pure justice and the demands of politics, the demands of peace,
the demands of reconciliation. Further, the new emphasis on the
international right to judge certain crimes complicates the
question of who is to be the judge of whether circumstance or
unyielding moral dictates should prevail.
 &HT;    It has been pointed out that the peaceful, constructive
transition of Spain from a fascist dictatorship to a sturdy
democracy was achieved, despite ominous predictions of another
civil war, by refusing to judge the past. South Africa found relief
from intolerable prospects of confrontation and revenge in its
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
 &HT;    Many countries _ El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, and
ex-communist countries of eastern Europe as well as Chile _ have
sought to transcend ferocious or deeply wounding civil strife by
trying to tell the truth instead of by insisting on punishment. Is
their choice to be overruled on the grounds that crimes committed
were crimes against all of humanity, not just their own nation?
 &HT;    The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, who initiated the warrant
for Pinochet's arrest, has been working on testimony collected by
victims of the regime for several years. He is a man of rigor, who
pushed corruption and drug cases and tracked the ``dirty war''
against Basque terrorists.
 &HT;    Garzon's document calling for Pinochet's arrest and listing 91
people kidnapped, tortured or killed also lists a long series of
international declarations and agreements which Britain has signed
proscribing genocide, war crimes and torture. There is no question
about the straightforward legal sincerity of Garzon or of the fact
that crimes were committed.
 &HT;    There has been a tendency of late, particularly in connection
with the atrocities in former Yugoslavia, to proclaim the
inevitability of eventual punishment as a kind of consolation for
not being able to stop the terror and not being able to catch the
perpetrators. The Pinochet arrest gives the satisfaction of being
able to feel that some day evildoers everywhere will get their due.
 &HT;    Indeed, the new treaty on establishing a permanent international
tribunal, which the United States has refused to sign, has been
hailed as a signal advance that will deter future criminal
monsters. But this is fantasy. If anything, an advance, locked-in
provision for punishment makes it harder to end a conflict short of
total victory. It leaves no room for negotiation or compromise.
 &HT;    Of course, a possible answer is that there never should be
compromise with evil. Justice must be complete, there must be no
escaping the highest law.
 &HT;    That leaves the underlying question of what we really hope to
achieve and what standards are to be applied. Even today in Chile,
there are people who consider Pinochet a savior rather than a
murderer. He was able to make his deal for lifetime immunity there
because he still had considerable support when he turned power over
to a freely elected president.
 &HT;    It isn't just a matter of who is to decide. It is whether the
desired outcome should be punishment, revenge, blind justice
regardless of its consequences or removal of civil conflict and a
better chance of peaceful life.
 &HT;    When, as was the case at Nuremberg after World War II, it is
possible to achieve all at once, so much the better. But the best
in moral terms must not destroy the chances of improving how people
live.

   Again Boris Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia. In a
normal situation in a normal society this news ought to have evoked
just one kind of feeling: compassion for an elderly man who must
discharge far-from-easy duties. In Russia, however, circumstances
do not allow one to indulge exclusively in these emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of Galina Starovoitova; the uproar around the
Federal Security Service following Boris Berezovsky's accusations
of a plot to kill him; the escape of six dangerous criminals from a
Moscow jail; the triumphant victory by the anti-Semitic
``Fatherland'' political bloc in a Krasnodar election _ this is far
from being a complete list of events that have occurred merely in
the course of the past week.
</P>
<P>
   And this amid mounting hysteria, when even a person's death is
used as an excuse for settling political accounts. The president is
sick, but are we all right?

   In this situation, Boris Yeltsin's hospitalization could indeed
aggravate the situation even more. The radicals will, with even
greater enthusiasm, start harping on the need to remove the
president from office. Kremlin officials will, with fresh vigor,
continue the search for a new boss. Bandits can breathe a sigh of
relief: They will be forgotten in the political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   All this points to an obvious conclusion: Today there are
powerful social groups in Russia that, judging by the logic of
their life, will continue to rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   But let's keep a clear head. What has actually changed in the
country since the president fell ill? Has he only now stopped
running the state? The condition of his health has long forced him
to take it easy. Has he only now left the country unattended? For
sure, Russia has a prime minister who was approved by parliament.
Is there now reason to believe that the premier has illegally
usurped power? But under the Constitution, the head of cabinet
performs presidential duties in the event that the president is
unable to do so himself.
</P>
<P>
   The only tricky point is the formal transfer of powers from the
president to the prime minister through an edict, something for
which Boris Yeltsin is apparently not ready. Yet, should we be so
upset over this given that it is only the ``nuclear briefcase''
that is ever transferred by edict? Hardly anyone seriously believes
that this is one of the trappings of power over which Russia can be
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The situation with the political powers that be is more or less
clear, but what about those who are going to take over? Is anyone,
except for the chronically feverish radicals, interested in the
idea of the president being relieved of his duties ahead of term
and, for that matter, in early elections?
</P>
<P>
   Although the election campaign began a long time ago, none of
its favorites are as yet ready for a showdown. The party of power
has not as yet decided on its single leader. Today this role is
being claimed by both Yuri Luzhkov and Viktor Chernomyrdin. Yevgeny
Primakov does not aspire to it but others are claiming it on his
behalf. Representatives of the ruling establishment refer to him as
a possible ``common nomenklatura'' candidate. This group is
obviously not ready for a forced presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are others particularly well prepared. Gennady Zyuganov has
unexpectedly acquired a rival in the person of the Moscow mayor,
who has recently managed to bite off a hefty bit of support from
the leftist electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government, formed with the participation of the
Communists, has not achieved overnight success. Nor is the famous
Gen. Alexander Lebed in particularly good shape. To date Boris
Berezovsky, his main image maker and sponsor (who has also fallen
on hard times), has not yet found a way to make up for Lebed's
mistakes in Krasnoyarsk, of which he is the elected governor.
Neither does Grigory Yavlinsky seem to be rapidly gaining
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, amid the ongoing crisis, no one has enough funds
for the elections. In short, all the indications are that no one is
going to force presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the worst comes to the worst and early elections do
become inevitable? Even then a sociopolitical catastrophe is not a
foregone conclusion. The country has a prime minister who is in a
good position to lead the country to a nationwide ballot. So no
matter what, there is indeed a safety factor. Let us understand
this and not give way to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Neither politicians nor special services nor psychics, even if
they really want this, will be able to cause an era of chaos
against our will. The country will calm down as soon as its
citizens calm down. And then the president's pneumonia will remain
nothing more than a sad page in his medical history. Not in the
history of the country.

   Again Boris Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia. In a
normal situation in a normal society this news ought to have evoked
just one kind of feeling: compassion for an elderly man who must
discharge far-from-easy duties. In Russia, however, circumstances
do not allow one to indulge exclusively in these emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of Galina Starovoitova; the uproar around the
Federal Security Service following Boris Berezovsky's accusations
of a plot to kill him; the escape of six dangerous criminals from a
Moscow jail; the triumphant victory by the anti-Semitic
``Fatherland'' political bloc in a Krasnodar election _ this is far
from being a complete list of events that have occurred merely in
the course of the past week.
</P>
<P>
   And this amid mounting hysteria, when even a person's death is
used as an excuse for settling political accounts. The president is
sick, but are we all right?
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, Boris Yeltsin's hospitalization could indeed

 THE STORY OF `FURBY,' the MOODY FURBALL  
 &HT;     (To publish this ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over Mattel. In three days he
planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in 25
years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the BIG toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, very late by
industry norms.
 &HT;    To be sure, the recent success of toys containing
microprocessors, from Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has
buttressed the belief that technology is the toy industry's savior.
Earlier generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive
to a child _ but the newer ones insinuate themselves into their
owner's life like a pal.
 &HT;    In past months, some schools even banned virtual pets because
children were more focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying
attention to the teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids
began to mourn digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like
Furby, which exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate
themselves even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a
secret language, playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    What's more, the technology is increasingly invisible. No
instruction manual is necessary and children can have what they
most desire: the perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him. The company seemed concerned that if the
inventor, whom I'll call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may
increase the fees he demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    According to Eric, an earlier version of Furby was manually
controlled with dials and came to life like a puppet. This Furby
uttered not a chirp from its yellow beak. But, Eric said, the
finished Furby would be able to play games, communicate with other
Furbies via infrared signals, learn English by means of positive
reinforcement and teach a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue).
No two Furbies would share the same personality or react to stimuli
in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    The master plan was to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in
'99 or 2000, the way other companies might to give the development
more time. Furby's category _ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz
lingo _ had already shown its potential, having grown 223 percent
in 1997 over the year before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category was pegged ``the hot one.''
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of all new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy
companies to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can
heavily discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, began to formulate opinions about which toys would be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    But Furby was a hands-down winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart
committed, on the spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire
production run. Everyone wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated
success. So sure was Tiger of Furby that at one point, it even
planned to require Furby-buying retailers to order other, less-hot
toys too from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

THE REPUBLICANS' NEW COMPASSION PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every time I hear another Republican echo the
Bush brothers and speak of the GOP becoming the party of
``compassionate conservatism,'' the same image comes to mind:
</P>
<P>
   A group of white folks (wearing very nice clothes and pained
looks on their faces) stand on a sidewalk around a dirty,
disheveled homeless family and chant: ``We really feel sorry for
you _ but it wouldn't be prudent to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Do any of the compassionate conservatives know what the word
compassion actually means? I ask because I've noticed that most of
them began using the term only after Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   That's when they saw many ``Big Tent'' Republicans tank while
the increasingly compassionate George W. Bush swept to his second
term as governor in Texas and the born-again compassionate Jeb Bush
swept to his first in Florida. (Campaigning for the same job in
1994, Jeb Bush was asked what he would do to help blacks, and he
answered, ``Probably nothing.'')
</P>
<P>
   Compassion is such a pure and noble word, I'd hate to think
anyone would co-opt it, rob it of its meaning for generations to
come, just so a troubled political party can have a catchy new
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Compassion comes from the Latin, com, which means ``together''
and pati, which means ``to suffer.'' Suffer together.
</P>
<P>
   Together means not behind electronic gates that open only to
specially coded card keys issued to you and your neighbors.
Together means with people other than the guys in your fraternity
at Dartmouth, your business school class at Stanford or the couples
in your tennis and golf club.
</P>
<P>
   Together means with psychotic people who dwell on the street and
Vietnamese immigrants who live eight to a room in lousy
neighborhoods. It means with people who have worked hard their
whole lives but never earned enough to set aside money for their
kids' education.
</P>
<P>
   It means with those people's kids who can't make enough at a
minimum-wage job to meet the ever-rising tuition at even a
community college.
</P>
<P>
   Together means with old people who are being victimized by a
combination of profit-driven HMOs and the rapidly-fraying Medicare
system. It means with children on welfare who get no increased
benefits when their parents' monthly payment is reduced as an
``incentive'' to finding employment.
</P>
<P>
   It means with teen-age runaways who are addicted to drugs and
alcohol but whose only chance at salvation is the rare rehab
program offered after a stay in the county jail. It means with
paroled recovering junkies who, reunited with their children, can't
get vouchers for food and milk because Congress took such
privileges away from convicted drug felons.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the Oct. 19 New Yorker by Joe Klein, Jeb Bush
is quoted during an address to a West Palm Beach women's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' Bush said, ``we've defined compassion by how
much money we've spent and how many rules we've enacted, instead of
by results. But true compassion means suffering with the poor and
acting on the consciousness of your suffering _ and we should shift
power away from the bureaucracy to the people in the compassionate
community, who actually deal with these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush went on to advocate that we use the same approach for
``dealing with problems like foster care or education'' that we use
for building highways: ``We contract out with experts.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds so caring _ and prudent.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton's party was reorganizing and scrambling to
regain power, he talked a great deal about suffering with the poor
and marginalized and acting on the consciousness of one's
suffering. Mercifully, he never used the term ``compassion,''
opting instead for ``I feel your pain.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton demonstrated in his colossal sellout to old-style
Republican ``welfare reform,'' his empathetic pain threshold is
rather low. Why would I expect any better from people who speak
with straight faces about paying ``the compassionate community'' to
``deal with these problems'' for all the rest of us?

STORM OF TRAGEDY ENGULFS ANACORTES IN `LOST AT SEA' 
</HEADLINE>
 DILLON-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Dillon was at his newspaper job in San Jose, Calif., in
1983 when the Americus, a crab boat from Anacortes, capsized in the
Bering Sea. Then came reports that a sister vessel, the Altair, had
disappeared, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen young men vanished with the ``A-boats.'' Some were
related through marriage, but all had become kin through the tribal
rites of a small town: playing high school football, sharing beers
at the Anchor Inn, bidding farewell to wives and tiny babies as
they headed north for another fishing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial gut reaction was it has to rip the heart out of
that town,'' Dillon said. ``With the loss of those 14 lives, the
linkages that are ripped off the face of the earth are just hard to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dillon knew more about fishing and small-town life than
most. He grew up on Bainbridge Island. On summer nights, he could
hear the diesel engines of the boats and the voices of the
fishermen. They cursed on bad nights and laughed on nights when
salmon filled their purse seines.
</P>
<P>
   The A-boats' story was one that Dillon, now 53, wanted to tell
and would 15 years later. His ``Lost at Sea: An American Tragedy''
(The Dial Press, 264 pages, $23.95) details the lives, work and
deaths of the 14. It also explores the aftermath: the families'
grief, the search to answer why the pride of the crab fleet sank
and the drive to bring safety regulation to a renegade industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, of course, there have been other
American tragedies in the fishing industry. But the story of the
Americus and the Altair stayed with Dillon as he edited newspapers,
wrote novels and raised children.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon waited 10 years to put the story on paper. What finally
moved him, he said, was reading the late Norman McLean's ``Young
Men and Fire,'' which told of 12 smoke jumpers killed in a Montana
forest fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great story there,'' he said of the A-boats. ``It
wasn't just a story how 14 kids came to die. It was also a story of
repressed grief and how a village manages grief.''
</P>
<P>
   He would have to wait to tell his story for business reasons.
``The Perfect Storm,'' which focuses on the loss of a fishing boat
in a horrendous storm in 1991, became a best seller in 1997.
Dillon's publisher decided to wait on his book, hoping ``The
Perfect Storm'' would create a market for similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   The writer's research for ``Lost at Sea'' ranged from dull to
dangerous. He studied the nuances of marine engineering and the
record of Coast Guard investigations. And he learned the power of
the sea as he slid on all fours on the olive oil-coated galley
floor of the crab boat Provider in bucking seas. He signed on as a
cook on the vessel to experience working on a crab boat, and spent
part of one memorable day on that floor as the contents of the
pantry fell on him.
</P>
<P>
   The heart and the tears of the story, however, are in Anacortes.
He moved into the town for four months. ``I tried from the very
beginning to become a neighbor instead of a reporter,'' Dillon
said.
</P>
<P>
   He ran into the players in his story at the gas station and
supermarket. He drew out people whom reporters had spooked 10 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Dillon said, what those left behind in Anacortes
didn't say was as important as what they did say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who did they really blame?'' Dillon said, was a question that
wouldn't be answered. Then again, the question perhaps shouldn't be
asked in a town where the vessel owner, crews of other boats and
the widows of the Altair and Americus rub shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not people who could just pack up and move to Santa
Fe. Anacortes is essentially an island. You can't escape each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   And they lived the story. They went to school with the crew.
They heard the church sermons that tried to make sense of it all
after the Valentine's Day sinkings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people know the story a lot better than I do,'' Dillon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some may read otherwise, Dillon said his intent was to
finger no one for the loss of the 14 lives. ``To say any one person
is to blame would be wrong,'' he said. The blame trickles down from
the boats' design to their construction to their operation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good man can sink a ship. A remorseful man can sink a ship.
A forgiving community can sink a ship. That is the story of the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason the two boats sank died with the 14 young men.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon believes similar American tragedies can be prevented
through tougher policing of fishing. Boats should be built to
exacting standards and skippers and crewmen should have to pass
tests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since the A-boats went down, fishing in Alaska _ an
occupation 20 times more deadly than a normal American job _ has
become safer.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a safety law for fishing in 1988. Fishermen must
carry survival suits, life rafts and know how to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more and more fishermen are surviving disasters at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the conditions that sent the Altair and Americus out
to sea still exist. Crab fishing remains a race among boats and
their crews to set pots and haul them back no matter how high the
seas or how strong the winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible,'' Dillon said, ``to take away from the
inherent danger.''

MONEY DECISION TO DRIVE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the next five weeks, prospective
presidential candidates will be scrambling to decide whether to run
for the White House, with some preparing to burst out of the
starting gates shortly after Jan. 1, the first day contributions
can be matched with federal money.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
have enough financial clout to put off an announcement for months,
most of the dozen other top prospects have no such luxury, with
analysts figuring that a viable candidate needs to raise $22
million in 1999, an amount requiring a daunting daily average of
$60,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the biggest overhaul of the primary system in 30 years
is under way, resulting in a bunched-up early round of primaries
that could determine the nominee for both parties in a period of
three to six weeks starting in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process becomes much more difficult if you wait too long''
to decide to run for president, said Senator John F. Kerry, who
expects to make his plans known in late January or early February.
Most other prospective candidates surveyed by the Globe laid out a
similar or speedier timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jardin, political director for Senator Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, agreed: ``If you are going to do it and take on a sitting
vice president, there is no reason to wait. The money situation and
the truncated primary system mean you need a lot more money
early.'' Kerrey plans to make his decision by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates who decide to run are expected to begin forming
campaign committees early next year. That is considered tantamount
to announcing a candidacy, although the formal announcements and
the accompanying cross-country tours might come later.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race boils down to who might be able to mount an
aggressive challenge to Gore. House minority leader Richard
Gephardt, who may drop plans to run for president in order to
concentrate on trying to become House speaker, is expected to make
his announcement soon, thus helping other Democrats decide whether
to jump into the race.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, meanwhile, a series of subplots is
developing, among them the possibility that former vice president
Dan Quayle will try to be the consensus anti-Bush candidate, an
unlikely role for the man who shared the White House with the Texas
governor's father, President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective candidates must raise money from only a limited pool
of contributors, according to Stan Huckaby, a financial consultant
to eight possible Republican presidential candidates. For example,
Huckaby said, about 45,000 Republicans are likely to donate $1,000
each to a presidential campaign, the maximum allowed in each
election cycle. To be a viable candidate, Huckaby said, it is
necessary to get contributions from about 19,000 of the 45,000.
Thus, only two or three candidates could have enough contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting those contributions, Huckaby said, is to
start collecting money in January. The financial requirements are
likely to narrow the field from the start, although some long-shot
prospects, including Republican Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire
and GOP Representative John Kasich of Ohio, have said they might
run anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, once said he would
rather bang his head against the wall than spend so much time
raising money. But asked last week if he is willing to embark on
such an effort, McCain displayed little hesitation, saying he is
``more inclined'' to run than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am keenly aware the odds are not in my favor and the
difficulty of it,'' McCain said in an interview. ``My view is I am
62 years old, I am confident that a Republican would win the White
House, and this is the only time the opportunity would come up.''
While he has ``no doubt'' Bush will run, McCain said he shares some
of the Texan's strengths, including an ability to appeal to
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Many candidates also plan to announce early because they are
mindful of the lesson learned by California Governor Pete Wilson,
who waited until June 1995 to announce his presidential candidacy
and found many financial sources had already dried up.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, early money is not a guarantee of success. Senator
Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican, raised $10 million in the first
quarter of 1995 but wound up pulling out of the campaign before the
New Hampshire primary in February 1996. The lack of big money,
however, hurt other Republicans. For example, Lamar Alexander did
reasonably well in fund-raising, but he didn't have enough money
after his third-place finish in New Hampshire to run a credible
national campaign and soon dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is a candidate like multimillionaire publisher
Steve Forbes, who can afford to delay his announcement because he
can finance his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several GOP prospects have been running de facto campaigns.
Alexander has spent this year collecting funds for several
political action committees, including one called ``We the
Parents,'' which is running ads featuring Alexander that look and
sound like campaign commercials. Forbes has gathered contributions
for a nonprofit company that also runs campaign-style ads.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has spent much of 1998 raising $6 million for his
political action committee, Campaign America, which boosts Quayle
and distributes some funds to state and local candidates. For now,
though, the GOP field is focused on Bush, described as the
``Republican rock star'' of the moment by Wilson's press secretary,
Sean Walsh. Bush has said he will send a ``signal'' in the spring
about whether he will run. But Walsh said the scrutiny of Bush will
be intense and stars can fade.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Bush could face a challenge from the right, with
Quayle or Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri hoping to win over the
party's social conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, have a smaller field of prospects and one
very well-placed, well-financed front-runner, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gephardt, four other Democrats have said they
might run. Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota is viewed as a
long-shot liberal candidate. Former senator Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, who is winding up a successful tour for his new book,
``Values of the Game,'' has said he will make his decision in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey of Nebraska, whose Senate term expires in 2000, has ruled
out running for the presidency and reelection at the same time.
That would turn a presidential bid into an all-or-nothing
proposition. Moreover, Kerrey last week told his hometown newspaper
that he doesn't want to be ``an anti-Gore spoiler ... I don't
intend to enter the race to cause anybody any difficulty.'' He told
the Omaha World-Herald that he will decide within weeks, saying,
``I won't enter 1999 with `maybe' on my lips... There is no
torment. There is not a skull in my hand saying, `To be or not to
be?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry &UR;  &LR; of Massachusetts, who held a $650,000 fund-raiser last
week in an effort to wipe out his 1996 Senate campaign debt, said
he is ``very inclined'' to form his first political action
committee. That could be a sign that he plans to run for the White
House because such PACs can pay many campaign-related expenses for
a presidential aspirant. In addition, Kerry is considering dropping
his much-touted ban on accepting money from various PACs, another
sign he is thinking ahead about the difficulty of raising money for
a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, is moving rapidly toward consolidating support,
starting with what aides are calling a campaign-style speech on
Wednesday at the Democratic Leadership Council, home to many of the
party's moderates and conservatives. Gore and his aides said they
hope the speech will be ``visionary,'' distinguishing himself from
President Clinton and setting the stage for his own presidential
campaign.

Florida humidity at a junkyard near Cape Canaveral, covered by
weeds and all but forgotten. It was the last artifact of America's
efforts to build a supersonic passenger plane that promised to be
an aviation tour de force that would have profoundly changed the
face of aviation.
</P>
<P>
   The full-scale, $11 million mock-up of The Boeing Co.'s
supersonic transport has had a vagabond existence since it was sold
to a Nebraska millionaire and transported in seven railroad cars
from Seattle to Florida after Congress killed the SST project in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most of it has finally found a permanent home, thanks to a
California aviation pioneer who had help from friends at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the highly publicized saga of the old ferry Kalakala,
which was rescued from mudflats in Alaska and recently returned to
Seattle for restoration, the effort to save this piece of aviation
history has played out without public notice.
</P>
<P>
   A 100-foot section of the fuselage, including the cockpit and
the plane's ``droop snoot'' needle nose, was rescued from the space
center junkyard, shipped cross-country in trucks and is being
restored at the recently opened Hiller Aviation Museum near San
Francisco. Eventually, visitors will be able to sit in the
first-class cabin and even operate from the cockpit the droop
snoot, which was designed to be lowered to give pilots better
visibility during takeoffs and landings.
</P>
<P>
   The mock-up will be as close as anyone gets to a Boeing-built
SST until well into the next century. Boeing recently decided to
delay until at least 2020 developing a new generation passenger jet
that would fly several times faster than the speed of sound,
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for quite a display. We feel very fortunate to have
it,'' said Stanley Hiller Jr., a longtime member of Boeing's board
of directors who spent two decades trying to turn his dream of an
educational aviation museum into a reality. The Northern California
museum that bears his name opened this past May.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we finish the restoration,'' he said of the SST mock-up,
``it will look like a flyable aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuselage section acquired by the museum already is on
display with some 75 other airplanes, and its needle nose was
recently mated again to the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from being restored, however. As Hiller said, ``If you
saw it now, it looks a little like it's been in a very long sleep.
It was just lying in the weeds and rain for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue and white Boeing paint job has faded and the fuselage
has been consumed by rust and streaked with years of grime since
that day on Sept. 29, 1966, when the sleek mock-up, only a dozen
feet shorter than a football field, was unveiled to the media,
airline representatives and other VIPs at Boeing's Developmental
Center off East Marginal Way in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Legend &AMP; Legacy: The Story of Boeing and Its
People,'' Robert Sterling wrote of that moment:
</P>
<P>
   ``The visitors were gathered on a balcony in the Developmental
Center; a bridge connected the balcony to the mock-up, which was
bathed in darkness until the moment of unveiling. A series of
spotlights came on one by one, illuminating the immense needle-nose
blue-and-white plane in sections. The last spotlight threw its beam
at the large `USA' on the tail, as a voice intoned over a
loudspeaker: `This ... is the Boeing supersonic transport!'''
</P>
<P>
   As the plane's nose was raised and lowered, guests were escorted
across the bridge into the model's interior, which Sterling wrote
was ``as spectacular as the exterior.'' The carpeting was a rich
but pleasing blue. Each of the seats, which alternated deep reds
and purples with splashes of orange, contained its own television
screen, a personal touch that would become available only when
Boeing introduced the 777 nearly 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The mock-up was not just for show. It was built to test
engineering designs for two prototypes of a Boeing SST that would
carry 250 passengers at Mach 2.7, or about 1,800 miles per hour.
That's faster than today's jet fighters can fly.
</P>
<P>
   The mock-up had the same section breaks and critical dimensions
as the planned prototypes, including wings that could be swept back
after takeoff to provide a more efficient angle for supersonic
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prototypes were to be made of titanium, the mock-up
was built of wood, steel and aluminum. Fifty tons of steel, 42,800
linear feet of lumber and 3,500 sheets of plywood went into the
mock-up.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only SST Boeing would build.
</P>
<P>
   Painted by critics as a white elephant and by environmentalists
as a destroyer of the Earth's ozone, the project ended abruptly
shortly after midnight on May 20, 1971, when the U.S. Senate killed
further funding.
</P>
<P>
   More than $1 billion already had been spent on developing the
SST.
</P>
<P>
   The 288-foot mock-up was put up for sale, but initial bids came
from companies that wanted Boeing to pay them to haul it away as
junk. Finally, it was sold by sealed bid to Marks O. Morrison for
$31,119. Morrison was a pilot, aviation buff and millionaire from
Nebraska who wanted the model as the centerpiece for an aviation
museum he planned in Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1973, with the help of Boeing engineers, it was taken
apart, loaded on to seven railroad cars and hauled to Kissimmee,
Fla. There it was reassembled on a concrete slab the size of a
football field that had been poured in a cow pasture about 15 miles
east of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's transportation bill was $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation museum, which opened July 4 that year, was
literally built around the mock-up, with the plane's tail _ the tip
of which rose 50 feet _ sticking through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the museum drew crowds, but visitors eventually
stopped coming and the museum closed in 1981. It would have cost
too much to take the plane apart and move it elsewhere, so it
remained when the property was sold to Faith World.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentecostal church held services under the wings until 1988.
Two years later, the building was sold to another church group, the
Osceola New Assembly of God. And it wanted the SST out.
</P>
<P>
   The story quickly attracted attention. Time magazine sent a
reporter. A CBS crew showed up.
</P>
<P>
   At a Sunday service, church pastor Ernie DeLoach told his
congregation that he hoped the plane could be saved rather than
hacked into bits, but it had to go so the church could expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some of you are going to miss this plane, and that some
of you will shed tears,' he said. ``Some churches have steeples.
Ours has an airplane tail sticking through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The mock-up was nearly sold for $10,000 to a scrap dealer, but
the deal fell through just days before the plane was to have been
chopped up.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a retired NASA engineer named Charlie Bell came
calling on the Osceola New Assembly of God.
</P>
<P>
   Bell liked to collect space-age artifacts and had restored a
couple of Redstone and Atlas rockets. At the request of the Puerto
Rican government, he had even built a rocket park near San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   After reading in a newspaper that the SST mock-up might end up
on the scrap heap, Bell bought it in late 1990 for an undisclosed
amount and, with the help of friends, took it apart in seven
sections and transported them to a former steel plant he owned on
Merritt Island, just outside one of the gates to the Kennedy Space
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bell removed valuable instruments from the mockup and took them
inside the plant to protect them from the weather, but the seven
pieces of fuselage, nose, wings and tail were left outside.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, aviation buffs from around the world who knew
about Boeing's SST project and the history of the mock-up would
track Bell down and visit the old steel plant just across the
highway from the Shuttle Bar &AMP; Grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it needs is a good high-pressure washing ... and some
tender loving care,'' Bell told a Post-Intelligencer reporter who
visited the mock-up late last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bell said he was talking to someone interested in
buying the mock-up and putting it in a museum. The buyer turned out
to be Stanley Hiller Jr.
</P>
<P>
   A native of San Francisco, Hiller pioneered many of the
vertical-lift concepts that led to the modern helicopter. He built
his first helicopter, which he named the XH-44, in a friend's
garage at age 16. It was the first helicopter ever to fly on the
West Coast, hovering over the football field at Berkeley Memorial
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, at age 18, he founded the Hiller Aircraft Co. It would
produce more than 2,000 helicopters for military and commercial
use.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller's $25 million museum opened in May on land leased from
San Mateo County near the San Carlos Airport. It features 100
exhibits and 75 aircraft, including some built by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller, now 73, has a fondness for Boeing planes. He was on the
company's board for 22 years. Although it was his ties with Boeing
that led him to the SST mock-up, Hiller understood the plane's
importance in aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fit the theme of our museum, which is not only to look back
but to look ahead in aviation to the next 100 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing helped Hiller locate the mock-up and sent engineers to
Florida to examine its condition. Hiller hoped to bring all of the
mock-up back to his museum, but it would have taken up too much
space.
</P>
<P>
   The fuselage section, cockpit and nose were taken from Florida
to California on two flat-bed trucks. Boeing coordinated the
difficult wide-load transport task with the various states along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is providing expertise to ensure the mock-up is
restored to its original condition, including the cabin interior
and cockpit instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our being able to do this is a real credit to Boeing,'' Hiller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bell nor Hiller will say how much the museum paid for
the mock-up. Bell said he didn't make money on the deal; he just
got back what he paid the Osceola New Assembly of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I could help find a home for it,'' Bell said. ``It
could easily have ended up as scrap metal.''

CRUSADER TARGETS CORRUPTION IN SOUTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEOUL _ Call it Korea's tale of David and Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Jang Ha Sung, a bespectacled, mild-mannered professor of
finance, has taken on the corporate giants of South Korea. And
shockingly, in a country where the chaebol, or family-run
conglomerates, control almost every aspect of life, Jang has
achieved victories that no one dreamed possible.
</P>
<P>
   With his conservative maroon tie and briefcase full of financial
documents, Jang is no Che Guevara. But that might be why he and his
band of progressive lawyers and professionals _ People's Solidarity
for Participatory Democracy _ could be the most effective
revolutionary group that tradition-bound South Korea has seen in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, we'd march and yell. But when you're dealing
with the chaebol, that doesn't work. It has to be pressure within
the system,'' said Jang, a former student activist and Wharton
School of Management graduate.
</P>
<P>
   By persuading average Korean shareholders and large American
investment funds to sign over voting rights to him, Jang has
pressured chaebol to clean up management, cut corruption, and open
their often-doctored accounts to public view. In cases where
pressure hasn't worked, Jang and his crew have resorted to the
American-style response: Sue the guys in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Jang and his band of anti-establishment
establishmentarians is a lesson in how the mood of even a
conservative nation can shift when people become fed up with crony
capitalism. The response here has not been violent as in Indonesia,
where people rioted and brought down a government. For that reason,
Jang's crusade to clean up Korean corporations may prove far more
effective in overhauling this economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him as a quixotic figure. One man tilting at the
corporate windmills is not going to knock them down or make them
salute him,'' Hank Morris, director of the Seoul-based Industrial
Research and Consulting Ltd., said of Jang. ``It'll probably be
years before his work has great impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet,'' Morris conceded, ``there are signs that he has had
some initial success. I have to take my hat off to him, because
what he is doing is quite courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Courageous because the chaebol mostly control life here. They
dominate business, from electronics and cars to real estate and
advertising. They own newspapers and television stations and run
foundations that set the cultural agenda. They own schools,
universities, and hospitals. And they have also controlled many
politicians and banks through bribery and collusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, they own it,'' said Jang, sitting behind his desk
at Korea University, piled high with papers documenting
illegalities in top conglomerates. ``If we want to make this
country more efficient, cleaner, more open, less corrupt, we have
to reform the chaebol and cut their relations with politics. Right
now, they are stronger than the government. Presidents come and go
every five years, but the chaebol never change.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the denizens of industry have not been amused
by the 45-year-old upstart. Jang, whose father was a businessman
and whose uncles are a top politician and the president of Korea
Electric Power Co., says being from the same background as many
chaebol elite has made his crusade harder.
</P>
<P>
   Managers first lobbied him through family and friends to drop
his campaign. Then came phone calls to his home and efforts to dig
up dirt from his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these top managers are my school and college
classmates, and we are talking about issues that nobody's
comfortable with,'' Jang said. ``But in their hearts, they know
that if not all, at least part of what I am doing is good and
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Koreans had long chalked up the roaring growth of the last three
decades to state-directed capitalism that featured cozy ties among
government, banks, and chaebol. But average folk now blame
conglomerates burdened by staggering debts for the crisis that
forced Seoul to accept a $57 billion bailout last year, the largest
ever granted by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting recession has been one of the worst in Asia _ the
economy is expected to contract 7 percent this year, and about 2
million people are jobless. And although average laborers have
taken a bite by accepting layoffs and pay cuts, everyone from
Korean President Kim Dae Jung to President Clinton complains that
the biggest chaebol have refused to accept reforms that would allow
the whole economy to recover. The top five chaebol, including
Hyundai, Samsung, and Daewoo, account for 40 percent of economic
activity here.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the problem are years of government pressure on
banks to lend to chaebol, which in turn were given the right to
overborrow and expand into every kind of business _ in exchange for
donations to politicians. In the process, conglomerates did as they
pleased _ using funds from flush companies to subsidize failing
subsidiaries, selling products to sister companies at inflated
prices, and issuing discounted shares to the chairman's family.
</P>
<P>
   Jang's aim is to prevent such practices and reform corporate
governance by speaking out for minority shareholders. His movement
began in 1994, but gained steam last year when the economy began to
show signs of wear. In January 1997, the Hanbo Steel conglomerate
went bust, bringing down with it Korea First Bank, which had made
more than $805 million in loans to Hanbo.
</P>
<P>
   Jang and his friends went onto the streets with placards asking
shareholders to sign over their voting rights in a campaign to
reform the bank. About 150 disgruntled stockholders _ from rich
individuals to janitors saving for retirement _ did so. Soon they
had 1 percent of First Bank's shares, the magic number to propose
an agenda, open a company's books, or sue executives.
</P>
<P>
   Jang's group suggested a plan to cut the labor force, sell off
bad assets and affiliates, form an independent appraisal company,
and fire top executives. First Bank rejected the plan, so the
minority shareholders sued, seeking $30 million compensation for
illegal loans to Hanbo and illegal political contributions. In
July, they won, Jang said.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Jang's group filed suit to stop Samsung
Electronics from issuing a convertible bond to the chairman's son
at a discounted price. They won an injunction, but Samsung was
allowed to issue the bond, though they were barred from selling it
on the Korea Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Jang's group attended the Samsung Electronics'
shareholders' meeting, an affair that was reportedly packed with
employees who were urged to jeer at Jang and fill seats to prevent
other minority shareholders from attending. The usually cursory
agenda dragged on 13 1/2 hours as Jang's group interrogated
management about allegedly illegal transactions and a shell company
in Ireland. Jang also protested the appointment as auditor of a
former government official who had been convicted of taking bribes
from Samsung.
</P>
<P>
   But 1 percent of votes was not enough, and in the end, ``they
did what they wanted,'' Jang said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Jang's most successful campaign was targeting SK Telecom Co.
Joining forces with Koreans and big American institutional
investors _ Scudder Kemper, Tiger, Oppenheimer and Emerging Markets
Investors _ Jang's alliance amassed 18 percent of shares, enough to
force SK Telecom to accept three independent board directors to
represent minority shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman's family also reimbursed the company $23 million,
which Jang said they took in illegal profits. And SK Telecom _ the
cash cow of SK Group's 45 companies _ was reimbursed $270
million &UR;  &LR; that its managers had drained away to ailing affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Jang calls SK Telecom his group's one victory. Even though they
won a lawsuit against Korea First Bank, the bank is still on the
verge of collapse. ``Our purpose is to make the companies better,''
Jang said. ``Unless we turn it around and make a company a success,
I wouldn't say we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Jang has attracted the attention of US diplomats, who invited
him as one of six guests last week at a roundtable with Clinton,
and the admiration of several institutional investors who have made
him their proxy. Jang has asked two Boston-based investment funds _
Putnam Investments and Wellington Management _ to join forces with
him, and a Wellington representative is expected to meet Jang here
in a few days to discuss his work.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jarvis, Korea analyst for the Arlington, Va.-based Emerging
Markets Investors Corp., recounted that largely because of the
efforts of Jang, ``corporate governance is in the vocabulary of
every chaebol I meet these days. It remains to be seen if their
deeds will match their words.''

GIVE THANKS TO GORE FOR TAKING ON MAHATHIR MOHAMAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- As lying, racist, anti-Semitic crooks go, Mahathir
Mohamad is small potatoes, except for the fact that any time a
lying, racist, anti-Semitic crook is actually running a country
it's wise to beware, at least out of respect for history.
</P>
<P>
   That goes double when the slime in question has been running the
place for more than 17 years, jails his deputy and has him beaten,
thumbs his nose at the world by placing controls on capital flows,
and blames his country's economic woes repeatedly on Jews and then
tries to deny having said it.
</P>
<P>
   Look on the prime minister of Malaysia, in short, as Louis
Farrakhan with a government, and be thankful that the likes of Al
Gore have decided to take him on now that he has become a threat
not only to human rights but also to a gradual return to economic
stability in turbulent Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It has barely been two weeks since Gore identified the United
States with the forces of reform _ political and economic _ in
Malaysia, obviously too soon for sweeping judgments about the
aftermath, but not too soon to notice some hopeful signs.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Prime Minister Mohamad himself has shied away
from any response to Gore's direct, tough criticism of his brutal
treatment of a prominent former government leader and protege, his
dangerous challenge to economic reform principles, and his related
suppression of political reformers whose peaceful agitation for
real democracy threatens his grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the visible signs of democratic activism _ protest
gatherings each Saturday _ not only continue, but are attracting
more participants. Less visible is a vibrant democracy movement
that is gaining strength and followers via a uniquely vigorous use
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And for a third, the increase in the world press's attention to
Malaysia has been huge, and may be the most important, short-term
consequence of Gore's well-timed intervention. It may be the most
important because the signal being sent by the increased scrutiny
is that Malaysia may not be the island of ``stability,'' the safe
investment haven it has long been assumed to be, that perhaps
international businesses and financial organizations need to
seriously rethink their assumptions. That prospect is delightfully
subversive.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreign policy priesthood, Gore's explicit words in Kuala
Lumpur produced some classic tsk-tsking _ rude to the host,
distracting at an Asian economic summit, counterproductive, and all
the other realpolitik cliches that post-Cold War reality is
rendering intellectually silly.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, the tsk-tsking has missed the point
factually as well as strategically, particularly in two areas:
</P>
<P>
   _Gore didn't simply blurt out a few phrases about free people
and free markets and single out for praise the ``reformasi''
activists in Malaysia. His comments were the culmination of weeks
of escalating alarm in the Clinton administration, and would have
been delivered by the president himself had Saddam Hussein's latest
outrages not intervened.
</P>
<P>
   _The bulk of his speech to the summit concerned the vital
importance of economic reforms in extricating the region and the
world from financial danger _ more disclosure of basic economic
information, more open markets for capital as well as goods and
services, and less crony capitalism and corruption. That was just
as tough a slam at current, kleptomaniacal practices in Malaysia as
his remarks on political freedom, but the foreign policy priesthood
(with economic interests at stake) somehow found that not only
excusable but even praiseworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Malaysia was an economic success story in the
main, though tarnished by a prime minister who gloated more than
most regional autocrats over the superiority of ``Asian values'' of
conformity over Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis, however, produced a unique lurch in Prime
Minister Mohamad's behavior. To shield his country in the short run
and promote his reelection next year, he slapped currency and other
anti-market controls on the economy, and began blaming outsiders in
general and Jews in particular for his problems.
</P>
<P>
   And because this kind of dictatorial economics and bigoted blame
game is usually accompanied by political misdeeds, he also went
after his longtime deputy, Anwar Ibrahim _ a free-market democracy
advocate well known in international circles as well as to Al Gore
personally. Ibrahim was arrested on trumped-up corruption and sex
charges and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The post-arrest photos of his bruises and his ex-boss's virulent
anti-Semitism galvanized the administration and Gore weeks ago to
public criticism, and the vice president's speech was preceded by a
highly publicized visit to Ibrahim's wife by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not act rashly, in short. His words had both context
and careful timing, and the world needs more of them, not less.

BLAME THE WHITE HOUSE SCANDAL ON GARY HART 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ OK, I know we're all tired of the subject,
but has it occurred to anyone else that this whole business of the
Starrship Lewinsky is the fault of Gary Hart?
</P>
<P>
   If you're too young, you may not remember the senator from
Colorado, a bright Democratic hopeful who had his eye on the White
House. Unlike the lackluster Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis of
his time, he was a forceful and charismatic campaigner who offered
a specific program of opposition to the Republican policies of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   He was doing pretty well on the march through the 1988 primaries
when Miami reporters caught him spending late-night hours in a
townhouse with a woman not his wife. Magazines and newspapers also
printed stories about Hart's being off on a boat called Monkey
Business _ without his wife but in the company of a couple of women
described, whether or not accurately, as bimbos.
</P>
<P>
   What Hart did _ perhaps nobly from his own point of view but
disastrously both for American politics and for American journalism
_ was to concede that the revelation about his private life was
important, and to withdraw from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   What Hart could have done _ and by doing so could have set a
precedent that politicians of every conviction, from Wilbur Mills
to Henry Hyde, could have relied on _ was to say simply, ``My
private life is none of your bloody business, and has nothing to do
in any way with my competence to be president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he done so and stayed in the race, he might not have won the
nomination, but we would not have had to wait this long to learn
that Americans are sanely capable of separating serious government
from salacious gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Bill Clinton, regardless of Gary Hart, could have done
the same thing (in 1992 he did, and it worked).
</P>
<P>
   The accusation by Paula Jones was different. Whatever its truth,
it was about sexual harassment _ an act that, not being consensual,
cannot be private, and therefore must be dealt with publicly. But
the business about the adventurous and far-from-innocent Beverly
Hills chippy who wrote about earning her ``presidential kneepads''
(and who has never been cross-examined) is something else again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had sexual relations with that woman.'' That's
what Clinton said. What he could and should have said was: ``My
personal sex life is none of your business; it was never any of
your business, and it will never be any of your business. Do you
have any questions about Northern Ireland?''
</P>
<P>
   Because, you see, that has to be the point. When the jinni of
your dreams promises you three wishes, you're always dutiful enough
to make the first wish for ``world peace'' _ and since the fall of
the Berlin Wall, the three biggest threats to world peace have been
the conflicts in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East and in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   During the six years of Clinton's presidency, all parties agree
that his administration was a major force in bringing about a peace
agreement in Northern Ireland; it brought about the Wye accords, in
which an Israeli prime minister actually signed an agreement with
Yasser Arafat; and, tenuous though it is, the world press routinely
refers to the ``U.S.-brokered'' cease-fire agreement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland may blow up again; it may be that neither side really
wants peace in the Middle East; and I confess to understanding the
Balkans no better than do most Americans. But surely some
distinction must be made between this sort of diplomatic heroism
and a private life perhaps three miracles short of sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon was specifically ordered by the Congress not to
extend the war in Vietnam beyond that country's borders. In
deliberate (and admitted) violation of that limitation, Nixon
personally ordered the bombing of neutral Cambodia _ with reports
of 3,000 civilian deaths. The House Judiciary Committee chose not
to include that war crime in its impeachment investigation, because
(as one committee member wrote to me personally), ``We have enough
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's potential impeachment, even without the bombing of
Cambodia, was about something that had to do with the presidency.
Clinton's troubles are about, to use the usual weasel phrase, oral
sex. If he had had the good sense to tell the first investigators,
and all who came after, that it was none of their business, he'd
have made an important contribution both to politics and to
journalism, and would have found himself where most of us have been
all the time.

AIDS STILL RAGES, AND DRASTIC MEASURES ARE NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You thought the AIDS epidemic was tailing off? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   An American dies from this plague-for-which-there-is-no-vaccine
every 15 minutes. Another American is infected every 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   You thought today's young people have been educated about safe
sex? Wrong; worldwide, half of all HIV-AIDS infections come in
those age 15 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Despite wonderful medical gains, colossal investment of reseach
money, and vastly improved knowledge about how to not only prevent
but treat this plague, ``HIV-AIDS remains the most dangerous public
health threat of our time,'' said Robert Wakefield, director of
Boston's Lemuel Shattuck Hospital. The Shattuck and the
Massachusetts Medical Society sponsored an ``AIDS at the
Millennium'' conference Nov. 18 at the Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is World AIDS Day. Despite the discovery of
protease-inhibitors drug cocktails, nine out of 10 of the 40
million people infected worldwide have no shot at getting those
drugs, whose US cost per patient can range from $25,000 to $40,000
a year. Nearly half of America's AIDS cases are black _ 43 percent
_ but blacks are only 12 percent of the population. Among infected
females, 60 percent are black, typically sex partners of men who
may use dirty needles to inject drugs. AIDS is the number one cause
of death among 16- to 24-year-old women.
</P>
<P>
   But the infernal viruses surprise other demographic groups. In
Florida, 15 percent of AIDS cases are in people over 50, primarily
heterosexuals. But overall, here as in the rest of the world, AIDS
is becoming a disease of women, the poor, minorities, and gay men
engaging in unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   While the disease spreads among the vulnerable here, in the
Third World the epidemic rampages. Asia, India, Latin America, and
worst of all, Africa, suffer a plague of biblical scale. Scientists
and bureaucrats are in the oldest race of all: against time. In
broad swaths of sub-Saharan Africa, one out out of every three
people between 15 and 55 are already infected. Life expectancy in
Botswana, where one in four adults are already infected, has fallen
from 61 years to 45, and a decade from now could drop to 33, warns
Harvard's Dr. Daniel Tarantola.
</P>
<P>
   Within 11 years, 40 million children worldwide will have been
orphaned by AIDS. ``We have never before in the history of man had
children losing their family at this rate,'' said Loretta
McLaughlin, a Fellow of the Harvard AIDS Institute. ``In Africa,
and soon in India, there is a fall-off in skilled manpower because
in a lot of these places the skills run only one person deep. A lot
of Third World countries don't want to talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   By June, the Christian Science Monitor calculates, the planet's
population will be 6 billion, double what it was in 1960, the year
JFK was elected. One out of three humans today is under age 15.
Those hormones are kicking in. The right-wing foes of abortion and
family planning in Congress this year blocked the US from
contributing even its usual pittance to the UN Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 2.1 children per woman to maintain population at a
steady level. The United States and most European countries have
fertility rates lower than that; our population increase (2.3
million a year) comes mostly from immigration. By the year 2050,
India will have more people than China, the United Nations
projects. We'll be the number three country, but there'll be about
as many Pakistanis as Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia and Nigeria combined will be double our population
now. Ethiopia and Congo combined will equal the US population then.
Africa will have three times the population of Europe and Russia in
51 years. Without question poverty and population pressure in Third
World countries will spur migration _ legal or illegal _ to the
developed world. Immigrants cannot come without bringing their
diseases with them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is tragic and stupid for young gay males to engage in
promiscuous and unprotected sex, it is folly on a grand scale for
politicians to refuse to fund needle exchange programs, condom
distribution, and aggressive sex education programs for
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of infection is still going up in Massachusetts among
the urban poor,'' points out McLaughlin, despite the demonstrable
reduction possible with bolder efforts to meet the crisis.
Conservatives elected to office on the ``just say no'' theme about
teen sex tell voters they are being moral and good. But the May 20
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association
editorialized that the abstinence-only approach the Republican
Congress funded for $50 million is woefully misguided and
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching safe sex has to be part of the effort, but the
conservatives block money for that. The editorial concludes:
``Public health policy should be empirically driven, not
ideologically motivated. Ideologically motivated policy decisions
may inadvertently cause a grave disservice to our youth, many of
whom are ill-equipped with the knowledge and the skills necessary
to reduce high-risk sexual behaviors. In the end, we risk
jeopardizing the health and well-being of a generation of youth.''
</P>
<P>
   To halt the AIDS epidemic, we need drastic measures. That
includes overriding the well-intentioned but misguided conservative
politicians who are disarming the doctors and teachers we need in
the front lines for this battle. If HIV-AIDS strikes down someone
you care about, who might have been spared by sterner measures, you
can't say no one ever told you.

A HOLIDAY OF MIXED BLESSINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a guinea pig in our freezer, his shoe box coffin wedged
between Ziploc bags of turkey meat and Tupperware containers of
creamed onions, an incongruous presence among the Thanksgiving
leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Death came without warning. No sooner had 8-year-old Katie
pronounced herself especially thankful for Fritz the dog,
Marshmallow the rabbit, and Zachary-Christine, the guinea pig of
indeterminate gender, than the smallest of our family pets keeled
over in its cage and died.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the simplest of American holidays, Thanksgiving is
also our most ambiguous. There is no pressure to produce a perfect
gift, no demand in this informal age to appear at the table in a
velvet dress or a bow tie. The most that is asked of us is to bake
a pie, help with the dishes, and hold our tongue when one or
another of our distant relatives makes an especially asinine
remark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no family measures up to Norman Rockwell's idealized
image of domestic harmony and few can wholly embrace the
Wampanoags' view of the holiday as a national day of mourning for
the loss of Native American land and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden demise of Zac-Chris, as he/she was informally known,
is something of a metaphor for the mixed blessing that was
Thanksgiving in our house this year, that the holiday probably is
in most houses most years.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered around a bountiful table, at once grateful for one
another's company and awkward about how _ or even whether _ to
acknowledge the fresh absence of the family matriarch we lost last
spring. Every chair in the newly refurbished dining room was
occupied, but an empty space remained. Each member of a
reconfigured family was working out a new role. The unspoken aim of
a clan known for its emotional reserve was to concede, but not
dwell upon, the changed domestic landscape. A dampness around the
eyes might be appropriate; an abundance of tears, a little over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   It's never that easy, however, especially for those for whom the
finality of death is not yet entirely comprehensible and for whom
little distinction is made between the loss of a favored pet and a
beloved grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't Santa Claus please bring Grandma and Zac back for
Christmas?, Katie asked between sobs.
</P>
<P>
   No, we told her gently, that's just not possible.
</P>
<P>
   The genuineness of her plea made it easy to suppress the smile
prompted by the image of my mother seated beneath a Douglas fir,
tucked between a pair of Roller Blades and a Beanie Baby, holding
the guinea pig that, out of Katie's earshot, she was known to
sneeringly refer to as ``that filthy rodent.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an unfair characterization. Zac kept himself clean enough
and he was a distinctive-looking rodent, as rodents go. A streak of
red fur over his left ear made him look either rakish or punkish,
depending on your age. His otherwise black-and-white fur stood
straight up along his back, Mohawk-style.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know what his expectations were, of course, but by
our own measure he had a good life for a guinea pig. His bedding of
fresh wood shavings was changed daily rather than mixed with the
cedar chips that eliminated odor but irritated his nose. He had
fresh water and nutritionally balanced food.
</P>
<P>
   It's true he didn't do very much. He cared little for the great
outdoors. If Katie put him in the yard, she could be sure he'd be
in the same spot an hour later. If she let him loose in the
playroom, though, he would soon be lost behind the television set
or among the stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   The guinea pig's squeak was louder than the dog's bark. It
reverberated off the walls of the basement playroom whenever we
descended the stairs. Zac was not signaling pleasure at our
presence; rather, he was issuing demands for fresh carrot peels.
Such was the racket he made that we felt compelled to exile him to
the laundry room during the children's sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   We are full of grief and penitence now for our annoyance with
the guinea pig. When there is no time for goodbyes, there is an
abundance for recrimination. Did we feed him enough? Too much? Did
we ignore a warning sign that might have saved him?
</P>
<P>
   Katie has picked the spot for Zac-Chris's interment, between the
flowering crab apple and the lace-cap hydrangea in an area of the
backyard we have designated as Grandma's garden. ``So Grandma can
look after Zac-Chris in heaven,'' Katie said. It's a prospect I
know my mother will welcome with all the ambivalence of a typical
Thanksgiving.

INMATES ON DEATH ROW ARE MORE LIKELY TO WALK THAN DIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The enemies of capital punishment often raise the specter of a
fallible criminal justice system sending an innocent man to the
electric chair. Many of those who make this argument do so in bad
faith, for they oppose the death penalty even when a murderer's
guilt is undoubted. Which of them, for instance, favored the
execution of Karla Faye Tucker, who gleefully butchered her victims
with a pickaxe?
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is conceivable that all the safeguards built into
the law could fail, and that someone not guilty could be put to
death. There is no evidence that such a thing has happened in
modern times, and the odds against it are dizzyingly steep. Still,
as with any human endeavor, there is always some level of risk.
Airplanes crash. Patients die under the knife. But only a crank
would propose that we abolish air travel or do away with surgery
for fear of committing a fatal error. It is equally irrational to
refuse to bring murderers to justice because of the remote and
speculative possibility of executing an innocent defendant.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that such a tragedy never occurs, capital-murder
statutes go to extreme lengths to err on the side of caution. In
Massachusetts, which still lacks the death penalty, Governor Paul
Cellucci has proposed a bill that would not permit an execution
unless:
</P>
<P>
   (a) the jury found that, in addition to the murder itself, one
of 12 aggravating circumstances had been proved beyond a reasonable
doubt;
</P>
<P>
   (b) all mitigating evidence was considered;
</P>
<P>
   (c) a second jury voted unanimously for the death sentence;
</P>
<P>
   (d) the defendant was represented by two experienced attorneys,
at least one of whom had demonstrable proficiency in capital cases;
</P>
<P>
   (e) the conviction and the sentence were both upheld on appeal
to the state supreme court, which would have wide discretion to
overturn a lower court's ruling; and
</P>
<P>
   (f) the conviction was reviewed by the governor, who has the
power to recommend commutation.
</P>
<P>
   No aspect of US criminal law is as relentless and obsessive as
the search for grounds to set aside a death sentence. In the past
quarter-century, fewer than 500 death row inmates have been
executed, while more than 2,000 have had their sentences vacated. A
prisoner under sentence of death is much less likely to die than to
have his conviction overturned (often on a technicality), his
sentence commuted, a new trial ordered, or a pardon granted. Vast
amounts of time, money, and judicial attention are spent on efforts
to save death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In short, of all the punishments meted out to American
criminals, none is less arbitrary and capricious than the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet death penalty opponents illogically cite this very
stringency _ the fact that many death row inmates are spared _ as
``proof'' that states with capital punishment stand a good chance
of executing innocent victims. It is like claiming that since
poultry inspectors reject tainted birds before they reach the
market, consumers can expect to find spoiled chicken on their
grocer's shelves.
</P>
<P>
   At Northwestern University two weeks ago, an antideath penalty
rally posing as a scholarly conference showcased 29 former death
row inmates. One by one, they walked to a podium and introduced
themselves as innocent victims who had been wrongly condemned. ``My
name is John Henry Knapp,'' said one. ``Had the state of Arizona
gotten its way, I would be dead today.'' Then he, like the others,
placed a sunflower in a crystal vase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dare anyone to look at those flowers that they wanted to
extinguish,'' said Lawrence Marshall, the Northwestern law
professor who organized the event, ``and tell us that their death
penalty works.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sheer sophistry. Had the 29 been killed, their deaths
would have cast doubt on the reliability of the death penalty. But
they weren't killed, they were released. Far from failing them, the
system saved their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The sour truth is that the foes of capital punishment don't
really care about rescuing the innocent. If they did, they would
ignore the death penalty and focus instead on the early release of
criminals from prison. For that is the single greatest cause of
homicide in America.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 study, the Department of Justice (using 1991 data)
found that 45 percent of all state prisoners had committed their
most recent crime while out on probation or parole. While ``under
supervision'' in the community (i.e., free), they committed 13,200
murders. Half their victims were strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies reach similar conclusions. In the nation's 75
largest counties, more than one-third of all murders in 1990 were
committed by criminals on probation, parole, or pretrial release.
Of the 1,411 murderers convicted in Virginia between 1990 and 1993,
one-third _ 474 _ were on some form of early release.
</P>
<P>
   An activist genuinely alarmed about the loss of life in this
country would throw himself into a crusade to eliminate probation
and parole.
</P>
<P>
   But saving innocents isn't what motivates Marshall and his
antideath penalty allies. No _ their goal is saving the guilty. A
few dozen murderers are put to death each year in the United
States. If Marshall &AMP; Co. had their way, each of those murderers
would live to a ripe old age. And that, in a nutshell, is what the
death penalty abolitionists are all about: long life for killers.

NETWORK TELEVISION'S NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, Marc Andreessen was a student at the University
of Illinois, tinkering with software that enabled people to access
the Internet with ease. Five days ago, the company he founded after
graduating from college _ Netscape _ was sold to America Online for
$4 billion. In the course of five short years, Andreessen changed
the face of computing forever. He is now involved in a venture that
may do something similar to broadcast television.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, it was announced that Andreessen had made a
significant investment in a small Silicon Valley start-up called
Replay Networks Inc., and that he would take a seat on the
company's board. Replay Networks will soon bring to market a
digital television recording system, similar to a videocassette
recorder, that will initially retail for $999.
</P>
<P>
   The system is called ReplayTV and in the words of New York Times
technology correspondent John Markoff, it will ``enable users to
record a complete program that is already in progress, to
automatically record programs that meet a predetermined criterion _
for example, movies featuring a particular actor _ and to
intelligently skip commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   The ReplayTV system houses a 7-Gigabyte hard-disk drive similar
to a personal computer's hard drive. According to Daily Variety,
``cable or satellite TV programming signals coming into the house
are sent into the unit, where they're compressed and recorded on
the disk drive. Software inside the device enables the user to
easily select programs up to two weeks in the future to record on
the disk drive for later viewing, as well as pause, fast forward
and review programming that they're currently watching and that's
still being recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   This technology represents a potentially lethal threat to the
broadcast television business. Broadcasters break even (or lose
money) on network programming and make a killing on their
owned-and-operated affiliates (O&AMP;Os). This arrangement allows
broadcasters to present themselves as competitively disadvantaged
(we can't make a buck in this business) while their O&AMP;Os mint money
for shareholders (we've just had another record year).
</P>
<P>
   Everything depends on a huge advertising revenue stream to cover
(or almost cover) the costs of network programming and fatten the
profit margins at the owned affiliates. To keep that revenue stream
flowing, broadcasters must convince advertising agencies that
spending vast sums of money on television commercials is the
``only'' way to reach a mass audience. This they have done with
considerable success for the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   But what if consumers adapt to digital television recording
systems as quickly as they did to videocassette recorders? The
first thing that happens is that Microsoft and everybody else will
get into the business of manufacturing digital television recording
systems and the price of said systems will plummet to a commodity
rate of about $199 per unit. The second thing that will happen is
that viewers will have complete control over content. If they don't
want to watch television commercials, they won't have to. The third
thing that will happen is that the network schedule (``ER'' at 10
p.m.) becomes fungible. Someone can watch the news from 9:45 to
10:07 (minus all commercials) and then watch ER in 50 minutes
(minus all commercials). Should they be interrupted for any reason,
they would simply ``pause'' the programming and return to it at
their convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a moment that you run an advertising agency. Would
you tell your clients to sign a long-term advertising deal with NBC
or CBS, knowing that in five years as many as 60 percent of all
households might be hooked up to digital television recording
systems? The only thing you might urge your clients to buy would be
``live'' events, such as breaking news stories or sports. You
wouldn't touch the rest of it, because you would know that anyone
with a digital television recording system can ``intelligently
skip'' commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Without this river of advertising revenue, the network equation
falls apart. Network programming goes broke. The owned-and-operated
affiliates also go broke. Cable television maintains its
subscription fees, but it also takes a huge hit on the revenue
side. Only HBO, Showtime and other premium television services
would be unaffected by the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who have used ReplayTV, it is a quantum leap
ahead of the videocassette recorder and is remarkably
user-friendly. ``The adaption rate is likely to be much faster than
VCRs,'' says one industry analyst, ``partly because it's like a VCR
and partly because it's so much easier to use.''
</P>
<P>
   If ReplayTV connects with consumers, then network television and
cable television will have to completely rethink their business
models, Hollywood television production companies will have to
rethink their distribution, and syndicators will have to
re-negotiate their contracts. Without advertising, television as we
know it is unsustainable. ReplayTV is a harbinger of the end of
television advertising.

LOOPHOLE IN BRADY LAW ALLOWS FOR UNCHECKED PURCHASES  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUNTA GORDA, Fla. _ Hassle-free sales and the bounty of choice _
Tec-9s, MAC-10s, double-action Berettas, and 9mm Glocks _ made
competition tough for the man wearing a ``for sale'' sign around
his neck and peddling a single rifle at the recent Suncoast Gun
Show &UR;  &LR; in this steamy Gulf Coast town.
</P>
<P>
   At any of the 5,000 gun shows around the country every year, an
individual claiming to be a private collector can sell firearms to
anyone who wants them. And private owners and collectors do not
have to record the transaction or subject the buyer to the
background check mandated by the 1993 Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   This means that people barred from buying guns at retail stores
_ fugitives, convicted felons, wife-beaters, illegal immigrants _
can slip under the Brady law radar by making purchases through
private owners and collectors at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no federal law whatsoever regulating gun shows,''
said BJ Zapor, a special agent of the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, law enforcement officials say these shows attract a
strong criminal element, along with hunters, collectors, and other
law-abiding citizens. Gun-control advocates say a loophole in the
law has transformed these shows into a legally sanctioned ``gray
market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not the gun shows themselves, it's the
unregulated sales that take place,'' said Sarah Brady, chairwoman
of Handgun Control Inc., a national advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control supporters like Brady are calling for change. This
month, President Clinton directed the administration to recommend
ways to close the loophole, and Representative Rod Blagojevich, an
Illinois Democrat, introduced a bill to crack down on off-the-book
firearms sales.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage of the Brady law expires Nov. 30. Henceforth,
the Justice Department will implement a system of instant
background checks to replace a five-day waiting period for gun
purchases. Like the previous system, the instant checks pertain
only to gun retailers, not hobbyists who sell at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Many collectors say the fears that gun shows attract criminals
are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crooks don't come to gun shows. They steal guns or get them on
the street,'' said a retired collector at the Punta Gorda show who
said he sells guns ``on the side.'' He requested that his name not
be used.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association also rejects the idea and opposes
efforts to close the loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a dealer, you need a permit, and if you are a
hobbyist or a collector, you don't,'' said Wayne LaPierre, the
NRA's executive vice president. ``This is the law and we support
it. I don't support the notion that criminals are getting guns at
shows. ... I don't believe more regulation is the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But ATF agents said licensed dealers have long complained about
private sellers. In a 1993 letter to a congressional subcommittee
considering amending the law, Bill Bridgewater, executive director
of the National Alliance of Stocking Gun Dealers, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do something about gun shows. Either shut them down or
regulate them and restrict their activities to legal transactions
in firearms. ... Every pugnacious child with a grudge to settle and
every other form of human predator has easy access to all the
firearms that they might desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say the history of gun shows demonstrates
the need for more regulation:
</P>
<P>
   _David Koresh acquired hundreds of weapons at shows and
stockpiled them in the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols bought and sold stolen
weapons at shows across the Midwest before the bombing of the
federal building in Oklahoma City, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   _Sam Dillon, a convicted Illinois serial killer who pleaded
guilty to five homicides, repeatedly bought, sold, and traded
weapons at gun shows, sometimes within hours of commiting crimes,
according to an investigation by the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Justice Department study found that an estimated 40
percent of all gun transfers are made in unregulated secondary
markets, including gun shows, flea markets, swap meets, and
classified ads.
</P>
<P>
   At the state and county level, a patchwork of laws regulate
gun-show sales. California and New Jersey have essentially outlawed
them. In Massachusetts, gun shows are legal, but both buyer and
seller are required to have a permit. Earlier this month, Florida
amended its constitution to let counties regulate gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gun-loving state, but people don't feel no questions
should be asked when someone buys a gun,'' said Edward Griffith,
assistant to the Miami-Dade County state attorney. ``They feel they
should know who it's being sold to.'' The state attorney's office
pushed the amendment, which passed with 70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to interview gun show promoters, including
Suncoast's, were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lack of regulation, ATF agents said it is
extremely difficult to draw the line between legitimate commerce
and a gray market.
</P>
<P>
   An ATF agent who asked not to be named said: ``I have yet to
encounter an unlicensed dealer who didn't say they were selling
from their `collection' that they just happened to have acquired
last week and want to get rid of this week.''

MEDICINE: REMAKING OURSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like the stuff of fiction, or a horror film plot line,
with mad scientists creating human body parts in laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a fact: Yard upon yard of human skin is being grown in
laboratories to help repair burns and leg ulcers. Tissue from pig
intestines is used to replace knee ligaments, and then stimulates
new human cell growth so that pig gut turns into human ligament.
And body pieces, from chest bone to thumbs, are being grown in
laboratories and then surgically attached to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue engineering _ an amalgam of biology, chemistry and
engineering _ is producing stunning results, including the
manufacture and testing of everything from nipples to heart valves
to liver cells. In less than 20 years, the tissue engineering field
has grown from a few scientists to more than 2,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, the whole question of worrying about body parts
wearing out will cause no more concern than whether your carburetor
wears out,'' says Dr. Michael Sefton at the University of Toronto.
Last summer, Sefton _ echoing the kind of bold challenge made by
President Kennedy a generation ago that man would walk on the moon
_ set the goal of growing a human heart in the laboratory in 10
years. With the help of scientists around the world, he says, that
goal is achievable.
</P>
<P>
   Such pioneering efforts in tissue engineering are backed by more
than $3 billion in investments _ 90 percent of it private.
Virtually all of the investors are betting heavily that tissue
engineering will result in profound changes in medicine. And
virtually everyone is calling that a pretty safe bet.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some skeptics doubt the industry can, say, produce a
complete off-the-shelf heart in 10 or even 20 years. And many in
medicine discount the idea that doctors will remove a diseased
heart or liver and plop in a new factory-made replacement organ
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But when doctors talked 15 or 20 years ago about putting new
body parts in patients, they talked of synthetics, of metal and
plastic. Now, the talk is of human tissue. And many doctors believe
that pieces of heart or liver may someday be grown and used to
replace diseased portions of those organs.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is general consensus, even among skeptics, that
tissue engineering holds great promise, there is not much agreement
on how best to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until last year that a group to formulate testing and
materials standards for tissue engineering was created. And there
is debate on the best way to stimulate tissue growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, doctors and scientists, such as brothers
Charles and Jay Vacanti and MIT chemical engineering professor
Robert Langer, use biodegradable scaffolds made of artificial
polymers to plant cells, which are then given growth factors to
produce a variety of body parts. Organogenesis, a Canton-based
company, is one of a handful of companies that have received FDA
approval to market human skin made in a lab, using a collagen-based
scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   This week, scientists from around the world, who use a
decellularized kind of pig intestine known as SIS (for
small-intestinal submucosa) will gather in Orlando to discuss SIS
as a scaffold for tissue regeneration in everything from a knee
ligament to abdominal hernia repair to small bowel regeneration.
The FDA this year approved first-stage clinical trials in humans
for regeneration of the knee ligament known as the anterior
cruciate.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Purdue University researchers led by Dr. Stephen F.
Badylak, the paper-thin and maleable SIS is inserted at a wound
site. In lab tests, it seems to stimulate growth of blood vessels
in the area, which not only speeds healing, but also rebuilds the
tissue that was destroyed or removed. Eventually, all that is left
is new tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach, at least for some applications, gets very good
results and the body seems to return to a more fetal wound-healing
when the SIS matrix is used,'' Badylak says. ``We don't understand
all the reasons why this happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more like pigs than we would like to admit and this is
just further proof of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because SIS, at least in animal trials, tends to seed whatever
type of cells it is placed near, its supporters say it offers a
simple, inexpensive way to grow new cells because the manufacture
occurs in the body, not a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Growing new cells may well prove to be a more desirable way to
repair a knee than the technique most often used now, which
involves taking ligament from another part of the body to repair
the damaged area. That results in a second wound and a leg that is
less strong overall than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Growing new knee ligament has none of those disadvantages _ and
the first rounds of testing shows that the results are generally
positive. Dr. Robert Hunter in Aspen, Colo., has put SIS in five
knee patients, the first one last January. Of the five, four are
doing ``very well'' and one operation was a ``complete failure,''
Hunter says. He believes the failure was the result of a mechanical
problem in the installation of the SIS (the ligament is attached
with titanium screws). The FDA, he said, last week concurred and
allowed the trials to resume. Surgeons in Baltimore will soon
perform six such operations.
</P>
<P>
   SIS is also being tested to repair skin wounds and bladder
problems. Badylak is hopeful that SIS will be able to help with
so-called orphan diseases, those so rare that neither research
companies nor medical facilities spend much time studying them
because the demand is so low. ``It could be used for cleft palate
repair, which is a horrific problem, but not the sort of thing a
company will ever get rich over,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Companies do hope to get rich with tissue engineering. In June,
the FDA approved the sale of Organogenesis's Apligraf skin tissue.
Since then, orders have been received by 200 medical centers around
the country, according to Carol Hausner, director of investor and
public relations for Organogenesis. The market for this type of
artificial skin, she notes, includes the 1 million people in the
United States who suffer from leg ulcers each year.
</P>
<P>
   And Reprogenesis, a Cambridge, Mass. company that uses
technology invented by Langer and Jay Vacanti, takes cartilage from
the ear, isolates the cells, combines it with a polymer, and
injects the substance in a patient to narrow the opening of the
bladder near the ureter, to prevent urine backflowing to the
kidneys _ a dangerous condition that affects thousands of children
each year and can require major surgery to correct.
</P>
<P>
   Late-stage clinical trials, says Reprogenesis CEO Daniel
Omstead, have shown a majority of patients to be ``clinically
cured.'' The company is also working on creating tissue-engineered
answers to the problems women face after breast surgery, including
mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lysaght, a Brown University biomedical engineer, found
that the capital value of the companies in the field today is $3.5
billion and growing at a rate of 21 percent a year. He reported his
findings in Tissue Engineering (yes, the field has its own
journal.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, tissue engineering is like a lot of biotech and the
money is in the investment rather than sales. There has not yet
been a really significant revenue-producing product, so it is a
huge act of faith,'' Lysaght said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an awfully good bet. In general, the potential
clearly justifies the investment that people are putting into it.
If you look at the first generation of high-tech medical devices,
pacemakers, heart valves, none of those things existed in 1960.
They now account for something like $200 billion of the $3 trillion
spent on health care around the world. Tissue engineering is the
next generation of those kinds of products. ... It is one thing to
invest in a second- generation pacemaker, but the really gutsy move
is the first-generation pacemaker. And that's where people are
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcements earlier this month that researchers at the
University of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins University had tamed a
human embryonic stem cell, which has the potential to form any of
the 210 kinds of cells in the human body, only further excites
people who believe tissue engineering will do for medicine in the
21st century what drug therapies did for medicine in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the potential to design human tissue to meet the
shortage needs for organs,'' says Dr. Peter C. Johnson, president
of the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative. ``In the meantime,
tissue can be generated in real time _ in the next few years _ to
meet the need for reconstructive surgery, cartilage, tendon, skin
and bone. And the component tissue will take up the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tissues do is, they allow you to provide `smart therapy'
to a diseased state.'' Johnson said. ``At some point in the future,
you will give the drug one time, in this case tissue. If a person's
face is paralyzed, you will put muscle in the face, they will smile
again and won't need drugs. You will put an organ in and they don't
need dialysis. How long in the future we will have to wait is not
known.''

WHY DO KIDS HEAR AND SEE BETTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why do kids see and hear better than adults?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One on one, any adult with good vision can see as well as any
kid with good vision; 20-20 is 20-20, whether you're 10, 20, 40, or
80. But across the population, more adults will need help to see
well, from glasses and contacts to surgery. The reason lies in the
way cells behave in the lens of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   The lens sits behind the iris, which lies behind the
liquid-filled aqueous humor compartment, which is under the cornea,
the outer layer of the eye. By changing shape from rounder to more
oval and back again, the lens helps us focus and adjust for the
distance of what we see. The lens is the size and shape of a
smallish button with a rounded top.
</P>
<P>
   Only cells on the surface of the lens have the ability to
replicate. As new cells grow on the surface, the older cells get
pushed farther back into the middle, which gradually becomes denser
and stiffer. The muscles that pull the lens into a more oval shape
to focus on things farther away can still do their job. But the
less-elastic lens doesn't spring back to the rounder shape it needs
to be in for seeing things closer up.
</P>
<P>
   That creates presbyopia, a common condition in people over 45,
in which the lens can no longer focus accurately on close things
and we need glasses to read.
</P>
<P>
   The aging lens causes another eye problem more typical in
adults. As those older cells are pushed into the middle of the
lens, it goes from clear to opaque, blocking some of the light.
That condition is called a cataract.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing is like vision. Any adult who can hear well, hears as
well as any kid. But more adults have trouble hearing than kids,
because with age hair cells and nerves in the cochlea, the inner
ear, break down and don't regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   The cochlea is a spiral, fluid-filled duct lined with sensitive
hairs. Incoming sound waves create pressure on the fluid and cause
it to move. That makes the hairs wiggle. They're connected to nerve
cells that translate the movement of the hairs into signals that
the brain ultimately translates as sound.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic exposure to high levels of sound can cause these
delicate hairs and nerves to deteriorate. (Short-term exposure
generally results in only short-term hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Aging commonly causes the same breakdown. This kind of hearing
loss in the elderly is called presbycussis. It affects different
people at different ages, depending on the kinds of sounds they've
been exposed to over their lifetimes, their general health, and
their genetic predisposition.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it only affects how well someone can hear ... the
volume. Hearing aids can help restore most of that loss. Sometimes
presbycussis also affects how well someone understands what they
hear ... clarity. Sounds come in garbled instead of clear. Hearing
aids are only just now being developed to deal with that kind of
problem.

<P>
   Rachel Gray picked at her bagel and cream cheese as she sipped a
bottle of Chillers juice in her school cafeteria. Almost every day,
that's what she eats for lunch. Nothing more. Most of the time, she
leaves off the cream cheese.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-5 and 120 pounds, she's slim in her size 3 jeans. Yet,
she says, ``I wish my thighs were a lot smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Her age? Twelve.
</P>
<P>
   Many of her classmates at Brown Middle School in Newton, Mass.
eat just as little, and some even skip lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of girls say they're fat, but they're not at all,'' said
Naomi Rotstein, 12, sipping low-fat chocolate milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``At lunch, look around and you'll see girls who don't eat. They
just drink something,'' said Marie Iagulli, 11.
</P>
<P>
   For those who thought dieting and obsessing about weight and fat
grams was something that begins in high school, guess again. Recent
studies show that diet-ing _ and associated eating disorders _ have
crept into childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary. They're bombarded by this culture of thinness
and their parents are gearing them in that direction,'' said Dr.
Cyndi Koch, director of the Renfrew Center in New Jersey, a women's
health center, where she treats an increasing number of
grade-school girls who have eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said parents call her, sometimes alarmed that their
daughters are gaining weight just before puberty _ something that's
natural and helps girls develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the culture of thinness, people are getting their
kids to eat low-fat,'' Koch said. ``So you see girls, 8 and 9, who
are dissatisfied with their bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Bode, a book author, was curious. She had been hearing
stories of young girls who were dieting but wanted to get a better
idea of how bad the situation was. So she surveyed 100 eighth
graders on Long Island, asking them about their eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Half of them had been on a diet at least once, she found, and 12
percent had forced themselves to vomit, a symptom of bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   Her findings led to her 1997 book, ``Food Fight: A Guide to
Eating Disorders for Pre-Teens and Their Parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bode said she also visited schools across the country. ``I asked
students to try (to write) about what they would change about
themselves,'' Bode said. ``They wrote things like, `I look like
Shamu the whale,' `I hate my body.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking, isn't it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Brewerton, professor of psychiatry and behavioral
sciences and the director of the Eating Disorders Program at
Medical University of South Carolina, said America is just waking
up to this fact because researchers haven't studied younger
populations until recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Brewerton and two colleagues conducted one of the first
studies on eating habits of grade-school children.
</P>
<P>
   They surveyed 3,175 students in grades five to eight and found
that 42 percent wanted to lose weight, 31.4 percent had dieted, 4.8
percent had induced vomiting, and 2.4 percent had taken diet pills.
Three percent had used either laxatives or diuretics to lose
weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no indication that it's getting any better,''
Brewerton said. ``Other studies have looked at young-er kids and
found simliar results. Some studies of preschool children have
indicated they have negative attitudes about overweight people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the same messages that brainwash adults _ advertisements
flaunting the physiques of slender models _ have seeped into the
subconscious of younger girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also see it in their mothers who are pretty preoccupied
with their weight,'' Brewerton said. ``This can't help but affect
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pediatricians are seeing an increase in the number of
children with eating disorders, American children _ like adults _
are becoming heavier. That's because of a lack of exercise and
diets heavy on junk foods that are fatty, high in calories, and not
very nutritious.
</P>
<P>
   For grade-school girls who diet there are obvious health
concerns. If girls don't get enough vitamins, protein, and even fat
in their diet, they may not fully develop. But Brewerton says even
more dangerous are mental health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He said white girls are more likely to report a dissatisfaction
with their bodies than girls who are African-American, Latino, or
Asian, but that doesn't mean girls of color are less likely to
obsess about weight.
</P>
<P>
   Students peer into the cafeteria kitchen at Brown Middle School
in Newton, a randomly chosen school that a reporter visited on a
recent day. Many students, especially the girls, passed up the
lasagna, vegetable, and garlic bread entree. Instead, many reached
for bagels _ the most popular lunch item on the menu, according to
Principal Judith Malone-Neville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls are more label conscious,'' Malone-Neville said. ``They
like salads and ask for yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a family and consumer science class, which is a
modern-day version of health and home economics rolled into one,
includes lessons on nutrition and proper eating habits. All
students take the course by the time they graduate, which she hopes
will keep students away from junk food and incomplete meals.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson girls seem to be getting is that they have to eat
skimpy meals so they can lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For breakfast, I have a banana or a NutriGrain bar,'' says
Rachel Gray, 12. ``For lunch, I'll have a berry bagel, plain, and
an iced tea. I'm a vegetarian. For dinner, I usually have fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Margo Mosher, 13, eats one slice of toast or a half-bagel for
breakfast with water or apple juice. For lunch, she eats a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich and has pasta for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Sherman, 13, eats cereal with skim milk for breakfast.
For lunch, she usually eats nonfat key lime yogurt with a cup of
dry Cheerios, a piece of fruit, juice and ``sometimes an Oreo. ...
I can't eat more than one.'' But, she says, she eats a big dinner:
tacos, pizza, pasta _ whatever her parents make.
</P>
<P>
   While Sherman says she's never dieted, she believes most of her
female classmates are concerned with their weight. ``I'd say 90
percent are very conscious and would, if they could, lose some
weight. But they don't have eating disorders,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Iagulli, 11, agrees: ``They think guys would like them
more if they were skinnier.''
</P>
<P>
   While eating a bagel and cream cheese for lunch, Iagulli said
she takes calcium, iron, and vitamin supplements because she knows
she's not getting enough in her vegetarian diet. Her mother, Sharon
Iagulli, said she spoke to Marie's pediatrician before getting the
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Iagulli said she took a soy cooking class so she could make
dishes for Marie with lots of protein. But Marie didn't care for
soy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her if she gets sick, this is not going to continue,''
Iagulli said. ``She looks and seems pretty healthy. She has plenty
of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, who is a size 1, said, ``I'm pretty happy with how I
look but if I could change something I'd make my stomach smaller.''
But her mother says Sherman wouldn't have said that if the topic
wasn't on weight and dieting.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Sherman, a psychologist, said her daugher isn't body
conscious, just health conscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves key lime yogurt. She would definitely eat it if it
had fat in it,'' Sherman said. ``She's not too thin. I think she's
pretty perfect, but of course she's my daughter.''

NEW VIEW OF ORIGIN OF CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The old view of how cities and civilizations began _ and the
one that's still being taught in many schools _ was simple and
straightforward. Sometime around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago or
earlier, the story went, humans learned to grow crops and
domesticate animals, and almost immediately this led to an
explosion of developments: Cities were built, complex social
organization arose, and advanced civilizations grew and flourished.
</P>
<P>
   It was an appealing and reasonable story. But as a variety of
archeological sites around the world are making increasingly clear,
it's a story that simply doesn't hold up. The emergence of
agriculture, animal domestication, cities, and civilizations are
all intertwined, to be sure, but in ways far more complex and
varied than the old cause-and-effect view.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that in many places, people lived in large
settlements for centuries, or even millenia, before developing the
agricultural base that was thought to have made such settlements
possible. In other places, agriculture developed for millenia
without giving rise to cities or civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so simple,'' said Guillermo Algaze, a professor of
anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, in an
interview last week. ``What has become clear now is that
agriculture and sedentism'' _ meaning settled life in permanent
villages _ ``are no longer so closely related. It used to be
thought that they were two sides of the same coin. Now, especially
in the Near East, it's clear that there was sedentism long before
agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   And, conversely, at some sites _ especially in South and Central
America _ it is becoming clear that at least some kinds of
agriculture were being practiced for thousands of years before
permanent settlements began to appear. Rather than developing
quickly and bringing social and economic changes in its wake, the
domestication of plants and animals was a long, slow process full
of fits and starts and occasional blind alleys. And rather than a
single pattern, it appears to have procee-ded very differently in
different regions, with major variations around the world in the
kinds of plants and animals that were used by early populations.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when the process of taming and controlling nature
had been so fully mastered that there were substantial surpluses of
food that large settlements usually followed, Algaze said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this emerging understanding is to ``separate
agriculture, as the underpinning of civilization, from the early
stages of the domestication of plants,'' said Deborah Pearsall, an
archeologist at the University of Missouri who studies the earliest
evidence of plant domestication in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Most earlier archeologists, she said, assumed that the origins
of agriculture would be found in and around the sites of the
earliest great cities. Not so, it turns out. In most cases,
agriculture had been developing slowly for many centuries and in
many locations before it led to the establishment of such cities.
</P>
<P>
   Domestication of plants and animals is ``an evolutionary
process,'' Pearsall said. ``It's a process, not just an event.''
</P>
<P>
   This changing view, still unfolding as several important sites
are going through more detailed excavations and analysis, was
highlighted in a series of articles in the Nov. 22 issue of the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   This reassessment has come from a combination of factors. New
excavations are underway in regions that have been little studied.
Many significant sites in the Near East, for example, were long
closed to research because of wars and political tensions, such as
the Kurdish regions of Turkey, but they are now accessible and
being studied again. And advances in scientific tools permit a
better analysis of existing sites, including more-precise dating of
small samples, and improved ways to find and identify small remains
of plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, archeologists had a limited amount of information
to work with,'' said Bruce Smith, director of archeobiology at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington.
``Now, there is so much more information, we're getting the
details. It's getting more complex and interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who wrote a book called ``Emergence of Agriculture'' that
has just been published in paperback, said that some of the key
contributions to the new understanding have emerged from research
in Central and South America. Clear evidence is turning up there,
through microscopic analysis of ancient plant remains, that shows
squash, tubers, and beans were being planted and harvested for as
long as 6,000 years before any signs of settlements and large-scale
agriculture show up.
</P>
<P>
   During that long interval, Smith said, ``domesticated plants
filled a relatively small role in their economy,'' which continued
to be based on a largely hunter-gatherer lifestyle. ``So, it's not
exactly a rapid expressway of development leading from
domestication of plants to a full agricultural economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip-side of that coin are some large settlements in Turkey,
such as Catalhoyuk, which dates back about 9,000 years. When first
excavated in the 1950s and 60s by British archeologist James
Mellaart, it was by far the earliest known large settlement, nearly
a third of a mile across and supporting a population of perhaps
10,000 people at its peak. It contained cattle bones as well as
depictions of the animals in murals and sculpture _ evidence, in
the prevailing view at the time, that the site may have been one of
the first places where cattle were domesticated.

FOR YOUNG PRODUCERS, `INCA GOLD' A TREASURE IN THE MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If David Ultan and Adam Ballachey had known two
years ago that their lives would be turned upside down by filming a
documentary about Inca treasure, would they still have done it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Ultan said. ``It was tough, and it cost us
dearly, but it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two-year process of making ``The Search for Inca Gold,''
which aired Sunday on the A&AMP;E network, the 31-year-old producers
endured endless delays, exhaustion, lack of funding leading to
personal debt and even a sudden death within the group. But never
once did they think about quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, how could we have?'' Ballachey said with a laugh. ``This
thing became a force of nature, with a life of its own. We couldn't
have gotten off that bus if we'd wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he said, ``It was a great story. We wanted to see
how it would end.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Inca Gold,'' part of the Peabody Award-winning series
``The New Explorers,'' is nothing if not a ripping yarn. Filmed in
the rugged Ecuadorean Andes, ``Inca Gold'' has history, villainy,
derring-do, genius scientists and charismatic treasure hunters.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minute documentary involves a high-tech goose chase for
archaeological remains and buried treasure, about $3 billion worth
of gold, reportedly hidden from the marauding Spaniards 400 years
ago by the dying Inca nation. Innumerable treasure hunters have
died seeking the treasure in the treacherous Llanganati region of
the Andes. But while their search was always ground-level, this one
was in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Using ground-penetrating radar technology developed by a team at
the Stanford Research Institute headed by Dr. Roger Vickers, the
documentarians flew over the region in a twin-engine plane. After
gathering data, the plan was to return to the Stanford Research
Institute and process the results, looking for irregularities that
would indicate Inca roads or ruins.
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to say that the results yielded both good and bad
news. The Llanganati _ the area presumed to be the resting place
for the tons of gold _ proved too rugged a terrain for the radar to
take proper readings. But a nearby site, flatter and more open,
which was surveyed to test the equipment, showed conclusive
evidence of Inca ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers, 60, points to a computer screen at the Stanford
Research Institute. ``You see remnants here of a road, a wall,
possibly a farmhouse. And these other dots, they're probably
farmhouses.'' He grinned broadly. ``So at least we know the
technology works.''
</P>
<P>
   Better news still, which was unreported in ``Inca Gold,'' is
that Dr. John Rick, the Stanford archaeologist who plays a major
role in the documentary, has made a discovery of his own using
similar technology in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say too much about it,'' he said, noting that if he
gave the location, treasure hunters would be swarming the area.
``But it's an already-explored area of ruins that predate the Inca
by perhaps two or three thousand years. We have found something
inside the ruins using radar that is a 3-meter by 3-meter cube.
Possibly an undiscovered tomb, which could give us important
information about who these people were.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe treasure? Rick smiled indulgently. After all, he is a
scientist, not a gold-crazy explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, perhaps knowing they were there for the ``right''
reasons, was undaunted by the legend of an Inca curse surrounding
the treasure, despite gruesome true stories that abounded of
veteran explorers who would become disoriented and plunge to their
deaths off cliffs, become impaled on sharp branches, kill
themselves when the disappointment proved too much.
</P>
<P>
   And although Ultan is shown in the film nearly taking a header
over a cliff during the grueling ground exploration of the area,
everyone survived the filming process. All but one.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Arias, perhaps the most famous treasure hunter in Ecuador,
who had been into the Llanganati some 70 times, died suddenly in a
freak car accident between the two filming trips. In perhaps the
film's most poignant moment, Arias is heard muttering to himself as
he peers through his binoculars: ``I love these mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a moment when I wasn't sure I could go on, it was
when we lost Diego,'' Ultan said. ``He was an amazing guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballachey already has three new proposals in the chute for ``The
New Explorers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``David and I are emblematic of the new opportunities out there
for documentary filmmaking,'' he said, noting the breakthrough
success of nonfiction series like ``The Civil War'' and programs
like A&AMP;E's popular ``Biography.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to keep working, more independently all the
time. And someday, maybe documentaries will be funded the way
Hollywood features are. They bring so much more to people's
lives.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For a presidential hopeful from Massachusetts, neighboring New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary is seductive indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Granite State has shown a decided preference for Bay Staters
_ and the national media has treated the results not as a
predictable back-yard benediction, but as a legitimate national
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's win in New
Hampshire's presidential primary catapulted him on his way to the
Democratic nomination. In 1992, former US senator Paul Tsongas's
laurels there transformed him from an underfinanced long shot to
Bill Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic nomination. No wonder
US Senator John F. Kerry _ who last week sent out fresh signals
that he'll seek the Democratic presidential nomination _ thinks he
may see gold when he looks toward the White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the glint could just as easily be fool's gold _ which
is why Kerry must stake a claim in Iowa if he hopes to strike it
rich in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And he must realize that, New Hampshire toehold notwithstanding,
1998 promises to be a very different year from either 1988 or 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, there was no heir apparent for the Democratic
nomination. Thus the Democratic primary resembled a sorting process
among newcomers, where any of a number of lesser-known candidates
had a credible shot at winning. In such an environment, being known
in New Hampshire was valuable indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, Vice President Al Gore will be running as the that
heir, campaigning with the power of two-time incumbency. A race
that involves such a candidate, particularly an incumbent, usually
has room for only two serious candidates: The front-runner whoever
emerges as his principal challenger.
</P>
<P>
   That means the first fight Kerry faces is not so much with Gore
as with the rest of the field so as to emerge as the challenger
best able to take on Gore. And that, in turn, suggests the Iowa
caucuses, the first real contest in the nominating process, will be
particularly important this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Remember 1984? It was US Senator Gary Hart's distant second
there against former Vice President Walter Mondale (16 percent to
Mondale's 48 percent) that separated the Coloradan from the rest of
the field. Even that showing was good enough to establish Hart _
not, as many had expected, Ohio Senator John Glenn _ as the most
credible alternative to Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   Positioned that way, Hart rode a riptide effect to victory in
New Hampshire and across New England and then into the South before
Mondale finally battled back.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa played a less dramatic role in 1988, but only because the
dynamic was different. With no established front-runner, the
caucuses were viewed as much more a first cut, culling a field of
little-knowns _ ``the seven dwarfs,'' the Democrats were derisively
called _ than as a contest that selected the chief challenger to
another two-time incumbent vice president, George Bush, who also
was a heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Still, veterans of Dukakis's campaign say that had he not
managed to stay viable with a third-place finish in Iowa
(collecting 21 percent of the caucus vote to 27 percent for Dick
Gephardt, the congressman from Missouri, and 24 percent for Paul
Simon, the Illinois senator), his support in New Hampshire likely
would have eroded.
</P>
<P>
   The early presidential primaries are essentially a process of
serial elimination. Jack Corrigan, Dukakis's deputy campaign
manager, compares it to the old joke about the two campers charged
by a bear.
</P>
<P>
   When one frantically ties his shoes, scrambles to his feet, and
dashes off, the second yells: ``It's no use. You can't outrun that
bear.'' ``I don't have to outrun the bear,'' the first replies. ``I
just have to outrun you.''
</P>
<P>
   That, says Corrigan, is the reality of the early going: ``If the
bear eats you in Iowa, there is nothing left for New Hampshire. You
have to maintain your viability coming out of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Gephardt emerged as Dukakis's early rival, despite a
neo-protectionist message that had little to offer booming New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly US Senator Edward M. Kennedy could tell Kerry that
popularity in New Hampshire can neither make nor save a
presidential candidacy. In September 1979, Kennedy led President
Carter by an astounding 48 points, 68 percent to 20 in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the Iranian hostage crisis created a
patriotic push that rallied Americans to the theretofore
beleaguered Carter's cause. With Kennedy slipping nationally, New
Hampshire voters declined to rescue him; Kennedy fell to Carter 47
percent to 37, completing his transformation from formidable foe to
injured challenger.
</P>
<P>
   After the campaign, Kennedy acknowledged the Iowa results had
probably doomed his campaign from the start. ``Iowa was probably
the most significant one,'' he said. ``After that, our chances for
success were remote.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Iowa didn't matter because home-state US Senator Tom
Harkin was a candidate, rendering the caucuses there meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   But without Harkin, it's hard to imagine that Tsongas, for all
his grit and determination, would have done as well as he did. His
underfinanced campaign had little traction outside of New England.
And though he had held a solid lead in New Hampshire the previous
fall, when New Hampshire voters started to focus on the choice they
faced, Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, pulled even and then
passed Tsongas in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late January, came the allegations that Clinton had
carried on a long-time liaison with Gennifer Flowers, followed
shortly thereafter by the controversy over his efforts to avoid the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Those controveries sent Clinton tumbling in the polls. Scared
off their first choice, New Hampshire voters retreated back to the
well-known and reassuringly mature Tsongas, who won a 33 to 25
percent victory over Clinton in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, had Clinton never faced the Flowers controversy, it's
hard to avoid the conclusion he would have beaten Tsongas in New
Hampshire and ended his before it ever left New England.
</P>
<P>
   So as Kerry ponders his future _ he says he will announce his
decision ``by the turn of the year'' _ what lesson should he take
from history?
</P>
<P>
   First, popularity in New Hampshire alone is unlikely to be
enough to launch a campaign. If a Massachusetts candidate wants to
pitch his presidential tent there, he'd best guy it off with a
solid showing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a fellow New Englander's New Hampshire advantage is
hardly immune to national trends sweeping the country.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, best to keep the sneakers tied in Iowa: When the
bear charges, a candidate must outrun his rivals if he's to stay
alive in New Hampshire.

 UNDATED: ... were domesticated.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But now, using methods developed since the first excavations, a
large team has been back at the site for three years _ and expects
to be there at least another 25 years. Led by British archeologist
Ian Hodder, now at the University of California, Berkeley, team
members are making a much slower, more methodical analysis of the
site than would have been possible before. Where Mellaart and his
team excavated more than 200 houses in four years, Hodder's team of
90 specialists are unearthing just one or two a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mellaart acknowledged the difference in the approach in an
interview last week. ``In those days, we got the experts to come at
the end of the season'' to spend a few days looking over bones,
seeds, and other significant pieces found during a season of
digging. The idea of having botanists, anatomists, and other
specialists right on the site throughout the digging was out of the
question, at a time when there were only a handful of specialists
in the world in identifying such remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, they do things with such precision,'' he said. But
one result of that painstaking methodology is that it may take a
very long time to build up enough evidence to make a convincing
case about exactly how these early dwellers in a large settlement
lived.
</P>
<P>
   But the preliminary evidence suggests that Catalhoyuk, far from
being a textbook example of the domestication of animals leading to
large settlements, may be quite the opposite. New analysis suggests
that most of the animal bones were from sheep and goats, not
cattle, and that the animals may have been wild, rather than
domesticated. &UR;  &LR; And microscopic examination of human teeth from the
site shows no sign that they were yet eating grains, at least not
in significant amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the early days, as for as making any good
conclusions,'' says Nerissa Russell, an archeologist at Cornell
University taking part in the Catalhoyuk dig who specializes in
interpreting animal bones. ``The cattle could be wild or
domestic,'' but there is no sign of the usual reduction in size
that occurs when a species is domesticated.
</P>
<P>
   This characteristic reduction in size _ perhaps a result of
human selection because smaller animals were easier to control, or
perhaps an unintended result of limited diet and mobility _ has
been used as one of the few ways of distinguishing wild from
domesticated animals in old sites. Recently, an additional method
has come into use: Looking at the ratios of old and young animals,
and males to females. Hunters tend to take full-grown animals,
while herders tend to kill most young males and keep a majority of
females for breeding, the theory goes, leading to differences in
the animal populations that can be determined statistically by
studying large numbers of bones.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that may eventually help to clear up the questions in
Catalhoyuk is the extensive artwork. Many houses had elaborate
murals painted on the mud-brick walls, most of them depicting
humans and animals together. Interpreting these scenes may help to
unravel the practices of that early society _ but that may not be
easy. Most of the paintings excavated in the 1960s have crumbled or
been lost, and can be studied only from photographs or drawings,
and no substantial murals have yet been found in the new round of
digging.
</P>
<P>
   The old murals remain hard to figure out. Humans cavort around
large animals, in some cases actually pulling their tails or
tongues. No obvious weapons are seen. ``Are they hunting scenes,
sacrifice scenes, or scenes from dreams or myths?'' Russell
wonders. ``It's hard to know exactly what's going on.... We hope to
have answers in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Other, even earlier large settlements _ though not nearly as
large as Catalhoyuk _ provide clearer evidence, she said. At a
Turkish site called Asaclahoyuk, ``it looks like things are
basically wild,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   These and several other big sites in the Near East and China,
says Hodder, ``appear without any trace of agriculture. You have
large numbers of houses, buildings, temples, all in a society which
is still using wild resources in terms of animals and plants.''
</P>
<P>
   In places like Catalhoyuk and Abu Hureyra, also in Turkey,
Hodder says &UR; , &LR;  ``Agriculture really comes in fairly late in the
process, 1,000 or 2,000 years later, depending on where you are.
There are a whole series of cultural changes that take place before
you get farming.''
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the recent research, Hodder said, is that
``this is causing a reconsideration of what we call agriculture and
domestication.'' It is becoming clear that these are not practices
that emerge quickly and simply, but that there is usually a long
transitional period where humans exert more and more control over
their plant and animal resources _ and become more dependent on a
few species.
</P>
<P>
   Research in the Near East, as well as in China and Central
America, could provide significant evidence over the next few years
about this intermediate stage _ a stage that Richard MacNeish, an
archeologist based in Andover who pioneered much of the study of
early plant use, dubbed ``incipient agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that ``people have tended to focus on evidence for
domestication, and for agricultural economies, and not much on
what's in between.'' But continuing research around the world is
likely to come up with more details about this critical stage of
development _ and its many variations around the world.

UNISEX JOHNS WON'T WASH WITH WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The New York Times reports that a metal distribution company in
Bristol, Conn., is installing a unisex ``Ally McBeal'' style
bathroom in its new facility. Craig Yarde, president of Yarde
Metals, told the Times, ``It started off as a little bit of a joke,
but we think it sends a message that we're all in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   All in what together? What is he talking about?
</P>
<P>
   OK, we may all be in this together in the larger, cosmic,
universal, lashed-to-the-great-wheel-of-being sense. But does that
mean we all have to go into the same company bathroom and do it
together? Is this what sexual equality in the workplace has come
down to?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if men are thrilled about the concept of unisex
company bathrooms, although I doubt many are. But I do know that
virtually any woman you ask will tell you that it's difficult
enough to share a bathroom with friends and loved ones of the
opposite sex. And now to share with male co-workers? Some of whom
you don't even know?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you might get to know them in a hurry, and better
than you might like, if they were occupying stalls next to yours.
Maybe the water closet will replace the water cooler as the hub of
office gossip, as it seems to have in Ally McBeal's law firm, where
people of both sexes gather to exchange maddeningly fey dialogue.
Does anybody ever actually, you know, go in those scenes? Or do
they just meet there to chat?
</P>
<P>
   Before we go any further, let's pause for a moment to let the
following sink in, once and for all, because I'm getting tired of
repeating myself: ``Ally McBeal'' is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   One of the classic indications of sanity _ as I understand it,
at least _ is the ability to differentiate between reality and
fantasy. Does Craig Yarde honestly think his real live employees
are going to take to his unisex bathroom the way Ally and her
fictional colleagues have taken to theirs?
</P>
<P>
   The Times suggests McBealish bathrooms may be a trend. They
managed to dig up an expert, industrial psychologist Andrew DuBrin,
who claims that unisex facilities are ``increasingly popular among
workers.'' Which workers? Where? If anybody knows, please get in
touch. Meanwhile, pardon me if I refuse to believe these people
exist.
</P>
<P>
   DuBrin also told the Times there was ``one possible benefit'' to
the unisex facilities: ``Bathroom hand-washing among men has
declined quite a bit in recent decades. Maybe this would get them
to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, working women don't have enough to do already. Besides,
when it comes to bathroom hand-washing, women are almost as bad as
men. According to a survey of 7,000 Americans, conducted last year
for the American Society of Microbiology, 98 percent of those
interviewed said they always washed their hands after they went to
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they said. This is what they did: Researchers
stationed in public restrooms found that only 68 percent actually
wash up afterward. They observed that women are more likely to wash
than men _ 74 percent compared to 61 percent _ but I think it's
fair to say that neither sex has any reason to feel smug about
these figures.
</P>
<P>
   Your mother was right. All sorts of diseases are spread by
people who don't wash their hands after they use the bathroom. It's
not just disgusting, it's unhealthy. If men are more lax about it
than women, well, that's a good reason to resist the unisex
bathroom trend, if there is such a trend, which I doubt, Yarde and
DuBrin not-with-standing.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many other reasons to can the idea, so to speak,
not the least of which is that bathroom gossip would never be the
same. We might all end up sounding as ditsy as the characters on
``Ally McBeal.''

DERSHOWITZ FINDS STARR HARD TO DEFEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT L. TURNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SEXUAL McCARTHYISM 
Clinton, Starr, and the Emerging Constitutional Crisis 
By Alan M. Dershowitz 
Basic Books, 275 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even a novelist would find it hard to conjure up a character
better equipped to sail past the dangers of the Lewinsky affair
than Bill Clinton. His legal background is considerable _ Yale Law
School, attorney general of Arkansas _ and his political deftness
is unmatched. Yet the nexus of politics and the law is what snared
him and spun the nation into a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Few probably are surprised that Clinton lacked the moral sense
to avoid a squalid affair with Monica Lewinsky. But it is shocking
that he lacked the political sense to sidestep danger when a
partisan special prosecutor was already out gunning for him, and
that he also lacked the legal sense to stay away from a sworn
deposition and grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   This historic lapse gains occasional perspective from ``Sexual
McCarthyism,'' by Alan M. Dershowitz, the local sage who has proved
himself unavoidable for comment on all things legal and
sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz is hard on Clinton, not so much for his infidelity as
for his bad judgment in hitching up with a ``young blabbermouth.''
The Harvard law professor also faults him for a series of legal
blunders that not only threatens his presidency but has created
precedents that will hurt his successors. The affair, however
smutty, never should have produced the damage it did, Dershowitz
argues persuasively.
</P>
<P>
   As the title would suggest, however, Dershowitz is most critical
of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. He says Starr is also
obsessed with forbidden sex and has abused his office far more than
Clinton did.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does a short book like this require the reader to
dispense with so much dross to find so few nuggets. One reason has
to do with time pressure: The book is current through September,
and even contains one short chapter, dated October, speculating
about a possible deal to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the price is heavy. Collected between these hard covers is
nothing more than an assortment of columns and opinion pieces that
are poorly connected, repetitive (four different articles say the
president should not be above or below the law), and often
embarrassingly self-serving _ why, exactly, do we need to hear
Der-sho-witz's contention that he do-nates half his professional
time to pro bono work? A 36-page overview plows much of the same
ground. The writing is festooned with cliches, and some of the
arguments run in contrary directions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Dershowitz argues that some form of independent
counsel is necessary in our system, but the appointing authority
should not be the judges who now have that role. Sitting judges, he
says, ``should not be in the business of appointing independent
counsel.'' Elsewhere, however, he makes a more dubious argument for
a permanent Independent Office of Public Prosecution within the
Justice Department, headed by someone ``selected on a nonpartisan
basis by a panel of judges or others outside the political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   All that said, the book makes some interesting points, several
of which are articulated with refreshing precision and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Already well-publicized is Dershowitz's contention that Clinton
should have tried harder to settle the Paula Jones case and,
lacking an agreement, should have simply defaulted rather than
submit to a deposition. Even if this strategy were given the
consideration in January that Dershowitz says it was denied, it
might not have seemed so attractive then. Only in hindsight does it
seem obvious that the political and financial costs to Clinton
would have been far less if he had defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate interest, Dershowitz offers sharp views on key
issues. If Starr had no intention of seeking criminal indictments
against the president, Dershowitz says, he should not have been
able to use a grand jury as an investigative tool.

COSTLY CATALOG ITEMS: SHIPPING &AMP; HANDLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding; includes shipping and handling text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever been skeptical about catalog merchants saying
their pricey ``shipping and handling'' charges barely cover costs,
you might be interested in a new survey on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study in the upcoming Catalog Age, a trade
publication for the mail-order industry, 48 percent of catalog
businesses this year admitted they made a profit from shipping and
handling charges, up from 44 percent the year before. About 41
percent said they broke even, and 11 percent said they lost money.
</P>
<P>
   These findings come as no surprise to many shoppers who say
they're drawn to the time-saving advantages of catalog shopping,
especially during the hectic holiday season, but can't bear the
delivery fees. On a typical $60 order, mail-order companies charge
anywhere from $5.50 to $16.95 for shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees bother me,'' said Mary Johnson, a mother browsing
last week at the Cambridgeside Galleria, which was already heavily
adorned with holiday lights and decorations. ``You're throwing
money away.''
</P>
<P>
   While consumers may be outraged by the fees, the catalog
industry may feel little pressure to change as more Americans get
hooked on the convenience. Catalog sales are projected to total
more than $87 billion this year, a 7.7 percent increase over last
year, according to the Direct Marketing Association in New York, a
mail-order trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The group also reported that more than two-thirds of Americans
last year made a purchase by mail, phone, or computer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some companies are responding to customer complaints.
Victoria's Secret, an intimate-apparel shop for women, offers free
shipping for orders over $100 until the end of the year. If you
order from certain L.L. Bean catalogs, you can get free regular
FedEx delivery until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Catalog consultant Jack Schmid of Kansas City, Kan., said the
industry is beginning to wake up to the consumer outcry. He said he
has found more companies experimenting with early-bird promotions,
flat-rate fees, or loyalty programs that give breaks on shipping
and handling charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are showing more sensitivity to customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with some discounts, anyone who wants the convenience of
catalog shopping faces hefty shipping and handling fees, usually
based on the total bill, and a sales tax that may have to be paid
to the state where the item is being sent.
</P>
<P>
   A federal rule requires that companies shipping items out of
state must impose that state's sales tax if they have a store or
other business presence there. Therefore, Massachusetts residents
sending clothing as a gift may lose this state's tax exemption on
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't catalog companies base the shipping fee on weight, as
the post office does?
</P>
<P>
   While some do, the growing trend is to assess fees based on the
total bill. Bettye Kahn, spokeswoman for Crate &AMP; Barrel, based in
Wheeling, Ill., said it gets too complicated for businesses to
assess each shipping order based on weight.
</P>
<P>
   At Crate &AMP; Barrel, the shipping and handling fees range from $5
for a $15 order (a 33 percent fee) to $15 for a $150 order (10
percent fee). A more typical $60 order would incur a $10.50
shipping and handling fee _ 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a few people that we treat unfairly so we can
treat thousands of people fairly,'' she said. ``Hopefully, it evens
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn points out that stores such as Crate &AMP; Barrel that sell
many fragile dishware items are also providing the service of
packaging the items safely for delivery. The thick boxes, tissue
paper, and other packaging materials are costly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The highest delivery fees appear to be from the food companies.
At Harry and David, the specialty food catalog business, a $60
order costs $16.95 to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   But even some firms sending nonfragile items have high fees. At
Hingham-based Talbots, a women's clothing store, delivery charges
are similar to Crate &AMP; Barrel. A typical $60 order would cost $10
in shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Thompson, spokeswoman for Talbots, said she believes they
are in the ``middle ground'' of their competitors and that they
also offer such perks as free gift boxes when they deliver.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in catalog shopping, the best way to reduce
costs is to buy in bulk so that shipping and handling fees are a
lower percentage of the total bill.
</P>
<P>
   Even with price breaks, Kathleen Seiders, marketing professor at
Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., said the catalog industry will
probably flourish because so many people hate shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``People this time of year are looking for ways to not have to
deal with the store or deal with the post office,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

   _ &UR; Playpen danger.  &LR; This warning came out in the middle of last
week, but we thought it worth mentioning again that the US Consumer
Product Safety Commission has recalled 9.6 million play yards and
playpens with protruding rivets because they can strangle children.
The commission knows of eight cases of toddlers strangling in these
products when their pacifier strings or clothing caught on rivets.
For more information, call the CPSC hotline at 800-638-2772.

 &QL; 
MAIL-ORDER CONVENIENCE HAS A PRICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Factors you may want to consider if you are deciding whether to
be a catalog shopper or a do-it-yourself shopper. In the example
below, a Boston resident picks a $68 fleece jacket from Talbots and
wants the gift shipped to someone in Chicago. The item weighs about
1.5 pounds. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CATALOG SELF  &QL; 
Item $68 $68  &QL; 
Shipping &AMP; handling charge(1)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   $10 $3  &QL; 
Tax $4.25(2) $0  &QL; 
Total $82.25 $71.00  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Difference  &QL; 
By catalog, the shopper pays $11.25 or 16 percent more than
do-it-yourself shopping and mailing.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Other issues  &QL; 
You can shop from home at any hour, and you're spared a trip to the
mall and post office.  &QL; 
You can handle the item you select, which may reduce the chances
that you'll have to go through the trouble of returning an item.  &QL; 
(1) Talbots uses the US Postal Service for its regular shipping
services, but sets fees based on the customer's total bill. We had
our do-it-yourself shopper also mail by US Postal Service, where
fees were based on the item's weight. &QL; 
(2) Based on a federal ruling, the company must impose sales tax if
it is shipping a package to a state where it has a store or other
business presence. The customer pays the sales tax rate of the
state where the package is being sent. &QL;

MAZDA CELEBRATES ON PEARL HARBOR DAY: YULE GIFT IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Auto companies do strange things to promote the corporate image,
brand awareness, or a car. Mazda has, it seems to me, gone the
corporate equivalent of bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   I have been receiving a series of fancy, four-color invitations
that open with the question: ``Pondering your news options for
December 7th?'' Below that, next to a rendering of Rodin's famous
sculpture, The Thinker, is the admonition: ``It's time to think ...
'' and inside it continues: ``out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we get to the heart of it. It informs that more than 3,000
``creative, intelligent, dare-to-be different personalities'' vied
for the title of ``Out-Of-The-Box Individual'' and the list has
been pared to ``five'' finalists: Marisa Tomei, actress; Jane
Krakowski, actress; Dennis Rodman, hoopster; Judge Mills Lane,
boxing referee; Eric Fogel, creator of MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch
(I'm not making this up); Mother Love, TV talk show host who
specializes in prompting embarrassing confessions. You have noticed
that six people are listed? Anybody who would hold Rodman up as an
intelligent, creative candidate for public honors couldn't be
expected to be good with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One of these will be named to receive the Mazda Protege
Out-Of-The-Box Award. Protege is the car they're promoting.
</P>
<P>
   Come join them for this ``break-from-the-herd media event'' Dec.
7 in New York, Mazda implores.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside the tastelessness of asking an American journalist
to celebrate Dec. 7 with a Japanese company (I know the war's long
over but would Ford invite Japanese to celebrate Aug. 6, the
anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing?), why would any journalist
consider that choosing the head idiot from among this gang is a
news event. OK, I'll give the actresses the benefit of the doubt;
acting is an honorable calling and if they do anything strange
offstage, I don't know about it nor do I care, either.
</P>
<P>
   I know the Protege _ it's a nice car scheduled for review here _
and everybody knows Bad Boy Rodman, but why would a corporation
concerned for its image be throwing a party to honor a jerk like
that?
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing is there will be some journalists in New York on
Monday, Dec. 7, with not much else to do, and there is the usual
long list of professional guests pretending to credentials who will
go to the opening of an envelope if free food is involved, who can
be counted upon to fill the hall. Auto companies desperately in
search of good words for bad cars depend on these people and public
relations firms seem to bill according to the head count at the
event. Since Mazda isn't making bad cars, why this desperate bid
for notoriety?
</P>
<P>
   Mazda, this gets my vote for Most Tasteless Event of Decade.
Mazda should can the PR genius who dreamed this up; PR agents are
supposed to get a company talked about, not laughed at. And just
how does this sell Proteges?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christman looms, so, in the spirit of the season, we offer our
annual shopping suggestions for the difficult person on your list
who owns a car. Buy for the car or buy car-related.
</P>
<P>
   A decent flashlight, especially one that plugs into a cigar
lighter or auxiliary socket, can make a welcome gift. Totes, the
umbrella maker, offers an interesting two-fer this year, a brolly
with a flashlight in the handle, about $20. The light is slightly
offset so that it illuminates the ground ahead of you while using
the bumbershoot on a rainy night, but it doubles as a handy light,
if you leave the umbrella in the car _ it's a compact that will fit
quite nicely in most door bins. One drawback: You need a small
phillips-head screwdriver to replace the two AA batteries in the
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Maps are always welcome. Delorme offers road atlases for Maine,
Vermont, New Hamphire and a few other states. There are also good
volumes of city/town street maps for eastern and western sections
of Massachusetts and all of New Hampshire's various municipalities
_ all this stuff is available in bookstores for reasonable money.
For the heavy-duty traveler, check the map supplies at interstate
truck stops where you can find a complete United States road atlas
with all the pages laminated in plastic for 20 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Books are always a good thought and the world abounds with
specialty books based on certain cars, books about the business
(such as ``Glory Days,'' reviewed here last week, from Robert
Bentley Publisher, 800-423-4595). For less reading and more photos,
something like ``Sixties American Cars,'' written and photographed
by journalist Dan Lyons, published by Motorbooks (800-826-6600,
$12.95). Lavishly illustrated, Lyons's tome captures the spirit and
iron of the decade that was the heyday of the muscle car.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is also noted for his car calendar photography on
BrownTrout calendar editions and some of Hemmings Motor News
offerings. Brown Trout lists a slew of motor calendars showcasing
Mustangs, Camaros, Porsche, Corvette, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ford,
Jaguar, and convertibles and exotics ($10.99 each, telephone
800-777-7812). Hemmings offers its '99 edition of the classic
old-cars-abandoned series that it initiated showing derelicts in
various scenic locales. In addition, Hemmings offers calendars
dedicated to antique pickup trucks, cars of the '50s and muscle
cars ($9.95 each, telephone 800-227-4373, ext. 550.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings also offers various automobilia and is becoming well
known for its series of collector truck banks _ for a catalogue,
should this intrigue you, telephone 800-442-3100.
</P>
<P>
   Auto retailers have hopped on the automobilia bandwagon and
these days many showrooms offer a boutique of marque-related stuff
from pricey pewter sculptures and key chains to models of the
individual cars.
</P>
<P>
   A decent tire pressure gauge _ some electronic models are
currently available _ is a handy stocking stuffer and, if you're
really stumped, a book of tickets to a car wash is a very good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a few hundred in spare cash, you might also
consider the young driver in your family for a gift of training in
an advanced driving school _ Skip Barber in Lakeville, Conn.
(telephone 860-435-1300) or Sandy Stevens in New Hampshire
(800-594-4193) are the closest to the Boston area. Hey, a gift of
advanced driver training could be a gift of life as well as the
gift of a lifetime.

TWO-STEPPING WITH FOUR PAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've done it before, admit it. We've all done it. But we had
the decency to do it in the privacy of our own homes. However, in
today's permissive society, in which anything goes, people are
doing it right out in public.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing with dogs, that is.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest competitive ``sport'' that's sweeping the
country, or maybe just whisk-brooming the country..
</P>
<P>
   It's not the kind of dog dancing most of us remember from
childhood, when you would pick up your dog's front paws and in a
moment of exuberance, dance around the living room until the dog
gnawed at your hands or your mother yelled, ``Leave the poor dog
alone!''
</P>
<P>
   In ``musical canine freestyle,'' owners and dogs perform
``dance-oriented footwork in time to the music.'' And the rules
specify that you can't do anything to endanger the dog, so ixnay on
grabbing those front paws. Basically, you dance to the music and
the dog sticks close. Each routine is supposed to tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   Patie Ventre is the national guru of the freestyle competition.
She is the force behind creating the World Canine Freestyle
Organization, which is so newly minted that it doesn't have
membership dues set or even a membership list yet. But there is a
mailing list of 8,000 people worldwide. There are freestylers in
Australia, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, and in African countries.
Ventre and her group's doggie Rockettes have recently been featured
on NBC and CNN (the reporter from the latter network compared the
virile energy of a golden retriever named Lookie to that of John
Travolta).
</P>
<P>
   If you want to trip the paw fantastic, to merengue with your
mutt, polka with your puli, or cha-cha with your chow chow, the
group says don't be intimidated. ``Being a dancer is not
necessary,'' the Pup-Peroni freestyle brochure reassures, though
``some sense of rhythm is helpful.'' Your dog should be
``accomplished in heeling.'' Ventre estimates that it should take
about three to six months to work up a routine. Part of the process
is finding out ``which music your dog responds to best.'' Foxtrot,
perhaps? That's easy for some of us _ it's the sound of kibble
hitting the dish, but it just doesn't have a beat.
</P>
<P>
   As for musical ideas, Ventre says that at the recent ``Nature's
Recipe Footloose Fantasy Freestyle Event'' in Houston, the waltz
``God Bless Texas,'' performed by a Chihuahua mix, brought tears to
the eyes of the crowd. (An encore of ``The Yellow Rose of Texas''
might have put the audience on stretchers.) Donna Duford and her
fuzzy little petit basset griffon vendeen will be doing Judy
Garland (not to mention Toto) proud with ``Get Happy'' at Bayside.
</P>
<P>
   But besides a catchy tune, you need a snappy outfit. Performers
``must costume up,'' according to Ventre. Unfortunately, that other
great tradition, making your long-suffering dog wear clothes, is
not allowed, though the dog's collar must match the handler's
attire.
</P>
<P>
   Do certain breeds dominate the field? Of course a Border collie,
the thinking dog's athlete, will often do well, but Ventre says
there are many mixed breeds and surprising entries, such as
bloodhounds and Newfoundlands.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is divided into three levels: novice,
intermediate, and advanced. There are competitions for one person,
one dog; two handlers, two dogs; and team, three or more handlers,
each with a dog. Judging, Ventre points out, is like the Olympics,
with scores from 1.0 to 10 on technical merit and artistic
impression.
</P>
<P>
   Freestyle has been around since the early '90s and Ventre says
she has been overwhelmed with the amount of media attention the
``sport'' has received. Now if only Kevin Costner had changed his
film's title to ``Dances With Pugs.''

   AIDSVAX _ ATLANTA _ Dan Flinchum doesn't much like needles, but
he is about to become the first volunteer in Atlanta to be
inoculated with AIDSVAX, the first vaccine for the AIDS virus to be
widely tested in the United States. He watches calmly as nurse Gail
Kropf prepares a syringe from an innocuous vial the size of her
thumb. He rolls up his left sleeve. This is not the end of AIDS,
not even close. The vaccine may not work. Even if it does, it will
take years of further testing and tweaking before it is approved
for widespread use. Flinchum knows this, and Kropf knows this, and
they try not to attach too much significance to the tiny vial
marked VAX004. (Kim , Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTO.

<P>
   AIDSVAX-TESTS _ Perhaps Dr. Edward Jenner swallowed hard when he
steadied the syringe containing the deadly virus smallpox, just
before he injected the contents into 8-year-old James Phipps.
Jenner must have been acutely aware that he was deliberately
imperiling the boy's life. The date was July 1, 1796, and Jenner
was performing a daring experiment that, if reproduced today, would
shock and outrage our 1990s sensibilities. Jenner was lucky. HIV
vaccine researchers know they will need luck, too, if they are to

!! 1/2 ``Babe: Pig in the City''  There's more city than story in
this sequel, as the talking pig, on a mission to save the farm,
journeys to an American city as it might be reproduced in a Vegas
theme park. What he saves are a bunch of dogs and primates facing
cruel and menacing dangers that might be too dark for younger
viewers' comfort levels. (G)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (FR) &LR; !!! &UR; 1/2 ``A Bug's Life'' &LR;  The ``Toy Story'' creators move
outside, into a luminously green natural world, beautifully
detailed. Their story of a misfit ant who redeems himself by saving
the colony from rapacious grasshoppers doesn't have the wit of the
similarly themed ``Antz,'' but exceeds it in all other respects.
(G)
</P>
<P>
   !!! &UR; ``Destiny''  &LR; Egypt's Youssef Chahine bends Hollywood's
old-fashioned way of filming historical epics to the service of a
biofilm about the 12th-century Islamic philosopher Averroes, whose
books were burned, but whose teachings survive. It's heartfelt and
enlightening on the achievements of Islamic civilization and on its
history of being menaced by fundamentalists, with a solid centering
performance by Nour el-Cherif as the wise, humane teacher. But it's
also tongue-in-cheek enough to throw in a little song and dance
when needed. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   ! &UR; 1/2 ``Very Bad Things''  &LR; Actor Peter Berg's filmmaking debut
isn't a very bad movie, just a relentlessly tiring one about a
bachelor party that goes murderously wrong. The one bright spot is
Cameron Diaz's maniacal bride-to-be, who is determined to let
nothing interfere with her wedding. (R) (Renee Graham)

IN HUNT FOR RANDOLPH, G-MEN FIND SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ The hunt begins with breakfast at the Huddle
House, an island of biscuits and gravy in the predawn darkness.
</P>
<P>
   At tables just feet apart, two separate groups of men talk about
the weather, the news, everything but their prey. They speak only
to one another, never to the men across the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   As light breaks over the maddeningly dense forest that surrounds
and beckons them, they move quickly to pay their separate bills,
then exit to their separate cars, and that is when the first of
many deep-rooted differences reveals itself.
</P>
<P>
   One group piles into a pickup truck carrying caged hounds, the
signature vehicle for country-bred bear hunters. The other group
slides into a gray Crown Victoria, the signature car for city-bred
G-men on a manhunt. They leave in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   As that scene played out last week, 293 days had passed since
the start of authorities' search for Eric Robert Rudolph, the man
accused in fatal bombings at a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic
and at the Atlanta Olympics. The day began and ended like every
other since Rudolph disappeared in the woods near this western
North Carolina town on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in between revealed in a hundred small ways why
the shotgun marriage between federal agencies and a mountain hamlet
has become badly strained. Pieced together, those elements offered
a possible explanation for why the search has taken so long with so
little apparent progress.
</P>
<P>
   Among the locals, at least, much of the blame is placed on
federal agents' textbook approach _ in the town as well as in the
wild _ and how it has succeeded only in alienating the natives
while leaving Rudolph running free.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one area of the country where, regardless of the
badge, you don't come in riding buckshot and pushing people around,
which is what they've done,'' said Darren McCullough of nearby
Murphy. ``I don't know about the abortion bombs, but I believe
they're using him as a scapegoat on the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also widespread disdain for the outsiders' search
methods. Nathan Curtis, a 14-year-old, fourth-generation bear
hunter, said city-bred agents would have better luck ``if they put
out a couple girls and a six-pack and just waited.''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking her 7-year-old daughter to school, Cathy Cottrell
of Andrews laughed as she told a story about an FBI dog falling to
its death. ``They brought in a dog from California and it chases a
scent right off a mountain. They should put mountain dogs rather
than flatland dogs out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal authorities are doing their best to ignore the
pressure and act as though they are welcome guests here. Some
accomplish that by simply turning on their heels at the approach of
a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have consistently said that we are here solely to locate
and apprehend Eric Rudolph,'' Woody Enderson, an FBI inspector who
heads the search effort, said in a statement. ``We are not going
anywhere before our job is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, warming the hearts of many locals, he promised: ``While we
have deeply appreciated the hospitality of the people in this
community, we have no desire nor plans to remain here after our
mission is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   While the action and the tension are here, the implications
extend far beyond the half-million acres of search area in the
Great Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina. The Rudolph
manhunt has become a test of two elite law enforcement agencies,
the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the
primary players in the Southeast Bomb Task Force that is conducting
the search under Enderson's direction.
</P>
<P>
   The shine was rubbed off federal agents' shoes at two previous
standoffs with antigovernment separatists _ the Branch Davidians at
Waco, Texas, and the Weaver family at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Further
damaging the FBI's image was its initial insistence that the
Olympics bomber was security guard Richard A. Jewell, followed by
revelations that the FBI's vaunted crime lab was a petri dish for
faulty science.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the FBI and ATF have invested resources and prestige in two
beliefs: They have the right man and they know where to find him.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes have risen markedly in recent weeks as the task force
has grown to roughly 200 agents _ after falling to about 80 earlier
in the fall. Justice Department officials say more searchers were
added because the FBI believes Rudolph will be easier to find now
that leaves that gave him cover have fallen from the trees.
High-tech motion and heat-sensing devices also should have a better
chance of finding a moving man or a heat source, a necessity on
cold mountain nights, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcheting up the intensity further was an incident two weeks
ago in which someone fired several shots across a soccer field and
into the task force headquarters, a former textile manufacturing
plant in a residential neighborhood. One round brushed the hair of
one agent and just missed another. The police chief said last week
he has no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A wide place on N.C. Highway 19 with just 1,674 people,
sustained by a Lee jeans factory with more than 400 workers,
Andrews bills itself as ``The Little Town With a Big Heart.''
Despite the deaths blamed on him and a $1 million bounty on his
head, Rudolph apparently has found a place in that heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real distrust of central authority here. It might
go back to the moonshine days. Not helping the feds isn't
necessarily looked on as a bad thing,'' said Frederick Hawley, a
criminal justice professor at Western Carolina University.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Rudolph learned these forested mountains while
spending part of his youth here, and old connections run deep.
Already, he has been immortalized in at least two country-western
songs. One, written by the owner of a pizza parlor in nearby Bryson
City, opines: ``Now the folks around the town of Andrews said they
wouldn't turn him in; Not even for a million dollars ... that would
surely be a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a romantic legend building here,'' Hawley said, ``and
the FBI needs to drag it into the courts and show it for what it
is, warts and all.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be an uphill battle with at least some locals. Bear
hunter Mike Curtis, who moves mobile homes when he is not in the
woods, said he thinks Rudolph might be a scapegoat. He has no
interest in the reward: ``It's really not that important. It's not
worth killing somebody over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sure making the FBI look bad,'' added Curtis, who said he
knew Rudolph casually years back. ``That don't bother me a bit. If
they knew what they were doing, they'd have caught him by now. They
would have had him in the first two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The search and bear hunt take place in the beautiful but hostile
Nantahala National Forest, a seemingly endless expanse bisected by
the Appalachian Trail. It is a world of ragged rock cliffs, steep
hills, old gem mines, laurel thickets, and huge rhododendrons.
Rattlesnakes are numerous, big, and fearsome, and the recent dry
weather was a boon to stinging yellow jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of the forest's density came this month: A single-engine
plane piloted by the father of an FBI agent went down in the woods
on the way to Andrews; despite a beeping signal beacon, weeks of
searching proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to get lost only a hundred yards from a main
road, and bear hunters warn a novice in the woods: ``If you lose
your way, follow a creek.'' Then, they joke, ``Or follow an agent.
There'll be plenty of them, and they'll be lost, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force agents enter the woods in groups of four to
eight, with one or two rifle-toting marksmen assigned to ensure the
team's safety. Authorities consider Rudolph armed and dangerous,
willing to kill to preserve his freedom. Some teams use tracking
dogs, and some use sophisticated electronic gear.
</P>
<P>
   If they are frustrated, none admit it to a reporter. ``Morale's
real high. Everybody's here to do a job, and we're confident of
getting it done,'' said one ATF agent from Atlanta. Citing task
force rules, he insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Among the locals, it is a widely held belief that if Rudolph is
still in these woods _ and there is doubt about that _ he must be
getting help. But not everyone is a supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not out there all this time. He couldn't survive it. He's
in somebody's basement, watching CNN,'' said David Hall, a
carpenter who said he briefly knew and disliked Rudolph. ``He's a
smart aleck, arrogant, a guy with a chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I saw him, I'd hit him in the head with a stick. I ain't
above that. I'd be dragging him in for the bounty,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions of sympathetic helpers stem from a July 7 incident in
which Rudolph contacted Andrews shopkeeper George Nordmann, a
longtime acquaintance. Two days later, Rudolph went to Nordmann's
empty house and took a large amount of food and a pickup truck,
leaving five hundred-dollar bills as payment. Nordmann did not
report the theft for two more days, and on July 13 investigators
found the truck at a nearby campground.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nordmann refused to talk about the meeting. At his
health food store, The Better Way, he responded to a reporter's
questions with hands held high in a pose of surrender. ``No
comment, no comment, no comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little sign of Rudolph, other than some buried
trash that bore his fingerprint. Yet, there have been alleged
sightings far from here, including several in West Virginia of a
pizza-eating, foul-smelling mountain man who left the woods to buy
a phone card.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the FBI, the ATF, and other task force members are
convinced Rudolph remains somewhere in these mountains. They are
not predicting when they will find him.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews Mayor Jim Daily said he is in no rush to see the search
end. ``This has helped the town. It's been good for business. All
the restaurants and B&AMP;Bs are full,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When night falls, there is little to do in Andrews. Dinner might
be a ``Rudolph Burger with FBI Curly Fries'' at the Cherokee Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one of the few options is the Civic Cinema. But on this
night the main feature does not appeal to many locals, and there
are no agents in sight, either. Starring Denzel Washington, it is
``The Siege.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected them all to come look at it,'' manager Sharon Ray
said of the task force searchers. ``A lot more came to see
`Something About Mary.' They liked that one a lot.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, Mass. _ They are stunted and, some would say, ugly
trees, clinging to the rocky slope with bare roots like talons. The
19th-century farmers who cleared the land at the foot of Mount
Wachusett didn't bother to cut down these old birches because the
trees were so spindly and the footing around them so treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   Until three years ago, they were just unheralded trees along the
mountain road. But, today, ecologists know that homeliness was the
secret to centuries of success. These birches are part of the
largest known old-growth forest in Massachusetts, about 200 acres
of woodland that was never cut because no one thought the timber
was worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Forest researchers have doubled their estimate of the remaining
old-growth forests in the East over the past four years, as marvels
like the Wachusett woods prove that far more of the pre-European
landscape somehow escaped the woodsman's ax than they had thought
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The expanding acreage of confirmed or suspected old-growth
forest _ now estimated at 2 million acres in the eastern half of
the country by leading researcher Robert T. Leverett _ is a boon
for scientists who get an unexpected chance to learn what Eastern
forests were like before Europeans cut them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, these trees may possess genetic secrets to
long life that foresters would love to know. The yellow birches on
Wachusett are older than many ecologists believed, enduring
centuries of winter cold and ice that sheared off limbs and left
some with up to a dozen knobby scars.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the scientists, activists, and amateur old-growth
``detectives'' who gathered at Harvard Forest in Petersham for a
conference on Eastern old growth this month, the main virtue is
more intangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us really have a feeling somewhere inside of us that
these places are important and we shouldn't let them slip away,''
said Leverett, a computer specialist in Holyoke who has developed a
knack for finding old-growth forests.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' old growth looks nothing like the ancient,
awe-inspiring Douglas firs in the Pacific Northwest, whose majesty
defines virgin forests in the public mind. Instead, Eastern old
growth is likely to be waterlogged black gum swamps, a prairie-edge
forest just 25 feet tall, or stunted birches on the windswept side
of Wachusett Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have this idea of big, cathedral-like trees as the
old ones and not these harsh, exposed sites,'' said Harvard
University forest ecologist David Orwig, pointing out a
370-year-old, lichen-covered birch at Wachusett. ``This hillside
probably looks a lot like it used to'' when permanent white
settlers came in 1791.
</P>
<P>
   In no small part because Eastern old growth is not widely
recognized, it is largely unprotected. Some of the oldest red oak
trees in New England were slated to be knocked down for a ski slope
at Wachusett Mountain State Reservation before an amateur
naturalist identified them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Massachusetts has a policy to save old growth on public
land, but other forests have no such protection. For instance,
large areas of suspected old growth on federal land in North
Carolina are not protected from logging, while Oklahoma developers
clear ancient forests for houses without even knowing what they've
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sin of it is that, because we do not widely appreciate
that fragments of original America still survive, we continue to
cut them down,'' said David Stahle, director of the Tree-Ring
Laboratory at the University of Arkansas and an authority on the
Oklahoma old growth. ``They're part of an ecosystem that has been
held together for 6,000 years, and we are bulldozing them and
replacing them with ornamental pear trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1980s, most researchers assumed that almost
every acre of forest east of Oklahoma had been subjected to logging
or other human disturbance in more than three centuries of European
settlement. Farming had denuded the landscape in great waves as it
spread westward, and even now spectacular woods such as the White
Mountains in New Hampshire have had to grow back from stumps at the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, except for national treasures such as the
150-foot-tall trees in the Great Smoky National Forest in Tennessee
and Adirondack Park in New York, ecologists assumed there were few
old-growth forests in the East worth looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Even Stahle, known as ``the Lord of the Rings'' for his skill at
estimating tree ages, said he expected to learn about Eastern old
growth by studying log cabins rather than live trees because ``I
had the notion ... that it's all been chopped down.''
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasts such as Leverett, who stalks old growth on
weekends, kept finding forests that somehow escaped logging, often
because they were inaccessible or the trees of low commercial
value. By 1994, Leverett and Vermont naturalist Mary Byrd Davis
identified 750,000 to 1 million acres of old growth in the 34
states from Maine to Florida to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Davis's guidebook, ``Old Growth in the East,'' lists 23 stands
of old growth even in densely populated Massachusetts, two-thirds
of it on state land in the western part of the state. Though almost
all of the sites, such as land on Mount Greylock, were known to
state officials, the guide brought many of the sites to public
attention for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Leverett's estimates are not scientific _ most sites
have not been thoroughly surveyed, and ecologists differ on what
should be counted as ``old growth'' _ but the report inspired
others to follow in their footsteps, spurring today's boom of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Rob Messick of the environmental group Western
North Carolina Alliance was so inspired that he trekked far from
the trails in North Carolina's Pisgah National Forest to find an
astonishing 38,900 acres of old-growth forests amid the gorges and
rocky outcroppings that warded off 19th-century loggers.
</P>
<P>
   Messick's discoveries underscored how little forest researchers
had focused on the ancient woods of the East: The Forest Service
had never tried to determine if the woods were old growth, leaving
the work to an amateur researcher.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, meanwhile, Stahle of the University of Arkansas
discovered that tens of thousands of acres in the Cross Timbers
forest at the edge of the Oklahoma prairie had never been logged.
He found post and blackjack oaks more than 300 years old despite
the fact that few were more than 25 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' old growth in New England contained relatively few
acres, but researchers were surprised to find any new sites after
all the human disturbances. Despite the widespread belief that the
White Mountains had been so heavily logged that it was reduced to
``smoldering ruins,'' University of New Hampshire graduate student
Christine Goodale found a stand of never-logged trees just off
Route 16 by reviewing historic maps.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the Wachusett old growth, which put the brakes
on expansion at Wachusett Mountain ski area in 1995. The trees run
in a narrow band around the mountain, representing the land that
neither the farmers below nor the resort hotel operator above
wanted. Leverett learned why loggers left them alone, breaking an
ankle while climbing the slope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 5 minutes, I knew that we had the discovery of the
decade,'' said Leverett of the day when he saw the Wachusett trees
for the first time. When the field work is done, Leverett believes
researchers will have identified at least 200 acres of old growth
at Wachusett.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the old growth of the East has to battle for respect.
Unlike the Pacific Northwest, field biologists have not found
animals, such as the spotted owl of northern California, that
depend on these virgin forests for survival. The best they can do
so far are several types of rare lichen that grow much more readily
on old trees than young ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard's Orwig said the old-growth forests deserve respect
simply because they survived, and are one of the few places that
looks much as it did when the Pilgrims stepped ashore in 1620.
``It's the portion of the landscape that's remaining from earlier
times,'' he said. ``It's what we have left.''

<P>
   SEOUL _ Call it Korea's tale of David and Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Jang Ha Sung, a bespectacled, mild-mannered professor of
finance, has taken on the corporate giants of South Korea. And
shockingly, in a country where the chaebol, or family-run
conglomerates, control almost every aspect of life, Jang has
achieved victories that no one dreamed possible.
</P>
<P>
   With his conservative maroon tie and briefcase full of financial
documents, Jang is no Che Guevara. But that might be why he and his
band of progressive lawyers and professionals _ People's Solidarity
for Participatory Democracy _ could be the most effective
revolutionary group that tradition-bound South Korea has seen in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, we'd march and yell. But when you're dealing
with the chaebol, that doesn't work. It has to be pressure within
the system,'' said Jang, a former student activist and Wharton
School of Management graduate.
</P>
<P>
   By persuading average Korean shareholders and large American
investment funds to sign over voting rights to him, Jang has
pressured chaebol to clean up management, cut corruption, and open
their often-doctored accounts to public view. In cases where
pressure hasn't worked, Jang and his crew have resorted to the
American-style response: Sue the guys in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Jang and his band of anti-establishment
establishmentarians is a lesson in how the mood of even a
conservative nation can shift when people become fed up with crony
capitalism. The response here has not been violent as in Indonesia,
where people rioted and brought down a government. For that reason,
Jang's crusade to clean up Korean corporations may prove far more
effective in overhauling this economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him as a quixotic figure. One man tilting at the
corporate windmills is not going to knock them down or make them
salute him,'' Hank Morris, director of the Seoul-based Industrial
Research and Consulting Ltd., said of Jang. ``It'll probably be
years before his work has great impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet,'' Morris conceded, ``there are signs that he has had
some initial success. I have to take my hat off to him, because
what he is doing is quite courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Courageous because the chaebol mostly control life here. They
dominate business, from electronics and cars to real estate and
advertising. They own newspapers and television stations and run
foundations that set the cultural agenda. They own schools,
universities, and hospitals. And they have also controlled many
politicians and banks through bribery and collusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, they own it,'' said Jang, sitting behind his desk
at Korea University, piled high with papers documenting
illegalities in top conglomerates. ``If we want to make this
country more efficient, cleaner, more open, less corrupt, we have
to reform the chaebol and cut their relations with politics. Right
now, they are stronger than the government. Presidents come and go
every five years, but the chaebol never change.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the denizens of industry have not been amused
by the 45-year-old upstart. Jang, whose father was a businessman
and whose uncles are a top politician and the president of Korea
Electric Power Co., says being from the same background as many
chaebol elite has made his crusade harder.
</P>
<P>
   Managers first lobbied him through family and friends to drop
his campaign. Then came phone calls to his home and efforts to dig
up dirt from his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these top managers are my school and college
classmates, and we are talking about issues that nobody's
comfortable with,'' Jang said. ``But in their hearts, they know
that if not all, at least part of what I am doing is good and
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Koreans had long chalked up the roaring growth of the last three
decades to state-directed capitalism that featured cozy ties among
government, banks, and chaebol. But average folk now blame
conglomerates burdened by staggering debts for the crisis that
forced Seoul to accept a $57 billion bailout last year, the largest
ever granted by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting recession has been one of the worst in Asia _ the
economy is expected to contract 7 percent this year, and about 2
million people are jobless. And although average laborers have
taken a bite by accepting layoffs and pay cuts, everyone from
Korean President Kim Dae Jung to President Clinton complains that
the biggest chaebol have refused to accept reforms that would allow
the whole economy to recover. The top five chaebol, including
Hyundai, Samsung, and Daewoo, account for 40 percent of economic
activity here.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the problem are years of government pressure on
banks to lend to chaebol, which in turn were given the right to
overborrow and expand into every kind of business _ in exchange for
donations to politicians. In the process, conglomerates did as they
pleased _ using funds from flush companies to subsidize failing
subsidiaries, selling products to sister companies at inflated
prices, and issuing discounted shares to the chairman's family.
</P>
<P>
   Jang's aim is to prevent such practices and reform corporate
governance by speaking out for minority shareholders. His movement
began in 1994, but gained steam last year when the economy began to
show signs of wear. In January 1997, the Hanbo Steel conglomerate
went bust, bringing down with it Korea First Bank, which had made
more than $805 million in loans to Hanbo.
</P>
<P>
   Jang and his friends went onto the streets with placards asking
shareholders to sign over their voting rights in a campaign to
reform the bank. About 150 disgruntled stockholders _ from rich
individuals to janitors saving for retirement _ did so. Soon they
had 1 percent of First Bank's shares, the magic number to propose
an agenda, open a company's books, or sue executives.
</P>
<P>
   Jang's group suggested a plan to cut the labor force, sell off
bad assets and affiliates, form an independent appraisal company,
and fire top executives. First Bank rejected the plan, so the
minority shareholders sued, seeking $30 million compensation for
illegal loans to Hanbo and illegal political contributions. In
July, they won, Jang said.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Jang's group filed suit to stop Samsung
Electronics from issuing a convertible bond to the chairman's son
at a discounted price. They won an injunction, but Samsung was
allowed to issue the bond, though they were barred from selling it
on the Korea Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Jang's group attended the Samsung Electronics'
shareholders' meeting, an affair that was reportedly packed with
employees who were urged to jeer at Jang and fill seats to prevent
other minority shareholders from attending. The usually cursory
agenda dragged on 13 1/2 hours as Jang's group interrogated
management about allegedly illegal transactions and a shell company
in Ireland. Jang also protested the appointment as auditor of a
former government official who had been convicted of taking bribes
from Samsung.
</P>
<P>
   But 1 percent of votes was not enough, and in the end, ``they
did what they wanted,'' Jang said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Jang's most successful campaign was targeting SK Telecom Co.
Joining forces with Koreans and big American institutional
investors _ Scudder Kemper, Tiger, Oppenheimer and Emerging Markets
Investors _ Jang's alliance amassed 18 percent of shares, enough to
force SK Telecom to accept three independent board directors to
represent minority shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman's family also reimbursed the company $23 million,
which Jang said they took in illegal profits. And SK Telecom _ the
cash cow of SK Group's 45 companies _ was reimbursed $270
million &UR;  &LR; that its managers had drained away to ailing affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Jang calls SK Telecom his group's one victory. Even though they
won a lawsuit against Korea First Bank, the bank is still on the
verge of collapse. ``Our purpose is to make the companies better,''
Jang said. ``Unless we turn it around and make a company a success,
I wouldn't say we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Jang has attracted the attention of US diplomats, who invited
him as one of six guests last week at a roundtable with Clinton,
and the admiration of several institutional investors who have made
him their proxy. Jang has asked two Boston-based investment funds _
Putnam Investments and Wellington Management _ to join forces with
him, and a Wellington representative is expected to meet Jang here
in a few days to discuss his work.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jarvis, Korea analyst for the Arlington, Va.-based Emerging
Markets Investors Corp., recounted that largely because of the
efforts of Jang, ``corporate governance is in the vocabulary of
every chaebol I meet these days. It remains to be seen if their
deeds will match their words.''

AS COMPANIES RUSH TO REPURCHASE SHARES, SOME INVESTORS ARE WARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a bid to boost stock performance, hundreds of
corporations are buying back their shares at a torrid pace, while
investors wonder whether the repurchase plans are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities Data Co. of Newark, N.J., reports that companies
are heading toward another record year, with 1,768 saying they'll
buy $203 billion of their shares. That tops the 1,300 companies
that announced buybacks worth $181 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a rash of announcements, and we won't be
surprised if we continue to see more,'' said Michael Mauboussin, an
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock repurchases are sending mixed messages to
investors and Wall Street analysts. Some companies enjoy dramatic
rises in their share prices, while others see their stock sink like
a rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buybacks aren't automatic,'' said David Fried, editor of ``The
Buyback Letter'' and president of Fried Asset Management, an
investment management company in Malibu, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that love buybacks span all sectors and products. In
banking, Citigroup has announced plans to snap up $2 billion of its
stock. Intel Corp. has said it will repurchase $7.6 billion worth
of shares. McDonald's plans a $3.5 billion buyback. And Philip
Morris Cos. has unveiled an $8 billion buyback plan _ the largest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperous stock market, scores of mergers and the growth of
employee stock option plans have filled corporate coffers with
extra cash and billions of shares. Rather than use the surplus cash
or equity to pay off debt or feed business growth, companies are
buying their own shares.
</P>
<P>
   Since buybacks are unregulated by the securities industry, the
process is quick: Corporate officers and boards simply sign off on
the repurchase plans, then make it public to investors.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason companies do buybacks is to jump-start flat or
sinking stock prices. When a company repurchases millions of common
shares, it shrinks the total number of shares in the market. With
fewer shares claiming a piece of a company's profits, its
earnings-per-share ratio often gets a big boost. This can lead to
greater demand and higher stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   One good example is The Gap Inc. in San Francisco. After the
company announced Oct. 29 it would buy back $1.6 billion, or 30
million shares, of its outstanding stock, its shares rose from
$55.13 to $59 on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Buybacks seem to help the long-term stock performance of
companies that repurchase at least 5 percent of their shares,
according to Melissa Brown, an analyst at Prudential Securities in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 to 1996, big companies that bought back their shares
gained 21 percent a year, compared to 15.5 percent for comparable
companies that did not. Medium-sized companies that repurchased
shares gained 26 percent yearly, compared to 16 percent for others.
And for smaller companies, the gap was 22.6 percent to 15.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another appeal of buybacks: It signals a company's faith in its
share performance and the overall stock market.
</P>
<P>
   One dramatic example came last year in October, when the Dow
Jones index plunged 554 points or 7 percent, in one day _ the worst
one-day percentage drop since the Black Monday market crash of
October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The market rallied swiftly the next day, and many credited IBM's
move to repurchase $3.5 billion of its shares. That vote of
confidence encouraged many investors to plunge back into the
market, market experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Buybacks also create tax advantages for shareholders. If a
company rewards its investors by paying dividends, the dividends
are taxable at an individual's tax rate of up to 39.6 percent. In
contrast, money returned through buybacks would be taxed when a
shareholder sells stock at the lower capital gains rates of 35
percent for corporations and 20 percent for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pay out in dividends, it would be taxable
immediately,'' Fried said. ``With buybacks, you get to choose when
you cash out.''
</P>
<P>
   But buyback plans don't always work out, market experts said.
</P>
<P>
   One danger to small investors, who rarely have a say in the
matter: Some corporate officers and board directors don't follow
through completely with their buyback plans after announcing them.
</P>
<P>
   A study last August by James Westphal, a management professor at
the University of Texas, found that one-third of 412 major
companies that announced buybacks from 1985 to 1991 failed to
repurchase their stock, and they are not legally required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also may halt or postpone buybacks if they are heading
into a merger or acquisition paid for by stock. If the proposed
merger uses the popular ``pooling of interests'' accounting method,
in which the exchange of stock to pay for the deal is not taxable,
companies must halt their buyback plans to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, stock buybacks are used by strong, profitable companies
with healthy cash flows. But market pros advise investors that
financially weak companies may announce buybacks in a last-gasp
attempt to boost their share prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is littered with companies that repurchased
`undervalued' shares, only to see business prospects sour and the
stocks go down,'' Mauboussin said. ``An announced buyback program _
even an aggressive one _ is not an automatic signal of value.''

GIVE THANKS TO GORE FOR TAKING ON MAHATHIR MOHAMAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- As lying, racist, anti-Semitic crooks go, Mahathir
Mohamad is small potatoes, except for the fact that any time a
lying, racist, anti-Semitic crook is actually running a country
it's wise to beware, at least out of respect for history.
</P>
<P>
   That goes double when the slime in question has been running the
place for more than 17 years, jails his deputy and has him beaten,
thumbs his nose at the world by placing controls on capital flows,
and blames his country's economic woes repeatedly on Jews and then
tries to deny having said it.
</P>
<P>
   Look on the prime minister of Malaysia, in short, as Louis
Farrakhan with a government, and be thankful that the likes of Al
Gore have decided to take him on now that he has become a threat
not only to human rights but also to a gradual return to economic
stability in turbulent Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It has barely been two weeks since Gore identified the United
States with the forces of reform _ political and economic _ in
Malaysia, obviously too soon for sweeping judgments about the
aftermath, but not too soon to notice some hopeful signs.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Prime Minister Mohamad himself has shied away
from any response to Gore's direct, tough criticism of his brutal
treatment of a prominent former government leader and protege, his
dangerous challenge to economic reform principles, and his related
suppression of political reformers whose peaceful agitation for
real democracy threatens his grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the visible signs of democratic activism _ protest
gatherings each Saturday _ not only continue, but are attracting
more participants. Less visible is a vibrant democracy movement
that is gaining strength and followers via a uniquely vigorous use
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And for a third, the increase in the world press's attention to
Malaysia has been huge, and may be the most important, short-term
consequence of Gore's well-timed intervention. It may be the most
important because the signal being sent by the increased scrutiny
is that Malaysia may not be the island of ``stability,'' the safe
investment haven it has long been assumed to be, that perhaps
international businesses and financial organizations need to
seriously rethink their assumptions. That prospect is delightfully
subversive.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreign policy priesthood, Gore's explicit words in Kuala
Lumpur produced some classic tsk-tsking _ rude to the host,
distracting at an Asian economic summit, counterproductive, and all
the other realpolitik cliches that post-Cold War reality is
rendering intellectually silly.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, the tsk-tsking has missed the point
factually as well as strategically, particularly in two areas:
</P>
<P>
   _Gore didn't simply blurt out a few phrases about free people
and free markets and single out for praise the ``reformasi''
activists in Malaysia. His comments were the culmination of weeks
of escalating alarm in the Clinton administration, and would have
been delivered by the president himself had Saddam Hussein's latest
outrages not intervened.
</P>
<P>
   _The bulk of his speech to the summit concerned the vital
importance of economic reforms in extricating the region and the
world from financial danger _ more disclosure of basic economic
information, more open markets for capital as well as goods and
services, and less crony capitalism and corruption. That was just
as tough a slam at current, kleptomaniacal practices in Malaysia as
his remarks on political freedom, but the foreign policy priesthood
(with economic interests at stake) somehow found that not only
excusable but even praiseworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Malaysia was an economic success story in the
main, though tarnished by a prime minister who gloated more than
most regional autocrats over the superiority of ``Asian values'' of
conformity over Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis, however, produced a unique lurch in Prime
Minister Mohamad's behavior. To shield his country in the short run
and promote his reelection next year, he slapped currency and other
anti-market controls on the economy, and began blaming outsiders in
general and Jews in particular for his problems.
</P>
<P>
   And because this kind of dictatorial economics and bigoted blame
game is usually accompanied by political misdeeds, he also went
after his longtime deputy, Anwar Ibrahim _ a free-market democracy
advocate well known in international circles as well as to Al Gore
personally. Ibrahim was arrested on trumped-up corruption and sex
charges and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The post-arrest photos of his bruises and his ex-boss's virulent
anti-Semitism galvanized the administration and Gore weeks ago to
public criticism, and the vice president's speech was preceded by a
highly publicized visit to Ibrahim's wife by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not act rashly, in short. His words had both context
and careful timing, and the world needs more of them, not less.
</P>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It's the tortilla, stupid!
</P>
<P>
   That's the message President Ernesto Zedillo and his top
officials are hearing these days from nearly every corner of Mexico
in response to proposed government cuts of basic _ and
traditionally subsidized _ staples.
</P>
<P>
   With crucial elections next year quickly approaching and a
presidential vote less than two years away, critics and political
observers are warning the Zedillo administration that many of the
cuts and tax increases they're seeking might anger Mexicans enough
to end the ruling party's 70-year hold on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   This year's budget debate has been unusually combative, due
mostly to an opposition-led Congress and because of several
controversial measures in the government plan. Among them: a 30
percent increase in gasoline, already about $1.65 a gallon; a 15
percent tax increase on phone calls; and increases in water,
electricity, and the sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Zedillo government has proposed ending tortilla
subsidies for 3 million low-income residents, a move that would
probably result in a price hike in the country's most important
staple from roughly 14 cents a pound to about 18 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will affect me and my family a lot,'' Guadalupe Macias, a
47-year-old housekeeper, said Friday afternoon while holding 2
kilos of fresh corn tortillas she had just bought at a factory in
the southern neighborhood of Coyoacan. ``You can tell people to buy
less gasoline, but how can you tell us to eat less?''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the cuts and price increases are
necessary to offset shortages caused by record-low oil prices this
year _ and free up more money for initiatives to fight crime,
widely viewed at Mexicans' foremost concern. About a third of the
federal government's revenues come from petroleum-related
operations, mostly through its monopoly, Pemex.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's budget chief, Jose Angel Gurria, also said that
without tighter spending, the country's deficit could balloon next
year from 1.25 percent of gross domestic product to nearly 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot-button issue in the Zedillo budget is a $55 billion
expense to rescue a bankrupt, government-run bank known as Fobaproa
that many Mexicans see as a taxpayer bailout for wealthy bankers
and political cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, budget season in Mexico has been one of quiet
handshakes and rubber stamps. The executive branch would propose
the plan, and a majority of Congress _ usually members of the same
party _ would approve it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, both the government and the budget have
drawn an unprecedented level of criticism from all sides, including
conservative business leaders, the Roman Catholic Church, and
progressive community activists. Even members of Zedillo's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, have lashed out at
parts of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think that if there are exaggerated increases ...
the people who manage the government's budgets are in a different
galaxy from the one we live in,'' said Bishop Abelardo Alvarado,
secretary general of the Mexican Episcopal Conference.
</P>
<P>
   A major labor union leader last week called for national strikes
unless wages are raised to compensate for the higher prices. And
several members of the lower house heckled Gurria with refrains of
``It won't pass!'' during a budget presentation last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity, variety, and solidity of the criticism that the
administration has received on its handling of the budget will
bring reforms to the process that could qualify _ without
exaggeration _ as revolutionary,'' Sergio Aguayo Quezada, a
political scientist at Colegio de Mexico, wrote in the Reforma
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout plan prompted protests at a bankers' meeting
Saturday, with one demonstrator putting a severed pig's head in
front of a leading government economic official and shouting, ``You
all should pay, not the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has until Dec. 15 to decide the budget. The Mexican
Constitution allows it to create a modified version that the
president could not veto.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their anger, though, some Mexicans wonder whether
legislators can or will do much to change the government's
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear them talking and yelling about the budget, but I don't
hear them saying what they're going to do about it,'' said Dolores
Cantu Cortez, 33, another customer at the tortilla store. ``Maybe
it's all a show, because they get their salaries from the budget,

`ZORRO' HAS PIZZAZ, BUT; `BEFORE TIME VI' A LOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``The Mask of Zorro''  &LR; _ Antonio Banderas stars
in this splendidly mounted retelling of the foxy hero's legend.
It's got splash and pizazz with a stunningly choreographed duel and
enough special effects to fill the Enterprise. But it's rather
hollow at the center, and the cuts between Anthony Hopkins's
close-ups and long shots make it obvious that a stuntman is doing
the hard stuff. Frankly, we prefer the 1940 black-and-white version
starring Tyrone Power and directed by that underrated genius Rouben
Mamoulian. It's also available on home video.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Land Before Time VI''  &LR; _ V too many.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Last Seduction 2''  &LR; _ John Dahl's sexy, provocative
original, starring Linda Fiorentino as a lady on the lam, was
brilliant; this sequel, with Joan Severance, is dull and
repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Woman in the Dunes'' &LR;  _ Hiroshi Teshigahara directed this
1964 Oscar winner (for best foreign-language film) with tough
artistry. The parable of a doomed couple trapped in sand dunes
resonates as a timeless allegory.

WILSON'S HUMOR BROKE BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the outsize personalities who popped out of the TV screen
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, few were more vivid than Flip
Wilson, and none pulled a more decisive disappearing act.
</P>
<P>
   By creating characters like the exuberant Geraldine and coining
such catch phrases as ``The devil made me do it!,'' Wilson
imprinted himself on the national imagination so quickly that in
1970, its first year on the air, ``The Flip Wilson Show'' was the
second-highest-rated TV program in the country. It was a remarkable
feat that he promptly repeated the next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the country had embraced a television
variety show headlined by a black performer, after shunning earlier
programs hosted by Sammy Davis Jr. and Nat King Cole. Wilson was on
top of the entertainment world.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1974 he decided to get off the weekly TV carousel. Even
though it was still popular, Wilson left his show. From then until
his death Wednesday night of liver cancer at the age of 64, the
comedian was seldom in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made virtually a complete disappearance from television,''
remarked TV historian Alex McNeil yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's appetite for any kind of spotlight seemed to disappear
as well. McNeil recalled attending a performance by Richard Pryor
in the mid-1970s at the old Paul's Mall in Boston. Spotting Wilson
in the audience, Pryor introduced him and asked him to come onstage
and take a bow. Wilson declined.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's withdrawal from the public arena was prompted, he told
interviewers, by his desire to spend more time with his five
children, to ``make sure they don't go through what I did.''
Abandoned by his mother at age 7, he had bounced among foster homes
and reform school while growing up _ hardscrabble origins that make
his later success even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was no Pryor; his comedy nestled within the mainstream
and seldom ventured toward the cutting edge. There were those who
accused him of stereotyping or of not being confrontational enough.
</P>
<P>
   But others saw Wilson as a gifted sketch comic who was simply
doing what comedians of other ethnic groups have done from time
immemorial: mining his own background for material, creating
exaggerated characters in a quest for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Wilson benefited from arriving on television at a time
when new opportunities were opening up for black performers. The
racial antagonism that had undermined Cole's variety show in the
1950s and Davis's first show in the 1960s was beginning to ebb.
Wilson's apolitical hi-jinks found a ready audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he wasn't talented and he wasn't funny, but the
time was right,'' said McNeil. ``He came in on the right wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatively brief though it may have been, Flip Wilson's time at
the TV pinnacle was memorable. One of his most popular characters
was Reverend Leroy of the Church of What's Happening Now; in an era
that consecrated the ``now,'' Wilson was what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the first man to wear a dress on network television _
that was Milton Berle _ but Wilson was probably the first one to
wear miniskirts, hot pants, and go-go boots. The sheer energy he
brought to the character of Geraldine made her over-the-top funny.
Pretty soon, the whole country was repeating Geraldine's pet
phrases: ``When you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're
not,'' ``What you see is what you get,'' and of course, ``The devil
made me do it!''
</P>
<P>
   That alibi would be employed by a fallen tel-evan-ge-list or two
in years to come, but could Wilson also have sown the seeds for
Dana Carvey's Church Lady on ``Saturday Night Live''? Not only did
Carvey wear a dress, but the Church Lady blamed everything on
Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Like innumerable other comics, Wilson had gotten his big break
on ``The Tonight Show,'' in 1965. He also appeared on that other
pillar of the comedy establishment, ``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' but
his reputation was really made on the counterculture classic,
``Rowan &AMP; Martin's Laugh-In.'' Even among the riotous goings-on of
``Laugh-In,'' Wilson stood out, especially when he declaimed,
``Here come the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving ``The Flip Wilson Show,'' Wilson resurfaced
occasionally in films or network specials, plus a short-lived
sitcom called ``Charlie and Company,'' and an equally short-lived
revival of ``People Are Funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed determined to prove there is life after
television. Having shucked the role of celebrity, he seemed content
with the off-camera role of father. And when he died, his daughter
Michelle was at his side.

THE ENTERTAINER IS READY FOR A REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No artist wants to be a parody of himself. Think of Elvis
Presley in his twilight years and the shuddering image of an
immobile, embarrassing burnout. That's not what Billy Joel has in
mind for his career, so he's taking himself out of the running.
He's now on one of the longest unofficial farewell tours in memory,
but he expects to end it before his 50th birthday, on May 9 of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to that time _ and, yeah, I don't want to be a
parody,'' says Joel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ability to do these rock 'n' roll shows is beginning to
leave,'' says Joel, who is confronting the inevitable. ``And I'm
aware of that. I'm more acutely aware of that than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   His soul-searching comes at a time when the demand to see him
has never been higher. His shows are selling out briskly and new
ones are being added daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audiences are fantastic,'' he admits. ``They are really
enthusiastic. They're made up of a lot of younger people, too.
College-aged kids. And even little kids. They're just screaming
their heads off. And I'm thinking, gee, the audience is in better
shape than we are these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel, who still plans to record classical music after this tour,
has had to overcome some serious physical ailments this year.
During the summer he suffered an upper respiratory infection that
forced him to cancel a European tour with Elton John. ``I
completely lost my voice, which was really bizarre,'' he says.
``That never happened to me before.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he had a heavy bout with the flu that caused him to
postpone a Pittsburgh show for the second time, though he's since
recovered and declares that his more recent shows have been among
the best on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to be up on stage if I can't do it well,''
Joel says from a tour stop in Chicago, before citing an analogy to
former baseball star Joe DiMaggio. ``You know, Joe took himself out
of the game when he felt he couldn't swing like he had before. And
I always thought, well, that took a lot of class. He removed
himself from the lineup. It's getting to be that time for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up on a stage now and it's like going on some kind of
terrifying amusement park ride,'' Joel says. ``The lights come on
and there is this huge roar coming out of the audience, so you're
immediately thrown into this broiler rotisserie with a lot of
lights, and this hugely loud PA system is blasting. Your head is
ringing and there you go, you're on this roller-coaster ride as you
go from song to song. I talked about this with the drummer (Liberty
DeVito), who has been with me a long time and is only a year
younger than me. It's now difficult for him to finish a two-plus
hour show banging the drums as hard as he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at each other by the end of the show and we say, `Hey,
we're getting too old for this.' You walk off the stage, your head
is ringing from the noise, your heart's pumping, you're sweating
like crazy, you're kind of dizzy from it, you're blinded by the
lights and then you go from sensory overload to sensory
deprivation. After the show, you get into this real quiet car and
you're sitting there and hearing all your systems pounding and
pumping. And I'm thinking, man, I'm definitely not as young as I
used to be. But that's not bad, as long as you're not trying to
make believe you are.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Joel has never done that. He has always espoused honesty in
his music _ and it's been enough to earn him a recent appointment
to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which he'll enter in March with
Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, and Curtis Mayfield, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   That's select company, but Joel, the pride and joy of
Hicksville, Long Island, has earned his slot with richly colorful
story songs such as ``Scenes from an Italian Restaurant,'' ``Piano
Man,'' and ``Only the Good Die Young.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking out on the audience and seeing college-age kids
who weren't even born when I wrote most of this stuff,'' he says.
``They're singing every lyric and I'm thinking, gee, this is the
stuff they want to hear, so they're getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this has been a ``greatest hits'' tour for Joel, who
hasn't had any new studio music out since 1993. ``That's a long
time in the music business. That's five years ago. And I realized
if I'm not going to put out new songs and new rock 'n' roll music,
then the day is coming that I will be a parody of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about a year ago that Joel made a commitment to tour
again. ``It's actually a commitment I made to the band and the crew
that I would tour. And then I got sick and couldn't tour the whole
middle of the year. So I'm touring at the end of this year and the
beginning of next. I don't want to call it a farewell tour, but
it's saying goodbye to fans who have been coming to see us for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'll never perform again. And I'm not saying I
won't pop up here and there from time to time in a different kind
of production. But right now, this is a kind of payback and a way
of saying thanks. We're also trying to keep the ticket price
down.'' (Joel's tickets are $39.50 _ not bad for an arena headliner
of his longevity.)
</P>
<P>
   The last pop song Joel even attempted to write was in 1995. It
had the working title ``Champs-Elysees.'' ``I said, OK, I'll write
about Paris. I love Paris. I'll just write about visions I've had
in Paris and the sort of serene consciousness of seeing the
carnival in Paris as I head toward the lights, and the ghosts of my
past, and just real pretentious crap. It was a bad lyric. Lyrics
were no longer expressing what music was expressing for me at that
point. But the song came to me as I walked along the
Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my guitar player, Tommy Burns, he's a tough kid from Long
Island, said, `You wrote a song called the `Champ's Eyelashes'? And
I cracked up and everybody else in the band cracked up. And I
realized no matter what I do, no matter what the lyric ends up
being, it will forever have to be known as the `Champ's Eyelashes.'
I might as well have been writing about the Champ's Eyelashes for
all the meaning the lyric had. And that was it. I just said, `This
stinks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began Joel's more serious foray into classical music
writing, which is where he feels his future lies. ``I'm getting
better at it,'' he says. ``I've got about eight or nine pieces now.
They are mostly piano pieces. Some pieces are for piano and
orchestra and there are some fragments of purely orchestral pieces
which are part of this work I've been doing called `The Scrimshaw
Pieces,' which is based on the history of Long Island and its
relationship to America and the settling of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not as confident, though, that critics will like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what would happen in the classical world if I tried to
present this as my attempt at classical music. They'd carve it to
bits because it is in no way late-20th-century atonal modern music.
It's very derivative of Chopin and Rachmaninoff and all of the
Romantic composers. And I'm not shy about saying that it is. That's
what I like, and that's how I write. I think even when I was
writing pop songs, I was coming from that ultra-melodic
Romanticism. And I think for it to be performed, for it to be
presented, I would prefer to have a classical virtuoso who's
trained to present this music to really do it justice. I can barely
play rudimentary classical music because my left hand is a waste
and I don't sight-read like I used to. And even though I have a
good knowledge of classical music, my hands don't do what they
could have done had I continued with my lessons when I was a
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, I can write better than I can play.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Dec. 1:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALZHEIMERS (New York) _ Scientists at New York University
Medical Center spent three days exploring the brain of the writer
in search for clues about what destroyed the brain of her mother at
a very early age. By Marion Roach. (1725 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SCIENTISTS-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Hollywood's treatment of
scientists is out of sync with that of the press, which generally
presents scientists as articulate people making important
discoveries. So now, efforts are being mounted to get Hollywood to
portray scientists in a more realistic light, as people with more
complex drives and emotions. These efforts also aim at getting
Hollywood to portray the process of scientific inquiry itself. But,
it's a hard sell. By Andrew Pollack. (1880 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEANDERTHAL-DIET (Undated) _ In a study already provoking
controversy, an American geographer has pointed out evidence
suggesting, in his view, that little more than the amount of iodine
in their diets may have been responsible for the physical
differences between Neanderthals and modern humans and that this
might solve the mystery of what happened to the Neanderthals. By
John Noble Wilford. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EMBRYOS-COMPETE (Undated) _ Evolutionary theorists are
scratching their heads over a new experiment on the breeding
characteristics of a rare species of monogamous mice. The
experiment has cast surprising doubt on a controversial, but highly
successful idea, namely that of a competition between embryos in
the womb and their mother, fueled by a kind of molecular arms race
between the sexes. By Gina Kolata. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: Do the terms
snake, viper and serpent have scientific differences? (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ION-PROPULSION (Undated) _ After more than a month of
lurching through space in fits and starts, an experimental
spacecraft crammed with new technologies has begun to cruise away
from Earth, driven by a recently revived ion propulsion engine
taken from science fiction. By Warren E. Leary. (980 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SHUTTLE (Undated) _ People in the eastern third of the
United States will be able to see the space shuttle within a few
minutes of its launching. By Joe Rao. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SAGAN-LEGACY (Undated) _ When Dr. Carl Sagan died two years
ago this month at age 62, most eulogies focused on his career in
popularizing science and conveying the wonders of the universe to
millions of people. But in addition to his celebrity, or perhaps
even despite it, Dr. Sagan was a serious and gifted researcher who
pushed back the frontiers of planetary science, molded a number of
gifted students and wielded great influence behind the scenes in
Washington. By William J. Broad. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on a new
test to tell if old pottery held milk; ways of dating earthquakes
with cosmic rays; sniffing out termites because they smell like
moth balls; dead and dying salamanders. (666 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-UMBILICAL-BLOOD (Undated) _ Should parents pay a blood bank
to store the blood from their newborn baby's umbilical cord and
placenta, in case that child or another family member ever needs it
to treat cancer or leukemia? Expectant parents are being urged to
do so by companies that have sprung up during the past few years to
sell cord-blood banking as a form of ``biological insurance''
against such dreaded diseases. By Denise Grady. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fitness and Health &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Diet plays an important role in the
prevention of cancer, including breast cancer. The American Cancer
Society estimates that diet is a primary factor in a third of
cancer deaths. But pop science that holds that fish oils, for
example, ``prevent'' cancer just doesn't hold up under scrutiny. By
Jane E. Brody. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SOCCER-RISK (Undated) _ The risk of injury in soccer may
have been downplayed, at least at the professional level, a study
published in the current issue of the British Journal of Sports
Medicine reveals. Players, the researchers found, had a 12 percent
chance of injury per game. By Paul Gains. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MAMMOGRAPHY (Undated) _ After a long delay, the Food and
Drug Administration is on the verge of issuing revised guidelines
that could enable a new generation of mammography devices to come
to the market. The devices rely on digital imaging, a technique
experts say offers clearer, more detailed pictures of some breast
tissue than traditional X-ray film. By Anne Eisenberg. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-TREADMILL (Undated) _ The success of Spinning has
spawned a new concept in exercise: Group classes are moving out of
the aerobics studio and on to the cardiovascular machines found on
the gym floor. Treadmill classes in particular are beginning to
appear on aerobics schedules all across the country. (575 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health:
</P>
<P>
   _ According to a researcher at Harvard, in any 24-hour period,
married women are 50 percent more likely to complain of being in a
bad mood than are men. The reason, he theorizes, is that married
women juggle several roles, so they encounter more opportunities
for things to go wrong in their lives. (275 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lung Health Study, which tracked 5,887 smokers, found that
those who quit put on substantially more weight in the years after
they kicked the habit _ 17 pounds for men and 19 pounds for women _
than earlier, shorter studies had indicated. (245 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Until recently, these utterances like ``uh'' and ``oh'' were
considered garbage that hindered communication. But a study due to
appear in the Journal of Memory and Language argues that the word
``oh,'' when used in the middle of a sentence, is not a bad habit,
but in fact plays a pivotal role in comprehension. (350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ When doctors put down their pens and typed prescriptions into
a terminal, serious medication errors dropped by half, researchers
at Brigham and Women's Hospital have found. (325 words)

   LONDON _ When the year 2000 computer problem gained wide
recognition a couple of years ago, the first reaction was disbelief
that a computer's inability to distinguish 2000 from 1900 could
seriously disrupt modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, companies and governments around the globe have
spent tens of billions of dollars to replace computers, rewrite
decades-old software and test their equipment and operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 400 days to go to 2000, there is a growing
realization that time is quickly running out.
</P>
<P>
   So today, governments and industry no longer talk simply about
fixing the millennium bug. They are actively preparing contingency
plans to keep vital operations going as best as they can if and
when problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, we can say with assurance there are
people who aren't going to make it,'' said Michael Powell, a
commissioner at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely past the period of where you're going to
solve the problem. We're into mitigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on anticipating failures reflects the
unprecedented nature of the year 2000 problem. The pervasiveness of
technology and the complexity of supply chains can cause problems
to cascade through the global economy, disrupting business
activity, communications and transportation networks, and basic
services like power and water.
</P>
<P>
   While multinational companies and banks appear well-prepared,
many government agencies and companies, especially small
businesses, are behind schedule or have yet to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be ready,'' said Max Rens, chief information officer of
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. But, he added, referring to Europe's
patchwork of air-traffic control systems, ``we can't fly if they
are not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps being taken range from the mundane, like restocking
forms to be able to revert to paper if computerized order systems
fail, to the strategic, such as finding alternative suppliers of
parts or stockpiling raw materials and finished goods, which
companies like Unilever are considering.
</P>
<P>
   American and British authorities are drawing up plans for police
and emergency services to respond to widespread disruptions or
civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Federal Reserve has gotten into action, ordering
the printing of an extra $50 billion of notes in case consumers
hoard cash ahead of the millennium bug weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contingency planning should be considered a legitimate
exercise and not an admission that you expect failure,'' said Roger
Ferguson, a member of the Fed's board of governors and chairman of
the presidential Year 2000 Council.
</P>
<P>
   The current state of preparedness underscores the need for
contingency arrangements. Gartner Group, a U.S. consultancy that
conducts the broadest assessment of year 2000 preparations, warned
last month that 23 percent of the companies it surveys in 87
countries had not started any work on the problem, a worrying sign,
as it takes the average medium-sized company a full 30 months to
make all its critical operations year 2000 compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner predicted that one-third to one-half of companies and
government agencies worldwide would experience a disruption to
operations severe enough to halt production or product delivery,
cause a significant loss of revenue or legal liability, or pose a
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where remedial efforts are believed to be
among the most advanced, disruptions were expected to hit as many
as 15 percent of companies and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem continues to be underestimated, and full-scale
actions to address it are only recently beginning in many
countries,'' the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development warned in a similar report.
</P>
<P>
   Half of OECD member countries have begun drawing up contingency
plans to deal with year 2000 problems, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can be sure where problems will arise or how
severe they will be, a consensus is developing that problems will
stop short of catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner predicted that 90 percent of disruptions will be
resolved within three days, and many companies are making
contingencies for relatively short disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie, which flies aircraft parts from member
companies in Britain, Germany and Spain to the consortium's final
assembly plant in Toulouse, France, is planning to stockpile one or
two weeks' worth of parts in Toulouse before Dec. 31, 1999, to
safeguard production in case Europe's skies are closed by a failure
of air-traffic control systems, according to Helga Flosdorff, the
company's year 2000 project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products group, is sitting
down with key suppliers to assess their compliance before deciding,
sometime early next year, whether to stockpile raw materials or
finished goods. But the company already is lining up backup
communications facilities with satellite companies such as Inmarsat
and Iridium, said Nick White, head of technology and
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard is considering stockpiling such vital spare
parts as rotors for its fleet, said George Naccara, the service's
chief information officer. ``We have found suppliers who have said,
`We will go out of business on Dec. 31.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also has ordered 10,000 inspection forms to be
printed in case its computerized ship-inspection system crashes,
and it is considering deploying its ships in all major U.S. ports
so their satellite communications can be used as a backup in case
telephone service breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   While anticipating technical problems is difficult, trying to
predict the behavior of consumers is even more fraught with risk.
Two Hollywood studios are believed to be preparing year 2000
disaster films for release next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired People has urged members to
have $1,000 in cash for every person in their household.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gartner, which warns against a ``bomb-shelter mentality,''
is advising people to fill their gasoline tanks, set aside two
weeks' salary in cash and stock batteries, medicines and a week's
worth of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm often asked, `Will there be a dial tone?''' said Powell of
the communications commission. His answer: ``Yes, unless you and
everyone else picks up the phone to check.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell is encouraging U.S. telephone companies to enter
mutual-assistance pacts to provide stopgap service in case of year
2000 failures. Many business executives maintain such government
efforts to ensure the reliability of power, communications and
transportation networks will be vital to preventing a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public confidence in the infrastructure will affect consumer
behavior,'' White of Unilever said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson of the Federal Reserve downplayed the prospect of
panic. While the risk of market disruption is real, he said, banks
and financial institutions have led the way in preparing for a fix
for the millennium bug. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people will believe the year 2000
disaster story any more than they believed Alfred Hitchcock,'' he
said. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ When the year 2000 computer problem gained wide
recognition a couple of years ago, the first reaction was disbelief
that a computer's inability to distinguish 2000 from 1900 could
seriously disrupt modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, companies and governments around the globe have
spent tens of billions of dollars to replace computers, rewrite
decades-old software and test their equipment and operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 400 days to go to 2000, there is a growing
realization that time is quickly running out.
</P>
<P>
   So today, governments and industry no longer talk simply about
fixing the millennium bug. They are actively preparing contingency
plans to keep vital operations going as best as they can if and
when problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, we can say with assurance there are
people who aren't going to make it,'' said Michael Powell, a
commissioner at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely past the period of where you're going to
solve the problem. We're into mitigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on anticipating failures reflects the
unprecedented nature of the year 2000 problem. The pervasiveness of
technology and the complexity of supply chains can cause problems
to cascade through the global economy, disrupting business
activity, communications and transportation networks, and basic
services like power and water.
</P>
<P>
   While multinational companies and banks appear well-prepared,
many government agencies and companies, especially small
businesses, are behind schedule or have yet to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be ready,'' said Max Rens, chief information officer of
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. But, he added, referring to Europe's
patchwork of air-traffic control systems, ``we can't fly if they
are not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps being taken range from the mundane, like restocking
forms to be able to revert to paper if computerized order systems
fail, to the strategic, such as finding alternative suppliers of
parts or stockpiling raw materials and finished goods, which
companies like Unilever are considering.
</P>
<P>
   American and British authorities are drawing up plans for police
and emergency services to respond to widespread disruptions or
civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Federal Reserve has gotten into action, ordering
the printing of an extra $50 billion of notes in case consumers
hoard cash ahead of the millennium bug weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contingency planning should be considered a legitimate
exercise and not an admission that you expect failure,'' said Roger
Ferguson, a member of the Fed's board of governors and chairman of
the presidential Year 2000 Council.
</P>
<P>
   The current state of preparedness underscores the need for
contingency arrangements. Gartner Group, a U.S. consultancy that
conducts the broadest assessment of year 2000 preparations, warned
last month that 23 percent of the companies it surveys in 87
countries had not started any work on the problem, a worrying sign,
as it takes the average medium-sized company a full 30 months to
make all its critical operations year 2000 compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner predicted that one-third to one-half of companies and
government agencies worldwide would experience a disruption to
operations severe enough to halt production or product delivery,
cause a significant loss of revenue or legal liability, or pose a
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where remedial efforts are believed to be
among the most advanced, disruptions were expected to hit as many
as 15 percent of companies and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem continues to be underestimated, and full-scale
actions to address it are only recently beginning in many
countries,'' the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development warned in a similar report.
</P>
<P>
   Half of OECD member countries have begun drawing up contingency
plans to deal with year 2000 problems, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can be sure where problems will arise or how
severe they will be, a consensus is developing that problems will
stop short of catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner predicted that 90 percent of disruptions will be
resolved within three days, and many companies are making
contingencies for relatively short disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie, which flies aircraft parts from member
companies in Britain, Germany and Spain to the consortium's final
assembly plant in Toulouse, France, is planning to stockpile one or
two weeks' worth of parts in Toulouse before Dec. 31, 1999, to
safeguard production in case Europe's skies are closed by a failure
of air-traffic control systems, according to Helga Flosdorff, the
company's year 2000 project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products group, is sitting
down with key suppliers to assess their compliance before deciding,
sometime early next year, whether to stockpile raw materials or
finished goods. But the company already is lining up backup
communications facilities with satellite companies such as Inmarsat
and Iridium, said Nick White, head of technology and
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard is considering stockpiling such vital spare
parts as rotors for its fleet, said George Naccara, the service's
chief information officer. ``We have found suppliers who have said,
`We will go out of business on Dec. 31.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also has ordered 10,000 inspection forms to be
printed in case its computerized ship-inspection system crashes,
and it is considering deploying its ships in all major U.S. ports
so their satellite communications can be used as a backup in case
telephone service breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   While anticipating technical problems is difficult, trying to
predict the behavior of consumers is even more fraught with risk.
Two Hollywood studios are believed to be preparing year 2000
disaster films for release next summer.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ According to a report before the Security Council,
23 United Nations staff members have lost their lives since July of
last year, and another 33 have been taken hostage or abducted. That
does not count the 31 killed in plane crashes. Nor does it count
locals who work for the United Nations, 60 of whom are detained or
missing.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the great silent scandals of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers, says the report, are ``threatened, robbed,
beaten, held hostage, stabbed, raped or murdered.'' It would be
hard to tell from the muted response.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are quick to protest U.N. wastage and withhold their
U.N. dues, but only 21 governments have committed themselves to the
protection of aid workers by ratifying the Convention on the Safety
of U.N. and Associated Personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The number of serious security incidents reported to the United
Nations since 1992 totals 162. Only one perpetrator has been
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of concern is less than surprising, since governments
are increasingly responsible for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers have always been an easy target. Last year, Hutu
rebels took machetes to a group of U.N. human-rights monitors near
Cyangugu in Rwanda, and left their heads on the hood of the car.
This paralyzed the monitoring mission and gave the Hutu a virtual
license to kill west of Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of savagery is almost to be expected from groups which
place themselves outside the law. Not so, one would think, with
governments. Yet this report shows clearly that more and more
would-be governments view humanitarian aid workers as legitimate
targets as they cling to power or bludgeon critics into silence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, after President Laurent Kabila of Congo
accused U.N. agencies of supporting the rebellion in the east,
UNICEF and UNHCR officials were threatened, abused and even
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One local UNICEF official, Bernard Nsabimana, remains in
detention. All UNICEF field offices are provided with post-exposure
treatment for the AIDs virus since the rape of a staff member in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, local employees of relief agencies have been
lashed for disobeying Taleban rules. International staffers were
publicly slapped and expelled for objecting to discrimination
against their women colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, Tutsi employees of the United Nations were among the
first to be killed during the 1994 genocide. Hutu employees were
among the first to be arrested, when the Tutsi took control. Many
are still in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Sudan, where U.N. officials are battling starvation
and war, the United Nations is forbidden to establish its own
communication system, which could greatly improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, scores of local employees of the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees have been detained in the
past year by Syria, Jordan and Israel. Fifteen were detained by the
Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations can do little on its own. The peacekeeping
mission in Georgia proposed to set up a 294-strong protection unit,
but this was vetoed by the two warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has set up a trust fund to pay for improved
security for relief workers, but only Norway has contributed. The
United Nations even lacks funds to hire two stress counselors for
traumatized relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   As often in the humanitarian business, there are no easy
answers. The ultimate recourse is to withdraw, as relief agencies
have done from Congo, Afghanistan and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger dilemma is whether foreign officials should demand
special protection, when those whom they have come to help are so
helpless. Many are deeply uncomfortable at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they agonize alone. There is no sense of urgency from the
U.N. Security Council, and nothing to suggest that governments will
bring those responsible to account.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for leadership from the U.N. Security Council, which
often relies on humanitarian aid workers to bail it out of hot
spots. At this rate, there will be no more relief operations for
the Council to exploit. &QL;

CYCLAMEN BRIGHTEN BOTH HOME, GARDEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I love cyclamen but need some information on how to keep them
flowering through the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cyclamen are cool-season plants with unusual waxy flowers
held on 3-to 6-inch stems above heart-shaped foliage. The leaves
often are enhanced with silver markings. The red, pink, lavender or
white blooms may continue for months, especially when temperatures
are cool and the plants are given bright, indirect light. Choose
healthy plants with numerous buds to enjoy longer flowering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florist's cyclamen
</P>
<P>
   Large-flowered florist's cyclamen (3-inch flowers) used as
houseplants will fare best in or near a window with eastern or
northern exposure _ where there is bright but indirect light. Avoid
too much direct sunlight or they may burn.
</P>
<P>
   Overwatering and overly warm temperatures spell death for
cyclamen.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overwater. Cyclamen crowns and foliage are subject to
fungal rot if too wet. Water from the bottom or water around the
crown to discourage this problem. Empty any water in the saucer
once the soil is moist. Water again when the soil is dry to the
touch, but do not let the soil get so dry that the plant wilts.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler the temperature, the better. Daytime temperatures in
the 60s and nighttime temperatures between 50 and 55 are ideal.
This means it's best not to display your cyclamen in the flow of a
heating vent or on top of the television. Occasionally place the
plants outdoors for a breath of cool, fresh air. Avoid freezing
temperatures or the flowers will be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   There are usually enough soil nutrients in the 4- and 6-inch
nursery pots to carry cyclamen for a while once you bring the
plants home. Later, make diluted applications of fertilizer every
10 days to two weeks to encourage more blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Remove faded flowers, as well as their stems, to encourage
repeat flowering. Also remove spent foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Once a plant has finished flowering and the leaves begin to
yellow, the cyclamen enters dormancy. Most gardeners toss such
plants and buy new ones the following fall or holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   But some do attempt to pull cyclamen through the summer. When
the foliage withers, move the plant to a cool, dark spot and stop
watering. In late August or early September, repot the tuber using
fresh potting soil. The top third of the tuber should be above the
soil level. Water, then move the container to a window that
receives bright light _ but avoid hot sun. The leaves will appear
before too long; the flowers in about two months.
</P>
<P>
   While florist's cyclamen are used as indoor ornamentals, they
can be used in outdoor containers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garden cyclamen
</P>
<P>
   There also are garden cyclamen that are beautiful in our winter
landscapes. These vary in size from large-flowered types to
intermediate sizes to miniatures. Large-flowered cyclamen generally
have 3-inch blooms on approximately 6-inch stems. The Laser series
is an intermediate size that works well in this area. Laser
cyclamen are approximately 4 inches tall and produce 5-inch-long
flower stems with 2-inch blooms available in numerous shades.
Miniature cyclamen are in the 4-inch height range with 3-inch-long
flower stems and 1-inch flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclamen planted in the garden _ whether in beds or containers _
can flower through late fall, winter and well into spring. Plant in
an area that receives morning sun, filtered sun or bright shade.
Plant high. A sandy loam is ideal; good drainage is a must.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet alyssum is a perfect garden companion. Cyclamen,
maidenhair fern and variegated ivy are beautiful together in
containers. &QL;

security for relief workers, but only Norway has contributed. The

BIG OBSESSION TURNS INTO TINY MUSEUM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ A few weeks ago in this space, I wrote
about how travel can help make our world seem smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie and Joe Red take that philosophy to an extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds purchased their first piece of miniature furniture 26
years ago. Bonnie explains, ``What started as a hobby turned into
an addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon they were designing and building a doll house. Equipping it
with personal mementos and gifts from friends. Making it the
centerpiece of their Arlington home.
</P>
<P>
   That was merely the beginning. They scoured North America for
other tiny treasures. Europe, too. As their collection grew to tens
of thousands of pieces, Joe designed miniature buildings _ a
schoolhouse, pharmacy, old-time barbershop, bakery, meat market _
to house them. He added paint, wallpaper, flooring and lighting.
Bonnie provided furnishings and landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Through their travels, Bonnie and Joe met others who cherish
miniatures, and they began purchasing rare finished displays _ a
Guatemalan monastery; a replica of Anne Hathaway's cottage near
Stratford-on-Avon, England; an entire European mini-village _ to
supplement their collection.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bonnie says, ``We ran out of room.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No labor involved &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for us. The Reds moved to Fredericksburg, and last month
they opened A World of Miniatures, a fascinating small museum that
allows them to share this labor of love with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't use that word `labor,' '' Joe corrects. ``That
implies work. And we don't consider this work. It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe's fun filled his spare time; only recently did he retire
from a full-time job as a computer engineer, a vocation whose
graphics elements helped provide perspective in creating an
environment one-twelfth the world's normal size.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor is hard-pressed to determine which is more impressive:
the Reds' meticulous precision or their imagination and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicholas Pharmacy and Fountain (named for Bonnie's father),
for instance, contains more than 450 medication and perfume bottles
and other miniatures. And that doesn't include hundreds of
pint-size candies that were glued together piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   The produce section at Greene's Grocery features berries, grapes
and mushrooms. Shelves are stocked with tiny containers of
Campbell's soups, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Ritz Crackers and dozens
more products. Entire flounders and haddocks could be devoured in
one bite at Captain Jack's Fish Shack. Mark's Meat Market is
equipped with working scales. And no two cakes are alike at the
Bluebonnet Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide search &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Allman Art Gallery, 15 of 20 paintings are reproductions
of famous works copied in miniature _ a remarkable accomplishment _
by U.S. and European artists. Soft lighting and mirrors create a
haunting effect.
</P>
<P>
   Where in the world do the Reds find all these itty-bitty
objects? Just about everywhere. ``We attend miniature shows in
Houston each March and in Dallas in May,'' Joe says. ``We've
traveled to almost every state. We've been to England, Scotland,
France, Italy, Switzerland, Canada. We're always looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvisation is essential. For salt-and-pepper shakers, Bonnie
and Joe use the backs of pierced earrings. A minuscule flowerpot is
a nut from Joe's toolbox. Beads are ideal for making perfume
bottles. Wax candles become cakes. Tongue depressors are shaped to
form furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you take the top off a tube of toothpaste and turn it
upside down, you've got a perfect wastebasket,'' says Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thatching'' the roof of one building in the European village
took Bonnie 40 hours. ``I can't tell you how many brooms I used to
get enough straw,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even more challenging was finding sufficient leaves for trees in
the village setting. ``But when I was shopping at Winn-Dixie, I
noticed them cleaning out the meat market, and I said, `Can I have
all that greenery?' They were throwing it out. And it was just what
we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece for a wedding-reception room also came from
Winn-Dixie. ``We needed a nice painting,'' says Bonnie, ``and when
I was looking for a sympathy card, I saw one with a pretty floral
arrangement on the front. I cut it out, and Joe framed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie and Joe credit hundreds of other miniaturists and
craftspeople with contributing to their displays. Exhibits range
from a Bavarian inn to a replica of the Vereins Kirche, a
Fredericksburg landmark directly across the street from the museum;
from a Roman colonnade to an ice-fishing shanty modeled on one in
the movie ``Grumpy Old Men;'' from an English castle to a rock shop
complete with workshop for cutting, grinding and polishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds aren't finished, either. They're hard at work building
the choir for an African-American church setting. For Christmas,
says Bonnie, ``We'll decorate the doll house, put in trees and hide
presents.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is housed in a Texas historical landmark, the
100-year-old F.W. Arhelger building at 109 N. Adams St., less than
a block from Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays. Admission is $4,
$3.50 for senior citizens, $3 for students, free for preschoolers
accompanied by an adult. Group rates are available. For more
information, call 830-990-8833 or call the Fredericksburg
Convention and Visitors Bureau at 830-997-6523 or access

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ According to a report before the Security Council,
23 United Nations staff members have lost their lives since July of
last year, and another 33 have been taken hostage or abducted. That
does not count the 31 killed in plane crashes. Nor does it count
locals who work for the United Nations, 60 of whom are detained or
missing.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the great silent scandals of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers, says the report, are ``threatened, robbed,
beaten, held hostage, stabbed, raped or murdered.'' It would be
hard to tell from the muted response.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are quick to protest U.N. wastage and withhold their
U.N. dues, but only 21 governments have committed themselves to the
protection of aid workers by ratifying the Convention on the Safety
of U.N. and Associated Personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The number of serious security incidents reported to the United
Nations since 1992 totals 162. Only one perpetrator has been
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of concern is less than surprising, since governments
are increasingly responsible for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers have always been an easy target. Last year, Hutu
rebels took machetes to a group of U.N. human-rights monitors near
Cyangugu in Rwanda, and left their heads on the hood of the car.
This paralyzed the monitoring mission and gave the Hutu a virtual
license to kill west of Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of savagery is almost to be expected from groups which
place themselves outside the law. Not so, one would think, with
governments. Yet this report shows clearly that more and more
would-be governments view humanitarian aid workers as legitimate
targets as they cling to power or bludgeon critics into silence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, after President Laurent Kabila of Congo
accused U.N. agencies of supporting the rebellion in the east,
UNICEF and UNHCR officials were threatened, abused and even
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One local UNICEF official, Bernard Nsabimana, remains in
detention. All UNICEF field offices are provided with post-exposure
treatment for the AIDs virus since the rape of a staff member in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, local employees of relief agencies have been
lashed for disobeying Taleban rules. International staffers were
publicly slapped and expelled for objecting to discrimination
against their women colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, Tutsi employees of the United Nations were among the
first to be killed during the 1994 genocide. Hutu employees were
among the first to be arrested, when the Tutsi took control. Many
are still in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Sudan, where U.N. officials are battling starvation
and war, the United Nations is forbidden to establish its own
communication system, which could greatly improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, scores of local employees of the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees have been detained in the
past year by Syria, Jordan and Israel. Fifteen were detained by the
Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations can do little on its own. The peacekeeping
mission in Georgia proposed to set up a 294-strong protection unit,
but this was vetoed by the two warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has set up a trust fund to pay for improved
security for relief workers, but only Norway has contributed. The
United Nations even lacks funds to hire two stress counselors for
traumatized relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   As often in the humanitarian business, there are no easy
answers. The ultimate recourse is to withdraw, as relief agencies
have done from Congo, Afghanistan and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger dilemma is whether foreign officials should demand

</P>
<P>
   Yet they agonize alone. There is no sense of urgency from the

the Council to exploit. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Why was Japan's artillery much more accurate than
its rifle-fire in World War II? Why do Japanese athletes, unlike
those of most other countries, perform better in trials for their
national Olympic team than in the Olympics themselves?
</P>
<P>
   According to a prominent Japanese sociologist, the answer to
both questions is the same: Japanese people do better when they are
not being observed by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The artillery was far behind the front-lines, out of sight of
the enemy, and only Japanese spectators watch Olympic trials while
the whole world watches the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The sociologist first expounded this theory in the 1970s, since
when Japan has gotten much more used to being watched by foreigners
_ especially where its economic performance is concerned. But many
Japanese manifestly feel uncomfortable under a foreign microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Since its economy began stagnating seven years ago, Japan has
endured a deluge of criticism and advice, mostly from the United
States. Recent weeks have brought more of the same, with senior
U.S. officials savaging Japanese trade policy and President Bill
Clinton delivering milder admonishments during his recent visit to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Japanese commentators now say the country's poor
economic performance, and foreign disapproval of it, are bringing
deep feelings of insecurity to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The country's reaction to foreign pressure is complex. Sometimes
Japanese officials welcome it as a way of persuading public opinion
to accept unpopular decisions; sometimes they resent it. Lately,
resentment has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly these cultural factors need to be taken into account by
foreigners seeking to influence Japanese decisions. Grating against
a culture is usually counterproductive (witness U.S. attempts to
browbeat France), and there is no point in gratuitously alienating
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there are two sides to most issues. Clinton may have a
point when he warns that the soaring Japanese trade surplus could
provoke calls for ``retaliatory protectionism'' in the United
States. But it is part of his job, not just Japan's, to keep
American protectionism at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be right that Japan has not done enough to
help its neighbors since the Asian economic crisis erupted last
year. But it was Washington that torpedoed Japan's original plans
for a big new Asian fund to help countries in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo was wrong to block further trade liberalization at the
summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this
month. But it is right to point out that fast-growing America will
inevitably suck in more imports than slow-growing Japan.
</P>
<P>
   America is perfectly entitled to ask whether the Japanese
system, so effective when Japan was catching up with the West, is
capable of dealing with current problems. But many Americans tend
to forget that Japan's values and priorities are legitimately
different from their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the Japanese will have to get used to
foreign attention. In today's interdependent world, the trend is
for the international community to intervene ever more intrusively
into what used to be regarded as a country's domestic economic and
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also nothing in Japan remotely resembling the huge
American policy-formation machine, a nexus of public and private
interests of every hue, that is constantly throwing out new
economic plans and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's third-largest economy after the United States and
the European Union, Japan must accept that its domestic policies
are a legitimate subject for foreign analysis and recommendations,
especially when they are not succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that if the Japanese find that those
recommendations clash too sharply with their culture and their
values, they should come up with more effective policies of their
own. &QL;

EUROPE'S SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP: RUSSIA AND GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's visit to Moscow
last month underscored the special relationship _ sometimes
friendly, often bitterly antagonistic _ that has bound Russia and
Germany together for three centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Geography links them in a way that cannot be undone. Just as the
Russians recognize that the United States is the world's
superpower, they know that Germany is by far their strongest
European neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has gone through many phases. The Russians
first entered the mainstream of European history by taking part in
the coalition that waged war against a German king, Frederick the
Great of Prussia, in the conflict called the Seven Years War
(1756-1763) in Europe and the French and Indian War in colonial
America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Russia's greatest sovereign, Catherine the Great, was
originally a German princess who came to that country as consort to
the czar. She later usurped the crown.
</P>
<P>
   It is now almost forgotten that in the late 19th century, the
then emperors of Germany and Russia formed an alliance to control
eastern Europe between them. Their alliance ended when Berlin chose
to support the territorial ambitions of its other ally,
Austria-Hungary, in the Balkans. It was a step that deeply offended
all Slavs, including the Russians, and eventually led to World War
I when Slavs murdered the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, the Germans have been attracted to the vast
space and natural resources of the land to their east, which is
part of Europe but somehow quite different. For Germans, Russia
will always be an enigma.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russians, even though they defeated Hitler's invading
legions in World War II, today fear and respect Germany as they do
no other nation, including their other great neighbor, China. They
are envious of Germany's industrial prowess and efficiency, which
they know they'll never be able to match.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Germans have abandoned their old dream of conquering
Russia and are content now to be simply its biggest foreign
investor, outstripping America and other industrial powers.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this is a return to the past. Traditionally, the
Germans were the leading merchants and traders of eastern Europe
long before they became jackbooted conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   It was the risk to German investments brought about by Russia's
financial turmoil that gave a sense of urgency to Schroeder's visit
and hour-long meeting with the fading Russian president, Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   However, the big German banks that are the primary investors
seem prepared to ride out the storm. For them, Russia is a good but
extremely long-term bet.

   Clearly these cultural factors need to be taken into account by
foreigners seeking to influence Japanese decisions. Grating against
a culture is usually counterproductive (witness U.S. attempts to
browbeat France), and there is no point in gratuitously alienating
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there are two sides to most issues. Clinton may have a
point when he warns that the soaring Japanese trade surplus could
provoke calls for ``retaliatory protectionism'' in the United
States. But it is part of his job, not just Japan's, to keep
American protectionism at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be right that Japan has not done enough to
help its neighbors since the Asian economic crisis erupted last
year. But it was Washington that torpedoed Japan's original plans
for a big new Asian fund to help countries in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo was wrong to block further trade liberalization at the
summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this
month. But it is right to point out that fast-growing America will
inevitably suck in more imports than slow-growing Japan.
</P>
<P>
   America is perfectly entitled to ask whether the Japanese
system, so effective when Japan was catching up with the West, is
capable of dealing with current problems. But many Americans tend
to forget that Japan's values and priorities are legitimately
different from their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the Japanese will have to get used to
foreign attention. In today's interdependent world, the trend is
for the international community to intervene ever more intrusively
into what used to be regarded as a country's domestic economic and
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also nothing in Japan remotely resembling the huge
American policy-formation machine, a nexus of public and private
interests of every hue, that is constantly throwing out new
economic plans and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's third-largest economy after the United States and
the European Union, Japan must accept that its domestic policies
are a legitimate subject for foreign analysis and recommendations,
especially when they are not succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that if the Japanese find that those
recommendations clash too sharply with their culture and their
values, they should come up with more effective policies of their
own. &QL;

Onetime glamour town of California resurges with urban renewal 
 
By MARTY RACINE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Hollywood. Beverly Hills. Palm Springs.
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach?
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Age of Celebrity the glamour capital of Southern
California was a resort town on a bay south of Los Angeles. Back in
the 1920s Long Beach had the largest motion picture studio in the
world, a boardwalk, mansions full of silent-film stars and, well, a
long beach.
</P>
<P>
   But the plot thinned. Hollywood became the leading man in
movies, Beverly Hills and Palm Springs attracted the stars, and
Long Beach returned to the real world. Long Beach discovered oil
under its skin. It built a Navy base and a commercial port. And for
half a century the second-largest city in the metropolitan Los
Angeles area was just too working-class, too secondary to be much
of a destination.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1975 the city embarked on a multibillion-dollar urban
renewal program to continue through the year 2000. It built a
sparkling Convention &AMP; Entertainment Center. It created a village,
marina and park along its shoreline and undertook the largest
waterfront redevelopment project in California history. It carved
out trails for biking, jogging and skating. It landed an aquarium,
installed nightlife downtown and rediscovered history in its parks,
ranches, canals and seaside neighborhoods. Gourmet coffee shops
filtered in from Seattle. Then came the requisite galleries,
bistros, antiques stores and museums.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery became a boutique. Long Beach became a destination.
</P>
<P>
   Now it ranks among the municipalities across America emerging
bleary-eyed from the agrarian and industrial ages knowing the old
economies don't work. Farming communities dried up. The grunt jobs
in the cities were exported to sweatshop republics that high school
seniors couldn't locate on a map. The new economies are based on
tourism _ sports, concerts, gambling, shopping, festivals, scenic
development and restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The Visitor is the new commodity. To compete, all a destination
requires is a big enough Wow Factor to blast the kids' attention
spans for more than three seconds, or long enough for Mom and Dad
to hit the casinos. Soon enough we will be the United States of
Disney, one clamoring theme park stretching from coast to coast,
with security around every corner, ushers in every doorway and
lengthy waits for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the carnival and the boosterism, some cities evoke a
sense of place. Long Beach is still a real city _ the size of Fort
Worth, it's too big to be otherwise. And as you drive down Ocean
Boulevard lined with palms and whitewashed bungalows, or fan out
across tidy rose-hedged neighborhoods or find lovers strolling down
its shores, you can't help but be charmed by its daily rhythms. For
there is, apart from the hype and headlines, a timeless California,
where the fog rolls in and by late morning surely burns off, where
desert and sea meet in a ritual pounding of the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the real Long Beach presents itself as a community secured
in time. Its population peaked after World War II, and half a
century later, having battled urban decay, there is a genteel
maturity about the city that contrasts with the tragically hip,
tongue-pierced parades up the coast in Venice and Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it has its rough spots: The shoeshine man on Pine Avenue
will warn you about the ``interior,'' and the air at the Port of
Long Beach feels a little oily, and the freeways are choked half
the time. But on the whole, when the overcast lifts to reveal a
golden go-West-young-man afternoon, as yachts drift in the Pacific
Basin and Lester Young blows wild free-form jazz on local radio
station KLON, Long Beach appears stately, even sophisticated. It's
a role any actor would covet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aquarium of the Pacific &UR;  &LR; (310 Goldenshore; call 562-590-3100;
access www.aquariumofpacific.org on the Internet; open 10 a.m.-6
p.m. daily except Christmas Day; adults, $13.95; children, $6.96;
seniors, $11.95).
</P>
<P>
   Opened this past June at a cost of $117 million, the AOP is the
latest gem to grace the crown of the downtown/harbor Queensway Bay
redevelopment project. The only aquarium anywhere to focus solely
on the world's largest ocean, its huge glass-walled tanks are home
to 10,000 specimens from three major regions: the temperate waters
of Southern and Baja California, the frigid waters of the northern
Pacific and the brilliant coral reefs of the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   Aquariums are lovely to look at, to be sure, but you can't just
jump in and go snorkeling. You can't bait a hook and cast away. For
a visceral experience aquariums rely on virtual reality. For
children of all ages there's Kid's Cove, a hands-on experience. And
suspended above the building's entry is a full-scale replica of a
blue whale, the world's largest mammal. If it were to swim away,
its tongue would weigh 5 tons, more than the body of an African
elephant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mary (1126 Queens Highway; 562-435-3511;
www.queenmary.com; open 365 days a year; tours are 9 a.m.-9 p.m.
daily; adults, $13; children, $8; seniors, $11).
</P>
<P>
   The most luxurious ocean liner ever built, the Queen Mary once
ferried the likes of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Fred Astaire,
Spencer Tracy, Lionel Barrymore, Clark Gable, David Niven, Greta
Garbo, Bob Hope and Marlene Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   Longer than the Titanic by 136 feet, the Queen embarked on her
first voyage from Southhampton, England, to New York City in 1936,
with, it is said, more art onboard than is stashed in most major
museums. During World War II it was refitted for battle and
conscripted into service. It participated in numerous allied
campaigns, and Winston Churchill made the Queen Mary his seaborne
headquarters. Nicknamed the Grey Ghost, Hitler put a bounty on it,
offering the equivalent of $50,000 to any submarine that could sink
it. But the liner was so swift it couldn't be caught, and it never
had to fire any of its guns in anger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 the city of Long Beach purchased the Queen Mary and
docked it in Long Beach Harbor for use as a tourist attraction and
hotel. Its first-class cabins were converted into hotel rooms (many
with lovely porthole views of downtown Long Beach). Meeting rooms
were turned into catering and banquet rooms, and a wedding chapel
was added, which hosts hundreds of nuptial ceremonies a year.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of the Queen Mary parallels the Southern
California economy. In the recession of the early 1990s the hotel
closed, and pigeons roosted in the hallways. When it reopened in
1992 the operation lost $4.2 million. By July 1994, expenses no
longer exceeded income. In 1995, the ship made a little money, and
last year it raked in $26 million in tours and hotel stays.
</P>
<P>
   All right, the Queen Mary didn't hit an iceberg, and if you must
gawk at a disaster there's a Titanic exhibit near the front
entrance. But for tourists and hotel guests alike, the Queen
presents a living history. There are authentic replications of such
cruiseline amenities as a barber shop, gymnasium and pharmacy, and
table settings for dining passengers are re-created.
</P>
<P>
   Elegance still reigns in the Queen's Salon, which presents
ballroom dancing on Tuesdays; in Sir Winston's restaurant, which
requires proper attire and offers ocean vistas; and at the Art Deco
Observation Bar, formerly the first class lounge, which recalls a
classy, bygone era. Order a martini or something, not Fizz Lite
beer.
</P>
<P>
   There are airy, wood-planked decks, dim stairwells and romantic,
somewhat musty hallways _ just the odors and the lighting exude
character.
</P>
<P>
   True believers among hotel guests might chance a late-night
stroll, for ghosts are rumored to roam the decks. Famous psychics
have even claimed to hear them. ``Some of my staff said they saw a
woman dressed in black walk into my office and thought I'd come to
work, because I wear black a lot,'' said Lovetta Kramer, director
of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they walked in, and no one was there. I said, `See, I'm
always watching you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Scorpion (1126 Queens Highway).
</P>
<P>
   This 300-foot diesel ``Foxtrot-Class'' submarine served in the
Soviet Navy from 1972 to 1994 and carried 22 torpedoes. Berthed
next to the Queen Mary in a ``wealth and stealth'' tour package,
the Scorpion will be here for the next five years. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Why was Japan's artillery much more accurate than
its rifle-fire in World War II? Why do Japanese athletes, unlike
those of most other countries, perform better in trials for their
national Olympic team than in the Olympics themselves?
</P>
<P>
   According to a prominent Japanese sociologist, the answer to
both questions is the same: Japanese people do better when they are
not being observed by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The artillery was far behind the front-lines, out of sight of
the enemy, and only Japanese spectators watch Olympic trials while
the whole world watches the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The sociologist first expounded this theory in the 1970s, since
when Japan has gotten much more used to being watched by foreigners
_ especially where its economic performance is concerned. But many
Japanese manifestly feel uncomfortable under a foreign microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Since its economy began stagnating seven years ago, Japan has
endured a deluge of criticism and advice, mostly from the United
States. Recent weeks have brought more of the same, with senior
U.S. officials savaging Japanese trade policy and President Bill
Clinton delivering milder admonishments during his recent visit to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Japanese commentators now say the country's poor
economic performance, and foreign disapproval of it, are bringing
deep feelings of insecurity to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The country's reaction to foreign pressure is complex. Sometimes
Japanese officials welcome it as a way of persuading public opinion
to accept unpopular decisions; sometimes they resent it. Lately,
resentment has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly these cultural factors need to be taken into account by
foreigners seeking to influence Japanese decisions. Grating against
a culture is usually counterproductive (witness U.S. attempts to
browbeat France), and there is no point in gratuitously alienating
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there are two sides to most issues. Clinton may have a
point when he warns that the soaring Japanese trade surplus could
provoke calls for ``retaliatory protectionism'' in the United
States. But it is part of his job, not just Japan's, to keep
American protectionism at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be right that Japan has not done enough to
help its neighbors since the Asian economic crisis erupted last
year. But it was Washington that torpedoed Japan's original plans
for a big new Asian fund to help countries in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo was wrong to block further trade liberalization at the
summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this
month. But it is right to point out that fast-growing America will
inevitably suck in more imports than slow-growing Japan.
</P>
<P>
   America is perfectly entitled to ask whether the Japanese
system, so effective when Japan was catching up with the West, is
capable of dealing with current problems. But many Americans tend
to forget that Japan's values and priorities are legitimately
different from their own.

interests of every hue, that is constantly throwing out new
economic plans and ideas.

<P>
   It's referred to by its code name, Scorpion, because its
official moniker, Povodnaya Lodka B-427, which is, well _ imagine
Dad saying to the family, ``Hey, guys let's go visit the Puv ...
odd ... Pavarotti Vodka Before!''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are first advised to consult their claustro-meters. The
Scorpion is a closet-size, gizmo-crammed chamber through which one
negotiates using pull bars and nimble leg-work. If you feel
trapped, just remind yourself it's only a visit. And you're not
underwater. At one time, 78 Russian sardines coexisted in this tin
can.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rancho Los Alamitos Historic Ranch and Gardens &UR;  &LR; (6400 Bixby Hill
Road; 562-431-3541; tours are1-5 p.m. Wednesdays-Sundays. Admission
is free. Group reservations should be made two weeks in advance).
</P>
<P>
   This ranch echoes with the history of Native America and Spanish
and Mexican California.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning there was the arid, wind-swept mesa and the
American Indian village of Puvungna, a sacred place that existed
around A.D. 500. In 1790 it comprised the largest land grant ever
from the Spanish crown, 300,000 acres given to soldier Manuel
Nieto.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, property disputes with nearby missions and the
concept of eminent domain by Cal State-Long Beach and other
institutions reduced the Alamitos site to 7 { acres. In 1968 the
parcel was donated to the city of Long Beach. Today it is operated
by a nonprofit foundation, with 130 volunteers and a paid staff of
nine.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds are kept as historically correct as possible _ down
to the rose hybrids from the 1920s. Even a damaged sundial was
rebuilt with the help of computer generated graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The guided tour features the rustic adobe ranch house with its
sturdy walls and old-fashioned furniture and appliances. One of the
few remaining two-story adobes in Southern California, it began as
a rudimentary outpost shelter for the ``vaqueros'' working Nieto's
open range and evolved into a home and Long Beach social center.
Behind the hacienda are the working-ranch barns, stables, bunks and
blacksmith shop standing from the ownership of cattleman Fred Bixby
in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Self-guided tours free you to wander the four acres of famous
gardens developed by Bixby's wife, Florence. Created in an era of
flamboyant regional horticulture, her gardens are instead prized
for their cool, restrained beauty. They were not planted for show
but for repose, for use by friends and family. And at every turn a
new garden envelopes you, such as the geranium walk, rose garden,
olive patio, rock waterway, cactus garden and the oleander walk.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hacienda or out in the garden, one senses the
continuum of history. With that, it's easy to beam yourself back to
a more serene, if hardscrabble, environment. ``Teeming with people,
it still feels like a special place,'' says C.J. Derby, director of
public relations. ``You can have 2,000 people on the site, and you
still feel like you have your own space.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   El Dorado Nature Center &UR;  &LR; (7550 E. Spring St.; 562-570-1771;
trail tours are 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesdays-Sundays; the museum and
bookstore are open 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays and 8:30 a.m.-4
p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. Entrance to the nature center is free,
but vehicle entry into the surrounding El Dorado East Regional Park
is $3 weekdays and $5 weekends and holidays).
</P>
<P>
   Alert to stressed-out residents of the modern world: This is
high-trek, not high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Set amid the urban sprawl is a Long Beach retreat: El Dorado
East Regional Park and its 102-acre centerpiece, the El Dorado
Nature Center. The complex is so massive it shouldn't be in a city.
But this is where it is needed. The nature center sponsors numerous
educational outreach programs. The park participates in Discover
Long Beach Parks, an adopt-a-park program designed for
third-graders that has been credited with reducing vandalism,
graffiti and gang activity.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a former flood plain of the San Gabriel River, the
nature center has walking trails winding around two lakes and a
stream in a dense forest of oak, pine, sycamore and redwood. Keen
observance might yield foxes, weasels, herons, egrets, hawks,
rabbits, possums and turtles.
</P>
<P>
   The two-mile dirt trail has an optional switchback that cuts it
in half. For even shorter jaunts there is a paved quarter-mile
trail that brushes against an open butterfly garden; recovering
stroke patients frequently take their daily constitutionals here.
</P>
<P>
   To begin your walk, stop. Take a deep breath. Take another. It
will calm the mind and clear your senses, senses that have been
dulled by tailgating through life on a treadmill. Here, the ears
are critical, for the brush rustles with critters, and the eyes
follow. Not to worry, though; unlike refuges in Texas, there are no
alligators or venomous serpents.
</P>
<P>
   Don't strive for absolute silence, however, or you'll notice the
high-tension lines humming and the jets roaring at Long Beach
International.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe we can't completely go back to the garden. But we
try, for we deny nature at our peril. The woods hone our survival
instincts, sharpening our entire being. You can achieve that by
walking in a bad part of town, but this is prettier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belmont Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Once an expanse of ocean wetlands, Belmont Shore was still a
marsh when real estate agents got in the act in the 1920s. But it
grew into a quintessential Southern California seaside community,
with sandy beaches, boardwalks, apartments named La Contessa and
Ocean Bliss, and immaculately maintained bungalows. There are rose
gardens, white picket fences, archways, red-tiled roofs _ lovely
stuccoed homes built prior to the new architectural behemoths that
scream, ``I'm rich, and you're not!''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Belmont Shore and its main thoroughfare of Second Street
are lined with boutiques, cafes and upscale emporiums _ the
proverbial shopper's paradise in a bastion of breezy
intellectualism, like the Rice Village with a nautical flair. The
people watching isn't bad, either, because Californians don't age.
There is a shoe store named Runner's High, a restaurant that serves
lobster burritos and a Mexican grill that advertises, ``No
microwaves, no can openers, no lard, no freezers, no MSG.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Shore is not above whimsy. If you see a parking meter
casting a ``shadow'' in the form of a pelican don't rub your eyes;
it's only part of a public art project.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shoreline Village.
</P>
<P>
   Located near downtown and on the water, Shoreline Village is a
contrived ``New England-style'' shopping and dining complex.
Despite the affectations, the location is attractive and the dining
excellent. Check out the Yard House, with over 250 brands of beer
on tap and an inventive menu. Parker's Lighthouse is famed for its
seafood.
</P>
<P>
   For families, there's a concentration of the keep-busys: a
virtual reality booth in the EcoPark educational center, outdoor
food vendors, harbor cruises and surrey tours of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pine Avenue (downtown).
</P>
<P>
   It's not the French Quarter or Greenwich Village. Pine Avenue,
which slices through the heart of downtown, is more trendy than
bohemian. But it's hip enough, with nightclubs, delis, sidewalk
cafes and art galleries, to qualify as a magnet for
action-seekers. &QL;

   It is only being faithful to its history. For decades Pine was
the city's premier business and social district, linking downtown
shopping with the famous Pike Amusement Park on the water. Grand
hotels, like the Virginia, drew world travelers, and on New Year's
Eve 1961 the Beach Boys made their first public appearance at the
foot of Pine in Municipal Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   But the street deteriorated as business fled to the suburbs, and
the amusement park lost its lure to Disneyland. In the 1960s, '70s
and '80s, the area was dead. Then the city stepped in with a
revitalization plan. Recently it has paid dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, winos were sleeping in the doorway,'' said
shoeshine man Jimmie Brown working Pine between 2nd and 3rd
streets. ``It was full of panhandlers, dope addicts and homeless.
It was real sad in the '80s. This was a Navy town. The city had to
transform it from a Navy town into something else. So they started
by cleaning up these two blocks _ reclaimed them, that is.''

   Gondola Getaway (5437 E. Ocean Blvd. behind Leeway Sailing;
562-433-9595; rides are $55 a couple and $10 for each additional
person and include a complementary basket of bread, salami, cheese,
wine glasses and an ice bucket. Tours are 11 a.m.-11 p.m. daily and
are conducted year-round. Reservations are advised.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not Venice (Italy), but there can be few more romantic
European-like excursions in the New World than the Gondola Getaway,
a one-hour glide through the canals of picturesque Naples Island.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a bottle of your favorite (California) wine and relax as
the gondola drifts around three islands connected by automobile
bridges and adorned with some of Long Beach's most interesting
homes. One, the Hershey House, was built in 1921, about the time
the canals were dredged.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old operation owns a fleet of eight gondolas, some
designed for groups. But this is best appreciated by lovers and
other strangers; many wedding proposals have been issued in these
gondolas.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, some gondoliers will even croon Italian love
songs. ``People kept on asking me if I'd sing,'' said one. ``I said
`I'm sorry.' Finally I went out and bought some sheet music.''
</P>
<P>
   Though tours are offered throughout the day, the best cruising
hours are at dusk, when the fading sunlight splinters over the
water, the imagination stirs and island residents are likely to be
at home. Some might be swimming in the canal, others might shout
greetings _ in Italian, of course.

   Long Beach Museum of Art Summer Concert Series (2300 E. Ocean
Blvd.; 562-439-2119; 7 p.m. Wednesdays during the summer; $9 for
members, $12 for nonmembers.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, the appreciation of art can get a little stuffy.
In the summer check the breeze in the Museum of Art's sculpture
garden atop a knoll overlooking the Pacific. On Wednesday evenings
the museum presents concerts that will appeal to anybody but snobs.
This year, the series' 14th, the eclectic list of invitees included
Tex-Mex legend Little Joe, Kansas City bluesman Jimmy Cheatham, big
band leader Eddie Reed, alternative country band the Derailers,
funkster Leo Necentelli, Afro-Cuban group Charanga Cubana and
roots-rocker Dave Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the down-home mix, this is a first-class BYOB. The
ladies and gentlemen arrive balancing armloads of the essentials
for a true concert experience: short-legged lawn chairs, picnic
baskets and bottles of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon. To be
imbibed from long-stemmed glasses, natch.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Charanga Cubana, a couple of guys are sitting
on the lawn playing chess. A woman is yakking on the phone even as
the cha-cha-cha beat dances past her. Little children are drawing
in coloring books, doing their own thing. And when one couple
unfolds the linen tablecloth and spreads the basil dip, bread
sticks and broccoli florets, you know you've arrived at the end of
the continent.

GOV. BUSH STILL DEFINING `COMPASSIONATE?' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Politicians, it seems, are constantly in search of the
perfect buzz word or memorable phrase that will keep them near and
dear to the hearts, minds or whatever else prompts voters to put
and keep them in public office.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush advocated a ``kinder, gentler''
America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his eldest son, George W. Bush, the hugely popular governor
of Texas who is being effusively touted in the Texas and national
media as the next president, is eagerly embracing the
``compassionate conservative'' label.
</P>
<P>
   As with all labels, we should be wary of this one until we see
how the governor continues to define it through his actions in his
second term. Of particular importance will be his role as the state
continues to grapple with welfare reform, an area that needs a
large dose of compassion in the true meaning of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't invent the ``compassionate conservative'' phrase. A
long string of other Republicans with varying reputations have been
laying claim to it for years.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole called himself a ``compassionate conservative'' in the
months before he lost the 1988 Republican presidential nomination
to the Texas governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Wilson won the governorship of California in 1990,
campaigning as a ``compassionate conservative,'' and then, a few
years later, adopted a hard line against impoverished immigrants
seeking a better life _ but overwhelming the financial resources _
in his state.
</P>
<P>
   Even Newt Gingrich has tried to wear the label.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently is trying to distinguish himself from the
``take-no-prisoners,'' social conservative agenda that has
dominated so much of Republican Party politics in recent years
before sputtering in the recent congressional elections, resulting
in Gingrich's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush occasionally tosses a bone to that wing of the party,
which, he knows, can help scuttle a race for the GOP nomination for
the White House. He opposes abortion rights, for example, and will
even say so if someone asks him. But he has never been very
comfortable with the far right.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has been enormously successful. He was re-elected
with 69 percent of the Texas vote and helped Republicans capture
every statewide office for the first time in modern history. His
message of lower taxes, welfare reform and improved educational
opportunities clearly appealed to a wide mainstream of Texas
voters, including many minority Texans who usually don't vote for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican governors and gubernatorial candidates in other
states enjoyed similar, if less spectacular, successes while their
more obviously partisan GOP colleagues in Congress were suffering
setbacks on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP governors believe their electoral successes were derived
from their pragmatic, businesslike approach to tackling the same
``mainstream'' issues that Bush has identified. At least that was
the message they delivered at their recent national conference in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that Bush and other Republican governors have
been seeking ``moderate'' solutions to crucial pocketbook issues
that are of far more importance to the average American than any
amount of ideological ranting or hot button-pushing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could be classified as a ``moderate'' Republican. But the
Texas governor quickly spit out that adjective when a reporter
suggested it at the New Orleans meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Being labeled a ``moderate'' is only slightly less distasteful
for a potential Republican presidential candidate than being called
a ``bleeding heart.''
</P>
<P>
   By calling himself a ``compassionate conservative'' instead,
Bush is trying to appeal to all stripes of Republicans,
independents and even some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to reconcile the ``compassionate'' part of
Bush's self-proclaimed label with some of the new welfare reforms
the governor proposed during his re-election campaign. Particularly
disturbing is his proposal to cut off welfare payments to children
if their parents refuse to work, as required by state and federal
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists the sanction, designed to help end the welfare
cycle, would prove more ``compassionate'' in the long run. And, he
says, the children would still be eligible for food stamps and
Medicaid benefits.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that poor people must be moved from the
welfare rolls to jobs. But making a child, whose existence is
already pretty close to hand-to-mouth, suffer for the sins of a
wayward parent is hardly ``compassionate.''

   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer
resources in defense, diplomacy and development. But the demands
upon us have not lessened. The patterns of world affairs shift with

<P>
   Documents relating to diplomacy in Bosnia _ including Richard
Holbrooke's memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996

aggressive fantasies toward one another can be rechanneled but
never eliminated. The world scene will always be populated by
states led by the occasional Mobutu, Milosevic or Saddam. Even if
the democratic, feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a
zone of peace where struggles are more economic than military, it
will still have to deal with those parts of the world run by young,

every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a profit but

CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet technology,

for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to America's
Cold War allies.

 AMERICA FELL SHORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
 
 &HT;    The following op-ed-length articles from the November/December
'98 issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS, described in more detail below, have
moved on the wire _ in the ``k'' and ``a'' category codes _ from
The New York Times Syndicate.
 &HT;    _ They are also available in full-text versions, which range
from 2,500 to 6,000 words. _ By Ruth Wedgwood  
 &HT;    (1,200 words) An historic opportunity to shape the International
Criminal Court in America's image was lost. What the world has
instead is a court America cannot agree to _ at least not until its
good faith has been tested over years.

senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.)

 ISRAEL AFTER HEROISM  
 By Eliot A. Cohen  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) Above all, the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in 1995 struck a blow at a major Israeli myth _ that no
matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade its politics, in
the end these are merely words, and the nation will stand together.

 THE IMF DID NOT PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE  
 By David D. Hale  
 &HT;    (1,400 words) Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were
imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

 GEORGE BUSH PUBLISHES MEMOIRS of HISTORIC ERA  
 By Michael Howard  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) No one is under oath when writing their memoirs,
but the joint account by former President George Bush and his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials
than most. By the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so
fast that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the
United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and
manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a
vision of a new world order.

 NATIONS HATE TO SAY `SORRY'  
 By Nicholas D. Kristof  
 &HT;    (1,500 words) Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing
at the start and end of every conversation and many times in
between _ which makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even
more remarkable. If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a
nuisance, even when they are not, why will they not show regret for
the slaughter of millions?

<TEXT>
<P>
   (1,450 words) The United States was built by immigrants who

past. By now, this attitude should be history, but it's not.

RETAILER'S CATALOG TACKLES NEW SOCIAL ISSUE: DISABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The young cover model has spiked hair, Down
syndrome and a wonderful blue turtleneck emblazoned with the word
LOVE. In another brilliant photograph, a boy with cerebral palsy
wears a beautiful brown sweater as he communicates with his
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Is this 98-page catalog, showing the fall/winter line for
Benetton, the Italian apparel retailer, cynicism and exploitation
run amok? Or is it the liberation of stereotypes about the
developmentally disabled?
</P>
<P>
   This much is true: Raising questions, social conscience and
emotions is the way of Benetton's unusual and provocative branding
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, the company has used the photography and art
direction of Oliviero Toscani to create a sociopolitical brand
image that denounces intolerance. Many images have struck many
people as gratuitously offensive. Examples: a man dying of AIDS, a
nun and priest kissing, a condom placed over the Obelisk in Paris,
a black horse mounting a white horse.
</P>
<P>
   Toscani explains that the horses ``oblige us to reflect on a
principle we often forget: that which is natural is never vulgar.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism notwithstanding, Benetton's revenues and net profits
have grown steadily through the decade in the 120 countries where
it has a presence. It had $2 billion in sales in 1997, a 13 percent
increase in Europe, up 11 percent in the Americas and down 11
percent in Asia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Its strategy in the United States has been to reduce the number
of stores from 600 _ when the company went public in 1986 _ to 200
today, but increasing their size.
</P>
<P>
   In those stores, consumers will find the new fall/winter
catalog, which, in fact, is not a catalog: There are no prices, no
codes, no way to order any of the clothes worn by the children
photographed with their families and teachers and staff at their
school, St. Valentin Institute in the Bavarian Alps of Germany.
Benetton calls it ``an image booklet'' that is free and has been
extremely popular at Benetton stores since it was released last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Toscani is not on Benetton's executive staff but is given
artistic license through a contract with Luciano Benetton,
president of the Benetton Group. Benetton founded the company with
brothers Gilberto and Carlo, and sister Giuliana in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The faces of the children in Toscani's photographs reflect the
same joy and curiosity and melancholy of any child, and lead people
to ``not pity but respect'' others who are different, said Millie
Olson of Amazon Advertising in San Francisco. She found the book a
bold detour from advertising's overworked and often narrow
boundaries of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is willing to do the socially responsible thing,''
said Lynda Pearson, Olson's Amazon colleague, ``and thank God for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The children of St. Valentin are the centerpiece of an $82
million worldwide fall/winter advertising campaign, including U.S.
fashion magazines. There's no question that selling goods has a
role in the campaign. But is this campaign righteous?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pictures that speak of a world with no defenses, no
limits, no preconceptions,'' said Toscani, who, in the 1970s and
1980s, did conventional fashion photography and catalog work. ``I
chose these children, these young people, these families, because
they are beautiful in the purest sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Toscani long ago broadened his definition of beauty. Last year's
Benetton image booklet was titled ``Enemies,'' in which friendly
Israelis and Palestinians _ some of them lovers _ were photographed
in colorful Benetton clothes. On the cover, a Bedouin and an
Israeli kissed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, Toscani has assembled provocative ads and placed
them within the covers of the Benetton magazine ``Colors,'' which
contains no ads for the retailer but is devoted to stories about
race, war, AIDS and a host of other social issues. It is published
six times a year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year's Benetton booklet, called ``the Sunflowers,'' has
resonance among parents of disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva Peare of Lafayette, Calif., whose son, Garrison, 6, has
Down syndrome, said she saw only love in the 98 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells about the children and their families and you get a
sense of the individual versus the disability, and that is what we
all strive for,'' Peare said. ``A lot of times people will say,
`Oh, you have a kid with Down's, and they are so loving.' They just
give a generalization and they do not try to get to know my son as
a person who has his own likes and dislikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Including disabled children in society, advertising included, is
good for all of us, said Dr. William Cohen, director of the Child
Development Unit and Down Syndrome Center at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important issue is that if we make believe that people
with differences do not exist, it certainly makes it harder for
them to live their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sesame Street' recognized this 20 years ago and began
including children with a whole variety of differences. Believe me,
parents of children with learning problems and physical
disabilities want their children in the community,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled children, said Salt Lake City pediatrician Louis
Borgenicht, are not like every other child. ``The degree to which
they are set apart depends on the individual who is perceiving what
they are doing,'' he said. As he looked at the catalog, he said he
thought not about what the children wore, ``but who these kids are
and how we view them socially.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Borgenicht added, ``I flip-flop on thinking it's
exploitative. I'm torn a little. It raises questions I'm not
prepared to answer. But that's good.''

   NEW YORK _ George Soros, the greatest speculator of the age,
admitted in a book published worldwide Sunday that putting his
funds' money into Russia was ``the worst investment of my
professional career'' and warned that the world is heading into a
depression unless international finance is reformed soon.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Crisis of Global Capitalism,'' Soros has put together
many of his observations of recent years in a book that amounts to
a wake-up call from a man who knows his subject firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   This year the value of the Soros funds dropped from about $22
billion to $18 billion _ half of the losses vanished in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the book consists of his diary of how he tried to
prevent the August financial meltdown in Moscow, an experience that
he concedes demonstrated to him the difficulty of reconciling his
role as an investor with his efforts to help make Russia a
democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks neither sympathy nor redress for his losses, only a new
and more stable order for global finance, despite the fact that
less volatility would mean fewer opportunities for speculators like
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prevent the global capitalist system from destroying
itself,'' he writes. It is as if Joseph P. Kennedy had demanded
stock-market regulation during the Roaring Twenties _ or, if Soros
is right, just before the crash of 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is devoted to an attack on what he calls the
dogma of ``market fundamentalism'' underlying the structure of the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   At times he overstates the obvious, most notably in a lengthy
explanation of his favorite market theory of ``reflexivity,'' which
boils down to the observation that the thoughts and statements of
market players can affect the market.
</P>
<P>
   His definition of this unsurprising theory: ``Facts can be
influenced by making statements about them.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when enough people chant the mantra of ``the magic
of the marketplace,'' Soros warns, this helps create the mass
delusion that the market solves all problems, whereupon people like
him bet that the herd will eventually stumble and he then picks up
the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He explains how his theories have helped make this contrarian
rich, but lest he give away Soros Fund Management's crown jewels,
he cites few examples beyond his already well-documented
billion-dollar profit on the 1992 fall of the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   In the present crisis, he argues that more information for
lenders is not sufficient because markets are inherently unstable _
and ``how much instability can society take?''
</P>
<P>
   Soros proposes a carrot-and-stick combination that would help
guarantee loans to countries that disclose their full balance
sheets and penalize banks that ignored warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having the International Monetary Fund serve as the
multinational banks' debt collector from devastated borrowers in
the developing world, the banks would have to swallow some of their
losses by turning bad debts into equity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the IMF's lending capacity would be increased
by issuing Special Drawing Rights to fill the financial hole
created by a default. The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, is an
artificial IMF reserve currency that central banks can cash in for
dollars and other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   This complex plan would be institutionalized by an International
Credit Insurance Corporation with access to all information about
outstanding loans, public and private, carried by borrowers and
lenders alike.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation would then decide what proportion of a loan to
guarantee at preferential interest rates. Foreign banks and
bondholders would be at risk for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that lenders could no longer count on IMF bailouts,
Soros argues, would put a powerful tool in the hands of the IMF and
``avoid excesses in either direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's publishing history demonstrates the public lack of
urgency about the problem. Originally contracted to Random House
for an advance of $50,000, a draft of the book was delivered this
summer to the publisher, which had recently been bought by
Bertelsmann AG of Germany. Soros urged Random House to move up the
publishing date from early 1999 to the autumn of this year.
</P>
<P>
   After Random House refused, the author went to PublicAffairs, a
small, new, and aggressive house, which shipped copies to U.S.
bookstores within two months of receiving his manuscript on Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, PublicAffairs sold the international rights for
$900,000, splitting the money in the traditional ratio of 75-25
between author and publisher in a financial coup worthy of, well,
George Soros. &QL;

   SCI-ALZHEIMERS (New York) _ Scientists at New York University
Medical Center spent three days exploring the brain of the writer

a very early age. By Marion Roach. (1725 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SCIENTISTS-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Hollywood's treatment of
scientists is out of sync with that of the press, which generally
presents scientists as articulate people making important
discoveries. So now, efforts are being mounted to get Hollywood to
portray scientists in a more realistic light, as people with more
complex drives and emotions. These efforts also aim at getting
Hollywood to portray the process of scientific inquiry itself. But,
it's a hard sell. By Andrew Pollack. (1880 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEANDERTHAL-DIET (Undated) _ In a study already drawing the
fire of controversy, an American geographer has pointed out
evidence suggesting, in his view, that little more than the amount
of iodine in their diets may have been responsible for the physical
differences between Neanderthals and modern humans and that this
might solve the mystery of what happened to the Neanderthals. By
John Noble Wilford. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EMBRYOS-COMPETE (Undated) _ Evolutionary theorists are
scratching their heads over a new experiment on the breeding
characteristics of a rare species of monogamous mice. The
experiment has cast surprising doubt on a controversial, but highly
successful idea, namely that of a competition between embryos in
the womb and their mother, fueled by a kind of molecular arms race
between the sexes. By Gina Kolata. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: Do the terms
snake, viper and serpent have scientific differences? (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ION-PROPULSION (Undated) _ After more than a month of
lurching through space in fits and starts, an experimental
spacecraft crammed with new technologies has begun to cruise away
from Earth, driven by a recently revived ion propulsion engine
taken from science fiction. By Warren E. Leary. (980 words)
</P>

   SCI-SHUTTLE (Undated) _ People in the eastern third of the
United States will be able to see the space shuttle within a few
minutes of its launching. By Joe Rao. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SAGAN-LEGACY (Undated) _ When Dr. Carl Sagan died two years
ago this month at age 62, most eulogies focused on his career in
popularizing science and conveying the wonders of the universe to
millions of people. But in addition to his celebrity, or perhaps
even despite it, Dr. Sagan was a serious and gifted researcher who
pushed back the frontiers of planetary science, molded a number of
gifted students and wielded great influence behind the scenes in
Washington. By William J. Broad. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on a new
test to tell if old pottery held milk; ways of dating earthquakes
with cosmic rays; sniffing out termites because they smell like
moth balls; dead and dying salamanders. (666 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-UMBILICAL-BLOOD (Undated) _ Should parents pay a blood bank
to store the blood from their newborn baby's umbilical cord and
placenta, in case that child or another family member ever needs it
to treat cancer or leukemia? Expectant parents are being urged to
do so by companies that have sprung up during the past few years to
sell cord-blood banking as a form of ``biological insurance''
against such dreaded diseases. By Denise Grady. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fitness and Health &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Diet plays an important role in the
prevention of cancer, including breast cancer. The American Cancer
Society estimates that diet is a primary factor in a third of
cancer deaths. But pop science that holds that fish oils, for
example, ``prevent'' cancer just doesn't hold up under scrutiny. By
Jane E. Brody. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SOCCER-RISK (Undated) _ The risk of injury in soccer may
have been downplayed, at least at the professional level, a study
published in the current issue of the British Journal of Sports
Medicine reveals. Players, the researchers found, had a 12 percent
chance of injury per game. By Paul Gains. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MAMMOGRAPHY (Undated) _ After a long delay, the Food and
Drug Administration is on the verge of issuing revised guidelines
that could enable a new generation of mammography devices to come
to the market. The devices rely on digital imaging, a technique
experts say offers clearer, more detailed pictures of some breast
tissue than traditional X-ray film. By Anne Eisenberg. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-TREADMILL (Undated) _ The success of Spinning has
spawned a new concept in exercise: Group classes are moving out of
the aerobics studio and on to the cardiovascular machines found on
the gym floor. Treadmill classes in particular are beginning to
appear on aerobics schedules all across the country. (575 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health:
</P>
<P>
   _ According to a researcher at Harvard, in any 24-hour period,
married women are 50 percent more likely to complain of being in a
bad mood than they Y-chromosomed counterparts. The reason, he
theorizes, is that married women juggle several roles, so they
encounter more opportunities for things to go wrong in their lives.
(275 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lung Health Study, which tracked 5,887 smokers, found that
those who quit put on substantially more weight in the years after
they kicked the habit _ 17 pounds for men and 19 pounds for women _
than earlier, shorter studies had indicated. (245 words)
</P>
<P>

 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend returned a book I'd lent her three years ago. It was
``The Messies Manual,'' one of a series Sandra Felton does so well,
the verbal equivalent of a week in boot camp for bad housekeepers.
I tried to stick it back on the shelf, but it clung to my fingers
for dear life and was grunting, ``Read me, read me,'' as it
wrestled me onto the couch.
</P>
<P>
   I'd already completed my entire fall cleaning. I'd finally
gotten rid of the pantry moths that spent an entire summer in my
house. I'd moved my winter clothes into my closet and organized the
upstairs hall closet. I was ready to move on with my life, when
that darn book started whispering, ``little minutes, little
minutes,'' like I really cared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little minutes'' is Felton's technique for breaking the habit
of making messes. It sounds simple. Placing something in a cabinet?
Wipe off the fingerprints. Brushing your teeth? Clean off the
counter. Putting away the laundry? Take a few ``little minutes'' to
straighten the drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Voila! No need for a cleaning marathon. None of this
it's-such-a-mess-I-don't-know-where-to-start. Everything that was
once neat and clean stays that way. No more lost checkbooks or
jumbled papers, dirty dishes in the sink, or clothes on the floor.
You just tidy up as you go along and before you know it, your house
is manageable and, even better, your life is in order at last.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to
sell you ...
</P>
<P>
   But I did believe Sandra Felton, who confesses to having once
been a major messie herself. I loved how orderly my house felt and
I wanted to reform. I didn't want to wake up in a day or two and
find that Hurricane Linda had struck again, dirtied things and
failed to clean them, taken things out and not put them back, used
things and left them where they didn't belong and couldn't be
found. Could my housekeeping actually be turned around in just a
few ``little minutes'' a day?
</P>
<P>
   A week later: The house is still neat, but I'm a wreck. Constant
straightening does the trick, but I'm finding that Felton's little
minutes stretch out like hours for someone who's used to leaping
ahead to the next thing on her mind. I'm usually ready to head off
to aerobics class right after breakfast, but like a fly in
molasses, now I'm stuck. I can't leave until the dishes are in the
dishwasher, the milk is in the refrigerator, and the oatmeal and
brown sugar are back on the shelf. Clean-up feels endless when I'm
raring to go and there are still a few malicious crumbs on the
counter, thumbing their nose at me.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments I doubt I'll ever get out the door again.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem. One little minute leads to a myriad
others, at least at the beginning. For example, for most of my life
I've simply gotten out of my car, taking a few things with me.
Inside the house I usually drop them on the counter in the hall and
tend to whatever task is before me. Now I carefully clean out the
car and when I get inside, I concentrate on putting everything
away.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened one day. First I put the Scotch tape I'd
bought up in my office. I took a few little minutes to organize the
basket that holds Scotch tape and stuff. Then I filed the papers
I'd photocopied, taking more little minutes to straighten out the
papers in that one file. When I went to put away a shirt I'd
purchased, I took quite a few little minutes to hang all my
turtlenecks next to each other. I was putting away groceries, using
up more precious minutes wiping refrigerator shelves, when my
husband showed up, expecting to eat dinner.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't believe his nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Felton says it gets easier. I believe her, even though she's
never set foot in our attic or Jack's workroom, two domestic black
holes that have been accepting everything and disgorging nothing
for 30 years. When I have organized the life out of every drawer,
every closet, every shelf, and every cabinet in this house, she
promises my little minutes will shrink to almost nothing, my
extraordinary capacity to create a mess a minute will diminish, and
beauty, dignity, and harmony will reign in my home and in my soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere. Sometime,'' as Maria sings in ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe that, I have some waterfront property to sell you
in Bangladesh ...

KEEPING THE FAMILY IN BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever Gary Slate of Stoughton, Mass. comes home from school
and sees yet another thick envelope in the mail for his sister, he
writes off dinner that night. Conversation is bound to focus again
on the pros and cons of yet another college that Rachel is
considering. Boring, boring, boring.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, 14, tries to be stoic. Nonetheless, he says, ``It starts
to make you feel bad.'' Bad as in jealous, left out, and worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts things in my mind that I wish weren't there and that
makes me feel weird,'' says Gary. ``Like, even though college is
far away for me, I wonder, `Am I gonna make it?''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Gary has felt that special events in
his sister's life are unfairly setting the agenda for the family.
Take her bat mitzvah. ``Nobody had time to do regular family
things, like throw a ball around,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What Gary is experiencing is a disequilibrium in the family, a
natural occurrence when one child gets more than a normal share of
parental attention. It doesn't have to be monthslong preparations
for a bar mitzvah; for some children, attention that comes and goes
even in a week in the wake of a one-time award is too much to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family balance is out of whack,'' says psychologist Mark
L. Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   That it's out of whack for something exciting, something worthy
of pride and joy, is a nuance lost on them. A child can only bring
a child's perspective to bear, after all, and it can best be summed
up in three words: What about me?
</P>
<P>
   The sooner parents realize and accept that, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any child who feels left out is going to be hurt. That's human
nature,'' says Michigan clinical psychologist Daniel Blake, who
specializes in sibling relationships.
</P>
<P>
   How the hurt manifests itself varies by developmental stage:
</P>
<P>
   _A 3- to 5-year-old typically blames herself: ``It's my fault
I'm left out because I had bad thoughts about Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   _A 6- to 8-year-old sees things as right or wrong, thus he's
angry at you for being ``unfair'' and allowing the balance of
attention in the family to shift.
</P>
<P>
   _A child 9 or older knows he should be happy for a sibling but
he can't help his jealous feelings. ``That makes him feel bad: `I
must be a bad person if I can't be more generous and loving to my
sister,''' says pediatric psychologist Peter Goldenthal, director
of child and family therapy at Children's Seashore House of
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   At any age, the behavior you see can run a gamut, from lashing
out to withdrawing. The young child, for instance, could be angry
with Daddy for making her have the bad thoughts to begin with or
she could refuse to get caught up in the event because she reasons
she's too bad to share in it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest mistake we make is insisting a sibling be
happy for the sister. When you force a child to act other than the
way he feels, it creates dissonance, says Blake: ``It makes you
question your feelings _ `Are they real?' _ and makes you think
there is something wrong with you for having them.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting aggravated at what looks like a selfish attitude doesn't
help either. ``Asking, `Can't you be happy for your sister?' or
telling her that her turn will come doesn't compute for her,'' says
Goldstein, a Northbrook, Ill., therapist who specializes in family
relations. Children under 12 are generally too egocentric to take
another person's perspective, he says. They also have a hard time
looking into the future.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true many children look at a brother's presents or
praise and whine, ``I want some, too,'' Goldenthal tells parents
not to assume a child is only feeling petty jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very anxiety-provoking to see your older sibling go
through something you know you, too, will have to go through,
especially if the sib is struggling,'' he says. ``There's a lot of
anticipatory anxiety: `I don't want to go through that. It'll be
even harder for me!'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fran Slate says that for her daughter's bat mitzvah,
Gary was more nervous than Rachel. It wasn't out of empathy,
however. Not only was he nervous for himself, says Fran, but he
worried his parents would run out of money by the time it was his
turn. ``He wanted the same benefits as Rachel,'' says their mother.
``When it was time to plan his bar mitzvah, he wanted the exact
celebration she had.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, Fran and husband Arthur never tried to disavow Gary's
jealous feelings and engaged him in conversations about his fears.
Goldenthal urges all parents to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can almost be certain that every child worries about his
turn,'' he says. In families where there is only one child, the
comparison could be made to an older cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Bring up the issue even if a child doesn't: ``I know you've
noticed how hard this is/how much work this is. When it's your
turn, we'll get you all the help you need.'' This simple statement
of support, especially for a child who feels less capable, is
surprisingly calming, Goldenthal says.
</P>
<P>
   He also tells parents to let a child know that you know the
balance is out of whack. For instance: ``This college stuff is
taking more time than I expected and it may seem unfair to you. If
you notice I'm going overboard with it, tell me, as long as you are
polite about it.'' Then, says Goldenthal, ``When he says at dinner,
`Dad, you asked me to remind you,' thank him and switch gears.
Don't say, `Yeah, but this is important.'''
</P>
<P>
   While some siblings' anger will be directed toward the older
sibling, some may be directed toward you. ``It's as if she's
saying, `You're not taking good care of me!''' says Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Don't compromise your limit-setting, even if you feel guilty for
neglecting a child. Instead of making him feel special, it feels
like you aren't paying attention or don't care enough to set the
limits. In addition, you push him to seek negative attention:
``What will make Mom pay attention to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all children look at a big event in an older sibling's life
and dread it. Some can't wait for their turn, especially for
graduation or a driver's license. Validate that these are
reasonable feelings to have, suggests Blake: ```It does seem like
it will be forever, doesn't it,''' rather than, ```Stop griping,
it'll be your turn soon enough.' That puts you on his side,'' says
Blake: ```You aren't going through it alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   On occassion, the table gets turned and it's an older sibling
who is jealous of a younger's achievement. Just because he's older
and developmentally more capable of understanding how these things
can happen, the hurt is no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents have no tolerance for comments like, `She doesn't
deserve it,''' says Blake. He says a good response is to
acknowledge the reality in a gentle way: `There are some painful
moments in life and this may be one of them for you, to see your
sister do something better than you did. It hurts.''' Find a time
later to talk about his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Slate wishes there was a way for parents to protect younger
siblings from all the plans and discussions. ``Maybe the
conversations can be when the younger person isn't around, or after
he's gone to bed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that parents have to forget about the college
applications, or whatever,'' adds Gary. ``I know it's a big deal in
a family, but the rest of us still have our life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for ways to include younger siblings in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Siblings who exhibit no signs of jealousy or anger may or may
not be fine. Try to draw them out by talking about yourself or a
third party: ``I remember when my sister ...''
</P>
<P>
   It's better to help a child work through feelings of resentment
than to buy the feelings away with a gift; when the gift's novelty
wears off, the feelings will still be there. On the other hand,
it's OK to talk about his upcoming birthday and what he wants as a
way to remind him that he, too, is worthy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're spending less time with a younger child, be pointed in
your adjustment: ``I've been so busy with Jen's recital that you
and I haven't had any time together. How about if we shut ourselves
in your bedroom Saturday morning to play?''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't afford to do the same thing you did for your
first-born, or your values have changed, say so: ``We gave your
brother a car when he got his license. It was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Give credit to a sibling for his help, even if the help is
simply not complaining: ``I know it must be hard to listen to all
these conversations. Thanks for being such a good sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal with brattiness between siblings as you always would, but
afterwards look for an opening to get feelings out: ``I bet it's
hard to see your brother getting so much attention ...''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Before a new baby and just after, two good books:
For a preschooler, ``Waiting for Baby'' by Harriet Ziefert; for 4-
to 7-year-olds, ``frog face, my little sister &AMP; me'' by John
Schindel (both Henry Holt).

<P>
   Next time you bite into a slice of bread or a bowl of breakfast
cereal, you may be swallowing more than you bargained for.
Increasing problems with resistance to pesticides mean that beetles
and mites are contaminating an ever-larger proportion of
cereal-based foods.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was highlighted at the British Crop Protection
Conference in Brighton, England, last week by Ken Wildey of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's Central Science
Laboratory in York.
</P>
<P>
   Wildey's team studied grain from 279 commercial stores.
Eighty-one percent of the grain stores contained mites and 27
percent contained beetles. The researchers have also studied 567
cereal-based food products, including flour, bread, breakfast
cereals and biscuits. Of these foods, 21 percent contained mites,
which came from a total of 24 species.
</P>
<P>
   The technique used to sample the mites from food kills the
creatures, so the researchers don't know which of the foods
contained living mites. But even dead mites can trigger allergic
reactions in sensitized people, if there are enough of them. One
product _ a dried rusk baby food _ contained 20,000 mites per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
   Wildey believes the problem is escalating because of resistance
to pirimithos-methyl and other organophosphate pesticides. A
quarter of the populations of sawtoothed grain beetles
(Oryzaephilus surinamensis) isolated from grain stores showed some
resistance to organophosphates. And 71 percent of populations of
Acarus siro, the most common mite in grain stores, survived 14 days
of exposure to pirimithos-methyl at twice the recommended dose.
</P>
<P>
   Every single population of another species, Tyrophagus
putrescentiae, was similarly resistant. ``We have also found
cross-resistance, with a number of mite strains resistant to all
approved grain protectants,'' Wildey says. ``This may well result
in a higher risk of contamination of foodstuffs by mites.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildey fears a ``total breakdown of chemical control options.''
But pesticides aren't the only option. Mites die if the moisture
content of grain falls below 15 percent, and most beetles are
unable to breed below 15 C. Adjusting the conditions under which
grain is stored and reducing treatment with organophosphates would
also reduce consumers' exposure to pesticide residues in food.
</P>
<P>
   But 90 percent of commercial grain stores in Britain rely on
organophosphates. Peter Beaumont, director of the Pesticides Trust
in London, argues that the government's Advisory Committee on
Pesticides should revoke licenses allowing grain stores to use
organophosphate.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem may lie elsewhere, however. Robin Appel, who
runs a grain store that doesn't use organophosphates in Waltham
Chase, Hampshire, says that farmers routinely treat grain with the
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers think they have got mites contained but they are
actually feeding live mites into the human food chain,'' he says.
``What they have to do is cool and dry their grain much more
rapidly.'' &QL;

   What makes a good classical guitar? Researchers in Mexico have
discovered that a guitar's quality can be assessed by measuring its
tuning accuracy and its acoustic efficiency. Their findings could
take much of the guesswork out of buying a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Ricardo Boullosa from the National
Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, tested four
classical guitars, ranging in price from $50 to $500. They asked a
mixture of people, from nonmusicians to professional guitarists, to
rate the sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   The team then tried to link its results with the physical
characteristics of the instruments. ``As far as we know, this is
the first attempt to correlate the tuning properties and radiation
efficiency of guitars with their subjective musical quality,'' the
researchers say in the current edition of Applied Acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate tests were carried out. First, the team asked a
small audience, including professional guitarists, to listen to
snatches of music. The audience could not see which of the four
guitars was being played. The most expensive guitar won three times
as many votes as the cheapest. Then a small group of guitarists,
including amateurs and professionals, was asked to rate the
instruments. They too rated the most expensive guitar the highest.
</P>
<P>
   Guitarists sound different notes by holding down the guitar's
strings against ``frets'' _ thin raised metal bands mounted on the
wooden ``neck'' of the instrument. The team measured the tuning
accuracy of these frets. In a perfectly tuned guitar, each fret
would be exactly a semitone apart _ known in acoustics as 100 cents
(one cent is one hundredth of a semitone).
</P>
<P>
   But the team found that the mean tuning error of the four
guitars varied from 7 cents in the $500 guitar to 20 cents in one
of the midrange guitars.
</P>
<P>
   The team then tested the radiation efficiency of the
instruments, which is a measure of how effective they are at
turning the mechanical energy from plucking a string into sound.
They found that for frequencies below 1 kilohertz, the $500 guitar
had an efficiency of nearly 15 percent, while the cheapest guitar
was less than 10 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   David Whiteman, who teaches guitar-making at London Guildhall
University's department of design and technology, says that the
tuning and radiation efficiency are unlikely to be the whole story.
Players also look for the guitar's tonal quality, how long notes
take to die away and the sound balance between the different
strings, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that the guitars used in the test were relatively cheap,
and components such as the fretboard were probably factory-made.
``In the United States a handmade concert instrument would cost
between $3,000 and $6,000,'' he says. He doubts whether the results
from these tests would apply to top-of-the-range models. &QL;

wooden ``neck'' of the instrument. The team measured the tuning
accuracy of these frets. In a perfectly tuned guitar, each fret
would be exactly a semitone apart _ known in acoustics as 100 cents
(one cent is one hundredth of a semitone).
</P>
<P>
   But the team found that the mean tuning error of the four
guitars varied from 7 cents in the $500 guitar to 20 cents in one
of the midrange guitars.
</P>
<P>
   The team then tested the radiation efficiency of the
instruments, which is a measure of how effective they are at
turning the mechanical energy from plucking a string into sound.
They found that for frequencies below 1 kilohertz, the $500 guitar
had an efficiency of nearly 15 percent, while the cheapest guitar
was less than 10 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   David Whiteman, who teaches guitar-making at London Guildhall
University's department of design and technology, says that the
tuning and radiation efficiency are unlikely to be the whole story.
Players also look for the guitar's tonal quality, how long notes
take to die away and the sound balance between the different
strings, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that the guitars used in the test were relatively cheap,
and components such as the fretboard were probably factory-made.
``In the United States a handmade concert instrument would cost
between $3,000 and $6,000,'' he says. He doubts whether the results
from these tests would apply to top-of-the-range models. &QL;

ROCKWELL, ONCE IMPUGNED, ENJOYS AN ASCENDANCY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. _ Ye denizens of uber-cool galleries and art
happenings, admit it _ you like Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK. Rockwell is no longer a guilty pleasure of the art
world. Yes, critics used to insist that we, if not exactly scorn
him, at least dismiss his genial, sentimental art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal Norman,'' as art critic Robert Hughes snidely dubbed
him, was devalued even by Rockwell himself, who deflected charges
against him by saying he was an illustrator, not an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, through eight decades he has burrowed deep into
the American psyche. The time has come when his pictures, the best
of which possess an authenticity and insight comparable to the Old
Masters, are being accepted in and out of the art world as fine
art.
</P>
<P>
   What could end up being a seismic shift in the artist's
reputation occurred earlier this year, when Robert Rosenblum,
contributing editor for Artforum, wrote that Rockwell ``keeps
pricking my art-historical conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum's epiphany came, as it often does for one-time art
snobs, viewing Rockwell's original paintings at the Norman Rockwell
Museum. ``I became an instant convert,'' the critic wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum's essay gave voice to a legion of new Rockwell
believers. ``I, for one, am happy now to love Rockwell for his own
sake,'' he declared unabashedly. ``We have a newborn Rockwell who
can no longer be looked at with sneering condescension and might
well become an indispensable part of art history.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum's reassessment continues a movement toward the lanky
Yankee that has grown quietly throughout this decade. Laurie Norton
Moffatt, the director of the Norman Rockwell Museum, has seen a
change in attitude toward Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tidal wave of energy moving on its own,'' said
Moffatt, whose museum is at the epicenter of the artist's
ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's rebirth as a master began in earnest in 1993, when
the museum moved to its present home on a 36-acre Stockbridge
estate. Before that, the museum had been located in a quaint but
cramped historic house on Main Street in the famously picturesque
Berkshire village where Rockwell spent his last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   When he died in 1978 at age 84, Rockwell left his personal art
collection 502 paintings and drawings, including 172 finished oil
paintings and the contents of his studio, to the museum in the Old
Corner House.
</P>
<P>
   That venue, which Moffatt began working in as a 20-year-old
docent in 1977, was little more than another tourist attraction in
a busy tourist town at the time of Rockwell's death. Fifteen years
later, when the collection was relocation to an elegant new
building designed by noted architect Robert Stern, the museum
attracted attention from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rockwell's reputation is about to rise again. His
paintings, which existed in a parallel universe from the museum and
critical community during his lifetime, will embark on a two-year,
six-museum tour that will include stops at the Chicago Historical
Society, the San Diego Museum of Art, the Phoenix Art Museum and
the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Co-organized by the
Rockwell Museum and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the exhibit
will open in Atlanta in November 1999, and end in Stockbridge in
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Moffatt said the aim of the show, which will contain more than
70 oil paintings and all 322 of Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post
illustrations, is to ``invite reappraisal and raise awareness'' of
an artist she calls ``a national treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pitch him as only an illustrator,'' Moffatt said.
``Someone as prodigious, prolific and passionate (as Rockwell),
there's a genius quality to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moffatt also wants the tour to introduce the artist's legacy to
young people unfamiliar with his art.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many of these new viewers will be struck by the feeling
of discovery that is the hallmark of Rockwell's painting. He was a
magical storyteller, on par not just with the great illustrators of
his day, the Howard Pyles and N.C. Wyeths, but up there with Mark
Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson and his personal favorite, Charles
Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dickens wrote about the kind of people I paint,'' he once
said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a boy, Rockwell would illustrate the Victorian
author's tales while his father read them aloud to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, like Dickens, infused his art with pathos and humor _
the sweet smile that spreads across your face while looking at his
best paintings is backed by feelings of sympathy and compassion,
both for the individuals within the frame and for the human
condition generally. Like all great storytellers, Rockwell makes
his audience a party to the drama unfolding before its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Critic Dave Hickey sees a ``deeply anti-authoritarian'' strain
in Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's art ``almost never portrays the benefits of power,''
said Hickey, a professor of art criticism and theory at the
University of Nevada Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockwell's whole idea of history is very American; it's based
on the promise of youth,'' he said in a recent telephone interview.
``It's easy to project the kids from the '50s (in his paintings)
into the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey said that much of American culture is rooted in
Rockwell's democratic sensibility, from the films of Frank Capra to
the novels of Jack Kerouac.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Kerouac but Norman Rockwell on the road? Beatific
encounters of everyday people on the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell learned his craft by copying Renaissance masterworks,
studying plaster casts and, of course, drawing from life. Although
he never claimed it outright, there can be little doubt he saw
himself as a living member of a glorious tradition, and in his work
made regular references to the great art of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The stance of a football hero in ``The Recruit'' is based on a
Michelangelo sculpture, while his own ``Triple Self-Portrait'' in
which we see Rockwell looking into a mirror at Rockwell while
painting the face of Rockwell, includes tips of the hat to Durer,
Rembrandt, Picasso and Van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, however, also worked from photographs; a concession to
deadlines he was at first loathe to accept. His archives are filled
with photographic studies of his models in full costume, often in
the same general setting as the finished painting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was much more than a copyist, a fact that is reasserted
over and over as one studies his paintings. Rockwell's gift _ maybe
his greatest gift _ was in details. In his famous ``Freedom from
Want,'' which shows a family gathered around the Thanksgiving
table, he depicts the subtle, beautiful play of light upon sheer
curtains, bone china, water glasses. ``The Gossips,'' a witty
narrative of a rumor spreading from ear to ear among 15 different
people, is a study in hairdos, noses and facial wrinkles. And ``The
Problem We All Live With,'' which shows a black girl being escorted
to school by U.S. Marshals, depicts an iconography of hate that
includes a hurled smashed tomato and scrawled epithets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't look at his paintings closely, you don't see the
things that he sees. It's taken for granted,'' Moffatt said. ``But
if you take the time to look carefully, you're astonished by the
level of detail. It's staggering what he took the time to paint.''

   What makes a good classical guitar? Researchers in Mexico have
discovered that a guitar's quality can be assessed by measuring its
tuning accuracy and its acoustic efficiency. Their findings could
take much of the guesswork out of buying a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Ricardo Boullosa from the National
Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, tested four
classical guitars, ranging in price from $50 to $500. They asked a
mixture of people, from nonmusicians to professional guitarists, to
rate the sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   The team then tried to link its results with the physical
characteristics of the instruments. ``As far as we know, this is
the first attempt to correlate the tuning properties and radiation
efficiency of guitars with their subjective musical quality,'' the
researchers say in the current edition of Applied Acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate tests were carried out. First, the team asked a
small audience, including professional guitarists, to listen to
snatches of music. The audience could not see which of the four
guitars was being played. The most expensive guitar won three times
as many votes as the cheapest. Then a small group of guitarists,
including amateurs and professionals, was asked to rate the
instruments. They too rated the most expensive guitar the highest.
</P>
<P>
   Guitarists sound different notes by holding down the guitar's
strings against ``frets'' _ thin raised metal bands mounted on the
wooden ``neck'' of the instrument. The team measured the tuning
accuracy of these frets. In a perfectly tuned guitar, each fret
would be exactly a semitone apart _ known in acoustics as 100 cents
(one cent is one hundredth of a semitone).

   Parents who assault their children usually claim the injuries
happened by accident. Sometimes doctors can't say for sure what
really happened. But researchers in Pittsburgh may now be on the
way to identifying a biochemical signature that can help
distinguish between brain injuries caused by accidents and those
resulting from violent abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Patrick Kochanek of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, is analyzing cerebrospinal fluid
from children and adults. The researchers are comparing fluid
drained from patients with severe head trauma to relieve a buildup
of pressure with fluid from patients given spinal taps for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children studied had been injured by adults who
admitted abusing them. Preliminary evidence suggests that victims
of abuse usually have a ``whole host of biochemical derangements in
the brain,'' Kochanek says.
</P>
<P>
   His team has studied a range of biochemicals, including amino
acids, immune system signaling molecules called cytokines, and
quinolinic acid, produced by immune cells that slowly infiltrate
the brain after an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any metabolite that we look at, seven times out of 10 we
see really high levels in victims of child abuse,'' Kochanek says.
``I think it really is a reflection of how severely these infants
are injured.''
</P>
<P>
   High levels of quinolinic acid may be the closest thing so far
to a ``marker'' of child abuse, Kochanek says. Adults who assault
children usually don't take them straight to the hospital _
instead, they show up later with a story about how the child was
injured in a fall, or some other ``accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Because quinolinic acid accumulates slowly in the brain, its
presence may reveal whether a parent is lying about the timing of
the injury. High levels might also indicate prior injuries,
signaling a history of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kochanek and his colleagues could find no trace of quinolinic
acid in cerebrospinal fluid taken from 39 adults with head injuries
who went to the hospital within 24 hours of being injured.
</P>
<P>
   But in a study to be published early next year in the Journal of
Critical Care Medicine, conducted with Melvyn Heyes of the National
Institute of Mental Health near Washington D.C., they say that two
out of 17 children with head injuries had high levels of quinolinic
acid. Both children had been abused. A third abused child in the
sample did not have elevated levels of quinolinic acid. Kochanek is
now expanding the study. ``We need to study more patients to
determine if this preliminary finding holds up or not,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The team has also found that the cerebrospinal fluid of babies
who have been shaken violently contains particularly high levels of
the amino acid glutamate _ which causes further damage to neurons
in injured brains. Randall Alexander, former vice-chair of the U.S.
Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect and a pediatrician at the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, says that this is further
evidence that victims of shaken-baby syndrome can suffer more
widespread damage than those who receive blows to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Kochanek warns that levels of a single biochemical are unlikely
ever to give a definitive diagnosis of whether or not a child has
been abused. But analyzed together with other evidence, such as
X-rays, he believes biochemistry could become an important tool for
doctors investigating suspicions of abuse. &QL;

Pittsburgh School of Medicine, is analyzing cerebrospinal fluid
from children and adults. The researchers are comparing fluid
drained from patients with severe head trauma to relieve a buildup
of pressure with fluid from patients given spinal taps for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children studied had been injured by adults who
admitted abusing them. Preliminary evidence suggests that victims
of abuse usually have a ``whole host of biochemical derangements in
the brain,'' Kochanek says.
</P>
<P>
   His team has studied a range of biochemicals, including amino
acids, immune system signaling molecules called cytokines, and
quinolinic acid, produced by immune cells that slowly infiltrate
the brain after an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any metabolite that we look at, seven times out of 10 we
see really high levels in victims of child abuse,'' Kochanek says.
``I think it really is a reflection of how severely these infants
are injured.''
</P>
<P>
   High levels of quinolinic acid may be the closest thing so far
to a ``marker'' of child abuse, Kochanek says. Adults who assault
children usually don't take them straight to the hospital _
instead, they show up later with a story about how the child was
injured in a fall, or some other ``accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Because quinolinic acid accumulates slowly in the brain, its
presence may reveal whether a parent is lying about the timing of
the injury. High levels might also indicate prior injuries,
signaling a history of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kochanek and his colleagues could find no trace of quinolinic
acid in cerebrospinal fluid taken from 39 adults with head injuries
who went to the hospital within 24 hours of being injured.
</P>
<P>
   But in a study to be published early next year in the Journal of
Critical Care Medicine, conducted with Melvyn Heyes of the National
Institute of Mental Health near Washington D.C., they say that two
out of 17 children with head injuries had high levels of quinolinic
acid. Both children had been abused. A third abused child in the
sample did not have elevated levels of quinolinic acid. Kochanek is
now expanding the study. ``We need to study more patients to
determine if this preliminary finding holds up or not,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The team has also found that the cerebrospinal fluid of babies
who have been shaken violently contains particularly high levels of
the amino acid glutamate _ which causes further damage to neurons
in injured brains. Randall Alexander, former vice-chair of the U.S.
Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect and a pediatrician at the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, says that this is further
evidence that victims of shaken-baby syndrome can suffer more
widespread damage than those who receive blows to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Kochanek warns that levels of a single biochemical are unlikely
ever to give a definitive diagnosis of whether or not a child has
been abused. But analyzed together with other evidence, such as
X-rays, he believes biochemistry could become an important tool for
doctors investigating suspicions of abuse. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Sad song of the rock 'n' roll star
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A buddy and I were riding around, going nowhere
in particular, something we've been doing since back in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Kiss'' by J. Frank Wilson was playing on the CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one thing wrong with that song,'' my friend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No there isn't,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was our tribute to J. Frank Wilson, someone we'd known
since grade school.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you remember that ``Last Kiss'' hit No. 1 on the charts in
1964, making J. Frank a rock 'n' roll idol and, for a short while,
the most famous guy to have graduated from Lufkin High.
</P>
<P>
   You can read all about him on the album notes of the new CD,
``The 'Last Kiss' Sessions,'' previously unreleased recordings by
J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers, on the Collectables label
(www.cicadelic.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Kiss'' tells the story of a teenage girl who dies in the
arms of her boyfriend after their car is hit by a train.
</P>
<P>
   It's no more tragic than the real life story of J. Frank, run
down by the fame train. It just took him a lot longer to die.
</P>
<P>
   J. Frank had graduated from high school in 1960, a year behind
me. I remember him playing rock 'n' roll at school assembly. Along
the way he got the nickname ``Greasy Frank,'' because of the way he
slicked back his hair, rock star-style.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1964, he had the talent to go with the look.
</P>
<P>
   Singing with the Cavaliers, a group he had met up with while
stationed in San Angelo, Texas, during a stint in the Air Force, J.
Frank was touring the country with his hit song.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Lufkin, a bunch of us got together to watch him
perform on national TV. In a brief interview afterward, the emcee
asked him if he'd had a nickname back in high school. J. Frank
mumbled something without really answering the question.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of us around the TV yelled out in unison, ``Greasy
Frank!''
</P>
<P>
   But not one of us resented his good fortune. We were proud of
him for doing what we'd all thought we'd do, become rich and
famous. Not so rich, as it would turn out for him, and not so
famous for very long.
</P>
<P>
   Early on the morning of Oct. 23 near Lima, Ohio, a station wagon
the band was traveling in crashed head-on with a tractor-trailer
when their driver fell asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The driver died instantly. J. Frank was severely injured with
head lacerations, broken ribs and a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Within in a week he was back on the stage, performing on
crutches and in a cast. Some say it was an example of his
professionalism. Others blamed the greed of the people making money
off of his success.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, in the process, J. Frank became addicted to pain
pills, and as a result of the head injuries, would later suffer
from seizures.
</P>
<P>
   As for the money: Along with the million-seller gold record, a
``Last Kiss'' album had sold over 100,000 copies, but the record
company had to be sued in order to collect any royalties.
</P>
<P>
   According to the album notes, ``after all the lawyers and
expenses were paid, J. Frank ended up with around $3,000 ...''
</P>
<P>
   J. Frank would release other singles in the coming years, but
with little success. Ten years after ``Last Kiss'' hit No. 1 on the
charts, he was back in Lufkin working as a nursing home orderly.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he ended up himself, as a nursing home patient,
never having fully recovered from the injuries he received in the
car crash. He died Oct. 4, 1991, a couple of months short of his
50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Saddest of all, after his death was noted in Billboard magazine,
it came to light that another performer had been billing himself
for years as J. Frank Wilson in rock 'n' roll revues. Such is the
greed that took away his success, his money and even his name.
</P>
<P>
   If J. Frank Wilson's story could ever have a happy ending, it's
yet to be written. The album notes of the new CD suggest that
possibility:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this CD will change rock historians' perception
about his talent to reveal the unique flair and great style J.
Frank had when the world was waiting to be conquered by him and The
Cavaliers.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not one thing wrong with that.

STUFF OF SCIENCE FICTION FUELS A SPACECRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than a month of lurching through space
in fits and starts, an experimental spacecraft crammed with new
technologies has begun to cruise away from Earth, driven by a
recently revived ion propulsion engine taken from science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Deep Space 1
spacecraft, now more than 3.5 million miles from Earth and moving
away at more than a mile a second, has weathered a sometimes bumpy
inaugural period punctuated by several small problems. But
engineers say these headaches are not unexpected and that the
1,000-pound robot craft is settling in for a productive mission of
trying new devices and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Since Deep Space 1 was launched on Oct. 24, it has twice
suspended normal operation and gone into emergency mode, software
problems have occurred that caused subsystems to turn on, and the
ion engine charged with propelling the craft turned off after four
and a half minutes of a planned 16-hour test when first started on
Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of Deep Space 1 is to test advanced, new
technologies that are in some ways risky,'' Dr. Marc D. Rayman,
chief mission engineer, said in a telephone interview from NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``If everything
worked perfectly on the first try, it could mean that we were not
sufficiently aggressive in selecting the technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission's main objective is to do some trouble-shooting
technology, not science. NASA wants to validate unusual
technologies that could make science craft more efficient and
cheaper, and has filled Deep Space 1 with miniature instruments and
other devices for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its unusual propulsion system, the probe carries an
autonomous navigation system that keeps track of its location, a
miniature integrated camera and spectrometer, a group of physics
instruments for studying charged particles in space, new low-power
electronics, and artificial intelligence systems that let the
spacecraft revise its mission as situations change.
</P>
<P>
   A centerpiece of the mission is the spacecraft's solar-electric
propulsion system, a form of ion drive that has been a mainstay of
science fiction. Ion propulsion has been tested in space, and small
ion engines are used to stabilize some satellites in high Earth
orbits, but Deep Space 1 is the first craft to employ this kind of
engine as its primary drive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of burning fuel as conventional rockets do, the ion
engine's xenon gas fuel is charged electrically to create
high-speed particles that leave the engine so fast that they
produce thrust, albeit in minute amounts. The energized particles,
called ions, are accelerated out of the engine through the pull of
two oppositely charged metal grids.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Space 1's engine should normally produce about one-250th of
a pound of thrust, comparable to the force exerted by one sheet of
typing paper resting on the palm of a hand. This small, steady
thrust should increase the craft's speed enough to boost its
velocity by 8,000 miles an hour by the end of its mission.
</P>
<P>
   After the engine faltered, controllers sent the craft new
computer instructions to help diagnose the problem, believed to
have been debris in the engine that was causing a short circuit.
When engineers turned the engine on last Wednesday to test the
software and collect more data, to their surprise it started right
away and ran flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were prepared for the engine to work, we didn't
consider it a high probability that it would start and run so well
the first time we tried it,'' Rayman said.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Space 1 will need the ion engine to complete its primary
mission in July, when the craft is to make a close flyby of a small
asteroid called 1992 KD. If NASA chooses to extend the mission, the
ion drive will propel the spacecraft by two comets in 2001,
Wilson-Harrington in January and Borrelly in September.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers said several of the other new technologies on Deep
Space 1 are working well and some, like the physics experiments,
have yet to be turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Space 1 has a new kind of solar power array that uses 720
cylindrical lenses to concentrate sunlight onto 3,600
electricity-producing cells. The arrays, arranged in a pair of
panels spanning more than 38 feet across, produce up to 20 percent
more power than conventional cells. Rayman said the panels deployed
perfectly and are doing a better job of maintaining their
orientation toward the sun than earlier types of solar arrays.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft's autonomous navigation system, which allows Deep
Space 1 to chart its course, also has worked as expected, he said.
The system periodically takes pictures of stars with asteroids in
the background and uses the information to compute the craft's
location and adjust its course without help from ground
controllers, as required by previous unmanned probes.
</P>
<P>
   Human controllers are fine-tuning the craft's operations and
rewriting computerized instructions to bypass some problems. A
sensor that keeps track of star locations so the spacecraft can
orient itself has failed occasionally, once causing the craft to
suspend operations and go into a safe mode. Engineers are still
diagnosing the problem, Rayman said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers determined that a software problem caused trouble with
another instrument, a sun sensor, that triggered a second safe mode
condition and they developed a way to fix it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see these problems as an opportunity to learn,'' Rayman
said. ``Everything you learn here applies to the next time this
technology is used, and that's what this mission is all about.''

<P>
   Airlines are failing to implement new safety procedures designed
to reduce pilot error, industry watchdogs claim.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single cause of air accident fatalities, accounting
for half of all deaths, is not mechanical failure but ``controlled
flights into terrain,'' or CFITs, by disoriented pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In one horrific example of a CFIT in April, a Colombian jet
failed to make a right turn on leaving Bogota, and careered
straight into a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   This type of accident appears to be on the increase. And experts
commissioned by the Flight Safety Foundation in Alexandria, Va.,
and the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal, say
that airlines are placing too much faith in new technologies to
warn pilots of impending disaster, while giving too little emphasis
to basic training and safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The CFIT Reduction Task Force, spearheaded by the two
organizations, has spent the past five years researching the causes
of CFITs with the goal of reducing their incidence by half. Last
year, it distributed 30,000 copies of a CFIT avoidance checklist
and an education and training aid to the world's airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The materials contain simple measures but, according to
research, are highly effective. The training aid alerts flight
crews to the dangers of CFIT accidents by taking them through
examples. Among other things, the checklist ensures that crew
complete a risk assessment before taking off, reviewing departure
procedures and terrain in the flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Matthews, president of the Flight Safety Foundation,
claims that airlines aren't implementing these countermeasures fast
enough. ``We would like to have these aids integrated into every
airline's training program, and that is simply not happening,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, airlines appear to be concentrating on improved
ground-proximity warning systems. Unlike existing systems, which
use radar to detect the proximity of terrain directly beneath the
aircraft, the new devices can warn pilots of dangers ahead and give
much earlier warnings.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthews argues that technology isn't the answer, at least
in the short term. ``We have had numerous incidents of people
ignoring warnings,'' he explains. Indeed, research has shown that
adding new technology to cockpits while ignoring pilots' ability to
act on the information it provides can cause problems rather than
solving them. The equipment can't be fitted to some older planes,
Matthews adds. And it could take several years for large airlines
to equip their entire fleets.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, CFIT incidents may be getting more common. At
least seven have been confirmed this year, three more than the
number reported at this time last year. And figures released last
week at the 51st annual International Air Safety Seminar in Cape
Town show an upward trend in the number of approach-and-landing
accidents, many of which are CFITs. There are currently about 15
such accidents each year. If the trend continues, this will rise to
23 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The International Air Transport Association in Geneva, which
represents more than 260 airlines, is disappointed by its members'
response to the CFIT task force. Ashok Poduval, the association's
director for flight operations and safety, says: ``All we can do is
encourage them to implement these training aids. We are looking at
ways to get a time-bound implementation framework in place.'' &QL;

'N SYNC'S A CAPPELLA FELLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _If your teen-age daughters won't stop talking about
'N Sync, don't go running to the kitchen in a panic. That's not the
Sync they're excited about.
</P>
<P>
   This 'N Sync is Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Lance Bass, Joey
Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick, five good-looking boys-next-door from
Orlando, Fla., who specialize in smooth r&AMP;b-style harmonies, tight
soul-brother choreography and more hooks than you'll find in a
fisherman's tackle box.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which has been compared to fellow Orlando heartthrobs
the Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block, is this week's pop
sensation. Last month, they were opening for Janet Jackson. Today,
they're in the midst of a headlining tour of theaters that comes to
the Universal Amphitheatre on Jan. 5 and 8 for shows that sold out
in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that 'N Sync had two albums in the Top 10 last
week _ their self-titled debut and the holiday-themed ``Home for
Christmas,'' both on RCA Records. Plus, there was that high-profile
appearance last week on the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't changed _ our schedules have changed, that's about
it,'' said Timberlake, 17, the youngest member of the group. ``We
have ourselves to keep us humble. We're a gathering of friends who
really wanted to do this particular kind of music. We knew we
wanted to sing a lot of a cappella harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, Timberlake and his pals formed the group in Orlando
but became an overnight success in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Chasez, originally from Washington, D.C., met Memphis-born
Timberlake on the set of the Disney Channel's ``Mickey Mouse Club''
in the mid-'90s. After the show ended, the two singers found
themselves in Nashville working with the same vocal coach and
writers on separate solo projects.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Timberlake returned to Orlando, where he hooked up
with Kirkpatrick. The trio met New York native Fatone at a local
club, later adding Bass.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync's debut album was first issued in Germany, where the
pop-soul workout ``I Want You Back'' became a chart smash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a learning experience,'' Timberlake said from
home. ```The Mickey Mouse Club' was a great way for me to learn
about acting and sound stages and studios. You get to see how the
machinery works, how everything comes into play.''
</P>
<P>
   The group appears Saturday in the premiere of the Disney
Channel's ``Holidays in Concert'' cable special and as presenters
on Monday's on Fox's Billboard Music Awards. Christmas Day, you can
get in sync with 'N Sync on ABC's ``Walt Disney World's Very Merry
Christmas Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bell, music buyer for the Wherehouse chain, called the
quintet ``unstoppable'' a few days before an April 16 date at the
17,500-seat Forum sold out in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be heard by all age groups,'' Timberlake said. ``We
came out first on the radio. If people were into the song, then
they were into the group. Shortly after that, they matched the
faces with the song.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the group has captivated the teen and preteen market with
high-energy teen music made by teens, just like Hanson and Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   A typical fan is Tina Mathew, 15, a Maryland high schooler who
started an 'N Sync site on the Web in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their music is so upbeat, and they seem like the type of
people you want to talk to,'' she said. ``They're not stuck up
about their success or anything. They differ from the Backstreet
Boys musically, too. A lot of people just hear the dance beat and
assume they're the same, but really they're not. There's
differences in lyrics, beats and singing styles.''
</P>
<P>
   There's that B-word again _ Backstreet. 'N Sync not only share
the same manager and home base, but both groups have a cute young
blond as their object of female devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being compared to others is just something that comes along
with being in a group,'' says Timberlake, 'N Sync's teen-age poster
boy in question. ``Things will change. When Toni Braxton first came
out, she had to deal with being compared to Mariah Carey and
Whitney Houston. It's not a big deal with us. I think people
recognize the difference when they come see our show. Personally, I
think our harmonies sound a lot different. We have a little more of
an r&AMP;b sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of 'N Sync insist there's no competition, even when
their debut album overtook Backstreet in the Top 200 after a savvy
Disney Channel concert special aired in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come into this business to beat anybody out,''
Timberlake said. ``We weren't thinking about anybody except
ourselves when we started. We're not here to knock anybody off
their platform _ we want to make a platform of our own. We're just
all about 'N Sync. It's a big country, and there's room for
everybody. I'm not worried about what anyone has to say about us or
what other groups might think of us. We're just here to be the
first 'N Sync, not the second anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite a packed schedule that will see 'N Sync on TV and
in concert throughout the new year, Timberlake says it's all
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Even as far as girlfriends are concerned?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get close to anybody,'' he laughingly moans, then gets
serious. ``I'm trying. It's a hard thing to do being in a different
city every day. Personally, I'm not good over the phone. I've
tried, but it doesn't work for me. I'm just trying to keep my
options open for when things maybe settle down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're at home, we go out on dates if we meet someone.
We'll definitely ask them out if time permits, but we're all really
focused on what we're doing right now. Everything else is just kind
of secondary.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' is a big hit. But can an
``N.Y.Ph.D. Blue'' be one too?
</P>
<P>
   David Milch, the executive producer of the ``N.Y.P.D. Blue''
television series, is working on a pilot for a similar dramatic
series about scientists. But compared with cops, he said at a
recent conference of scientists and filmmakers, scientists are a
tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankenstein gets a lot of business, `Nova' doesn't,'' he
said. ``Science is out of reach as perceived by the vast, vast,
vast majority of people. There are deep misgivings in the public
consciousness about the devil's bargain science has made.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently many in Hollywood agree. From Dr. Frankenstein to Dr.
Strangelove, from the grave robbers of yesteryear to the cloners of
today, scientists in movies are almost invariably mad, evil,
antisocial, clumsy or eccentric. And science and technology
themselves are usually seen as forces of destruction rather than of
good.
</P>
<P>
   In television dramas, scientists barely appear at all, unless
one counts ``The X Files.'' Only 2 percent of the characters in
prime-time dramas from 1994 to 1997 were scientists, well behind
businessmen, entertainers, police officers, doctors and lawyers,
according to a survey directed by George Gerbner at Temple
University.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists think Hollywood is guilty of poor casting.
``Very few scientists I know are anywhere close to being loony
bins,'' said Dr. James D. Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize in
1962 for discovering the structure of DNA. ``A lot of us are more
like Michael Douglas _ slightly evil, highly competitive,'' he
added, referring to roles often played by the actor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hollywood's treatment of scientists is out of sync with
that of the press, which generally presents scientists as
articulate people making important discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley engineers have become role models in the new
economy and cover boys for national magazines. And surveys by the
National Science Foundation show that Americans on the whole are
more optimistic about science and technology than people in other
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   So now, a few efforts are being mounted to get Hollywood to
portray scientists in a more realistic light, as people with more
complex drives and emotions. These efforts also aim at getting
Hollywood to portray the process of scientific inquiry itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has spent $2 million so far on a
program to encourage more thoughtful treatment of science. It gave
a grant to Milch, for example, to develop his pilot. To influence
the next generation of filmmakers, the foundation, which is based
in New York, is also offering prizes of up to $25,000 to students
at six film schools who make movies about science or engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a basis for the stereotype but there's more than the
stereotype,'' said Doron Weber, an author and former scriptwriter
who heads the Sloan project. ``Science and technology offer a
potential gold mine for screenwriters and filmmakers _ wonderful,
diverse characters and great stories that have largely gone
untold.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of scientists affiliated with the American Association
for the Advancement of Science has also been trying to sell the
networks on a science drama. And the American Institute of
Engineers, a small group that aims to improve the image of its
profession, is hoping to interest networks in creating an annual
black-tie awards show for technology and a series called ``L.A.
Engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   ```L.A. Law' did marvelous things for the legal profession,''
said Martin Gottlieb, president of the engineering group. ``It
revealed the humanness behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just a desire to feel appreciated, however, is behind
such efforts. A better image of scientists and engineers could lead
to more people entering those fields and to greater public support
for projects ranging from space exploration to particle
accelerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``To raise the level of public understanding of science is the
work of the Lord,'' said the scientist who is spearheading the
Advancement of Science effort, Dr. Leon M. Lederman, director
emeritus of the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory. Society
needs to make complex decisions about technology rationally,
Lederman said, adding, ``Somebody raises an issue like radiation
and the fear takes over.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cultural gap between scientists and entertainers remains
wide. This became clear when the Sloan Foundation brought some
eminent scientists here two weeks ago for a series of panel
discussions with Hollywood directors and producers. One of the
discussions degenerated into a raucous name-calling exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't meet as many scientists who can meet my eyes in
conversation as I do people who pump gas,'' Milch said. Watson shot
back that Milch was a ``misfit from the Yale English department''
who was afraid of science.
</P>
<P>
   Milch, who was also the co-creator of ``Hill Street Blues,''
said it would be a challenge to get viewers to sympathize with
scientists. The drama he is working on will do that by using a
``surrogate villain,'' like a research administrator who treats
scientists badly.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge, he said, is that the scientific method, with
its emphasis on repetition of experiments, might by its very nature
be ``antithetical to the art of story-telling.'' The best stories,
he and other Hollywood types said, involve human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The top-rated drama ``E.R.'' has lots of medical content in its
emergency rooms but is really about the doctors, nurses and
patients involved.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the scientists did not see it that way. ``The
natural world is fascinating in its own right,'' said Dr. Richard
Dawkins, an Oxford University biologist and author of ``The Selfish
Gene'' and other books. ``It really doesn't need human drama to be
fascinating.'' In an interview after the meeting, Dawkins wondered
why ``Jurassic Park'' had to have any people in it at all when it
had dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Porco, a professor of planetary sciences at the
University of Arizona, said that too many movies with science
themes were about space battles in the future. ``It's always the
physical confrontation that TV and movies seem to harp on, when
science is the confrontation of ideas,'' she said. ``There's drama
just in the quest for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco was an adviser on the movie ``Contact,'' which starred
Jodie Foster as Ellie Arroway, an astronomer searching for life on
other planets. Dr. Porco said the movie presented a fairly
realistic portrait of a scientist, but she wondered why the
scriptwriters insisted Ellie have a love affair.
</P>
<P>
   She said an early version of the script had Ellie sleeping with
her thesis adviser. ``I know no one who has done that who is a
successful female scientist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists seemed to agree that some movies combined
scientific inquiry with emotion. One example was ``The Race for the
Double Helix,'' the story of Dr. Watson and Francis Crick's
competition with other scientists to decipher the structure of DNA.
Starring Jeff Goldblum as the young James Watson, it was shown on
cable television in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But such examples are rare. Anne Eisenberg, former dean of
humanities at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, surveyed 100
science-related movies made between 1984 and 1994 and found almost
none that portrayed scientists and their accomplishments in a
positive light. The most positive, she said, was ``Awakenings,'' in
which Robin Williams played a neurological researcher who helped
revive nearly catatonic patients.
</P>
<P>
   Steven L. Goldman, a professor of philosophy at Lehigh
University, found overwhelmingly negative depictions of science and
technology in 100 films made before the mid-1980s, starting with
Fritz Lang's ``Metropolis'' in 1926 and Charlie Chaplin's ``Modern
Times'' in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Star Wars,'' which is full of gee-whiz technology, ends
with Luke Skywalker defeating the Death Star by turning off his
computers and trusting the spiritual ``Force,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common themes, in movies from ``Frankenstein''
to ``Jurassic Park,'' is that of scientists trying to play God or
technology running amok, with deadly consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Mosquito Coast,'' Harrison Ford plays an engineer who
tries to impose ``straight lines and right angles'' on unruly
nature, only to have all he created destroyed in the end. The
premise of the ``Terminator'' movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
is that three billion human beings are destroyed in the future by
the computers created using a powerful microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   In other movies there are heartless scientists, like the ones
that wanted to dissect E.T. There are pawns of big corporations,
like those in ``The China Syndrome.'' There are demented criminals,
like Freeze and Poison Ivy in ``Batman and Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are absent-minded or clumsy nerds, as in ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Back to the Future,'' not to mention all
those films featuring awkward computer whizzes who can't get a
date.
</P>
<P>
   Even some laudatory movies show scientists as somewhat
emotionally detached. In ``Madame Curie,'' made in 1943, the famous
scientist does not react when her husband is killed. ``We know from
a letter that when they brought her husband's corpse in she hurled
herself at it and kissed it and cried,'' said Spencer Weart,
director of the Center for History of Physics at the American
Institute of Physics in College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent scientists are mistrusted as witches once were,
as people possessing secret knowledge or power, Weart said. But the
negative portrayals also reflect more concrete fears of the
possible consequences of science, particularly the atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was perceived in pop culture that science let the atom out
of the box and it was a scary thing,'' said John Copeland, the
producer of the television series ``Babylon 5.'' But Copeland said
he thought the portrayal of scientists was becoming somewhat more
favorable. ``We grew up watching the space program,'' he said. ``We
grew up inspired by a type of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year the Fox network will broadcast ``Killer App,'' the
pilot for a series about Silicon Valley created by the Doonesbury
cartoonist Garry Trudeau and the filmmaker Robert Altman.
</P>
<P>
   But other efforts still have a long way to go. Lederman, who won
the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988 for his work with Fermilab, was
able to gain audiences with the heads of some television networks a
few years ago, but his project has gone virtually nowhere since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to track down the first cousin of Steven
Spielberg's cleaning lady,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute of Engineers sent a proposal to David
Geffen, the Hollywood mogul, that was returned unopened, Gottlieb
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sloan Foundation hopes to have a script for the pilot within
a year, but Milch is still not sure he will be able to produce a
workable one. And of the first three student films awarded prizes
by Sloan, two portrayed tormented, antisocial scientists, the very
stereotype the foundation is trying to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The third film was not about science at all. The original
scientific content, the student director said, was removed from the
screenplay to make the picture more interesting.

CORPORATE OWNERS AND FAINTHEARTED PROGRAMMERS ARE KILLING RADIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although this is an essay about radio, it's appropriate that it
follows the reissue of a certain older movie. Because every time I
turn on a commercial music radio station these days, I feel my own
big chill.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1983, when ``The Big Chill'' was first in theaters, I
was part of a group of broadcasting students who _ like the movie's
characters when they were in college _ were idealistic, precocious
and ambitious. And, like the movie's characters, few of us followed
through on our promise, at least not in the way we expected to.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen of us staffed a campus radio station that was
piped directly into the dorms. We followed few rules; although the
station had some sort of playlist, most of us played what we wanted
to. It made for a lively mix of early hip-hop, small-label punk,
deep-cut classic rock and mainstream music.
</P>
<P>
   The station was called KVOF, the last three letters
optimistically standing for Voice of the Future. We were hardly the
voice of the future; only one person from that group still works in
radio. We were hardly the voice of the present; I used to joke that
the transmitter was made up of a shoe box, a couple of soda cans, a
double-A battery and a coat hanger. But it's precisely because we
didn't believe anyone was listening that we were so adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   Before and since, I've followed radio with an equal mix of
fascination and disgust. But it's not fair to assign the blame to
local radio _ it stinks all over, and I'm not the only one who
thinks that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I talk to in every city in America thinks that radio
in their town sucks,'' said Dan Halyburton, marketing manager for
Susquehanna Radio, which owns four Fort Worth-Dallas stations.
``You go to New York City or San Francisco, and they think they've
got the worst radio anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If people everywhere think radio is lame, why doesn't someone do
something to fix it? Radio-industry suits blame a raft of factors.
Car-radio presets and scan buttons come in high on the list, as do
the quarterly Arbitron ratings, which the stations use to set
advertising rates. Record-label pressure to play certain songs
comes up, as does FCC deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to sympathize. Since the passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed corporations to own
eight stations in a single market and hundreds nationwide, the
radio dial has turned into a Monopoly board. Companies such as
Irving, Texas-based Chancellor Media Corp. _ which owns six
Metroplex radio stations and nearly 465 nationwide _ have spent
millions and even billions on mergers and package buys. No wonder
they're playing it safe, with this much money being thrown around.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder they're playing it safe, with so much competition.
In the dial-busting Metroplex market, KHKS/106.1 FM (a k a KISS)
ruled the third-quarter Arbitrons with a 7.7 share _ less than 8
percent of the potential audience. Thomas Mocarsky, vice president
of communication for Arbitron, says that even a 2-share station can
make money.
</P>
<P>
   With everyone after such tiny pieces of the pie, stations are
taking the tack that familiarity breeds attraction. Abby Goldstein,
assistant program director for KKZN/93.3 FM (the Zone), explains
the reasoning this way: Most people listen to the radio in their
cars, during their commutes to and from work _ an average of three
to six songs (and that's if the DJs are unusually reticent).
Therefore, those songs had better be ones that keep people from
hitting the scan button. Which is why you hear the same songs over
and over.
</P>
<P>
   The people I know who are disenchanted with radio see it
differently; it's precisely because they hear the same songs over
and over that they're playing radio roulette, or that they've given
up altogether and turned to their car CD players. Their main
complaint is that they're not exposed to enough variety or novelty.
In other words, they're bored.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty years ago, my mother's mind went to battle
with Alzheimer's disease and lost. Last month scientists at New
York University Medical Center, in a hunt for clues to the blight
of her brain, spent three days looking at mine.
</P>
<P>
   It is because I survived the enormous effect of this illness in
my family that I was willing to undergo this investigation. Family
members of patients think of ourselves as survivors: We saw the
disease rage through our lives and turn children into parents, kill
spouses from exhaustion and financially devastate us along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But to science, we are also potential victims, statistically
more at risk than others. In our brains may be a key to
understanding the illness of our parents. But because of my mother,
I dreaded a diagnosis: What if they found in my brain the
premonitions of what happened to her?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at NYU's Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research
Laboratory have spent 20 years studying the spectrum of aging, from
normal live brains and healthy behavior through dementia and on to
autopsy. The lab's clinical director, Dr. Barry Reisberg, developed
the scales used worldwide to measure the ordinal losses of
abilities in Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that this summer, while I was at the lab with a
friend who was concerned about his own memory loss, that Dr. Mony
de Leon, the lab's research director and an acquaintance, said he
wanted to give me some tests.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the moment appears like an image in a zoom lens _ a
minute before I was not really there, off in the distance, safely
detached from being back in the place I had brought my mother and
attended years of family support groups.
</P>
<P>
   Safely distanced from the present, as well, I walked past the
freezers that limn the hallways, wondering which one held her
autopsied brain. I was also detached because of the enormous fear
that my dear friend might have what my mother had (he does not).
</P>
<P>
   But then I snapped into focusing on the fact that I was sweating
and stammering something to De Leon about being busy, being a
mother, living upstate.
</P>
<P>
   A work-up at the NYU lab, he explained, requires psychiatric,
neuropsychological and memory testing, as well as thorough
neurological and physical examinations and an MRI of the brain. ``I
want to study children of early-onset patients, in particular,'' De
Leon said, ``but I really want to have a look at everybody I can.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother was 49 when she lost the ability to make change. Soon
a daily search for her keys became a daily rage, and I would find
her, purse contents strewn about, shrieking that she was losing her
mind. She was. And for all that catastrophic behavior to be
occurring then, De Leon believes that there must have been a good
deal to show for it in her brain when she was 40. And 30. And maybe
even 20. To get a sense of her younger brain, the doctor asked to
have a look at mine.
</P>
<P>
   I left without giving him an answer. These tests are about
genetics, probability, and the organic changes in the brain that
might precede the illness. I didn't want to know if I had any of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Then I realized that if I didn't agree to be tested, I had no
right to expect anyone else would either. I called to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than four million Alzheimer's disease patients in
America. It is well known what the brain of a patient looks like at
death. Equally well documented are the losses of abilities that
occur in a predictable way. What is not known is the mechanism that
triggers the illness and when it starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know nothing about pre-Alzheimer's,'' De Leon told me.
``Five years ago, we realized that people in their 50s were showing
changes in the parts of the brain that are the gateway to all
memory. What we didn't know is those changes can be seen at 30. And
we never realized, until now, that we could identify who is going
to get memory change years before they do.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that I would be tracked for the rest of my life.
Every two years I would return to NYU for a psychiatric evaluation
and a physical follow-up. Every four years would be the three-day
review, including the magnetic resonance image. So this, like my
first mammogram, was to be a baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can now tell you the age of a living brain by looking at an
MRI as easily as I can tell your age from your face,'' De Leon
said. ``For years pathologists have been able to stage autopsied
brains. I am staging the living.''
</P>
<P>
   He does so by measuring the MRI images of those parts of the
brain associated with memory. These days his focus is on the
entorhinal cortex _ which he describes as ``a memory processing
center of the brain that funnels information to the hippocampus'' _
where the first lesions of Alzheimer's disease appear.
</P>
<P>
   I started at home, filling out a questionnaire about family
history, psychiatric well-being, memory and health, sleeping
patterns and alcohol and drug use. At the end of it I felt like a
normal, somewhat bemused, reasonable 42-year-old woman who should
never run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, the standard for an Alzheimer's work-up at NYU, would
take three days, which I chose to do consecutively. The first day
started with a psychiatric workup, which took about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It can take Alzheimer's patients nearly two hours. I was asked
to remember three words _ apple, book, chair _ and to name
childhood friends and teachers from grammar school. At the end of
the interview, I was asked to recall the three words. I did.
</P>
<P>
   I filled out an autopsy consent form and got a laminated
wallet-sized card that reads ``At the Time of Death'' in boldface
and gives instructions to call the funeral home affiliated with the
study when I die, so my brain can be studied after death. The card
is the same color as my American Express card, and it pleases me to
know that someday, at least, one will cancel out the other.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On to the Red Screen memory test. I defined 40 words accurately.
But when I was told 10 pairs of unrelated words, then asked to
recall the pairings, I performed dreadfully, and managed to recall
only 4. A researcher read a paragraph aloud, then asked me to
recite it. I managed only the first couple of sentences, a phrase
from the end, and not much in between. I felt a sense of panic.
</P>
<P>
   I did finger-tapping exercises for speed and accuracy.
Cognitively impaired people have poor motor control. Symbols on
flash cards tested my spatial memory and digit symbol substitution
required me to correctly choose symbols representing numbers one
through nine over and over again on a long page.
</P>
<P>
   A test measured my ability to recognize angles of lines; another
checked my category retrieval. (How many things could I name that
are worn on feet? What male names begin with F?) Then the
researcher asked again about those word pairs. I could remember
only two. I was scared.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen small tubes of blood were drawn from my arm at the
beginning of the second day. The glucose metabolism mechanism is
disturbed in Alzheimer's disease and so my glucose will be checked.
</P>
<P>
   Among the blood tests will also be a screening for the ApoE, or
apolipo protein, to see which type I carry. Type four is now
considered a susceptibility factor for the disease, although not
either causative or predictive.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the Wechsler Memory Scale test: counting backward,
reciting the alphabet, multiplying figures and remembering drawings
that looked like cubist paintings. My figurative memory seemed to
get better with practice.
</P>
<P>
   When the researcher announced that a word pairs test was next, I
was ready. I aced it: all 10 right.
</P>
<P>
   There were more exercises: numbers backward and forward,
patterns to remember. And 40 minutes later, the word pairs
returned. Aced it again. All 10.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down the hall toward my neurological exam, I ran into De
Leon. ``I hear you're doing great,'' he said. Maybe I was.
</P>
<P>
   The neurological exam tested more than 200 items, including
language, left-right orientation, sensory perception, gait, posture
and reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   The neurologist was stroking my top lip with a plastic picnic
knife. I asked him what he was looking for. ``The sucking reflex,''
he said. Alzheimer's disease, he explained, is the reverse of
normal human development.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with the loss of the ability to hold a job and handle
simple finances _ I remembered my mother's inability to make change
_ and the regression continues, as patients lose the ability to
dress, to control bowels and bladders, to speak five or six words,
then one word, then even sit up, smile and hold up their heads.
During this reversal, reflex responses return _ such as sucking.
</P>
<P>
   I suddenly remembered that early in her illness, my mother made
sucking sounds, and puckered up if her face was touched. Now I knew
why.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a thorough physical exam, then, in the computer lab,
tests that resemble computer games, then oral exams after that,
checking my understanding of idiom and literal commands. I left the
lab at 4:30 p.m. It had been a long day.
</P>
<P>
   The third and final day began with Marnie, the tester who had
seen me fail so miserably on the first day with word-pair
association and paragraph recall. By computer and then verbally, my
recognition and memory were gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Marnie read me a list of 10 grocery items. I remembered 6. She
read them again. I got 8. Then all 10. More computer testing. Then
the grocery items again. Got 8. Studied the list. Got 10. Could I
alphabetize them in my head? I could. On the first try.
</P>
<P>
   Finally came the MRI. That image, compared to my test results,
will give us a complete picture of who I am. The researchers will
know what my brain looked like at this age and how my memory
exhibited itself.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how I progress.
</P>
<P>
   I called De Leon a week later. ``Oh, I'm just sitting here
looking at your brain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, Doc,'' I said, hesitantly, ``how does it look?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks great,'' he said. ``See you in two years.''
</P>

EASTERN THIRD OF U.S. CAN CATCH THE SHUTTLE'S GLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOE RAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Space fans who have always yearned to see a rocket launching but
could never venture to Cape Canaveral will get a great chance, of
sorts, early Thursday morning, when the space shuttle Endeavour is
scheduled to blast off with the second component of the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   Because of unusual circumstances _ the tilt of Endeavour's
orbit, the direction of the launching and a rare nighttime takeoff
_ observers in the eastern third of the United States will be able
to see the shuttle's glow as it bores up into a 245-mile-high
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Around New York, it should be visible about seven minutes after
the launching, set for 3:59 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, shuttles are launched into orbits inclined at 28.5
degrees to the Equator, or straight to the east from Cape
Canaveral. But the International Space Station is to have an orbit
inclined at 51.6 degrees so that it can be reached from the Russian
launching pads in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The first piece of the space station, a module called Zarya, was
launched from there on Nov. 20. To connect with the nascent
station, Endeavour, with a six-member crew aboard for an 11-day
flight, will be launched to the northeast, adjacent to the Eastern
Seaboard of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Given good weather, people within a radius of 475 miles of the
Kennedy Space Center will be able to see the opening 128 seconds of
the mission. Then, the shuttle will be visible because of its two
solid booster rockets, whose brilliant orange-yellow plumes shine
roughly half as bright as the sun. For Florida communities near the
launch site, the night will briefly be turned into day as Endeavour
rises into space.
</P>
<P>
   According to the flight plan, the solid rocket boosters will
shut down and be discarded two minutes into the flight, but the
shuttle should continue to be visible, though not as bright, by
virtue of the light from the three main engines on the orbiter
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The main engines will fire for about 8.5 minutes after liftoff,
and will be cut off when the shuttle reaches an altitude of about
70 miles, roughly 200 miles east of Atlantic City. Then, racing at
about 17,000 miles an hour, the shuttle should be visible within a
900-mile radius as the main engines are shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, observers should concentrate on the
southeast horizon beginning about seven minutes after the shuttle
lifts off from Florida. It should become visible as a bright,
pulsating yellow-orange star that will appear to race rapidly
toward the east. The shuttle's altitude will be rather low, only
about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon at maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle launchings have been visible from the New York region
before. On Feb. 28, 1990, the shuttle Atlantis was visible along
much of the Atlantic Seaboard soon after it lifted off with a spy
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Covault, an editor at Aviation Week and Space Technology,
saw the vehicle from Washington and described it as ``a bright,
V-shaped rocket plume moving northward at high velocity.'' At this
point, about 8 minutes into the flight, Atlantis was 60 miles high
and moving at a velocity of Mach 25, or 25 times the speed of
sound.
</P>
<P>
   When the main engine cut off, the plume disappeared, but the
thruster firings to move the orbiter away from the large external
fuel tank were visible, Covault said.
</P>
<P>
   Total darkness is not always necessary to see the shuttle. The
Discovery was launched in bright twilight on Sept. 12, 1991. Then,
people as far north as New York reported seeing both the glow of
the main engines and sunlight reflected off the shuttle itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the magazine Sky &AMP; Telescope, John Bortle, a contributing
editor, described seeing the shuttle from his home in Dutchess
County, N.Y. ``The shuttle showed the most amazing structure,'' he
wrote, ``looking like a bright star with multiple gas jets trailing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to Thursday's launching, a NASA spokesman, Bruce
Buckingham, said: ``If you see it, it will look like a large star
moving fast.''

HOW COMPUTERS CONNECT FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>
  By BRONWYN FRYER 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 6-year-old Derek Fearon, who lives in a New York City
suburb, lost his first tooth, he longed to show his stubby white
prize to his grandmother, ``Bubbe.'' It hardly mattered that she
lived in Boca Raton, Fla. His mother simply turned on the computer
and clicked on an icon. In seconds, Derek could see and hear his
grandma as if she were in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed it to me and said, 'Look, Bubbe!''' recalls Derek's
grandmother, Judith Levy. 'What's better than seeing the face of my
grandchild?'''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a century ago, the telephone began to alter forever the
way human beings communicate. Today, the Internet is retracing the
telephone's path, not only changing the way we go about our
business but also transforming the way we keep in touch with our
loved ones. Electronic mail, videophones and family web pages are
allowing us to maintain close contact at a minimal cost, regardless
of distance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Videophones: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Levy's thrice-weekly conversations with grandson Derek are
hardly the stuff of science fiction. They come courtesy of
videophone technology _ in this case, Intel's Create &AMP; Share Camera
Pack. The camera pack, which ranges in price from $149 to $300
(each party must have one), provides everything a computer-equipped
family needs for those virtual family get-togethers. Kodak's DVC
323 ($169) is another good choice.
</P>
<P>
   For Marcy Fearon, mother of Derek and 3-year-old Dylan, the
videophone has already transformed the family. ``Grandmother is no
longer someone the children hear about once in a while,'' she says.
``It's like she's actually in the house. It's a real blessing for
the children, who don't get to be with their grandparents very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Videophone technology typically consists of a camera that mounts
on a computer monitor, a video capture card that is inserted in a
slot inside the computer, and software that places calls and
transmits video images over a regular telephone fine.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the quality of the sound and picture can be
iffy. Also, the person on the other end has to be compatibly
equipped, and the telephone line must be working well. Some
technical novices find the installation and setup daunting. (Levy
had a technician install hers.) And the technical requirements are
generally too stiff for anything less than a fully equipped
multimedia computer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Family websites: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Steve and Leslie C. brought their new baby boy to their San
Francisco home, Steve's coworkers gave him a gift that keeps on
giving: a family website. ``I got the baby shower, and Steve got
the site,'' Leslie says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Steve and Leslie's site boasts regularly updated pictures
of their son, Sam, who now 1 1/2. As the child has grown from
infancy to toddlerhood, Leslie's brother in Massachusetts and
sister in Southern California have been able to see how he's
filling out and to share milestones _ like Sam's finally surpassing
the size of the family cat!
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to set up a website. With software like IBM's
deluxe version of the 1999 World Book Multimedia Encyclopedia
($70), families can employ easy-to-use templates to create their
own individual, group, or newsletter-style pages. The software also
helps families research information from the World Book to include
on their sites, like facts about the breed of the family dog, and
create links to other, related sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scanners: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To get your snapshots up on a site, the best way to go would be
to use a desktop scanner; these are now priced at $200 or less and
produce crisp color reproductions of ordinary photos. Just plug the
scanner into your computer and load the companion software. Place a
photo on the scanner, close the lid, click a button on your
computer screen, and voila: Your photo is digitized, suitable for
electronic use.
</P>
<P>
   Good scanners include the HP ScanJet 5100C ($299) and the AGFA
SnapScan EZ ($129). Once you have your digital pictures, you can
post them to your site.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet service providers offer free website service.
America Online, for one, gives its members free space for a site
and a simple, easy-to-use tool with which to build it. The effort
is worth it. Compared with the cost of developing, copying and
mailing photos, posting to a site is a real bargain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; E-mail: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most families with home computers have discovered that
electronic mail is an inexpensive alternative to the telephone.
Kelly and Kevin Jones of West Jordan, Utah, have discovered that
it's also a great way to send quick pictures of their three small
children _ Bryson, 3, Addisen, 2, and Corbin, 7 months _ without
having to pay for film, processing and postage.
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses, who use a free e-mail service called theglobe.com,
regularly send text messages to the children's great-grandmother in
Springfield, Ore., and to their maternal grandparents in Portland.
``Today I sent my in-laws a message telling them how Bryson was
putting Addisen to bed,'' says their father. When he's finished
with his own message, he places Bryson on his lap and allows the
little boy to add a few lines of keyboard gobbledygook.
</P>
<P>
   When the text message is complete, Jones can attach a picture to
it. For this purpose he uses a tool from Play Inc. called Snappy
Video Snapshot, a $99 video grabber that plugs into the computer's
printer port. Jones plugs the family's video camera into a jack on
the computer; then he and his wife pose with the kids in front of
the camera. When they see an image they like, ``we just click the
mouse and the frame gets saved on the computer,'' he explains. Then
he selects the ``attach file'' option in his e-mail software,
clicks on the ``send'' button, and the photo arrives on
grandmother's desktop in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jones notes that e-mail is an ideal communication tool for
young, budget-conscious families like his. ``It's a quick, easy,
inexpensive way to keep up with our family,'' he says. ``And that's
really been wonderful.''

FOREVER MISS PICKLES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of the author and her potbellied pig, Presten.
Also a sidebar with address of L'il Orphan Hammies. 
 By LISA TRYTKO 
 c.1998 WE magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My name is Lisa Trytko, and I am 18 years old and live in Mount
Morris, Mich. I was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Not long
after potbellied pigs were introduced into the United States, I
knew that this was the pet for me. My father, however, was not so
easily convinced, and as time passed I gave up all hope of ever
receiving my wish.
</P>
<P>
   Then while I was away at summer camp, I received a letter from
my mother that said she was caring for the cutest baby girl. I
thought it strange my mother would take up baby-sitting. As I read
further, she elaborated: She was, in fact, caring for a 6-month-old
potbellied piglet. Best of all, she said it was my piglet. I was
overjoyed!
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after I arrived home, I had the privilege of the
very first visit with Miss Pickles, named by my mother, who had
noticed that her body formed the shape of a marinated cucumber.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Pickles grew fond of me and I of her, and we became the
best of friends. One of her favorite pastimes, naturally, was
eating, during which her unique personality came into play. When
she got her dinner, she made such a careful effort not to make a
mess, and she especially loved when I dropped spare watermelons and
cucumbers into her pen.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, her all-time favorite treat was mine as well. I
visited the pen of Miss Pickles as often as I could, bringing along
an enormous bag of marshmallows. As I offered them to her, she
would take them tenderly from my hands. Then, she gently licked off
the little sticky bits remaining on my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   She also had one odd trait: She despised getting her trotters
muddy. Whenever she did, her face twisted into an expression of
disgust. Then she carefully picked up a foot as she attempted to
clean it. Every time my mother cleaned her pen, she ran around it
oinking, as if to say, ``You missed this spot. And that one!''
</P>
<P>
   At about this time, I was in junior high school and my grades
were slipping because of kids who saw nothing in me but my
disability. They would tease me relentlessly and I would become
extremely stressed, which, in turn, caused me to go into seizures.
My constant comfort throughout the seventh and eighth grades was
Miss Pickles. I would confess my crisis of the day while she and I
munched on marshmallows. As I poured my heart out, her tall swished
and she oinked, as if attempting to give me counsel.
</P>
<P>
   I thought my guiding light would be with me all my life, but
life had other things in store.
</P>
<P>
   One day my mother had the vet come out for Miss Pickles' first
health examination and shots. The vet had to sedate her in order to
complete the examination, then gave her a clean bill of health. The
forecast was cold for the night, so the vet recommended we bring
her inside until the anesthetic wore off and then return her to her
pen.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I was opening my eyes the next morning, I heard mumbling
voices, then a cry, and, slowly, my mother entered my room to tell
me Miss Pickles had died in the night. As I heard those words, the
walls of security and happiness that had surrounded me shattered.
Grief entered my world.
</P>
<P>
   Mom had bookmarked a website where owners of potbellied pigs
from around the world share stories about their pets. She posted my
story, and then e-mails of condolence poured in.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the generous offers of new pigs was one from Sue
Parkinson of L'il Orphan Hammies, a nonprofit, potbellied pig
sanctuary in Solvang, Calif., where her lifework is caring for
abandoned and disabled potbellied pigs. She said her own beloved
PJ, short for Pete junior, had died recently, and I could have not
one but two piglets!
</P>
<P>
   Once again, after many months of being pigless, I arrived home
from camp, this time to two special bundles, Presten and Westen.
Presten, on hearing the word ``circle'' as he's handed a treat, is
a downright showoff, spinning in circles like a tornado. Westen is
endearing but shy. The Boys, as we call them, recently learned to
swim in a kiddy pool in their pen.
</P>
<P>
   Caring for Presten and Westen brings me joy now and enables most
of the void within my heart to be filled. Part of it will never be,
and it is there that my cherished memories of Miss Pickles will
always rest in peace.

TIMELESS ADVICE ON AGING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Old age is the new rage. That was apparent even before John
Glenn, aged 77, went up into space. There are more old people than
ever. Many of them have word processors. Many of those pass their
free time writing. And, following the advice of all teachers of
writing, they write about what they know, which is old age. So
there is a lot of writing on that subject. Even Jimmy Carter has
written a book about old age.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to keep up with this trend, I have just reread the
classic on the subject, Marcus Tullius Cicero's ``De Senectute.''
The last time I read it was 68 years ago. I read it then in Latin.
Today I read it in the wonderful Loeb Classic Library edition, with
the Latin on the left page and the English on the right. I read the
right page.
</P>
<P>
   I can hardly believe that I read it in Latin when I was a junior
in high school. And I can't imagine what I learned about old age,
reading it in my teens. We didn't read ``De Senectute'' to learn
about old age. My Latin teacher believed that reading Latin _ any
Latin _ made tiny grooves in your brain that increased your general
intelligence _ not just your capacity to read Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero wrote the essay in 44 B.C., when he was 62 years old. One
might think that was pretty old for a Roman of that time, but
Cicero evidently didn't think it was old enough to qualify him to
discourse on the subject. He wrote in the voice of Cato the Elder
in the year 150 B.C., when Cato was 84 years old. In fact, Cicero
did not live to experience much old age. The year after writing the
essay he was executed for being on the wrong side of a political
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The essay consists of a long answer by Cato to questions posed
by two younger men, one 35 and one 36. They ask him ``on what
principles we may most easily support the weight of increasing
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato breaks down the question. He identifies four reasons why
old age appears to be an unhappy time: First, it withdraws us from
active pursuits. Second, it makes the body weaker. Third, it
deprives us of all physical pleasures. And fourth, it is not far
removed from death.
</P>
<P>
   He then discusses these four concerns. Translating the answers
into the English of 1998, they almost all consist of saying that
the quality of one's old age depends on the investments one made in
earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   I don't refer, and Cicero didn't either, to financial
investments that assure one a comfortable income in old age.
(Cicero came from a wealthy family.) I am sure that financial
investments are important, and I don't suppose Cicero would have
denied that. But there are other kinds of investments implicit in
Cicero's discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is investment in one's health and bodily
strength. I don't think the Romans of Cicero's time had a cigarette
problem. But it seems clear from the examples he gives that having
a satisfactory old age depends on adequacy of physical exercise and
moderation of eating and drinking in the years before.
</P>
<P>
   Another investment important for old age is friendships. Cicero
has Cato say, ``I have always had my club companions.'' Cato takes
pride in having been instrumental, when he was 30 years old, in
establishing certain clubs in Rome, ``and therefore I used to dine
with these companions _ in an altogether moderate way, yet with a
certain ardor appropriate to my age, which, as time goes on, daily
mitigates my zest for every pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a Stoic, Cicero-Cato does not regret but rather welcomes
the decline of appetite for what he calls ``sensual'' pleasure. He
praises the value of the intellectual and aesthetic pleasures in
which an old man can still indulge. But to fully appreciate art,
science and nature in old age requires some prior investment in
cultivating them.
</P>
<P>
   An even older source reminds me of an investment for old age at
which Cicero only hints. Genesis 24:1 says, ``And Abraham was old,
well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all
things.'' According to my rabbi (I don't want to pretend to be a
student of such things), later commentators said that meant that
Abraham was blessed with the recognition that he had passed the
trials of his life with valor and devotion and could now enjoy a
peaceful retirement, content in his own eyes and in the eyes of
God.
</P>
<P>
   He had, in today's parlance, paid his dues. That is another
investment one can make for old age: so to conduct oneself in prior
years that one can feel one has paid one's dues.
</P>
<P>
   On the final question of how to invest to prepare for the
proximity of death in old age, Cicero is not very helpful. (Who
is?) He offers his ``philosophical'' view. Death brings at least an
end to those troublesome appetites and may open the way to
something better _ he doesn't say what.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one could indoctrinate oneself in that attitude in youth
and so prepare for old age. But obviously Cicero did not find that
philosophy sufficient. As the introduction to the Loeb edition
says, ``In February 45 (a year before he wrote ``De Senectute'')
the death of his adored and only daughter drove him into a frenzy
of writing in an effort to forget his grief.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not accept the fact of his daughter Tullia's death with
the thought that she had at least escaped all appetites. His
philosophy might have prepared him for his own death; it did not
prepare him for the death of one he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Later he wrote an essay titled ``Consolatio,'' which probably
dealt with this subject and which I have not read. If he was
rescued from his grief, it was apparently time and work, not
philosophy, that rescued him.

AMERICAN AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
  By NORMA BLAIR 
 c.1998 Ann Normansell 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the problems with moving to a foreign country is learning
the language. After nearly 30 years in the U.S. I still find myself
using expressions that produce blank stares from my listeners.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example of this came when I pronounced myself
``a little peckish,'' and saw the familiar glazed expression
appear. When I appealed to a bystander he was able to provide a
translation, but the experience brought home to me the fact that
the English and the Americans are more divided than united by their
common language.
</P>
<P>
   In self-defense one has to adopt certain terms for use in
everyday life. Thus I wash my windshield, not my windscreen, and
stash stuff in the trunk rather than the boot. I also check my
``skedule'' rather than my ``shed-yule'' if asked to do something,
which may be the reason that I am accused of ``talking American''
when I visit England, even though I am immediately tabbed as a
foreigner over here.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I have yet to understand, though, is why I am
sometimes called ``veddy British.'' Is that really how the English
``very'' is heard? Shortly after we came to Virginia, I was
chatting with the mailman (not the postman!) and happened to
mention that we were from England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's where you're from, is it?'' he replied. ``I thought
you were from one of those Northern states.''
</P>
<P>
   In England I had similar problems. While in college I got a
summer job at the seaside with a family who had a 12-year-old boy
and a 6-year-old girl. Being from the north of England, I build
sand castles (short ``a'') rather than cahstles.
</P>
<P>
   One day we were discussing home towns and, when the fact of my
northern origin emerged, the 6-year-old said, ``Oh, is that why you
don't speak English?''
</P>
<P>
   My acclimatization began on the day that we arrived in
Charlottesville, when we were welcomed into a colleague's home and
our children were offered ``peanut butter and jelly.'' Since jelly
is a gelatine dessert in England, and no mention was made of
``sandwich,'' I had a very strange vision of what was being
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterwards I realized that my English might be more
archaic than the local norm. I told one of the children in that
same household not to ``tread'' on something (not a snake!) and got
the soon-to-be-familiar blank stare. Her mother, a Tennessean who
became a good friend, recommended that I use ``step'' or ``walk''
instead.
</P>
<P>
   She was the person who said ``You have to be kidding!'' when I
said ``aluminium'' instead of ``aluminum.'' Yes, there really is an
extra ``i'' in the word in England, and it is one of the few words
I have learned to pronounce differently. Others, like ``tomayto,''
``vite-amin,'' and the Greek letters ``bayta,'' ``thayta,'' etc.
have been more difficult to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise slurring ``t's'' into ``d's.'' When our daughter went
to nursery school, she brought home tales of a child named
``Doddy,'' which seemed an unusual name for a girl. I knew it as
the nickname of the English comedian Ken Dodd, he of the buck teeth
and electric shock hair, who was popular then. It was not until I
met ``Marty,'' pronounced ``Mardy,'' that I made the connection and
realized that I had been hearing about ``Dottie.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, I was totally confounded when I met another ``Marty''
whose name turned out to be ``Mardie.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping can also be an interesting experience. When I asked
where I might find a ``Thermos flask'' in K-Mart, I got a very odd
look until the assistant divined that I might be looking for a
``Thermos bottle.'' And I would love to have been there when a
fellow alien asked for batteries for her ``torch'' _ it wasn't even
Olympic season!
</P>
<P>
   I have learned to avoid the obvious pitfalls, like abbreviating
pussycat, but I still goof at times when talking about waking
people up in the mornings. Long before alarm clocks and telephone
wake-up calls, there was a person in the north of England who
walked the streets in the predawn hours, carrying a long pole with
which he tapped on upper storey windows. His official title was
``the Knocker-up.''

WRITER EXPLORES THE MEANING OF AMERICAN HIP-HOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More white kids may buy rap records, but the
phenomenon of hip-hop culture has created a black urban economy in
the form of jobs for the first post-soul generation.
</P>
<P>
   And hip-hop is not going to die any time soon, according to
Nelson George _ hip-hop's most prolific and perhaps best chronicler
_ despite wishes from adults who range from Tipper Gore to C.
Delores Tucker who react to rap's most extreme forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap entrepreneurs are an important economic tool in the black
community,'' George said during the San Francisco Bay Area Book
Festival. ``Rap has generated thousands and thousands of jobs for
twentysomethings who may not be that skilled.''
</P>
<P>
   George has written eight nonfiction books on African-American
culture and two novels. ``Hip Hop America'' is his latest effort, a
neatly written account of the collision between black youth street
culture and mass media and its effect on consumers, mainstream
culture and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Look around, argued George.
</P>
<P>
   Gangsta-style movies and graffiti have spawned in-your-face
attitudes that mark the first generation after the civil rights
era. Hip-hop culture's most noted form, rap music, has engulfed
America, spilling its influence over into art (graffiti), fashion
(baggy pants), sports (Allan Iverson) and advertising (almost any
sneaker commercial). It's all about mixing street skills and
technology, George said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing for adults to fear. George reminds us that
it's just ``age and responsibilities changing your perception,''
just as baby-boomers parents' minds were altered by 1950s blues
music and later, rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``New music of any generation is always scary to the parents,''
said George, at 43 a baby-boomer who has kept up with youth
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only afraid of hip-hop in its extreme aspects _ like
your parents were afraid of Black Sabbath. You're not afraid of
your kids listening to Lauren Hill. If they like movies, they're
watching `Halloween' Part 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hip-hop creates mental pictures. In rap, it's just young black
men telling these stories. Run DMC said it loud _ a yelling black
man is a scary thing to some people, especially if they're wearing
black.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of the public attention-grabbing, misogynist
lyrics and violent tales of urban life, rap music has produced a
ghetto industry. ``Bad Boy (Records) had 20 to 30 (black employees)
inside the office in mail rooms, as secretaries and assistants.
Street teams plaster the street with fliers and stickers. On the
road, stylists, makeup artists and truck drivers. Not all (those
jobs) go to black people but a lot of them do,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   As people moved up, others were hired to repeat the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Master P. employs people. A black woman manages his recording
studio. No way that happens if Puffy (Sean Combs, aka Puff Daddy)
doesn't exist. He owns a restaurant now _ more jobs. Next year a
clothing line. Russell Simmons employs people in jobs that wouldn't
exist without the music,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are young black attorneys, black accountants. You notice
it more and more. You forget how much money is spilled off by
success. That hip-hop is a positive economic force can't be
disputed and it's not just the artist. People around them are the
beneficiaries. There's no Vibe (magazine) without hip-hop.''
</P>
<P>
   George grew up in Brooklyn, where his mother taught him to read
before he attended elementary school. Her success inspired her to
become a schoolteacher, which allowed her to move the family to a
better section of Brooklyn. In Brownsville, the neighborhood was a
bit more middle-class, George said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found language seductive,'' George said, referring to his
early attraction to the writing of Ernest Hemingway and Claude
Brown, author of ``Manchild in the Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   But his first spark to write came from reading Richard Wright
and New Journalism gurus Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese, New York
newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin and Esquire magazine. Reading a
review of a Brothers Johnson concert, which he thought showed the
reviewer didn't understand the music, led him to music writing.
After stacks of rejection letters from Rolling Stone and The
Village Voice, he began writing about hip-hop as an intern at New
York's largest black weekly, the Amsterdam News in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``My true entry into hip-hop happened in 1978,'' wrote George in
his latest book. ``I was ordering lunch when a teen-ager came
strutting by with his ghetto blaster cranked to 10. ... He was
jamming a tape with a man talking very fast in rhyme over, I
believe, `Love Is the Message.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was a homemade tape that urban rappers sold from the trunks
of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   It formed an underground musical economy.
</P>
<P>
   And as George has duly noted, it was the changing of the guard,
the passing of the torch from the civil rights and soul generation
to the first post-soul and post civil rights generation.
</P>
<P>
   As George documents hip-hop, he provides insight into this new
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-soul kids grew up with the Vietnam War. Their fathers
came back with drugs and bad dreams _ if they came back at all,''
George writes in the new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they grew up, both the black middle class and the black
lower class expanded; they grew up with Wall Street greed, neo-con
ideology, Atari Gameboys, crack, AIDS, Afrocentricity and Malcolm X
as movie hero, political icon and marketing vehicle. They saw
Nelson Mandela walk out of jail and Mike Tyson walk in. Some say
this is the first generation of black Americans to experience
nostalgia. And it all showed up in the music.''

UNDATED: they're bored. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A handful of commercial Metroplex stations do their jobs well;
oddly, they're the ones that many listeners look on with disdain.
Older listeners may dismiss KISS as a teeny-bopper station, but it
calls itself Top 40, and that's what it plays _ and although its
rotation at times seems unusually tight, at least the songs it
plays over and over are fresh songs. KDMX/102.9 (The Mix) brags
that it plays a mix of the '80s and '90s, and that's just what it
does. KEGL/97.1 FM (The Eagle) is the place to turn for hard rock,
and after a brief flirtation with lighter bands such as the
Wallflowers, it has toughened its format and sought out some rarely
heard album cuts.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the FM stations that make my stomach tighten up
when I listen. It's the other stations, which are loaded with
promise but short on delivery: classic-rock and oldies stations
that have reduced 40 years of rock 'n' roll to 1,000 songs or
fewer; stations that brag about being ``cutting edge'' and then
play a song that's 15 years old; ``Texas country'' stations that
play more Garth and Alabama than Jerry Jeff and Lyle;
adult-alternative stations that start off adventurously, only to
fold their hands after two or three bad ratings books.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers at these stations will tell you that they're just
doing what their audiences want. I must not know many people from
their audiences, because nobody I've talked to disagrees with my
criticisms. I can't help but think that the reason many people have
burned out on oldies and classic rock is that they're sick not of
the artists, but of the same old songs. If 20,000 people see Steve
Miller at Starplex every year, you'd think they'd be open to
hearing something besides ``Fly Like an Eagle'' or ``Jet Airliner''
_ ``The Stake,'' say, or maybe ``Sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ``jammin' oldies'' station Magic 102 is drawing baby
boomers because the station plays great music that we haven't heard
on the radio in years (it's an outrage, really, that Stevie Wonder,
Sly and the Family Stone and the Temptations, among others, aren't
considered ``classic rock,'' when they put out some of the best
music of the '60s and '70s). But Magic 102, not even 3 months old,
is already lapsing into the repetitive patterns of other oldies
stations. And I'd almost be willing to bet that, unless the station
does phenomenally well in its first-year ratings, it will begin to
blend in some ballad-heavy contemporary soul music, as rivals
KRVB/100.3 FM and KRNB/105.3 FM have done.
</P>
<P>
   Halyburton is right; any of these kvetches could apply to radio
in just about any medium-to-large market, although I wonder if the
people who tell you that listeners here aren't as sophisticated as
ones in, say, San Francisco or Austin, aren't giving the fans here
enough credit. Junior Brown packs Billy Bob's, but just try to hear
him on commercial radio; Barenaked Ladies sells out the Bronco
Bowl, but from the way ``One Week'' has been driven into the ground
this year, you'd never know that the group had more than one song
(and has been around for several years). Obviously, these groups
and others have a local following, but commercial-radio exposure to
them is slim or nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Radio isn't alone in playing to the lowest common denominator _
all media, including newspapers, do it, as does the fast-food
industry and almost any other commercial endeavor you can name. But
radio is the biggest underachiever, the most afraid to take risks.
During the past few years, movies and TV have broadened their
horizons with challenging independent and even network fare.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, observers will tell you, is different because it's a
passive medium _ background noise or music to sing along to. I like
to sing along with the car radio myself, but I also want to be
surprised every now and then, and that's happening with increasing
rarity. Maybe, instead of bowing to the ratings and the
advertisers, someone will eventually take a tip from my campus
radio station: Pretend no one is listening, and play something
exciting again.

ESSAY ON CLINTON PROMPTS ANGRY RESPONSE FROM BAPTISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do President Clinton's sexual sins have a connection with his
Baptist upbringing? Newsweek religion correspondent Kenneth L.
Woodward posed that question Nov. 2 in an essay, ``Sex, Sin and
Salvation,'' that brought a flood of responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand Clinton the president, you have to meet Bill the
Baptist, a believer whose faith leaves plenty of license,'' a
subheadline declared.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward theorizes that the Baptist doctrine of ``soul
competency'' that Clinton was taught as an adolescent _ combined
with the belief ``once saved, always saved'' _ could be interpreted
as almost a libertarian doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that having a doctrine like soul
competency _ saying I can interpret the Bible for myself _ combined
with the radical individualism of the Baptist faith can be
translated into a kind of immunity'' from sinful behavior, Woodward
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's essay was fiercely criticized by many Baptists,
including Toby Druin, editor of the Baptist Standard, the Texas
Baptist news journal.
</P>
<P>
   Druin especially objected to Woodward's statement that moderate
Southern Baptists view Clinton as ``both a flawed follower of
Christ and an exemplary Baptist president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no Baptist, moderate or otherwise, who would say he
has been an `exemplary' Baptist president,'' Druin wrote in a Nov.
11 editorial. ``Most I know are embarrassed to share the name
`Baptist' with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptists are known for bans on alcohol, gambling and other
worldly activities. Some still see dancing as a sin. A Baptist
program, ``True Love Waits,'' asks young people to sign pledges
promising they won't have sex before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward says Baptist doctrines of freedom of conscience
leave room for immature Christians to think they are free to
indulge in all kinds of behavior, including sexual experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said in an interview that many who become Christians
before reaching puberty _ including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans
and members of other faiths _ have trouble reconciling what they
are taught in church with the sexual urges they have later.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a profession of faith as a 7-year-old in a Hot
Springs Baptist church. He was taught that individuals have the
final say in how they interpret the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus seemed to be telling imaginative Baptist teen-agers that
they could work out their own personal rules, permitting some forms
of sexual experimentation without feeling guilty,'' Woodward wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I looked at specifically was how these doctrines related
to Bill Clinton growing up as an adolescent Baptist,'' Woodward
said. ``When Clinton said `I didn't go all the way,' I learned that
many Baptists, as adolescents, went through similar kinds of
experiences. But the difference is, Clinton gave those same kinds
of explanations when he got caught as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek received more that 200 E-mail responses to the ``Bill
the Baptist'' essay, much more than the responses to the cover
story. Most were critical, Woodward admitted.
</P>
<P>
   But one Philadelphia woman, the daughter of a Baptist minister
who said she was of the same generation as Clinton, wrote that
Woodward's essay made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found your article right on and can wholeheartedly confirm
your explanation behind our president's rationalizing of his `lies'
regarding his sexual activity of late,'' Bonnie Bergey said in a
letter published Nov. 23. ``From the get-go, many honest Baptists,
or former Baptists, saw in Bill's `fudging' the tactics employed in
our Baptist adolescence. That, plus the inability to lose one's
salvation, makes temptation more tempting.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter from a Southern Baptist executive, Robert E. Reccord,
complained to Newsweek of Woodward's ``cavalier'' portrayal of
Baptist doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodward suggests that Baptist doctrine somehow legitimizes
extramarital sexual conduct by providing `considerable room for
maneuvering' to full-blooded youth like the adolescent Clinton,''
wrote Reccord, president of the Southern Baptist North American
Mission Board.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's provocative article won't convince many Southern
Baptists that their doctrine about soul freedom is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Caldwell Giles of Raleigh, N.C., reminded Newsweek
editors that former President Jimmy Carter, also a Southern
Baptist, confessed to Playboy magazine that he had lusted after
women, thereby committing the sin of adultery in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the version of adultery I remember being taught as a
Baptist teen-ager,'' Giles said. ``Not the
fill-in-the-blank-to-define-your-sin variety that you seem to feel
most Baptists espouse.''

RECALLING THE UNKNOWNS OF THE SPACE PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six men and one woman stood before the world that October day,
decked out in their impressive NASA flight suits, prepared to be
thrust into the heavens with an unwavering confidence in man and
machine that most people are hard pressed to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are also hard pressed, despite the overwhelming
media coverage, to name six of the seven astronauts who were aboard
the space shuttle Discovery last month as it circled the globe on
its 3.6 million-mile mission. Sure, everyone knows John Glenn. Even
youngsters who were born decades after his historic 1962 orbit of
the Earth in Friendship 7 know the name John Glenn. He's a true
American hero, right up there with Abe Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   But were it not for the inclusion of the 77-year-old senator
from Ohio, the activities in southern Florida as Discovery lifted
off on Oct. 29 would have garnered scant attention, and few would
have been so enthralled with daily updates on the crew's progress
before and after its Nov. 7 return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new for pioneers and innovators _ they are used
to working in anonymity. The nameless, faceless men who risked
their lives as Cold War test pilots in the pursuit of science and
military might for the United States were no exception _ yet they
were exceptional people.
</P>
<P>
   America paid little attention to the activities at Edwards Air
Force Base in Southern California decades ago, when experimental
flights were making possible what would one day be Glenn's first
trip into space. The men toiled in obscurity, their actions known
by few outside their families and the controlled circle of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, the United States didn't want the rest of the
world to know what was going on in the deserts of California and
New Mexico. As the Cold War simmered in the international
spotlight, engineers and scientists worked in secret to develop the
next generation of flying machines that could deliver lethal cargo
if need be.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of what America would do if forced into a position of
defense was backed up by real weapons. The world is just now
finding out that much of the Soviet threat during those years was
little more than theatrics and facades.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the scrutiny of America's media, young test pilots
daily stepped into massive pieces of machinery, great hunks of
steel veined with miles of complicated wiring that intricately
coursed through reinforcement joints and instrument panels. These
military men (at that time, all test pilots were male) sat in
cockpits and revved up engines that aerospace manufacturers hoped
would carry them skyward.
</P>
<P>
   When one of these flights failed _ as did the one that in 1958
claimed the life of my father, Boyd Lee Grubaugh _ there were no
public memorials, no scholarship funds for the children left
behind, no national outcries of sorrow. Unlike the televised
disaster that was Challenger, the ill-fated shuttle with an
adventurous schoolteacher named Christa McAuliffe on board, many
men died without a nation's recognition of their important work.
Their widows drew what strength they could from knowing that their
pilot husbands were doing what they loved to do: pushing the
envelope, testing the unknown, ``flying.''
</P>
<P>
   The world is now poised for the next great experiment in space:
the International Space Station. The first piece of the flying
laboratory was launched into the ether this month by the Russians.
It will take scores of such launches to complete the station's
assembly. Another countdown began this week.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds so matter-of-fact, even routine. But in a survey
released in April, NASA concluded that ``it clearly needs to be
recognized and understood that there is a high likelihood that one
or more failures, including catastrophic failures, will occur over
the span of 93 launches.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the technology is more sophisticated, the computers and
materials used to manufacture the parts more exact. But it is still
flesh and blood that sits behind the controls; those are men and
women strapped inside these behemoths made of plastics and
composites, electronics and robotics.
</P>
<P>
   Take a minute to at least remember their names.

THE MICROSOFT EMPEROR HAS NEW CLOTHES, IN COMEDIAN'S BOOK

   This is Bill Gates as you've never seen him.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovered!
</P>
<P>
   Uncensored!
</P>
<P>
   Dressed as Janet Reno!
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the richest man in America has a thing for the
attorney general's clothes. Turns out the Microsoft billionaire
likes to wear pantyhose after a long day fighting the Justice
Department over antitrust charges.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how comedian Chris Alpine sees it. Alpine and
illustrator Peter Georgeson have brought us Bill just the way we
want him: as a paper doll.
</P>
<P>
   Their new book, ``Bill Gates 99,'' takes on every aspect of
Gates and his computer software empire. Nothing is sacred, from
computer nerds to pocket protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of Bill in Reno's purple suit and black flats? Strip him
down to his boxers and socks and go from there.
</P>
<P>
   There's Bill the Big Man on Campus, and Bill the prison warden;
Bill the computer dork in plaid pants, or Bill as Hugh Hefner in a
bathrobe and fuzzy slippers. The joke: He's carrying a dogeared
copy of ``Pentiumhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bill the ``Internet Explorer'' in safari clothes,
and Bill dressed as Charlton Heston playing God in socks and
Birkenstocks, holding 10 Commandments (''Thou Shalt Make Money''
tops the list.)
</P>
<P>
   Alpine and Georgeson make fun of Gates' haircut, his glasses,
his money, and they even throw in a fictional biography with the
details we really want to know. Bill's turn-ons: pulling
all-nighters, Pentium chips. His turnoffs: power surges, Macs. And
his nickname? What else but Bill-ionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates 99'' costs $9.99.

   CELINE DION, ``These Are Special Times,'' 550 Music: This is the
big one, the Christmas offering by the woman who ruled pop music in
1998. And it's ... well, pretty good, in no small part because the
sugary and sometimes schmaltzy Big Pop that Dion traffics in is far
more acceptable during the ultrasentimental holiday season. This
gauzy, string-laden 16-song offering is a nicely eclectic mix of
standards such as ``O Holy Night'' and a few originals, one of
which, ``Don't Save It All for Christmas Day,'' scores points for
reminding us that we shouldn't just be nice to our loved ones
between Thanksgiving and Christmas morning. Dion tries a bit too
hard to be all things to all listeners _ ``Ave Maria'' and a
warmed-over John Lennon's ``Happy Xmas (War Is Over)'' on the same
CD? _ but she gets away with it more often than not.

   SHAWN COLVIN, ``Holiday Songs and Lullabies,'' Columbia: Colvin
follows ``A Few Small Repairs,'' her darkest and best album, with
her sweetest and lightest CD. Unsurprisingly, it's a quiet affair,
although the best numbers are the ones in which Colvin's band gets
a bit of a ``Wichita Skyline'' groove going. Some of the Christmas
songs, especially ``Silent Night,'' challenge Colvin's waifish
range, but she acquits herself well on ``In the Bleak Mid-Winter''
and ``All Through the Night.'' The lullabies don't have much
staying power for anyone older than 18 months, but Colvin has
better sleepy-song taste than Linda Ronstadt, who tried to turn
Queen's soccer-game chant ``We Will Rock You'' into a bedtime song.

   BABYFACE, ``Christmas With Babyface,'' Epic Records: Christmas
with the megapopular performer and producer sounds as though it
would be pleasant and a bit quiet. Mellow grooves and saxophones
are the cornerstones of this 10-track collection, nine of which are
standards such as ``Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.'' It's all
``nice,'' yeah, but hardly ever are his arrangements or vocal
interpretations of these songs memorable. The last track, his own
``You Were There,'' has little, if anything, to do with Christmas.
Sounds like he just had to get one of his own songs on there.

   CHUCK LEAVELL, ``What's in That Bag?,'' Capricorn Records:
Leavell is a Georgia keyboardist who has recorded and/or toured
with the Allman Brothers (in the '70s), Eric Clapton (in the '80s)
and the Rolling Stones (every tour since 1982). His first Christmas
CD is a down-home blast of soul and boogie-woogie piano licks.
Aside from Leavell's voice not being as strong as his playing, it's
one of the season's best. Recorded with esteemed session players
such as Roger Hawkins, ``Bag'' is a solid, Southern-flavored
collection of, mainly, seasonal favorites like Charles Brown's
``Merry Christmas Baby.'' Leavell's solo piano interpretations of
``God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen'' and ``O Holy Night'' are lovely,
and his duet with Stones vocalist Lisa Fischer on ``Please Come
Home for Christmas'' is as cool as it gets.

   CYNDI LAUPER, ``Merry Christmas ... Have a Nice Life!'' Sony:
Big fun, this first yuletide offering from Lauper. Most of the
songs are originals, and most of those are winners: ``Home on
Christmas Day'' is both sad and hopeful, ``Minnie and Santa'' is
the story of a waitress planning to seduce the fat man, and
``Christmas Conga'' is the perfect dance song for that inebriated
office/block/whatever party you know you'll go to. Unlike many
people who do Christmas CDs, Lauper sounds like she really loves
the season, the kind of old-fashioned gal who would put up a big,
real tree, invite everyone in the neighborhood, and lead the
caroling until way past midnight.

   'N SYNC, ``Home for Christmas,'' RCA: Millions of teen-age girls

quintet's Christmas disc is, of course, nothing more than
disposable pop fluff, another example of a record company
pressuring a trendy act to spit out as much stuff as possible
before fans grow up and wake up. All the songs are typical 'N Sync:
syrupy, harmony-driven ballads that make schoolyard promises _
``I'll always love you,'' ``You're the only one for me'' _ that
turn 13-year-old girls into goo-goo dolls. It'll sell anyway, and
Justin, Chris, JC, Lance and Joey will become that much richer. And

McKnight and true embarrassments like Kris Kross), ``Soulful
Nights'' is made up of original material from R&AMP;B stalwarts such as
McKnight, K-Ci and JoJo, Gerald Levert and Chaka Khan. The sultry
songs follow a similar making-out-by-the-fireplace path, and it
does get old after awhile. At least there's honesty and originality
here, though, not just some crooner belching out more Christmas
carols for more Christmas cash.

   SQUIRREL NUT ZIPPERS, ``Christmas Caravan,'' Mammoth Records:
Elmo and Patsy and Robert Earl Keen have had their silly holiday
songs, but leave it to the Zippers to offer an entire Christmas
album that's fun. There's the occasional spurt of looniness, such
as ``Indian Giver,'' but this effort is mainly kept alive through
the band's mix of calypso, Delta blues and ragtime. Katherine
Whalen does her lovely Billie Holiday warble on ``Winter Weather,''
the traditional ``Sleigh Ride'' gets a New Orleans-style makeover,
while ``Hanging Up My Stockings'' changes moods many times, going
from big band to an ominous dirge to vinyl-cracking crooning. A
definite stocking-stuffer.

   TAMMY WYNETTE, ``Christmas With Tammy Wynette,'' Sony/Nashville:
The late queen of country music released this holiday classic album
in 1970, and it hasn't been commercially available since the
mid-1980s. Fans will rejoice again at the Tammy touch on her
ethereal ``Silent Night'' and steel-guitar paced ``O Little Town of
Bethlehem.'' ``White Christmas'' gets that Wynette catch in the
voice, and a guitar chord intro reminiscent of ``Stand by Your

Be Having One,'' an untypical country song of holiday love gone
right.

just plain gorgeous. It's followed up with a beautiful vocal

   LEONARD BERNSTEIN, conductor; New York Philharmonic; Westminster
Choir. Handel's ``Messiah'' Sony Bernstein Century Collection: For
some, the newly re-mastered version of Leonard Bernstein's
performance of Handel's ``Messiah'' with the New York Philharmonic,
from a studio recording of 1956, will be a fascinating document of
one musical genius interpreting another. For others, it will be a
bizarre distortion of a masterpiece. Bernstein liberally
re-arranged the movements, sometimes with breathtaking effect. For
better or worse, he makes the Overture sound like Mahler _ and no
other conductor who has ever lived could have made the counterpoint
so lively and energetic. And there are definite drawbacks besides
Bernstein's fast-and-loose approach to the score: the standards for
symphonic choirs were not as high in the 1950s as they are today
and the soloists are a mixed lot. While this is a must-buy item for
connoisseurs of Bernstein or ``Messiah,'' typical buyers looking
for one good ``Messiah'' should go to the star-studded, mainstream
version with the Toronto Symphony and conductor Andrew Davis on
EMI.

RETURN OF THE LUDDITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 6)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets. The word TILDE in parentheses should be
replaced by the tilde symbol.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lead attorney for Microsoft, the firm accused by the U.S.
government of seeking to monopolize the computer industry, strode
into a Washington courtroom and told the judge that the proceedings
had turned into ``a return of the  &UR; Luddites &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates' lawyer, John Warden, explained to listeners unversed
in English history that the  &UR; Luddites &LR;  were a band of workers who
smashed machines ``to arrest the march of progress driven by
science and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   If I had been the judge, I would have interrupted to say, ``If
you're going to cite precedent, get specific.''
</P>
<P>
   In Leicestershire in 1779, a man named Ned Ludd broke into a
house, and in what was reported to be ``a fit of insane rage,''
destroyed two machines used for knitting hosiery.
</P>
<P>
   The breaking of such knitting frames _ machinery invented two
centuries before _ had been going on for nearly a century. Ludd,
however, did it with such gusto and flair that subsequently,
whenever machines of any sort were found smashed, the excuse was
given that ``King Ludd must have been here.''
</P>
<P>
   What was Ludd's motive? Was he a lover of hand-knitted hosiery?
Did he prefer going barefoot? Or was he making some sort of
undarned social protest of deeper significance?
</P>
<P>
   Revisionist historians say that Ludd and other frame-wreckers
were protesting poor working conditions and low wages at the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   However, between 1811 and 1816, organized bands of masked men
swore allegiance to ``King Ludd'' rather than the British
sovereign, and waged a war against the serflike conditions spawned
by the users of textile machinery. ``If the workmen dislike certain
machines,'' explained The Nottingham Review in 1811, ``it was
because of the use to which they were being put, not because they
were machines or because they were new.''
</P>
<P>
   That living-condition claim was swept aside by commercial
interests and officialdom, which hung the label  &UR; Luddite &LR;  on
protesters not for demanding a living wage but for obstructing the
march of technological progress. The historical revisionists argue
that others attributed the anti-machinery ``cause'' to the
 &UR; Luddites &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Intellectuals and romantics like the poets Blake, Byron, Shelley
and Wordsworth picked up that anti-technology theme, but identified
with its other side.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``dark Satanic mills'' of industry, they saw the human
spirit being stifled. Byron wrote an inflammatory ``Song for the
 &UR; Luddites &LR; '' in 1816. Its first stanza: ``As the Liberty lads o'er
the sea/Bought their freedom, and cheaply, with blood,/So we, boys,
we/Will die fighting, or live free,/And down with all kings but
King Ludd!''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Shelley, daughter of the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and
wife of the poet, gave the  &UR; Luddite &LR;  theme dramatic power in her
1818 novel, ``Frankenstein.'' The danger of rampant technology is
expressed by the monster, who says to Dr. Victor Frankenstein,
``You are my creator, but I am your master.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the sweatshop operators and the romantic poets, the
meaning of  &UR; Luddite &LR;  became fixed as ``radical opponent of
technological or scientific progress.'' The novelist Thomas Pynchon
wrote in The New York Times in 1984, ``The word  &UR; Luddite &LR;  continues
to be applied with contempt to anyone with doubts about technology,
especially the nuclear kind.''
</P>
<P>
   But he foresaw the day when ``artificial intelligence, molecular
biology and robotics all converge'' and found what Microsoft
lawyers claim to be government barbarians at their Gates as
``certainly something for all good  &UR; Luddites &LR;  to look forward to,
if, God willing, we should live so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about today's neo- &UR; Luddism &LR; , from Netties who
describe themselves soothingly as ``people who tend not to
overutilize technology,'' can be found on the Internet at
www.nmc.edu/(TILDE)kovacsj/luddit(TILDE)1.htm. (That's two tildes,
the symbol that looks like an arched eyebrow.)
</P>
<P>
   From breaking knitting frames at the start of the Industrial Age
to breaking into mainframes and PCs in the Information Age _ you
just can't keep old Ned Ludd down. Lord Byron and Frankenstein's
monster would be proud.
</P>
<P>
   MISS PRISION OF 1998
</P>
<P>
   ``There is substantial and credible evidence,'' charges the
majority staff of the House Judiciary Committee, ``that the
president may have engaged in  &UR; misprision &LR;  of Monica Lewinsky's
felonies. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Minority counsel fired back that ``allegations of lying under
oath, obstruction and tampering _ or even as counsel renames them
as  &UR; misprision &LR;  of a crime'' did not rise to historical impeachment
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Where is this  &UR; misprision &LR; , and how is it pronounced?
</P>
<P>
   The word has nothing to do with  &UR; prison &LR; , though it can send you
there. The last syllable begins with the same sound that begins the
name  &UR; Zsa Zsa &LR;  Gabor.
</P>
<P>
   The root meaning is ``mistake'';  &UR; misprision &LR;  comes from the
French  &UR; mesprendre &LR; , with  &UR; prendre &LR;  meaning ``to take.'' It was
Shakespeare's meaning in ``Love's Labor Lost'': ``sweet
 &UR; misprision &LR; !''
</P>
<P>
   A more sour sense was already in use, that of ``concealment.''
In 1533, Henry VIII beheaded Sir Thomas More for refusing to
acknowledge an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon,
calling his crime `` &UR; misprision &LR;  of high treason.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the legal meaning is still spelled out in a treason
statute. Title 18 of the U.S. Criminal Code: ``Whoever, owing
allegiance to the United States and having knowledge of any treason
against them, conceals and does not, as soon as may be, disclose
and make known the same to the president ((or other legal
authority)) ... is guilty of  &UR; misprision &LR;  of treason'' and faces a
jail term of up to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Setting treason aside, and ignoring its application to all
outdated sedition,  &UR; misprision &LR;  means ``neglect of duty''; all
citizens, especially government officials, are duty bound to report
knowledge of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The noun was thrust into the nation's vocabulary in 1974 during
the Nixon impeachment hearings. The White House attorney Leonard
Garment, drawing on his familiarity with a 1649 poem by Richard
Lovelace (``Stone walls do not a prison make/Nor iron bars a
cage''), offered this amelioration to those accusing the president
of obstructing justice: ``Stonewalling does not  &UR; misprision &LR; 
make.''

AN EXPERIMENT IN SOCIALIST CAPITALISM
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: First in a four-part series) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: For decades, U.S. foreign policy has sought to
dislodge Fidel Castro from his seat of power in Havana. But there
he sits still _ discussing medical supplies, Wall Street, global
economics _ and he doesn't appear to have any plans to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, for our part, we must learn to be patient,'' says
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Our conversation, up to this point, has been going briskly for
more than two hours. I have just asked Castro what he thought our
country might do, and what his might do, to normalize our tattered
relations, shredded by four decades of injuries, insults and
chronic mutual misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   Castro says he must learn to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   On my right at the dinner table sits Ricardo Alarcon, president
of the National Assembly. He is Cuba's speaker of the House,
urbane, well versed in American politics. Alarcon lived in our
country for several years as ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   On my left is Carlos Lage, vice president of internal affairs.
He's in charge of Cuba's efforts to upgrade its battered economy,
squeezed first by Russia's abandonment and collapse, and now by the
suffocating U.S. economic blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon and Lage are the two most frequently mentioned
successors to the charismatic bearded leader. Thus far in the
dinner conversation, neither has spoken a word.
</P>
<P>
   And Castro says to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   In front of me sits our host, his piercing eyes locking on mine
as I speak, his expressive hands gesturing dramatically while the
celebrated voice, quieter now, rises and falls in cadences of
carefully phrased thought. (American television hates Castro
because he refuses to speak in sound bites.)
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro. He has outlasted eight _ almost nine _ U.S.
presidents. The Soviet Union has fallen apart and European
communism has disintegrated, but Castro survives. He has escaped
assassination attempts and outlived mortal enemies. Save for King
Hussein of Jordan, our host might be the world's longest-reigning
head of state.
</P>
<P>
   And Castro says he must learn to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   At 72, he apparently enjoys encountering another septuagenarian
with whom to exchange old political stories; he is eager for
insights into the personalities of our former presidents. But he
springs back to the present, full of curiosity and an incorrigible
hint of impatience. Castro recites current Dow Jones averages,
probes for underlying meanings in U.S. congressional elections. He
quotes from newly published books by former White House aides,
recoils from the ``cultural invasion'' of countries everywhere by
ubiquitous electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently well-read and up-to-date, Castro recites reams of
current statistical data. One third of all U.S. exports go to Latin
America, he reminds his American guests. ``And it isn't like
1929,'' he says. ``Then only 5 percent of Americans were into the
stock market.'' Today, he points out, at least 50 percent are
invested through their pension and retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is absorbed by the current economic crises in Japan,
Russia and elsewhere, worrying lest they spread to Brazil, ``from
which they could bound to Mexico.'' He follows with approval
President Clinton's efforts to organize an effective global
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why we all must be patient with President Clinton at
this very time.'' Castro insists that America's chief executive
``is confronting for all of us everywhere'' the frightful menace of
``an economic meltdown'' that would adversely affect the whole
global economy. And that, he adds, is ``more important, and more
urgent in the president's mind, than (relations with) Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro seems to excuse Clinton for the almost total failure of
the president's announced order to lift the embargo on selling
American medicines to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the embargo was technically suspended by
presidential edict four months ago, Castro reports, and Cubans
``immediately _ immediately, that very day'' _ began contacting
U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers to buy desperately needed drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they agreed,'' he says, but later they discovered
mountains of permits, paperwork and red tape still required by
Treasury technocrats before any American firm could sell anything
to Cuba, notwithstanding the presidential six-months suspension.
Apparently the bureaucratic burdens made the cost of moving these
commodities prohibitive, if they were to sell at world prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now four months have passed,'' Castro says, lifting his
shoulders and raising his palms while his eyes widen, ``and none of
the medical goods Cuba stands ready to pay for have been delivered.
Not even an aspirin tablet!''
</P>
<P>
   Patience may be the happiest face to put on chronically abraded
U.S.-Cuban relations. With the harsh memories of the Bay of Pigs
and the 1962 missile crisis dimmed by intervening decades, the gate
to normalized relations, trade and travel between the two close
neighbors remains stubbornly closed.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, long ago abandoning thoughts of exporting its revolution,
has been restored to good standing in most parts of the world. On
the tarmac at the spacious new Havana airport, completed three
months ago, I count commercial passenger jets from eight
identifiable countries. Cuban trade flows back and forth with every
other nation in our hemisphere. But not with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Our country has made peace and opened trade and diplomatic
routes with China, Russia, all of Eastern Europe, even Vietnam. But
not with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   And newly opened foreign investment opportunities in Cuba are
being snapped up by Canadian and European firms, not by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Our neighbors in the hemisphere are baffled that we haven't
ended the lingering impasse. They think it's hurting America and
Cuba both. One Canadian diplomat described it privately as the
world's most discouraging ``case of hardened arteries.''
</P>
<P>
   California Rep. Esteban Torres, who tried unsuccessfully this
year to repeal the Helms-Burton embargo on trade in medicine and
food, likens Cuban-American politics to ``a sophisticated game of
chicken'' _ two cars heading toward one another in the same traffic
lane, each driver expecting the other to yield.
</P>
<P>
   Our State Department chief of mission in Havana, Michael Kozak,
heads a diplomatic contingent of maybe 300 Americans, doing
business in the stately U.S. Embassy. Because our government still
does not officially recognize the Cuban government, Kozak's
operation is technically, in arcane diplomatic jargon, a section of
the Swiss Embassy. But Kozak tells me that we recently have spent
about $38 million rehabilitating our handsome embassy, which looks
back upon downtown Havana and out upon the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Kozak wants the Cuban government to open the domestic political
process, making it easier for independents and rival political
parties to field candidates for the National Assembly. He sees this
and other internal political reforms as the first step toward
normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested this possibility two days earlier to Cuba's
young foreign minister, Roberto Robaino, he went into an orbital
oratorio about the presumption of a big country that it may dictate
cultural and political modalities to its smaller neighbors. ``Your
people don't seem to realize,'' he storms, ``that a far greater
percentage of people vote in our elections than do so in yours!''
</P>
<P>
   Castro, calmer and less strident, points to Cuba's attainments
in education and public health, to problems suffered by the Soviet
Union when it tried to change everything overnight. He stresses
modest steps. His regime has undertaken on its own, he says, to
open up elections, particularly for state and local offices, and to
make some accommodations to free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   From the Cuban point of view, our dropping of trade sanctions
constitutes the best, and necessary, beginning toward political
detente.
</P>
<P>
   Torres deplores the lack of concessions on both sides as a
``macho standoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the embargo might be costing the United States in trade
or investments, its greatest cost is in world opinion. On Oct. 14,
the United Nations condemned the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba,
imploring our country to repeal it. The vote in the General
Assembly was 157-2, with only Israel standing beside the United
States. And Israel itself has substantial current investments in
the island's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo's defenders hope that, by strangling Cuban chances
at economic growth, it will bring about the fall of Castro. It has
undoubtedly slowed the Cuban economy. But the embargo began in
1961, and there sits Castro across the table from me. He offers no
hint at retirement. His appearance belies periodic rumors of ill
health. Preparations are under way for a gala nationwide
celebration in January to mark the 40th anniversary of the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The aging strongman carries his tall frame erect. He looks trim.
I guess him at 6-foot-2 and 195 pounds. He moves with ease. His
voice is older, not as strong as I had guessed. But it is forceful.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's trademark olive-green uniform with the red epaulets is
freshly pressed, and his shoulders do not droop. The dark hairs in
his famous beard still outnumber the gray. At the end of nearly
four hours of intense conversation, our translator seems exhausted.
But the whites of Castro's eyes are clear. His face shows no sign
of strain.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, this is a Castro different from the one I had expected.
Gentler, kinder. More tolerant, maybe. Maybe more ... well,
patient.

WHAT KILLED NEANDERTHALS? MAYBE LACK OF IODINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Texas, Ill., Mo.)   (af)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a study already drawing the fire of controversy, an American
geographer has pointed out evidence suggesting, in his view, that
little more than the amount of iodine in their diets may have been
responsible for the physical differences between Neanderthals and
modern humans and that this might solve the mystery of what
happened to the Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   According to this interpretation, the skeletons of Neanderthals
bear signs of physical deformities and possibly impaired mental
health, which could be a result of iodine-deficient diets.
</P>
<P>
   This condition may explain why they were so rapidly and
completely replaced by modern humans in Europe about 30,000 years
ago. It may even mean that Neanderthals could actually have been
anatomically modern humans who were pathologically altered by
iodine-deficiency diseases, like cretinism.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Neanderthals did not so much disappear as change
their diets some time before 30,000 years ago to include more
iodine-rich foods. In that case, this could explain why certain
Neanderthal physical traits _ heavy brows, thick bones and
musculature and propensities for degenerative joint diseases, which
are also associated with iodine-deficiency diseases _ did not
persist even if their genes continued into later European
populations.
</P>
<P>
   These are the provocative ideas of Dr. Jerome E. Dobson, a
geographer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Tennessee, who
crossed into the territory of paleontology and the minefield of
Neanderthal studies while examining geographic questions about
differences between coastal and inland populations.
</P>
<P>
   His analysis is being published this month in Geographical
Review, the journal of the American Geographical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compared Neanderthal and cretin morphology and ultimately
concluded that Neanderthals were iodine-deficient,'' Dobson said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists who specialize in Neanderthal research have
raised sharp objections. Dobson's conclusions, they contend, are a
stretch based on highly circumstantial evidence and at odds with
evolutionary biology. But some anthropologists and other
geographers said that the data seemed impressive and that the
interpretations should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sometimes have to rock the boat,'' said Dr. Karl W. Butzer,
a geographer at the University of Texas at Austin. ``Even if this
just generates papers that argue against the idea, it will have
served a purpose, making the fossil people think and rethink their
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   For want of the chemical element iodine, a modern human
typically suffers from goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland
that disfigures the neck, or from cretinism, an even worse
condition of physical deformity and mental retardation. Cretinism
is caused either by dietary iodine deficiency or by malfunction or
absence of the thyroid gland, which processes iodine into the
thyroid hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the addition of iodine to table salt has all but
eliminated goiter and cretinism in developed countries, the World
Health Organization estimates that 750 million people suffer from
goiter and that 5.7 million are cretins. About 30 percent of the
world's population is at risk of iodine-deficiency diseases,
especially people in inland regions away from the principal sources
of dietary iodine like saltwater fish, shellfish and seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to Dobson that Neanderthals mainly lived in such
iodine-deprived areas in interior Europe during the ice ages. So he
set about examining some of the 300 Neanderthal skeletons in museum
collections and comparing them with medical descriptions of
cretinism and with 17 cretin skeletons at collections in Basel,
Switzerland, and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In both the skeletal examinations and the medical literature,
Dobson was struck by the conspicuous similarities in the overall
body proportions, skulls and individual bones of Neanderthals and
cretins. Many of the cretins had bulging brow ridges much like
those common to Neanderthals. They also seemed to suffer many of
the degenerative joint diseases of the jaw, spinal column and hip
that typically afflicted Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, Neanderthal skeletons resemble cretins far more
closely than they resemble healthy modern humans,'' Dobson wrote in
the journal article. ``Conversely, cretin skeletons resemble
Neanderthals more closely than they resemble healthy modern
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The research revealed too many similarities to be coincidental,
Dobson said, and the ``key factor in controlling Neanderthal
morphology'' appears to be iodine. This suggested to him that
perhaps the critical difference between Neanderthals and modern
humans was a single genetic alteration that improved the ability of
the modern human thyroid gland to extract and use iodine.
</P>
<P>
   This would have given the modern humans who arrived in Europe
40,000 years ago, and are known to science as the Cro-Magnons, a
clear advantage over Neanderthals in a low-iodine environment.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson even sees hints of Neanderthal cretinism in Cro-Magnon
art. He speculated that the ``Venus figurines,'' tiny statues of
women with huge breasts and bellies and conspicuously exposed
genitalia, may not have been fertility symbols, as usually
interpreted, but actually representations of the cretinous form the
Cro-Magnons remembered from their final encounters with the
Neanderthals they replaced.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Dobson's thesis has unsettling implications for
many issues that have long puzzled scientists since the first
Neanderthal skeleton was found in a German quarry in 1856. At
first, the skeleton was dismissed as the remains of a Mongolian
Cossack who had deserted the Russian army pursuing Napoleon in
1814.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent German scientist examining the bones judged that
this had been a modern man who had a bad case of rickets, a calcium
deficiency condition.
</P>
<P>
   After the skeleton's greater antiquity was recognized and
similar bones were found through Europe, scientists debated the
Neanderthals' relationship to modern Homo sapiens.
</P>
<P>
   Direct ancestor? Or only an archaic cousin? Tests of
mitochondrial DNA, reported earlier this year, suggest that
Neanderthals were a separate species that last shared a common
ancestor with Homo sapiens no later than 550,000 years ago. But
paleontologists specializing in human evolution are not yet sure
that the DNA findings can be considered definitive.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fate of the Neanderthals, Dobson said his analysis
could support either of two opposing theories: replacement or
continuity.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing replacement theory holds that all Neanderthals
died out and were replaced by modern Homo sapiens, though it has
always been puzzling that these hunters who had survived across
Europe and western Asia for some 200,000 years should lose out to
modern humans, the Cro-Magnons, in the relatively brief time of
10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his conclusions, Dobson wrote, ``Iodine deficiency among
Neanderthals may explain why they were so easily replaced by
Cro-Magnons.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuity theory posits that some interbreeding occurred
between Neanderthals and modern Homo sapiens, meaning that some
Neanderthal genes survive in Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson argued that in genetic terms, Neanderthals may have been
anatomically modern humans who were pathologically altered by the
effects of iodine deficiency. Through growing trade and other
contacts with coastal people, the Neanderthals could have added
more iodine to their diets.
</P>
<P>
   Their superficial differences with modern humans would then have
largely disappeared over a few generations, leaving Neanderthals
indistinguishable from modern humans in the fossil record.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lewis Binford, an anthropologist at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas who has studied and written about Neanderthal
society, said the new analysis was the first to consider the
implications of iodine deficiency in early populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data seem impressive to me and the hypothesis doesn't seem
unreasonable,'' Binford said. ``We stand to learn something if
others investigate the geographic and dietary issues of
Neanderthals.''
</P>
<P>
   An authority on Neanderthals, Dr. Fred H. Smith of Northern
Illinois University, in De Kalb, said the iodine hypothesis
reminded him of the arguments raised, and rejected, in the past to
explain away Neanderthal anatomy as examples of rickets-caused
deformities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that if we could sit down and talk, Smith
said, ``these apparent differences could be explained without
resorting to pathology.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Trinkaus, a paleontologist at Washington University, in
St. Louis, who has written several books on Neanderthals, also
disputed Dobson's evidence for widespread iodine deficiency in
Neanderthal skeletons as well as his interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot explain 100,000 to 400,000 years of human evolution
based on a pathological condition,'' Trinkaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating controversy, Dobson wrote in his journal report:
``I might be less bold in offering a new and dramatically different
explanation of Neanderthals if prominent experts were satisfied
with the debates of the past century or so. But they are not.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When words like ``cure'' and ``prevention'' appear in the title
of a book about a chronic, disabling or life-threatening disease,
they often enrich authors and publishers at the public's expense.
Such is likely the case with a current best seller, ``The Breast
Cancer Prevention Diet'' by Dr. Bob Arnot, the medical
correspondent for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The book's premise _ that adopting a diet rich in soy, flaxseed
and fish oils can prevent breast cancer _ has been soundly
denounced by breast-cancer researchers and patient advocates alike
as promising something it cannot possibly deliver.
</P>
<P>
   As Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer
Coalition, put it, ``There is no breast-cancer prevention diet,''
and the basis for Arnot's assertion is too flimsy to warrant a
radical dietary shift based on a ``bet,'' as he put it, that it
will deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an onslaught of criticism, Arnot now says he should
have used the words ``risk reduction'' instead of ``prevention'' in
his book title.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the book overextends laboratory findings that have
yet to be confirmed in women, suggests dietary changes that have
not been tested for long-term safety, and intimates that, counter
to all rules of sound medical science, it is foolhardy to wait for
definitive proof of effectiveness and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Cancer-Diet Link
</P>
<P>
   Arnot is not wrong in suggesting that diet plays an important
role in the prevention of cancer, including breast cancer. The
American Cancer Society estimates that diet is a primary factor in
a third of cancer deaths. That estimate is derived from thousands
of studies of people worldwide and is supported by findings in
laboratory cell cultures and experimental animals.
</P>
<P>
   These studies suggest that a reorientation of American eating
habits _ to emphasize fruits, vegetables and whole grains and
minimize red meats, total fat and especially saturated fats and
alcohol _ can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing
most of the common cancers, like colon and rectum, lung, bladder,
stomach, esophagus, mouth, throat and breast.
</P>
<P>
   What cannot be said is that adopting a particular diet can
ensure that you won't get cancer, or that if you do, the diet will
prevent the cancer from recurring.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the American Institute for Cancer Research and the
World Cancer Research Fund released an analysis of more than 4,500
studies that examined the relationship between cancer and diet and
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion, as summarized in the current issue of Nutrition
Action Health Letter: ``While there are no guarantees, there is
plenty you can do to cut your risk.'' Simply eating more fruits and
vegetables, for example, can eliminate about 20 percent of cancers,
the analysis suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important is that the recommended anti-cancer diet
is the very same diet that studies have shown can help to prevent
and treat heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, anyone who is interested in maximizing the
chances of staying healthy would be wise to consider adopting a
diet rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables that are loaded
with fiber, vitamins and minerals and other cancer-fighting
chemicals that occur naturally in plant foods.
</P>
<P>
   A protective diet would also be moderate in animal protein and
especially limited in red meats and low in fat, especially
saturated fat, simple sugars and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the low-carbohydrate plan advocated by Arnot,
such a diet is rich in carbohydrates _ not sugars, of course, but
the complex carbohydrates, or starchy foods, particularly in their
natural, unrefined, fiber-rich state.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a diet that can help fight obesity, which is
strongly linked to an increased risk of breast, uterine and other
cancers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dietary Do's
</P>
<P>
   The cancers most directly linked to diet are those that arise in
lining tissues throughout the body, especially cancers of the colon
and rectum, lung, bladder, stomach and, to a lesser extent, the
breast, uterus and prostate. The following dietary suggestions are
based on the strongest associations established in studies:
</P>
<P>
   FRUITS AND VEGETABLES Evidence in people has accumulated rapidly
in recent years to support the protective role of plant foods
against most cancers. The average American eats only about three or
four servings a day of vegetables and fruits, while five servings,
and preferably nine, are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Especially helpful are yellow, dark-green and orange vegetables
rich in carotenoids, fruits like citrus, tomatoes and strawberries
that are rich in vitamin C, and all the cabbage-family vegetables
like broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, collards, kale, bok
choy and mustard and turnip greens.
</P>
<P>
   Such foods are linked to lower risks of lung, stomach, colon and
rectum, oral-cavity, esophagus and, to a lesser degree, breast,
bladder, pancreas and larynx cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, onions and leeks contain allium compounds that help
prevent cancer, especially breast cancer. To reduce loss of the
protective chemicals, these vegetables should be cut up and allowed
to stand for 10 minutes before they are cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent findings suggest that the risk of prostate cancer
can be reduced by eating lots of cooked tomato products, including
ketchup, that are rich in a carotenoid called lycopene, and foods
rich in the mineral selenium, like meats, fish, grains and seeds.
</P>
<P>
   SOY AND OTHER DRIED BEANS These contain plant estrogens that may
be beneficial in preventing hormone-related cancers, including
breast, uterine and possibly ovarian cancer. A soy-rich diet may in
part explain why Asian women have a low risk of these cancers.
Dried beans may also help prevent colon cancer. But experts say
that beans are most likely to be protective when used in place of
meats and when the rest of the diet is low in fat.
</P>
<P>
   WHOLE GRAINS Wheat bran in whole-grain cereals and breads is
strongly linked to protection against colon and rectal cancers,
probably because they speed the passage of wastes and reduce
exposure of the lower gut to cancer-causing substances.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER HELPFUL FOODS The list of possible dietary cancer weapons
keeps growing. Among recent additions are green tea, olive oil
(linked to a lower risk of breast cancer when used in place of
other fats) and milk and other foods rich in calcium and vitamin D
(linked to a reduced risk of breast and colon cancer).
</P>
<P>
   Though the evidence that flaxseed and fish oils can protect
against breast or any other cancer is still highly preliminary,
there are many other health benefits associated with eating more
fish.

SNAKES AND VIPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do the terms snake, viper and serpent have
scientific differences?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Especially large or poisonous snakes are commonly called
serpents, and biblical tradition calls the shape Satan assumed to
tempt Eve a serpent, but technically speaking, all snakes can be
called serpents, from the Latin serpere, meaning to creep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake'' and ``serpent'' are overall terms for any of the
members of the suborder Serpentes in the order Squamata. They lack
limbs, shoulder girdle and external ear openings and have immovable
eyelids and a braincase that is completely bony in the back. There
are nearly 3,000 species in 414 genera.
</P>
<P>
   Vipers, a subgroup of snakes, are another matter, and the term
is derived from fuzzy medieval science. The scientific name of the
family Viperidae, which includes many poisonous species commonly
called vipers or adders, comes from the Latin vivipara, meaning
bearing live young, on the assumption that they all did so.
</P>
<P>
   In truth some are live bearers, some are egg layers and some are
ovoviviparous, meaning that they carry eggs that hatch just before
they give birth. The genus vipera, six species of Eurasian adders
or true vipers, are all ovoviviparous.
</P>
<P>
   The puff adder and pit vipers are usually referred to as vipers.
Pit vipers include the familiar rattlesnakes, cottonmouths and
copperheads, and are so called because they have two characteristic
pits right between the snout and the mouth, which pick up infrared
heat signals to identify approaching creatures.

HIGH COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS CONCERNING STATISTICAL ESTIMATES TO
COMPLEMENT CENSUS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday heard arguments
concerning the legality of President Clinton's plan to use
statistical estimates to complement the 2000 Census and indicated
strongly that opponents of the proposal lack legal standing to
mount a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices, in a 90-minute oral-argument session, appeared
just as critical of the president's plan, noting that it would be a
departure from the way the Census has traditionally been taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled House of Representatives and 16
private individuals are suing the Clinton administration, seeking a
court order that the president abandon his proposal to use
statistics in addition to the traditional head count of the U.S.
population. Clinton says the estimate is necessary to get a more
accurate number, but House Republicans and the individuals counter
that federal law and the U.S. Constitution permit only a head count
for the Census.
</P>
<P>
   The Census, which the government takes every 10 years, tabulates
not only the U.S. population but determines how the 435 House seats
will be apportioned among the 50 states. The Clinton
administration, saying the last Census in 1990 failed to count 8
million people, including 66,745 in Houston, argues that a
statistical estimate is needed to achieve a more accurate
population count.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General Dan Morales filed a legal brief with the
Supreme Court in support of the Clinton administration. Morales
noted the large number of state residents, mostly minorities and
poor people, not counted in 1990 and said he feared ``history
repeating itself'' unless statistical estimates are included in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a growing population of those that are traditionally
undercounted, the loss of federal funds and equal representation
would easily eclipse the losses of the last decade,'' Morales
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   However, House Republicans argue that anything but a traditional
head count would be unlawful and result in an illegitimate
apportionment of House seats. The 16 individuals say the
president's illegal plan would also render congressional districts
within states invalid because they also are calculated based on the
Census results.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in comments and questions directed at lawyers for
the Republicans and the individuals, seemed skeptical of whether
the opponents had adequately shown they would be harmed if
statistics were used to supplement the Census results.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia was especially critical of the House
Republicans' argument, saying their dispute with Clinton's plan was
political, not legal, and, therefore, did not belong before the
Supreme Court. Courts do not get involved in political disputes,
opting instead to let Congress and the president ``duke it out,''
Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Scalia in saying that
Congress, if it does not like the president's proposal, can simply
refuse to appropriate money for the controversial plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 900 ways Congress (can) stymie the president, if it
has the political will,'' Scalia said. ``All you have to do is not
pass legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter expressed concern that the Supreme Court
would be ``opening up a very large door'' if it permitted Congress
to sue any time the president did something a majority of the
lawmakers did not like.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the justices, the Republicans' lawyer said the
dispute concerns the constitution, not policy. Congress has a legal
right to ensure that the distribution of the 435 seats is based on
a legally sound Census, added the attorney, Maureen Mahoney of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution's call for an ``actual enumeration'' of the
U.S. population requires a head count and prohibits the use of
statistical estimates, she said. ``They (census takers) can't
guess,'' Mahoney argued.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, who usually reserve only one hour for arguments,
also questioned whether the individuals have suffered as a result
of Clinton's plan to use statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Carvin, pressing the individuals' case,
responded that the federal government uses Census figures not only
to apportion congressional seats but to determine where federal
funds will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal agencies will use the census figure to distribute
funds, and that will cost us money,'' said Carvin of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' and individuals' arguments have succeeded so
far. U.S. district courts in Washington, D.C., and eastern Virginia
have ruled that the opponents have standing and the president's
proposal runs afoul of the federal Census Act.
</P>
<P>
   The courts, which did not resolve whether the Constitution
requires a head count, said the law prohibits the use of statistics
in calculating the decennial Census.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, representing the Clinton
administration, urged the justices to overrule the district courts'
decisions. He called the president's plan ``a good-faith empirical
effort to determine the number of persons in each state.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, up to 90 percent of the U.S.
population would be counted by traditional Census methods,
including mail-in questionnaires and visits by U.S. Census Bureau
personnel to residents who did not respond to the national survey.
The other 10 percent, held in reserve to make the statistical
calculation more sound, would be counted using a series of
statistical estimates, Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   However, several justices appeared critical of the president's
proposal, questioning why the Census Bureau was suddenly choosing
to rely so heavily on estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do 100 percent,'' Scalia said, noting the
president's plan to actually count only 90 percent. ``You don't
even try to do 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist predicted that a
statistically enhanced Census would breed more litigation. ``Some
court will decide what the population of the United States was in
2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision by July. &QL;

CLEARER MAMMOGRAMS MAY BE NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a long delay, the Food and Drug Administration is on the
verge of issuing revised guidelines that could enable a new
generation of mammography devices to come to the market. The
devices rely on digital imaging, a technique experts say offers
clearer, more detailed pictures of some breast tissue than
traditional X-ray film.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of digital mammography say that it is particularly
effective in viewing dense portions of the breast. Dense breast
tissue occurs in women of all ages but is more frequent in younger
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a digital image, you can magnify an area and adjust the
contrast at a computer workstation so that dense tissue that
appears virtually white on film reveals more detail,'' said Dr.
Robert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
   But companies seeking to market the devices that X-ray the
entire breast have been delayed by a bottleneck in the Food and
Drug Administration, which has not approved any digital mammography
systems even though it issued an initial set of guidelines to the
manufacturers in July 1996. Manufacturers must comply with the
guidelines in order to receive the agency's approval to market
their devices.
</P>
<P>
   Some are critical of the way the agency is handling the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have moved excessively slowly, dampening enthusiasm for a
development that could be helpful to women,'' said Dr. Martin
Yaffe, a professor of medical biophysics and medical imaging at the
University of Toronto and an expert in new techniques for breast
imaging. Yaffe's research has contributed to the development of the
new systems, but he says he has no financial connection to any
manufacturers of the devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a mammogram _ not a vastly new procedure,'' Yaffe
said. ``The new systems just replace film with an electronic
detector.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, the agency conceded that its original guidelines were
flawed. ``The FDA's guidance did not take into account the
variability in the way radiologists read mammograms,'' said Brian
Casey, editor of Scan, a medical-imaging industry newsletter. ``It
wasn't possible for manufacturers to comply, as the agency more or
less admitted when it decided to revise the criteria in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Doyle, a reviewer at the agency, said officials there
were responding to critics and hoped to release new guidelines in
about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Alpert, director of the FDA's office of device
evaluation, did not agree that the agency had been slow to act.
``This is a high-impact decision,'' she said. ``It divides the
women who go away for a year from the women who need follow-up. We
have to be sure digital mammography provides a reliable assessment
before we let those women leave for 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alpert said she is particularly concerned about the skills
of those who will read the digital mammograms. ``How do we train
people to use this new information so we don't lose the gain we
have from film-screen mammograms?'' she said. ``As a woman,
patient, doctor and regulator, I think this question is critically
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Sickles, a professor of radiology at the University
of California School of Medicine in San Francisco, who participated
in the August panel convened by the agency to discuss guideline
revisions, disputed Dr. Alpert's contention. ``Radiologists know
what mammograms look like, and they can learn to read new ones,''
he said. ``The problem is not radiologists; it's the FDA. They are
dragging their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in
the United States. About 180,000 new cases have been discovered
this year, said Smith of the cancer society. Though he would like
to see digital mammography approved, he said he believed that the
agency was being appropriately cautious.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The FDA needs to satisfy itself that the accuracy of the new
method is as good as conventional methods,'' Smith said. ``Based on
conversations I've had, I suspect that the FDA and manufacturers
will soon sort out their differences, and that companies will then
be able to bring products to market.'' He predicted that several
systems would come out in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also cautioned that although the new technology offers
many benefits, the devices are not revolutionary: ``It's still
mammography, however improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, a
patient-advocate group in Washington, expressed reservations about
the new systems' costs, expected to be about four times those of
traditional mammography units. ``We think they are a step
forward,'' Ms. Visco said, ``but we'd prefer an inexpensive global
alternative _ a low-tech, low-cost blood test that all women could
use.''

GOLF COURSES SHOULD OFFER DISCOUNTS DURING ROUTINE UPKEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's some evidence that the advice ``Buyer,
beware'' applies to the business of golf as much as any other.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I was just an anonymous golfer, calling a few
courses I hadn't played in a while, looking for a tee-time. I was
all set at one of them, when I asked, ``Oh, by the way, how's the
course? Have you been doing any work on it at all?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes, we aerated all the greens Monday,'' the starter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everyone in Northern California is doing that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe so,'' I said, ``but I think I'd rather play a
course that aerated two or three weeks ago than one that aerated
four days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Greens that have just been aerated tend to be bumpy, sandy and
generally unputtable for the better part of two weeks. Yet, the man
was clearly indignant that I would prefer to spend my money, not to
mention a precious day off, at a course in playable condition than
at his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, then, you'll have to go someplace else,'' he huffed.
</P>
<P>
   You bet I did, and without a shred of regret. Buy a shirt that's
missing a couple of buttons, you get a discount. Buy a house that's
in shambles, you get a ``fixer-upper'' deal. If you make a tee-time
at a golf course that's aerating its greens, you get a coverup! A
snow job!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real dilemma for the operators, because if they tell
callers the truth, they're going to lose money,'' said Bob Higgins,
director of golf at Poppy Hills Golf Course, home of the Northern
California Golf Association. ``We tell people. We put it on our
reservation system 30 days in advance, and we hang signs on the
door. Some places don't want to tell anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they wake up one day and decide to aerate the
greens or punch the fairways. Most courses make their maintenance
schedule at least a year in advance, trying to work around their
biggest tournaments. And if you have a smaller tournament and you
care about this, it's a valid scheduling question.
</P>
<P>
   Courses that understand that great customer services means
repeat business will tell you the truth. Or, they'll search for
compromises _ one course, for instance, will aerate nine holes this
week, nine holes next. Higgins said he played another course where
half of each green was aerated at a time.
</P>
<P>
   We bargain hunters would get a big thrill out of a discount, or
maybe a two-for-one coupon for a future round. Ha, fat chance of
the fat cat golf courses sharing the dish. For the moment, there
are still too many of us and not enough of them.

 &HT;    BUSH FINDS BACKERS AT WESTERN WALL
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Amid the religious fervor and history of the holy
Western Wall, travel agent Manola Noon of Austin got to give her
governor the two-fingered ``Hook' em horns'' signal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush answered the University of Texas fan
with a thumbs up, and his second day in Israel sidetracked into a
few minutes of handshakes and photos with other Americans who
happened to be sightseeing there.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Noon were on their first visits to Israel, but
Bush has been hosted as the GOP presidential frontrunner he denies
being.
</P>
<P>
   His day started with a reception with Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert, who said with a grin that he hoped to someday visit the
governor ``in Texas or Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He then met with several top Israeli politicians, culminating
with a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is accompanied by Republican governors from Utah, Montana
and Massachusetts. But, aside for an awkward digression in which he
asked whether Montana borders Canada, Netanyahu focused his toast
on Bush and his potential as a ``world leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he has not made up his mind about whether he will
run for president, but the prospect has focused early attention on
him.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is organized by a group of Republican supporters, the
National Jewish Coalition, which calls itself the ``Jewish voice of
the Republican Party'' and supports the policies of the Israeli
government. Bush aides have said he will reimburse the group for
the trip from leftover campaign money. He was re-elected governor
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Trip organizers have refused to disclose the governors'
schedules and Bush has refused to answer most questions from
reporters, saying that he will hold his comments about the trip for
a press conference in Austin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There have been questions here about whether the last day of the
trip, Tuesday, will include a visit to any of the controversial
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, land Israel captured in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   An initial schedule released by the Israeli government indicated
that a helicopter tour for the governors might include a brief stop
at a settlement, if only to use it as an observation point for the
area. The idea concerned a Palestinian spokesman who worried the
Israelis might use the visit to legitimize settlements that much of
the world has condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also would not say whether Bush would meet any
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush's father was president, he sometimes clashed with
Israel's government at the time over its plan to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank. President Bush asserted that
expanding the settlements was an obstacle to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the other governors heard Monday from members of
Netanyahu's right-wing government as well as leaders of the
opposition Labor Party. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai reviewed
for them the threats Israel faces from Iran and Iraq and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon briefed them on security and the region's
water shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The governors visited the grave of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, the holocaust museum and the Israeli parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told local reporters that he has been impressed by the
``warmth'' of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In his dinner toast, he said Israel was the ``best hope for
democracy in the Middle East'' and said, ``Long may Israel live and
long may America and Israel's ties be as close as they possibly can
be.''

COUNTDOWN BEGINS FOR ENDEAVOUR LAUNCH TO DELIVER SPACE STATION
COMPONENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With marginal weather forecast, NASA on
Monday began the countdown for this week's launch of the shuttle
Endeavour with the second major component of the international
space station.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts are to blast off from
Kennedy Space Center on Thursday at 3:56 a.m., EST. The precise
moment will be recalculated shortly before liftoff to enable a
rendezvous with the first component of the new station, already
circling at an altitude of 240 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle carries the $300 million Unity module, a
33-foot-long component equipped with a half-dozen docking ports to
which future station compartments and hardware will be attached.
Using the shuttle's robot arm and spacewalks, the astronauts plan
to attach Unity to the $240 million, Russian-built Zarya module.
The station's first component, Zarya was successfully launched from
Central Asia on Nov. 20 to furnish the station's earliest
propulsion, electrical power and communications requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's launching has been delayed a year by Russian
financial difficulties. The problems have held up production of the
service module, the station's first habitable component and a
crucial factor in the pacing of the six-year station construction.
</P>
<P>
   As the countdown got under way on Monday, forecasters offered
the prospect of additional delays. The weather outlook included a
chance of low clouds and rain showers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Priselac, NASA's shuttle weather officer, placed the chance
of favorable conditions at 40 percent. The outlook was not expected
to improve until the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Endeavour mission has reserved the use of U.S. Air Force
ground tracking radar here through Dec. 8, said NASA test director
Doug Lyons, one of the officials supervising countdown activities.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the use of the tracking equipment would be
redirected toward the Dec. 10 liftoff of NASA's Mars Climate
Orbiter aboard a Delta rocket. That orbiter is the first of two
unmanned probes slated for launching to the Red Planet this month
and next.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reported that Endeavour's countdown was unfolding
routinely on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the mission were two Russian electronics boxes for
possible use aboard Zarya. One of the half-dozen power storage
batteries aboard Zarya has not discharged power properly since its
launching 11 days ago. Mission managers may assign the shuttle crew
to repair the problem using the new boxes or to simply leave the
gear for a future repair effort.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of training, the Endeavour crew was clearly
eager to begin its mission as they arrived in Florida from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a long time in coming,'' said Endeavour
commander Bob Cabana. ``This flight coming up is just the
beginning. I can't tell you how excited we are to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Endeavour links up with Zarya, the astronauts will use the
shuttle's 50-foot robot arm and at least three spacewalks to join
the two modules.
</P>
<P>
   The station's construction will require three dozen shuttle
flights and nine unmanned Russian rockets. An equal number of
Russian Progress cargo and Soyuz crew capsule missions will be
required as well. &QL;

ONE-THIRD OF TEXAS MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS, 43 PERCENT OF HIGH
SCHOOLERS REPORT TOBACCO USE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ A survey showing that nearly one-third of Texas middle
school students and 43 percent of high school students use tobacco
suggests the enormity of the state's teen smoking problem, which is
worse than state health officials expected.
</P>
<P>
   The figures include roughly 1 in every 4 sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco is addictive and deadly, and everyone should be
shocked that more than one-fourth of all sixth-graders in Texas are
using it,'' said Philip Huang, chief of the Texas Department of
Health's disease and injury prevention bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, believed to be the most comprehensive of its kind
conducted in the state, students were classified as current tobacco
users if they had used tobacco at least once in the previous 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   When students were asked if they had merely tried cigarettes _
as opposed to all forms of tobacco _ the numbers shot up to 53
percent for middle school students and 75 percent for those in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings include:
</P>
<P>
   Smoking generally increases with grade level, topping out at 47
percent of high school seniors.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, black students showed the lowest tobacco use in high
school (33 percent) but the greatest in middle school (37 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Huang considered it particularly ``worrisome'' that a larger
percentage of black students are smoking in middle school than in
high school. He said he feared that may stem from cigarette
advertising targeted to African-Americans and noted that black
people have been depicted in several ads for menthol cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Some 51 percent of high school boys and 35 percent of high
school girls use tobacco. But the gender gap narrows in middle
school, where 33 percent of the boys and 28 percent of the girls
use tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Some 19 percent of Texas high-schoolers and 14 percent of middle
school students smoke cigars and 8 percent of both age groups smoke
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, sponsored by the Texas Department of Health,
included an 87-item questionnaire completed by 13,029 students in
181 public schools last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Students and schools were selected to reflect the statewide and
regional demographic makeup of Texas' student population, the
health department said.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts say most people who become addicted to tobacco
begin smoking as children.
</P>
<P>
   State law prohibits the sale of tobacco to anyone younger than
18, and it also is illegal for anyone younger than 18 to buy or
possess cigarettes or other tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature last year attempted to crack down on teen
smoking with a new law that means a fine up to $250 or the
six-month suspension of a driver's license for any minor caught
smoking or possessing tobacco. Violators also can be required to
take a tobacco education course.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General Dan Morales sued the tobacco industry in
1996 to recoup public health care costs associated with smoking and
to end what he said were industry marketing practices that targeted
young people.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the $17.3 billion settlement that Morales negotiated
with cigarette makers earlier this year, the tobacco companies
agreed to some advertising restrictions, including an end to
billboard ads.
</P>
<P>
   But Huang said cigarette companies had increased their
advertising at convenience stores, which is still allowed under the
settlement. In Texas alone, the tobacco industry has been spending
$360 million a year on advertising _ at least before the state
settled its suit against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Huang said, the health department only has about
$1.5 million, including federal funds, to spend this year on
anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who will leave office next month, has asked the
Legislature to use $200 million of the state's first-year tobacco
settlement payments to beef up the educational effort against
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   A task force of state agencies and health care providers has
developed a proposal for spending that money over the next four
years, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the survey will help health officials evaluate the
potential effectiveness of new anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, 47 percent of whites, 41 percent of
Hispanics and 33 percent of black high school students use tobacco.
Users among middle school students include 37 percent of blacks, 35
percent of Hispanics and 27 percent of whites. &QL;

IF BUSH CAN'T SAVE THE GOP, WHO CAN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a question that is occurring to more and more people these
days. U.S. News &AMP; World Report posed it on the cover of its Nov. 16
issue: ``Can Bush Save the GOP?''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine cover featured a photograph of a smiling George W.
Bush, newly re-elected governor of Texas and hands-down
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 _
the picture leaving no doubt as to which member of the Bush family
has been anointed as potential savior of the Grand Old Party.
</P>
<P>
   With the governor's father just six years out of the Oval
Office, his wife winning acclaim as first lady of Texas, his
brother soon to be inaugurated as governor of Florida, and his
mother ... well, with his mother still one of the most admired
women on the planet, it would not be outrageous to imagine that a
casual reader might wonder which Bush was being touted to lead a
Republican rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know before, you know now: George W. Bush, the
``compassionate conservative,'' is the Republicans' best hope for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won re-election with darn near 70 percent of the vote _ and
those votes came from Texans in just about every voter category.
U.S. News described the Bush phenomenon:
</P>
<P>
   ``In winning a second term and sweeping the rest of the
statewide Republican ticket into office with him, he carried key
voting blocs that could be the basis for a new Republican
presidential coalition in 2000. Bush won not only more than two
thirds of female voters but 70 percent of independents, 60 percent
of moderates, and nearly one third of Democratic liberals. Perhaps
his most impressive achievement was snagging 49 percent of
Hispanics, a group he made a special effort to court.''
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to the sort of across-the-board appeal that
Republicans have only dreamed about in recent years while
consistently finding themselves on the short end of the gender gap,
the ethnic gap, the race gap and the ``Which candidate cares most
about people like us?'' gap.
</P>
<P>
   Party strategists can hardly be blamed if they are tempted to
overlook other would-be nominees as they rub their hands in
excitement at the prospect of a Bush-led ticket in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   We should not ignore the possibility, of course, that Bush will
pre-empt the ``Bush saves GOP'' scenario by taking a pass on the
presidential election. He has said again and again that he will not
run if he has serious misgivings about the effect of a national
campaign on his family _ and when he says it, he means it.
</P>
<P>
   What some people don't understand about Bush is that he is not a
politician who wins an election and immediately starts fantasizing
about higher office. He ran for governor because he had a vision
for the state's future and believed that he could turn that vision
into reality; he did not see the Governor's Mansion as a launching
pad to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush runs for president, it will be because he believes that
he can play a role in making the greatest nation on earth even
greater. He's been to the White House; he harbors no irresistible
yearning to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the question: Can Bush save the GOP?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. If he decides to run for the Republican presidential
nomination, he will be the nominee. If he is the nominee, he will
win the election _ over Vice President Al Gore or any other
opponent that the Democrats can conjure up.
</P>
<P>
   Why will he win? For the same reasons that he won two elections
for governor. He explained it in his victory speech on Nov. 3:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's resounding victory says my compassionate
conservative philosophy is making Texas a better place. But today's
election says something more. It says that a leader who is
compassionate and conservative can erase the gender gap, can open
the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and new voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says someone who is conservative and compassionate can win
without sacrificing principle. I have set and will continue to set
a tone that seeks to unify, not divide. I will work to include, not
exclude.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't just election-night rhetoric. It's what Bush
believes _ it's what he does and who he is.
</P>
<P>
   If George W. Bush can't save the GOP, nobody can.
</P>

RENO POSTPONES DECISION ON ICKES INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno postponed a decision
Monday on whether to seek an independent counsel to investigate
allegations that a former top aide to President Clinton lied under
oath during an inquiry into 1996 campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has been reviewing the case involving Harold Ickes for
the past three months, asked for another 60 days to determine
whether an independent counsel was needed to investigate the
perjury allegations against the former deputy White House chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's request was approved by a special three-judge panel of
the U.S. Court of Appeals that oversees the independent counsel
law. The court late Monday said the attorney general had ``shown
good cause for the requested extension.''
</P>
<P>
   The submission by Reno, which included her reasons for seeking
more time, was not released by the court. Sources said Reno asked
that the documents be kept confidential by the court.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Reno has resisted a push, mostly from
Republicans, to turn over to an independent counsel the campaign
fund-raising investigation being run by a Justice Department task
force. The team of 120 prosecutors and investigators has produced
charges against 14 people, including key Democratic contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Reno a week ago decided against seeking an independent counsel
to investigate whether Vice President Al Gore, a likely candidate
for president in 2000, lied under oath during an inquiry into his
1996 campaign fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   Calling evidence of wrong-doing ``insubstantial,'' Reno said
there ``are no reasonable grounds'' for further examination of
whether Gore lied to FBI agents about his effort to solicit
campaign funds by telephone from his government office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; By Monday, the attorney general must decide whether an outside
prosecutor should look into whether Clinton and his aides violated
federal law when they set up a multimillion-dollar advertising
campaign financed by the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ickes have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ickes case grew out of his testimony last year during a
Senate investigation into Democratic fund-raising in the 1996
campaign. Ickes, who coordinated the president's re-election
efforts with the Democratic Party, was asked about the White House
siding with the Teamsters, a major Democratic Party donor, to
settle a California labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes said he knew of no assistance from the administration, a
claim contradicted by other evidence gathered by investigators for
the Senate Committee on Government Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Committee investigators found that Ickes had asked then-U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor to urge Diamond Walnut Growers
to settle a dispute with the Teamsters in 1995. A company executive
testified there was no explicit threat but Kantor's call was viewed
at Diamond Walnut as part of the Teamsters' effort.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has turned to six independent prosecutors to investigate
allegations against Clinton administration officials. They include
current or former Cabinet members Alexis Herman, Bruce Babbitt,
Henry Cisneros, Mike Espy and Ron Brown.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton's business dealings in Arkansas and
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, plus alleged misuse of FBI files
and firings at the White House travel office have been under
investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. &QL;

   Evolutionary biology can be long on theory but short on
evidence. So biologists were delighted when they thought they had a
rare chance to conduct an experimental test of a popular and
appealing theory involving a kind of molecular arms race between
the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the test compelling but there was every indication
that its results would turn out to support the theory.
</P>
<P>
   But when the experiment, reported in the current issue of Nature
Genetics, was completed, the scientists got a rude surprise. The
results were not what they expected. Now, as the dust starts to
settle, researchers are asking whether the theory is wrong or
whether the experiment is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The evolutionary theory drew on a notion that there could be a
battle between the sexes even in the womb. One popular theory,
advanced by Dr. David Haig, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard
University, said that if a species is polygamous _ several males
can be the fathers of one litter _ each male will want to be sure
his progeny survive, even at the expense of the other offspring and
the mother.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the theory says, it will be in a male's interests to
carry genes that make his fetuses grow very big, very quickly. The
mother, on the other hand, will want to keep as many of her embryos
alive as possible, so she will want to pass on genes that
counteract the male's genes.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict will not arise, theoretically, if the species
is monogamous, since it is then in the interest of both the mother
and the father to give all fetuses an equal chance.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Haig's theory says, there can be a sort of genetic tug
of war in polygamous species. Males will develop genes that make
their offspring grow quickly. And females will develop genes to
counteract those male genes.
</P>
<P>
   What made the theory particularly appealing was that it could
explain a perplexing phenomenon known as genomic imprinting.
Certain genes only function if they are inherited from the father,
and the mother's copies of those genes are forever silenced. Other
genes only function if they are inherited from the mother, and the
father's copies are turned off.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 to 200 genes, 1 percent to 2 percent of the total in
the mammalian genome, are thought to be imprinted, said Dr. Shirley
M. Tilghman, a Howard Hughes professor of molecular biology at
Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of imprinting seemed paradoxical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually assume that organisms should do the sensible
thing,'' said Dr. Laurence D. Hurst, a professor of evolutionary
genetics at the University of Bath in England. ``If you have two
copies of a gene, you should be able to express both so that if one
misfires, you have a backup.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for biologists, Hurst said, was to explain why,
with imprinting, ``the organism is doing what at first glance is a
stupid thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, more than a dozen hypotheses to explain
imprinting have been proposed. But Haig's gained widest acceptance.
He argues that imprinting is the way that males of polygamous
species attempt to make their fetuses grow big.
</P>
<P>
   The males will imprint a gene, chemically modifying it over the
course of evolution, so that only the male's copy of the gene is
expressed. And that will be a gene that encourages fetal growth.
Females will respond by imprinting genes that will slow fetal
growth. Haig's theory also predicts that monogamous species would
not imprint their genes.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic arms race model proposed by Haig ``best explains all
the experimental data on imprinting,'' Tilghman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tilghman, who studies imprinting, decided to test Haig's
model directly. What she needed was a monogamous mammal and a
closely related polygamous one. Then she could ask whether genes
that were imprinted in the polygamous species were not imprinted in
the species that was monogamous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest job was finding a monogamous mammal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her search led to a 1965 paper by Dr. Wallace Dawson of the
University of South Carolina, who had discovered and maintained two
species of mice, one of which, Peromyscus polionotus, was
monogamous, while the other, Peromyscus maniculatus, was
polygamous.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson had mated the monogamous and the polygamous species of
Peromyscus and the results fit exactly with the predictions of
Haig's hypothesis. When the mother was monogamous and the father
polygamous, the theory predicts that the father's imprinted genes
would run into no opposition from the mother and the embryos should
be large.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are huge _ so big that they cannot be delivered
and the mother and her fetuses die unless scientists deliver the
baby mice by Caesarean section. But when the mother is polygamous
and the father is monogamous, the theory predicts small embryos.
And in that case the embryos were runts whose growth was
dramatically stunted. Even the placentas were affected, with those
from the giant mice six times the size of those from the runts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `This is perfect,''' Dr. Tilghman said. ``We will
get these mice and find out that the monogamous mice do not imprint
and the polygamous ones do. We will have done everything but prove
Haig's hypothesis.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to her great surprise, Dr. Tilghman found that both the
monogamous and the polygamous mice imprinted their genes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tilghman and her colleagues started by testing a gene called
H19. That gene, she said, was always ``perfectly imprinted''
whenever researchers examined it. A copy of the gene inherited from
the mother was always turned on full blast during fetal life and
the copy inherited from the father was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   If Haig's theory explained imprinting, it would be expected that
H19 would not be imprinted in the monogamous mice. But it was. And,
as with the polygamous mice, only the copy from the mother was
expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tilghman and her colleagues went on to look at seven more
genes, but to no avail. The imprinting patterns were not what she
expected; the predictions of Haig's theory were not fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how to interpret these results has now begun.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tilghman says that her data do not necessarily contradict
Haig's hypothesis because, for example, the monogamous mouse
species may have become that way fairly recently in evolutionary
time and may have retained imprinting as a remnant of its
polygamous past.
</P>
<P>
   Imprinting might also have the subsidiary effect of spurring
speciation, Dr. Tilghman said. Maybe the first thing that happens
when species diverge is that they start modifying genes _
imprinting them _ and eventually, as a consequence, they cannot
mate.
</P>
<P>
   This idea would not rule out imprinting as a reflection of a
battle between the sexes, Dr. Tilghman said. But it would say that
the consequences of the battle are not predictable and when it
occurs independently, species might diverge.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, a skeptic, said that the ready defense of Haig's
hypothesis perfectly illustrates what he sees as the problem with
evolutionary biology: no one says, before the fact, what
experimental results will cause them to reject a hypothesis. That
way, he said, if the data support a hypothesis they are embraced
and if they do not support it they are explained away. ``It's a
double standard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Haig sees the matter differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interpretation would not be that the theory was wrong, but
that the theory doesn't explain everything,'' Haig said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he welcomed Dr. Tilghman's experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm incredibly grateful to her,'' Haig said, ``and I'm glad
that she came up with questions to which we don't have ready
answers. That's the purpose of science.''

 &HT;    CLINTON WHITE HOUSE MAKES BEST OF BAD NEWS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the midst of an impeachment struggle that has
put excruciating details of his personal conduct on display,
President Clinton has nonetheless found the evening TV news much
kinder to him than to his adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the scandal discussion that has dominated the news
programs, comments on Clinton's job performance were 80 percent
positive, according to a study made by the Center for Media and
Public Affairs. The private, non-partisan group rated comments on
the evening news programs of ABC, NBC and CBS from midsummer until
Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the daily barrage of ethics and sex scandal coverage,
Clinton's aides and supporters were successful in airing their
views. Among comments made on the controversy, 25 percent were
rated as ``positive'' for Clinton, according to the same study.
</P>
<P>
   That's much better than for the man who led the investigation of
Clinton. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr fared about as well on
the evening news as did Iraq's President Saddam Hussein in the
depths of the Persian Gulf war, said Robert Lichter, president of
the media center, which has been monitoring TV news trends for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Starr received only 12 percent ``positive''
comments on news programs, according to the center's count. That's
about the same as the wartime coverage of Saddam. In the past few
weeks, Starr's positive percentage has bumped up to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton controversy, the president has a big advantage
over his critics, Lichter said. ``The White House defends the
president and it attacks the attackers. So he gets mixed coverage,
but his opponents get the worst.'' Lichter said that accusers such
as Starr, former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and Linda
Tripp, who taped her phone conversations with Lewinsky, have gotten
much more negative news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Starr could not publicly defend himself, so that
nearly all the remarks about him came from his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sound bites, the White House also had the advantage in
providing favorable pictures and backdrops for Clinton, Lichter
said. ``This has been true ever since Ronald Reagan discovered that
he was going to get terrible press but great pictures by setting up
photo opportunities,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the depths of the controversy over whether Clinton
perjured himself about his affair with Lewinsky, Lichter said that
the White House has succeeded in providing positive TV images.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, the day the Starr report hit the streets of
Washington, Clinton was addressing the United Nations and receiving
a standing ovation. As the impeachment hearings were opening in
Congress last week, Clinton was touring Asia aboard Air Force One
and cheering the U.S. troops guarding the South Korean border. And
as the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing Tuesday on the
significance of Clinton's alleged perjury, the cameras will also be
focused on the president's planned appearance at an AIDS event.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton has proven that he can make the most of such
events. ``I describe Bill Clinton as the almost perfect television
president,'' said Bruce Gronbeck, professor of political
communication at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has the ability to use television's great power, which
is to present emotions or feelings up close and personal,''
Gronbeck continued. ``Clinton's obviously extremely good at face
work. He can express a phenomenal range of emotions by very small
adjustments in his facial features. It's utterly amazing how good
he is at it, as good as any television actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the president's conversational style creates ``a
near-intimate relationship with the viewer'' that has been
essential in helping Clinton generate public sympathy, the
communications expert added.

POST-`WATERBOY' DEAL MEANS MEGABUCKS FOR SANDLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Waterboy'' has proved to be a watershed
moment for Adam Sandler, not to mention his accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Cashing in on the phenomenal success of ``The Waterboy'' (the
film has already grossed $123 million), Sandler has signed a
two-picture deal with New Line Cinema that will pay him nearly $20
million for the first picture and possibly as much as $25 million
for the second film. Sandler will also receive a substantial gross
participation fee for both movies.
</P>
<P>
   With the deal, Sandler joins the elite circle of actors,
including Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford and Tom
Cruise, who can command a $20 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `The Waterboy' grossed $39 million in its opening week,
everyone knew it was just a matter of time before Adam Sandler
would get this kind of contract,'' says Paul Dergarabedian,
president of the box-office tracking service Exhibitor Relations
Co., Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the first time Sandler and New Line have joined
forces. Earlier this year, the studio released the comedian's
breakthrough film, ``The Wedding Singer,'' which broadened
Sandler's audience appeal to the tune of $80 million. The former
``Saturday Night Live'' star had earlier enjoyed modest box-office
successes with his first two films, ``Billy Madison'' and ``Happy
Gilmore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled that Adam has committed his next two films to
us,'' said New Line president Michael De Luca. ``With `The Wedding
Singer,' Adam knows how hard New Line worked to develop, market and
distribute a romantic comedy that expanded his fan base. We have
every intention of being a part of his success for a long time to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the immediate future, Sandler is currently shooting ``Big
Daddy,'' about a man who adopts a little boy to keep his girlfriend
from leaving him. Sony Pictures will release the movie in June.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler will then segue into his New Line deal with ``Little
Nicky,'' a father-and-son comedy that has Sandler playing a guy
who's next in line to take over the family business. He has his
reservations, about joining, though, because his father is the
devil. Sandler will write the movie along with longtime
collaborator Tim Herlihy. New Line hopes to begin production this
spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment nightmare is
turning into a congressional tummy ache. As the showdown with the
lying lecher in the White House at last nears a close, the
sanctimonious Congress is losing.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a gripping morality play has become a silly
political farce, for all its potentially serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee
gives it to President Clinton, as expected, next week and the House
votes on whether to recommend his impeachment, the better off we
will all be.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment follies have become redundant, filled with a
strange, otherworldly quality that seems isolated from the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Political unreality characterizes the partisan congressional
crusade to persuade the public that the president should be thrown
out of office. The whole performance comes as an afterthought. Most
minds are already made up.
</P>
<P>
   The same members of Congress appear on television saying the
same things over and over, solemnly arguing with one another over
constitutional issues they describe as inarguable. The same pundits
repeat the comments they have been making all along. Nobody
influences anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Help. Where is a theatrical deus ex machina when we need one?
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters long ago decided that Clinton is a naughty
boy but did not abuse his official power in ways that deserve the
impeachment so piously advocated by Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr. The only charge Starr substantiated is that Clinton lied
about illicit sex under oath in a civil suit. This is too much ado
about too little.
</P>
<P>
   For all the contradictory public posturing of its members, the
House committee's anti-Clinton verdict is preordained. But that
will not finish off the president. The Senate is certain to reject
his ouster if the full House recommends a trial. With only 55 GOP
senators, the numbers are simply not there to reach the two-thirds
majority of those present required to send Clinton packing.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is how determined House Republicans are to
betray their own long-term interests by overreaching in their
campaign to humiliate a president who has no shame. They seem
genuinely divided on whether to recommend impeachment, even though
it would be truly stupid to force the GOP-controlled Senate to
waste months debating presidential punishment instead of dealing
with issues that voters really care about.
</P>
<P>
   Such a distraction would interfere with Senate consideration of
serious legislation, leaving the Republicans looking as though they
cannot govern. The image of an impeachment-obsessed Congress hurt
the Republicans in last month's election. Extending that impression
into the new Congress is surely a bad idea for year 2000
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is flopping around aimlessly,
making no serious effort to turn up new information and producing
nothing of substance to affect the outcome. This is a bad joke, a
far cry from the serious, bipartisan House committee that
recommended impeachment for President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Why are members bothering with these nonsensical hearings? Why
are they calling, behind closed doors, minor witnesses who they
know will take the Fifth Amendment? Why don't they call the one
person who could be enlightening, Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   Sending 81 juvenile questions to the president created an
illusion of professional activity but was really a foolish test of
wills that the committee could not win. The GOP majority professed
to be outraged at the president's legalistic answers in which he
failed to confess major crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would have satisfied them but an admission of guilt.
Underestimating him for the umpteenth time, they actually thought
he was stupid enough to voluntarily incriminate himself.
</P>
<P>
   The committee underestimated the rest of us, as well. A day
spent discussing the meaning of perjury is a day wasted, a sorry
attempt to lecture Americans from a moral pedestal that is
inappropriate for a Congress with its own credibility shortfall.
Americans already know the difference between right and wrong. And
they know the difference between a dangerous, corrupt president and
a self-indulgent, horny one.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also cynically invited Clinton to appear before the
committee to defend his behavior. How generous of Hyde. How
transparent. Not surprisingly, the White House promptly rejected
this feeble legislative trap to force Clinton to grovel in person.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, momentum grows, although mostly underground, for
the alternative penalty of censure. It would scar Clinton for
history's purposes but leave him in office.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans are opposed because they are determined to
destroy Clinton, even though the lengthy impeachment process is not
in the best interest of either their party or the country. But
cooler heads will hopefully prevail. Short of a Clinton
resignation, censure is the only sensible way out. Congress can do
no more. And it should not.

 &HT;    BUSH FINDS BACKERS AT WESTERN WALL
 &HT;    EDS: Clarifies name of ``Jewish voice'' group in 8th graf
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Amid the religious fervor and history of the holy
Western Wall, travel agent Manola Noon of Austin got to give her
governor the two-fingered ``Hook' em horns'' signal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush answered the University of Texas fan
with a thumbs up, and his second day in Israel sidetracked into a
few minutes of handshakes and photos with other Americans who
happened to be sightseeing there.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Noon were on their first visits to Israel, but
Bush has been hosted as the GOP presidential frontrunner he denies
being.
</P>
<P>
   His day started with a reception with Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert, who said with a grin that he hoped to someday visit the
governor ``in Texas or Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He then met with several top Israeli politicians, culminating
with a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is accompanied by Republican governors from Utah, Montana
and Massachusetts. But, aside for an awkward digression in which he
asked whether Montana borders Canada, Netanyahu focused his toast
on Bush and his potential as a ``world leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he has not made up his mind about whether he will
run for president, but the prospect has focused early attention on
him.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is organized by a group of Republican supporters, the
National Jewish Coalition, which calls itself the ``Jewish voice''
of the Republican Party and supports the policies of the Israeli
government. Bush aides have said he will reimburse the group for
the trip from leftover campaign money. He was re-elected governor
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Trip organizers have refused to disclose the governors'
schedules and Bush has refused to answer most questions from
reporters, saying that he will hold his comments about the trip for
a press conference in Austin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There have been questions here about whether the last day of the
trip, Tuesday, will include a visit to any of the controversial
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, land Israel captured in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   An initial schedule released by the Israeli government indicated
that a helicopter tour for the governors might include a brief stop
at a settlement, if only to use it as an observation point for the
area. The idea concerned a Palestinian spokesman who worried the
Israelis might use the visit to legitimize settlements that much of
the world has condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also would not say whether Bush would meet any
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush's father was president, he sometimes clashed with
Israel's government at the time over its plan to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank. President Bush asserted that
expanding the settlements was an obstacle to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the other governors heard Monday from members of
Netanyahu's right-wing government as well as leaders of the
opposition Labor Party. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai reviewed
for them the threats Israel faces from Iran and Iraq and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon briefed them on security and the region's
water shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The governors visited the grave of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, the holocaust museum and the Israeli parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told local reporters that he has been impressed by the
``warmth'' of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In his dinner toast, he said Israel was the ``best hope for
democracy in the Middle East'' and said, ``Long may Israel live and
long may America and Israel's ties be as close as they possibly can
be.''

   CLINTON-TV _ WASHINGTON _ In the midst of an impeachment threat,
President Clinton has found that television news has been

group found that, aside from the scandal, 80 percent of the network
news TV ``sound bites'' on his job performance were positive.
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's coverage has been only 15
percent positive, only slightly better than Saddam Hussein fared on
the evening news programs during the Persian Gulf war. For the
White House, powerful pictures and a TV-savvy president have been
crucial to scandal management, experts say. (Malone, Cox News

Kropf prepares a syringe from an innocuous vial the size of her
thumb. He rolls up his left sleeve. This is not the end of AIDS,
not even close. The vaccine may not work. Even if it does, it will
take years of further testing and tweaking before it is approved
for widespread use. Flinchum knows this, and Kropf knows this, and

SUPREME COURT ENTERS BATTLE OVER 2000 CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration asked the Supreme Court
Monday to allow it to use a new method to conduct the 2000 census
that would likely benefit the Democrats by lowering an expected
undercount of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The new method would employ statistical sampling to help
determine the number of people in the United States rather than
relying completely on the traditional system of mailing out
questionnaires and then dispatching thousands of enumerators to
hunt down those who don't respond.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican-led House of Representatives and a group of
private citizens who claim they would be hurt by the new method
have challenged the use of sampling, saying that it violates the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In his arguments before the Supreme Court, Solicitor General
Seth Waxman, representing the administration, said that no census
in the history of the United States has ever been able to track
down every person in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The sampling plan would ``best achieve the Constitution's goal
of determining the number of persons in each state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman added: ``It is in effect a quality check'' on the initial
head count to be conducted starting April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 study by the National Academy of Sciences showed that the
1990 census missed 8.4 million people, mostly of whom were
minorities and recent immigrants living in urban or rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Carvin, representing the group of 16 citizens, told
the court that the Constitution calls for an ``actual enumeration''
of the population. ``The only process it contemplates is
counting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices appeared to agree with Carvin.
</P>
<P>
   Interrupting Waxman during his arguments, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said, ``Most people would think an actual enumeration
means an actual count. How do you get around that?''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman answered that someone looking for the number of people
attending a baseball game wouldn't count every person but would,
instead, estimate the size of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia snapped back, ``You would call that an
enumeration?''
</P>
<P>
   But other justices questioned the accuracy of a census that used
the traditional methods of counting the population.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked Maureen E. Mahoney, representing
the House, what would happen if nobody in a large apartment
building that was known to house illegal aliens responded to census
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a census enumerator couldn't get anybody to say that they
lived there, would he write down that the number of people in that
apartment building was zero?'' Stevens asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mahoney answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the lights go on and off in the evening?'' added
Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to rule on the case in the spring. Because
the census is used to determine the makeup of the House of
Representatives and state legislatures and to decide where federal
funds should go, the court's decision could have tremendous
political and financial impact across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists from both political parties say that sampling would
turn up increases in the number of people living in historically
Democratic areas, giving the party an advantage when new boundaries
for congressional, state and local legislative districts are drawn
after the 2000 census has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   These strategists also say that since sampling would find
increases in the number of poor people counted in urban and rural
areas, cities and agricultural counties would receive extra federal
dollars at the expense of suburban communities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration's sampling plan, the Census Bureau
would use traditional methods to count everyone living in 90
percent of U.S. households and then use the data gathered to
estimate the remaining 10 percent of the population who haven't
been located.
</P>
<P>
   Following that count, the bureau would conduct another, more
intensive census of 750,000 specially selected households.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau then would compare the results of the second census
with those of the original 90-percent census. In areas where the
two counts differ, the bureau would use the figures from the second
census to adjust the original census.
</P>
<P>
   During his argument, Waxman urged the justices to throw out the
case. He contended that the plaintiffs _ the congressional
Republicans in one lawsuit and the 16 individuals living in six
states plus officials from Cobb County, Ga., in another _ have no
right to file the motions. He argued that since the census has yet
to take place, the plaintiffs have not been hurt by it and
therefore cannot say it is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way they can claim that something that hasn't
happened could have injured them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist appeared unconvinced by
the argument, asking, ``What good would waiting until after the
census is taken to figure out if there was a mistake? Would we
re-do the census?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In September, a three-judge federal district court in Richmond,
Va., unanimously ruled, in the case of the 16 individuals and Cobb
County, Ga., that federal law bars the use of sampling for the
purpose of apportioning congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   That court said the six states where the 16 people live are
``substantially likely'' to lose seats in the House if the national
head count is determined partly by sampling. As a result, the lower
court found, the 16 can legitimately claim that they would be hurt
by prospective ``vote dilution'' of the sort that the Supreme Court
has recognized in the past as a basis for challenging an
apportionment plan.
</P>
<P>
   The six states are Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in August, a separate three-judge district court panel
here in Washington, D.C., issued a unanimous ruling in the suit by
House Republicans, saying sampling violated federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The D.C. court ruled that the lawmakers did have the right to
file the suit. It said sampling threatens the ``institutional
interests'' of the House because it could alter that body's
composition.

 &HT;    SUN WITNESS TO MOVE MICROSOFT TRIAL INTO KEY PHASE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft antitrust trial will shift into high
gear again this week when the government calls Java creator James
Gosling to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 pages of direct testimony from Gosling, a
vice-president of Sun Microsystems Inc., is expected to be made
public after the court recesses Tuesday, to be followed by an
intense cross-examination by Microsoft's lawyers for the rest of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   The key issue in this phase of the case will be Microsoft's
purported misuse of the Java programming language. The trustbusters
contend that Microsoft willfully ``broke'' Java by grafting a
Windows-only version of the language onto what Sun's intended
``write-once, use-many'' universal standard.
</P>
<P>
   Gosling has also been a witness in a private lawsuit that Sun
brought against Microsoft. In that case, Gosling told a federal
district court in California why Microsoft supposedly saw Java as a
threat to its operating system, and how it then allegedly wrote a
``polluted'' version of Java for its products in a bid to derail
Sun's competitive efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Sun won a preliminary injunction in that case,
which in turn forced Microsoft to make changes to its Java products
to bring them into line with Sun's compatibility standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Microsoft is always trying to change the subject,
this case has always been about the market for personal computer
operating systems _ a market that Microsoft monopolizes,'' David
Boies, the government's chief litigator, said in a brief interview
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Microsoft placed an ad in several newspapers
congratulating three companies that have attacked the software
giant in court _ America Online Inc., Netscape Communications Corp.
and Sun _ for having cut a merger deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy and vibrant high tech economy is creating powerful
new alliances and competitors. It isn't occurring in court and it
doesn't take years of litigation,'' the ad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always interesting when a monopolist spends its money to
tell people it is not a monopolist,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   Although in view of the AOL-Netscape merger Microsoft has
publicly called on the government to drop its case, no such request
has been filed with either the federal court or with Attorney
General Janet Reno, who has the discretion to halt the civil
prosecution, a Microsoft spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the trial entered its seventh week with no end in
sight. Both sides had initially predicted a six- to eight-week
battle. Boies now believes the trial will run at least until March,
one assertion that Microsoft's defenders, the Wall Street firm of
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, won't challenge.
</P>
<P>
   However, over four days in court, attorney Michael Lacovara has
challenged nearly every aspect of the testimony offered by
Frederick Warren-Boulton, a top economist in the Justice
Department's antitrust division during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lacovara noted that one of the many internal
documents Warren-Boulton has cited came from Christian Wildfeuer,
who conducts focus groups for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think monopolists have an incentive'' to invest in
focus groups? Lacovara asked the witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing about monopoly power that indicates that a
profit-maximizing monopolist has any incentive not to listen to its
customers,'' Warren-Boulton replied.

CUSTOMS SEIZES FAKE NEW JERSEY TAX STAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The U.S. Customs Service said Monday that agents
recovered 86,000 counterfeit New Jersey cigarette tax stamps that a
woman tried to smuggle into the United States from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The thumb-nail size stickers were hidden in gift-wrapped
packages carried by the woman as she crossed the border from Nuevo
Laredo in a taxi, Customs spokesman Rick Pauza said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was stopped during the holiday weekend, had told
inspectors at the international bridge here that the brightly
wrapped packages contained pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps were seized, but the woman was not charged and later
was fined $34,000 and released. Pauza said she must pay the fine if
she becomes a legal resident of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very rare,'' Pauza said of finding the black-and-red
stickers with an outline of the state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The bogus stamps, printed in sheets of 100 to look as if they
were issued by New Jersey, have an estimated street value of
$68,800, a New Jersey official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bootlegging in a way,'' said Dan Emmer, a spokesman for
the New Jersey Treasury Department. ``If you get your own or
counterfeit tax stamps, you can undercharge the price of
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's tax is 80 cents on a pack of cigarettes, and stamps
are affixed to packs by distributors to show the tax has been paid,
he said. It is the third highest state cigarette tax in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey investigators will examine the stamps, said Joe
Flynn, a criminal investigator with the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions is whether there is a relationship between
the stamps seized here and a New York City operation that was
caught during the summer counterfeiting tax stamps for
Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to track down the source and destination,'' Flynn
said. ``If they're counterfeiting New Jersey stamps, I'm sure
they're counterfeiting other things.''

 &HT;    The world is far larger than outcome of a game
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Naked hatred is an ugly sight, as senseless as a rabid
dog.
</P>
<P>
   You have only to turn on the radio. ``I hate Tech!'' someone
whose name I think was Phil screamed into his telephone. On the
other end, the program's host ministered to his caller like a
kindly pastor in his hour of grief. It occurred to neither host nor
caller to focus the fury more precisely, much less explain it.
</P>
<P>
   This was hatred for someone, or something, that did not even
exist in the flesh. ``Tech''? Who exactly was that? It was an
abstraction, like ``society'' and ``liberals'' and
``conservatives'' and ``the media.'' The impulse to hate creates
its own object, real or not.
</P>
<P>
   So it was on Saturday afternoon as my son and I were driving
from Athens(Ga.) back to Atlanta. We had witnessed one of the best
college football games you'll ever see. A year ago, we had seen one
just like it, this one in Atlanta, this one also involving the
University of Georgia and Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The two games were mirror images of each other, the outcomes
decided in the closing seconds. The difference _ as all know by now
_ was that Georgia won last year and Tech won this year.
</P>
<P>
   What goes around comes around. At least sometimes _ and that was
what made both games autumn afternoons that won't be forgotten by
anyone who was present. On one side there was jubilation, on the
other disappointment. Anyone could understand that, and the games
could be appreciated for that alone.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always easy to make the case for big-time college
athletics. But last Saturday you could think better of the players
than of the fans. Many of them, anyway. If you were careless enough
to tune into a sports call-in show, you realized that the real
goons were not in the locker room. They were on the air.
</P>
<P>
   It was a station broadcasting from Athens, 95.5 on the AM dial.
As we headed west on U.S. 78, it began as nothing more than
post-game patter. The Bulldogs' offensive coordinator was fielding
dumb questions, returning the dumb answers they deserved, and
sometimes no answer at all.
</P>
<P>
   If I'd been alone I'd have put in a CD or simply enjoyed the
silence. There were other things on my mind. Driving into a sunset
that became more beautiful by the mile, I knew I would be attending
a funeral the next day in Gwinnett County(Ga.). A friend and her
husband would be burying their youngest child, killed a few days
earlier in a car wreck. It was easy enough to enjoy the game, and
just as easy to leave it at Sanford Stadium. Nothing like life or
death was happening between the hedges.
</P>
<P>
   But these were my own thoughts, and there was no reason to dwell
on them with my son. Noah is 11, and you would have thought most of
the callers weren't much older.
</P>
<P>
   When you're 11, the outcome of a game between 20-year-olds can
be all-consuming. I knew that from experience, and tried to be
consoling. The truth is that it didn't matter much to me who won,
the Bulldogs or the Yellow Jackets. But Tech was the underdog and
anyone with any feeling for the game had to thrill seeing
quarterback Joe Hamilton and tailback Charlie Rogers cut upfield
for big gains.
</P>
<P>
   More than any of this, though, I know that Noah enjoys a benign
competition with his old man. When the football rankings come out
each Monday morning, his oatmeal sits cold as he pores over the
latest calibrations in the polls. This fall, every week that
Georgia inched up a notch was a week off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   How he ever got to be such a Bulldog fan, I have no idea. It's
OK with me, but I'm trusting he'll realize in time that the world
is larger than just Clarke County(Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   The people I wonder about are the ones oblivious of anything
beyond the hedges. The spectacle of grown-ups waiting on hold to
ask a football coach to fill them in on where high school students
plan to attend college is as silly in its own way as the calls Dr.
Laura gets.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's a bit juvenile, at least it's not abusively fanatic.
It was other callers, venting blind hatred, you wanted no part of.
Whatever world they live in, I want to live somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, at a graveside service in Gwinnett County, I thought
about them again, and thought how paltry their passion was, how
small their world. I almost pitied them.

   Time has passed, although apparently not quite enough time for
some of New York's 15th Precinct. Bobby Simone is dead and buried,
but still a living memory for his wife and fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   Then in walks Bobby's replacement, and it's that little Ricky
Schroder from ``Silver Spoons,'' except now he's Rick (no
diminutive) Schroder, all grown up with what may be the toughest
dual job on television at the moment: convincing his resentful
co-workers he's not some fresh punk trying to do a man's job _ and
convincing ``NYPD Blue'' viewers of the same.
</P>
<P>
   And Schroder is convincing. The acting chops that producer
Steven Bochco and co-star Dennis Franz saw when Schroder tried out
for the new role are abundant. He may look like a high schooler _ a
running thread on tonight's episode _ but he has an impressive
authority as rookie Detective Danny Sorensen.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't easy being the new guy, though, especially when you're
still getting carded in bars. Danny is partnered with Sipowicz
(Franz), who's his usual cuddly self: ``So that's what 14-year-olds
are wearin' now?'' he growls at Danny, who's wearing a leather
jacket. (Sipowicz, never exactly on the cutting edge of fashion,
should realize the leather jacket is now the garment of choice for
45-year-old men nationwide.)
</P>
<P>
   But young Danny's real shoe-squeezer is Diane Russell (Kim
Delaney), Bobby's widow, who's still fragile and unwilling to
accept anybody as Bobby's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   (Maybe it's method acting for the cast, since Schroder
leap-frogged right into second-spot billing, after Franz but ahead
of the rest.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Danny is no boy. Although he's only recently gotten his
gold detective's shield, he's an Army vet and former beat cop. When
he hits the streets, he's in his element, with a good cop sense of
when to play rough with a suspect and when to play nice.
</P>
<P>
   The more you watch him, the more he's reminiscent of a younger
Sipowicz we never saw, a guy with a little attitude, a lot of heart
and a healthy amount of lip. ``Yeah, why don't you write that up
for Reader's Digest,'' he snaps at a whiny perp in a line that
could have been written for Andy.
</P>
<P>
   So ``NYPD'' comes out very well in the Smits-for-Schroder swap.
And the sobriquet ``icky Ricky'' is hereby officially retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>

 &HT;    SUN WITNESS TO MOVE MICROSOFT TRIAL INTO KEY PHASE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft antitrust trial will shift into high
gear again this week when the government calls Java creator James
Gosling to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 pages of direct testimony from Gosling, a
vice-president of Sun Microsystems Inc., is expected to be made
public after the court recesses Tuesday, to be followed by an
intense cross-examination by Microsoft's lawyers for the rest of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   The key issue in this phase of the case will be Microsoft's
purported misuse of the Java programming language. The trustbusters
contend that Microsoft willfully ``broke'' Java by grafting a
Windows-only version of the language onto what Sun's intended
``write-once, use-many'' universal standard.
</P>
<P>
   Gosling has also been a witness in a private lawsuit that Sun
brought against Microsoft. In that case, Gosling told a federal
district court in California why Microsoft supposedly saw Java as a
threat to its operating system, and how it then allegedly wrote a
``polluted'' version of Java for its products in a bid to derail
Sun's competitive efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Sun won a preliminary injunction in that case,
which in turn forced Microsoft to make changes to its Java products
to bring them into line with Sun's compatibility standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Microsoft is always trying to change the subject,
this case has always been about the market for personal computer
operating systems _ a market that Microsoft monopolizes,'' David
Boies, the government's chief litigator, said in a brief interview
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Microsoft placed an ad in several newspapers
congratulating three companies that have attacked the software
giant in court _ America Online Inc., Netscape Communications Corp.
and Sun _ for having cut a merger deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy and vibrant high tech economy is creating powerful
new alliances and competitors. It isn't occurring in court and it
doesn't take years of litigation,'' the ad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always interesting when a monopolist spends its money to
tell people it is not a monopolist,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   Although in view of the AOL-Netscape merger Microsoft has
publicly called on the government to drop its case, no such request
has been filed with either the federal court or with Attorney
General Janet Reno, who has the discretion to halt the civil
prosecution, a Microsoft spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the trial entered its seventh week with no end in
sight. Both sides had initially predicted a six- to eight-week
battle. Boies now believes the trial will run at least until March,
one assertion that Microsoft's defenders, the Wall Street firm of
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, won't challenge.
</P>
<P>
   However, over four days in court, attorney Michael Lacovara has
challenged nearly every aspect of the testimony offered by
Frederick Warren-Boulton, a top economist in the Justice
Department's antitrust division during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lacovara noted that one of the many internal
documents Warren-Boulton has cited came from Christian Wildfeuer,
who conducts focus groups for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think monopolists have an incentive'' to invest in
focus groups? Lacovara asked the witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing about monopoly power that indicates that a
profit-maximizing monopolist has any incentive not to listen to its
customers,'' Warren-Boulton replied.

 &HT;    Taking their best shot; AIDS vaccine trials begin in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Flinchum doesn't much like needles, but he is
about to become the first volunteer in Atlanta to be inoculated
with AIDSVAX, the first vaccine for the AIDS virus to be widely
tested in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He watches calmly as nurse Gail Kropf prepares a syringe from an
innocuous vial the size of her thumb. He rolls up his left sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   One would think this would be a solemn moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never, never get a tattoo of your lover's name,'' Flinchum
quips ruefully, looking at the inscription ``ROGER'' _ an
ex-boyfriend _ on his upper arm, just below where the needle should
go.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone stops laughing, Kropf gives him the shot.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the end of AIDS, not even close. The vaccine may not
work. Even if it does, it will take years of further testing and
tweaking before it is approved for widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   Other vaccines must be created and tested, in a winnowing
process that could take more than a decade. In that time, tens of
millions of people will become infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Flinchum knows this, and Kropf knows this, and they try not to
attach too much significance to the tiny vial marked VAX004.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a step in the long march toward eliminating one of the
worst diseases the world has seen, a disease with no cure. As of
today, the 11th annual World AIDS Day, 33.4 million people
worldwide are living with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Flinchum nor any of the other 149 Atlantans who will be
inoculated eventually as part of the AIDSVAX study are in any
danger from the vaccine. Unlike some other types of vaccines that
carry a small risk of infecting people with the diseases they are
meant to prevent, AIDSVAX is harmless. It doesn't contain the virus
itself, only a copy of the viral shell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, AIDSVAX recipients are at risk for HIV _ researchers are
specifically choosing test subjects with sexual habits that put
them at risk.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound callous, but it is the only way to find out whether
a vaccine works. To prove that an HIV vaccine is effective,
scientists must test it in humans who are exposed to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   But because AIDS is a killer, researchers have a moral
responsibility to do everything possible to prevent people from
risking infection.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dilemma worthy of Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we would want or encourage infections to happen
in a trial to determine whether or not a vaccine works is
ludicrous,'' said Dr. William Heyward, who heads HIV vaccine
research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, is a vaccine to be thoroughly tried?
</P>
<P>
   As the first large-scale trial of an experimental HIV vaccine
gets under way in Atlanta and the United States, researchers must
grapple with this question and other social and scientific issues.
</P>
<P>
   During the next four years, 5,000 people in North America and
2,500 in Thailand will be inoculated with either the AIDSVAX
vaccine or a placebo, an inactive shot. AIDSVAX is the creation of
VaxGen Inc., based near San Francisco and headed by veteran AIDS
researcher Dr. Don Francis.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Research Consortium of Atlanta is seeking 150
volunteers for the AIDSVAX trials here. Altruism is appreciated,
but the primary criterion is rigid: Participants must be
HIV-negative but at high risk for infection because of their sexual
behavior. Flinchum, for instance, is dating an HIV-positive man.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai arm of the study will focus on injection drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the study criteria, volunteers will risk being
stigmatized. And because of their own risky behavior, some of the
test subjects will become infected.
</P>
<P>
   They will join the 16,000 people who become infected with HIV
each day.
</P>
<P>
   Francis is optimistic about AIDSVAX, but grimly realistic about
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bloody dangerous virus,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately before Flinchum's inoculation last week, ARCA nurses
gave him a head-to-toe physical examination as well as a
heart-to-heart conversation about HIV risks and prevention. Test
subjects must undergo risk counseling before every time they are
inoculated _ seven times in all, over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about it,'' said Flinchum, who works in human
resources for Rich's at Perimeter Mall. ``It gives me a chance to
be involved in something worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Flinchum, who is 42 and gay, has spent most of his adulthood in
the shadow of the AIDS epidemic, yet has escaped its worst ravages.
He is HIV-negative and has never lost a partner to AIDS, although
friends have died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm lucky,'' he says. ``The majority of the people I
know are still around.''
</P>
<P>
   He is seeing a man with HIV, but they are always careful, he
assures. That won't change despite the inoculation _ he knows
there's a 1-in-3 chance the syringe was full of nothing but saline.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Flinchum did receive AIDSVAX, he'll probably never have
reason to question its preventative powers. ARCA researchers will
be proud of him for practicing safe sex, though he won't be a good
test of whether AIDSVAX is effective.
</P>
<P>
   Other test subjects will not be so wise. Despite repeated,
earnest counseling, they will have unprotected oral or anal sex.
Some will ignore constant reminders that they may have received the
placebo and that the vaccine may not be effective. Thinking
themselves protected, they will abandon caution.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Feinberg of Emory University(Ga.) recalls a 1994 HIV
vaccine study in San Francisco, in which a number of people were
infected with HIV although testers warned them against relying on
the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That message seems to be a difficult one to get through,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are obligated to thoroughly educate study participants,
but it is entirely up to individuals to determine their own
actions, Heyward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully recognize that our ability to change people's
behavior and prevent them from engaging in risk behavior, whether
it's sexual activity or drug use, is limited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the infection rates among the trial's participants may be
lower than among the general population _ yet people will be
infected. Through them, researchers will learn about AIDSVAX as
well as gain insight into the human body's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a really incomplete understanding of the immune
system,'' said Dr. Melanie Thompson, ARCA's principal researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDSVAX trial also will be something of a study in human
nature. It will reveal how test subjects behave during an HIV
vaccine trial and whether they acquire a false sense of immunity or
a greater degree of caution.
</P>
<P>
   The concern over complacency is a valid one, as research
indicates faith in new HIV drugs has led some people to engage in
risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that treatment options are far from perfect,
and more people than ever are living with HIV. Half of all new
infections occur among 15- to 24-year-olds, and 11 people are
infected every minute worldwide. Clearly, prevention without a
vaccine is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therapy will have a miniscule impact globally,'' Heyward said.
``The only way we're going to get out of this is a preventative
vaccine.''

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I cannot believe who our company put into a
vice president position over our area. He has been with the company
for several years, but he does not have the skills or experience to
handle this job, nor does he have the respect of those of us who
are supposed to report to him. It's not as if I should have been
promoted, but any of us would have been better. What should we do?
E.F. &QL; 
A. At this point, you have to play the cards that you have been
dealt, even if you feel that this new vice president is not exactly
an ace. The best approach is to give this whole matter some time.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, if you maintain the belief that he is weak, this
is going to affect the way that you work with him to the point that
your working relationship is going to be undermined before it
starts. Although you do not need to greet this new vice president
with open arms, an open mind will help.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is possible that your perceptions of this person
are inaccurate, and he may have more skills than may be apparent.
There are certainly cases where people move into positions that are
seemingly over their heads only to perform with distinction.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if your perceptions about this individual's
competencies are accurate, there is a good chance that top
management will recognize its mistake and correct it. However, if
management is literally or figuratively wedded to this type of
person, then it is time for you to think about how long you want to
be wedded to this type of company. &QL; 
Q. A few weeks ago, I hired a new employee in our department. Right
from the start, he has acted like he is in charge. He tells other
people what to do and answers questions that are beyond his
expertise. I have met with him to discuss the problem, but he has
not changed. What can you suggest I do? K.B. &QL; 
A. Employers often state that they want employees who will take
charge, but sometimes this approach leads to an employee who wants
to take over. On the one hand, you do not want to undercut his
initiative and energy. But at the same time, you do not want to let
him undercut the initiative and energy of your entire department.
</P>
<P>
   Since you have met with him to discuss the problem, now is the
time to meet with him to discuss solutions. Let him know that you
expect employees to demonstrate independence, creativity and
leadership, but the No. 1 priority is for employees to carry out
the responsibilities for which they were hired in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him to discuss what he regards as the primary
responsibilities of his position, along with his views of the way
in which he is carrying them out. If there are a few gaps in these
areas, you should fill them in. Both of you should then jointly
establish some near-term and longer-term objectives, along with
plans and strategies to meet them. The meeting should end with a
commitment from him to focus his energy on these objectives. He
should also understand that if he cannot keep his commitment, it
may be difficult to keep him. &QL; 
Q. One of my close friends reports to me, and she made a monumental
error. There's no question that I have to reprimand her, but,
honestly, I fear what that will do to our friendship. What's the
best way to handle this? T.G. &QL; 
A. In your question, you indicated that you honestly fear what will
happen to your friendship, but your question has the answer implied
in it. The best way to handle this matter is to deal honestly with
her. However, rather than opting for a reprimand, which generates
little more than defensiveness and ill will, you should approach
this from the standpoint of providing performance-based feedback,
coaching and guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this employee is your friend should have no
bearing whatsoever. You should approach her in the same way that
you would any other employee: Be friendly, fair and businesslike,
and avoid criticizing, berating or labeling. The objective is to
discuss what happened and then develop a strategy to prevent it
from occurring again.
</P>
<P>
   As her manager, you should also honestly ask yourself if there
was anything that you could have done to help prevent the
monumental error in the first place. This type of approach, based
on trust and respect, is an important part of the manager-employee
relationship, and it is an important part of the friendship as
well. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another round of heavy rain will spread onto the northwest coast
on Tuesday, as the latest in a parade of moist Pacific disturbances
marches onshore. Strong winds will buffet the coast, with gusts
past 60 mph likely along exposed beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, some heavy, will fall in the Cascades. Snow levels will
fall Tuesday night, after temporarily rising Tuesday afternoon.
Farther south, patches of lighter rain will affect northern
California, with snow falling above 4,000 feet in the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   A potent jet-stream disturbance will spiral into the Southwest.
The associated surface low-pressure system will lead to showers
across parts of southern Nevada, interior southern California, Utah
and Arizona. Snow will fall in the higher elevations. Precipitation
will reach New Mexico and Colorado on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A complex frontal system will move through the Plains states.
Patchy light snow or freezing drizzle is possible near the Canadian
border, but will mostly be confined to southern parts of Manitoba
and Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
   A weak cold front will move away from the northeastern states.
In its wake, brisk winds from the northwest will direct cooler air
into New England. Some clouds and patchy light showers will
accompany the southern end of the front in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, abnormal warmth will extend from the Front Range of
the Rockies to the Eastern Seaboard. Afternoon highs will be 10 to
20 degrees above normal. A few places in the western High Plains
will have readings nearly 25 degrees above normal. There are no
signs that arctic chill will enter the contiguous states in the
next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warmth at Night
</P>
<P>
   At 12:01 a.m. Monday, a new record high temperature for Nov. 30
was set in Madison, Wis., where the mercury stood at 63 degrees.
The record-setting nighttime warmth was repeated at several other
locations across the upper Middle West. While record high
temperatures under cover of darkness are uncommon, they are more
apt to occur around the winter season. The contribution of solar
energy to the daily cycle of temperature is limited when sun angles
are low. At the same time, the weather systems that can draw warm
air northward are at their strongest.

IN VIETNAM, THE PEN WAS AS MIGHTY AS THE NAPALM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Common wisdom has it that the Vietnam War was the first
television war, and that is no doubt true. But a new two-volume
Library of America collection called ``Reporting Vietnam'' shows
that the conflict was probably also the last writers' war, at least
the last writers' war involving American forces in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The collection contains some 1,600 pages of writing on Vietnam
from 1959 to 1975, much of it of extremely high quality. One reads
these handsome volumes with many emotions, including those stemming
from the tragedy of the war, evoked in graphic terms by the
firsthand reporting, the eyewitness accounts, the profiles,
interviews and analyses.
</P>
<P>
   But one reads also with a kind of nostalgia, a sense of a past
unrecapturable. Some of the best reporting was done by seasoned
veterans: Bernard Fall, Stanley Karnow, Robert Shaplen and others.
But the evocative photographs in each volume also show the war as a
journalistic trial by fire for a younger generation, born before
the baby boomers but after those who covered World War II or the
Korean War. It was the generation of reporters and writers, many
well known today, whose careers took off in Vietnam, especially
when the war turned out to be America's most hotly contested.
</P>
<P>
   David Halberstam, Seymour Hersh, Neil Sheehan, Sydney Schanberg,
Peter Arnett, Gloria Emerson, Frances FitzGerald and others look
very young in their photographs. The conflict ended 23 years ago,
and its chroniclers don't look young anymore.
</P>
<P>
   One reads their reporting with the feeling that there will never
be another group of American war correspondents quite like them.
This is not because they did their jobs well, though they did, but
because whatever American wars may be fought in the future, they
will be brought to the public in the fashion of the Persian Gulf
War: not by adventurous men and women in the field with flak
jackets and helmets, but by computer specialists putting on screens
the electronically guided images provided by the Pentagon public
affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely, for example, that there will ever be another
piece of writing quite like ``Quang Ngai and Quang Tin: 1967'' by
Jonathan Schell, certainly one of the youngest journalists to make
his reputation in Vietnam. Schell covered the war for a few weeks
for the Harvard Crimson and later wrote two short books after
reporting on what he saw as he accompanied American troops into
combat. His message fed the growing anti-war sentiment back home by
stressing, as he put it, the ``overriding, fantastic fact that we
are destroying, seemingly by inadvertence, the very country we are
supposedly protecting.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection's first entry is a brief Time magazine account
from 1959 of the first deaths of American military advisers in
Vietnam. While much fighting is then described, the collection also
includes Tom Wolfe's report on Ken Kesey's speech at an anti-war
rally in 1965, Norman Mailer's account of the 1967 march on the
Pentagon and many other descriptions of the home front. There is
also a gripping, studiously matter-of-fact account in U.S. News and
World Report by John McCain, now a Republican senator from Arizona
and possible presidential candidate, on his six years of
imprisonment in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   For those who, like me, came of age during the war and followed
it closely, the volumes are like a literary recapitulation of
events, once at the forefront of the collective mind, which have
faded into obscurity. Here, for example, is Karnow's prescient 1961
analysis of South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem and his
powerful brother Ngo Dinh Nhu. Of Nhu, Karnow writes, ``He has
certainly helped to curtail freedom, but it is not so sure that he
has done much to promote progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The terrible events of Vietnam are all here: Harrison
Salisbury's reports on the bombing of North Vietnam in 1966 (``One
can see that United States planes are dropping an enormous weight
of explosives on purely civilian targets''); Hersh's 1969 scoop on
the massacre of villagers at My Lai the previous year; James
Michener's account of the killing of student demonstrators at Kent
State University in 1970; Schanberg's description of the seizure of
Phnom Penh by the Khmer Rouge five years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has been excluded,'' Schanberg wrote in The New York
Times, giving one of the first indications of the Cambodian horror
that was to follow, ``even the very old, the very young, the sick
and the wounded have been forced out onto the roads _ and some will
clearly not be strong enough to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most gripping of the almost-forgotten incidents was
the shooting in 1968 of a Vietcong prisoner by Nguyen Ngoc Loan,
the South Vietnamese national police commander. A profile of Loan
by Tom Buckley is reprinted from Harper's in ``Reporting Vietnam,''
and it presents the issue with a moral complexity that eluded most
observers at the time. Buckley calls the incident ``the moment when
the American public turned against the war.'' He describes the
prisoner at the moment of his execution: ``His face is distorted,
pushed to one side by the impact of the bullet in his brain, his
hair stands up, his mouth opens in what might be a final cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley cites Loan a month later, curtly arguing that moral
niceties do not win wars. ``People in the United States do not know
the things we know here,'' he tells the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   In the account of his imprisonment, McCain describes the cruelty
of the enemy and their cynical manipulation of prisoners for
propaganda purposes. Prisoners were tortured, he writes, to force
them to tell visiting humanitarian and anti-war delegations that
they were being well treated.
</P>
<P>
   Loan's foolish assassination of a Vietcong prisoner formed one
of the most famous images of the time, while the treatment of
McCain (and the assassinations committed by the North Vietnamese
side) were hidden. And this led to the frequently expressed opinion
that the Vietnam War was lost on the terrain of public opinion.
That may be true, but reading the dozens of articles reprinted here
suggests a tough professionalism by reporters who were interested
not in slanting the news (as the government complained) but simply
in telling the story as it unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The impression, in short, is of a job well done, and also of a
job that very likely nobody will have the opportunity to do again.

A SERIES TO SEND AUDIENCES HOME HUMMING AND TAPPING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lincoln Center's American Songbook, a new series that
aspires to be the popular song equivalent of the successful Jazz at
Lincoln Center series, has announced its opening programs. On Feb.
5 and 6, it will make its debut at Alice Tully Hall with ``I Gotta
Right to Sing the Blues,'' a salute to Harold Arlen, the composer
of the standards ``Stormy Weather'' and ``Come Rain or Come Shine''
as well the scores of the movies ``The Wizard of Oz'' and the 1954
``Star Is Born.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, on March 5 and 6, the series will showcase the
music of Richard Rodgers in a program called ``With a Song in My
Heart.'' American Songbook, produced by Ira Weitzman and financed
by Chivas Regal and the Irene Diamond Fund, is to continue in the
fall of 1999 and spring of 2000 with four more programs. Each
concert will be semi-staged with theatrical lighting, slide
projections and full orchestral accompaniment. The disk jockey
Jonathan Schwartz, the program's artistic director, will be the
concerts' master of ceremonies. Like the jazz series, Lincoln
Center's American Songbook will also include educational programs
and workshops to introduce the music to younger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Performers who are to participate in the Arlen program include
Barbara Cook, Diana Krall, Jay Leonhart, Audra McDonald, Maureen
McGovern, Richard Muenz, Ken Page and Mike Renzi. The Rodgers
program is to feature Harolyn Blackwell, Ann Hampton Callaway,
Michael Feinstein, Maria Friedman, Mary Cleere Haran, Leonhart,
Mark Murphy, Faith Prince, Renzi and Wesla Whitfield. These
performers belong to the series' informal repertory company that is
also to include Jackie Cain, Rosemary Clooney, Vic Damone, Vinnie
Falcone, Roy Kral, Andrea Marcovicci, Susannah McCorkle, Mandy
Patinkin, John Pizzarelli, Linda Ronstadt Carol Sloane and Margaret
Whiting.
</P>
<P>
   Each program will include symposiums built on each concert
event, film presentation and other educational events. The first
will be a documentary, ``Over the Rainbow: The Life and Music of
Harold Arlen,'' directed by Don McGlynn, who has made many films
profiling jazz legends. The movie features performances by singers
closely related to Arlen, including Judy Garland (``Over the
Rainbow''') and Lena Horne (``Stormy Weather'') along with clips of
Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Mel Torme. The film will be shown
in association with the Film Society of Lincoln Center at the
Walter Reade Theater on Feb. 3 at 8:30 p.m. A free three-hour
symposium featuring a panel of Arlen specialists and performers
will be held at Walter Reade Theater on Feb. 6 at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same way that jazz found a home here at Lincoln Center
through our series of Classical Jazz concerts, which grew into Jazz
at Lincoln Center, so, too, shall America's greatest songwriters
have a home at Lincoln Center with this new series,'' said Nathan
Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks before he died, Dr. Carl Sagan dropped by to see
Daniel Goldin, the NASA administrator. Sagan was deathly ill. His
blue jeans hung limp. He had no hair. His losing battle against the
bone-marrow disease myelodysplasia had taken a heavy toll.
</P>
<P>
   But his mind was ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour or two in Goldin's office at the Washington
headquarters of NASA, Sagan, the astronomer, laid out a series of
visions about the future of space exploration. So lively was the
discussion that the two men continued it over dinner in nearby
Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking with intensity,'' Goldin marveled. ``A man on
his deathbed. This is the Carl Sagan I love, a man so full of hope
and optimism that he never gave up. He never gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   That meeting was the last of dozens between Sagan and Goldin,
who credits the astronomer with major NASA initiatives for this
century and the next.
</P>
<P>
   When Sagan died two years ago this month at age 62, most
eulogies focused on his career in popularizing science and
conveying the wonders of the universe to millions of people. But in
addition to his celebrity, or perhaps even despite it, Sagan was a
serious and gifted researcher who pushed back the frontiers of
planetary science, molded a number of gifted students and wielded
great influence behind the scenes in Washington. Time and again he
came to the rescue of the politically beleaguered search for
intelligent life in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   So today his legacy lives on, most especially in the actual
doing of science and space exploration, areas where his elan was
mostly unknown to people who read his books and watched his
television shows. Most centrally, his legacy is addressing one of
Sagan's most durable curiosities _ the riddle of whether life
exists beyond Earth.
</P>
<P>
   As NASA prepares to mount thorough explorations of the two most
likely sites in the solar system, Mars and Europa, it is Sagan's
proteges who are in charge. Indeed, his greatest student may be one
who never took a class, Goldin, the commander of this star fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who did take courses, one of the top students was
Steven Squyres, 42. Now a Cornell University professor, Squyres
chairs a 15-person NASA advisory committee on exploration of the
solar system.
</P>
<P>
   He also heads a 20-member NASA team designing a Martian rover
meant to land on the planet in 2003, probe its terrain, drill into
hard volcanic rock and fire samples back to Earth. From the rocky
samples, scientists hope to extract Martian microbes, either fossil
or extant, proving the reality of aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Squyres said his scientific skills owe much to Sagan, including
a knack for knowing what to ignore and what to watch. ``In light of
his marvelous communication skills, lots of people lose sight of
how he was also a hell of a physicist,'' Squyres said. ``His work
could be brilliant,'' and brilliantly presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl was able to show you how to cut to the heart of the
matter. That was the most important thing he ever taught me,''
Squyres said.
</P>
<P>
   Another top student is Christopher Chyba, 39. For NASA, he is
probing even farther into the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   He chairs a 12-person panel drafting plans for a spacecraft that
the agency in 2003 wants to fire toward Europa, a large moon of
Jupiter whose icy, cracked surface hints strongly of an interior
ocean. NASA and many scientists want to know if the sea exists and
if alien life thrives in its inky depths.
</P>
<P>
   Chyba said one of most important lessons Sagan taught him was
the value of raw curiosity. ``He had a willingness to address a
broad sweep of issues, even if you couldn't always get answers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brash and brilliant, a poor kid aiming high, Sagan entered the
University of Chicago in 1951 at age 16, got a bachelor's degree in
liberal arts in 1954 and one in physics in 1955, a master's in
physics in 1956 and a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics in 1960,
ready to shake up his field.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy at the time was in love with stars and suspicious of
planets, whose study had produced an embarrassment of false claims
early in the century about dying civilizations on Mars. But Sagan
was deeply curious about extraterrestrial life and pursued the
topic with vigor, prodding others to do the same. He was rigorous,
despite his enthusiasm. One of his credos, often repeated by
experts, was ``extraordinary claims require extraordinary
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 27-year-old astronomer, he found his avocation in 1961 when
he attended a small meeting with diverse experts to figure out
whether a radio search for alien civilizations was worthwhile. The
group decided it was, and that Earth's own galaxy, the Milky Way,
in theory held up to 100,000 advanced civilizations, many with
powerful transmitters and other technologies that might be detected
from afar. Thus was planted an important seed.
</P>
<P>
   A polymath, Sagan wrote his first scientific paper on the origin
of the gene, the basic unit of heredity, in 1957. In 1962, he wrote
a paper with Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel laureate in biology, on
possible Martian life. In 1962 and 1963, he won an appointment at
Stanford University's medical school to explore that topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew more about biology than any astronomer I'd ever met,''
recalled Frank Drake, an astronomer and a pioneer of the
extraterrestrial hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sagan's devotion to aliens, his early achievements
helped show that they were less likely in some places than
scientists had previously thought. While in his 20s, he deduced
that mysterious radio emissions from Venus were caused by surface
temperatures around 900 degrees, far too hot for life.
</P>
<P>
   By 1967, Sagan took aim at Mars from a post at Harvard. Some
scientists said the planet's seasonal color variations were caused
by plant life. But he and a graduate student, James Pollack,
proposed that the variations were instead caused by wind storms and
blowing Martian dust, which turned out to be right.
</P>
<P>
   Sagan went to Cornell in 1968 and stayed there until he died.
His influence grew as he edited a leading journal and helped found
the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary
Sciences, raising his field's status. Division membership soared
from 100 or so in 1970 to about 1,400 today.

 UNDATED: 1,400 today. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an explorer, Sagan played important roles in helping NASA
loft the world's first wave of interplanetary probes, including
ones to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. He was on
the team that set two landers on Mars in 1976. The craft, to his
dismay, found no hint of life.
</P>
<P>
   Far from giving up the extraterrestrial hunt, he increasingly
looked toward the stars. In 1975 and 1976, Sagan and Drake searched
for alien civilizations with the huge dish antenna at Arecibo,
Puerto Rico. The radio telescope, the world's largest, had never
before been so used.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Sagan rushed to the defense of such work after Sen.
William Proxmire tried to get it cut from the federal budget as a
waste of money. First, after a tete-a-tete, he got the senator to
end his criticism. Then, he won public backing for such hunts from
70 of the world's top scientists, including seven Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the organization of a coordinated, worldwide, and
systematic search for extraterrestrial intelligence,'' Sagan's
group wrote in Science, the nation's foremost scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his growing influence came from the great popularity of
his books, most of which were best sellers. ``The Dragons of Eden''
(Random House, 1977) won a Pulitzer Prize. Others included
``Broca's Brain'' (Random House, 1979) and ``Cosmos'' (Random
House, 1980). ``Contact'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1985), his only
fictional work, told of a radio-telescope hunt that stumbled on an
alien civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Sagan became increasingly political in the 1980s. In books,
talks and protests, he faulted nuclear-arms testing, the Reagan
administration's Star Wars anti-missile plan and, inspired by a
dust storm on Mars, warned that nuclear war could result in a
smoke-shrouded, deeply frozen Earth that he and colleagues called
``nuclear winter.''
</P>
<P>
   His leap from the ivory tower to television studios and
executive suites annoyed some peers. Science magazine in 1982
looked askance at The Cosmos Store, a venture Sagan set up to make
cosmic books and calendars. The National Academy of Sciences, the
nation's premier scientific club, landed a heavy blow in 1992 by
rejecting him for membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl was so superb at public relations that this engendered
some jealousy among colleagues who weren't,'' said Elliott
Levinthal, a Stanford professor who worked with Sagan for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the academy rebuff, he grew even more powerful. Starting
in 1992, Goldin, the newly installed NASA administrator, a former
aerospace engineer and executive, consulted Sagan for advice and
developed a respect for his energy and views during dozens of
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The bond was strengthened by personal history. Both had grown up
in New York and gone to its public schools, Goldin in the Bronx and
Sagan in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl didn't come up with solutions,'' Goldin recalled in an
interview. ``He posed questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The most influential questions, Goldin said, had to do with the
puzzle of extraterrestrial life and how best to address it. Sagan,
he said, especially bore in on how to probe Mars, whose greater
warmth and wetness in its early days were seen as possibly having
given rise to microbes or other forms of life.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, NASA had taken a Cadillac approach to space
exploration, launching costly probes rarely. The more costly the
probes got, the rarer and more complex they became. In 1992, only
one spacecraft was scheduled to fly to Mars, a $1 billion orbiter
known as Observer, the nation's first mission to the red planet in
17 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``His argument was that this is not a program, it's a single
event, it's the last ship out of port,'' Goldin recalled.
``Although I had a lot of my own thoughts, and had talked to a lot
of people, Carl convinced me I had to develop a vision and a
strategy for Mars.'' By early 1993, Goldin said, a new plan was
set. It featured low-cost orbiters and landers to be flown every
two years as Mars and Earth came into alignment. The merit of the
new approach was driven home in August 1993 when the costly
Observer craft, as it neared the red planet, failed mysteriously.
</P>
<P>
   The new series began last year when Mars Pathfinder landed and
created a sensation with its miniature rover. Others are to follow
in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007 and so on.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Goldin said, Sagan played a vital role in
getting the agency to deepen its biological roots. In 1994 and
1995, he said, he met often with Sagan and other advisers to
discuss how to sharpen NASA's overall skills in examining Mars and
more distant worlds for signs of alien life.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the ferment, NASA planned an Astrobiology
Institute, a consortium of academic and agency experts in various
sciences, to address the riddle of life in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Established this year, the institute is run by NASA's Ames
Research Center in California and has 11 institutional members,
including teams at Harvard, the University of Colorado and the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. Its budget, now
$9 million, is expected to grow to $100 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Sagan saw little of what he helped create late in life. He died
Dec. 20, 1996, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, before the Mars Pathfinder landed with its Sojourner rover
and the Astrobiology Institute took off.
</P>
<P>
   But his students are leading the new hunt for extraterrestrial
life, with Squyres focusing on Mars, and Chyba on Europa.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, Chyba wrote NASA as chairman of the panel drawing up
plans for a Europa orbiter. That project, he said, was in the
agency's ``greatest traditions'' of exploration, presenting large
challenges as well as enormous potential payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the 2003 orbiter demonstrate the existence of an
ocean,'' he wrote, Europa will rapidly become ``a primary focus''
in the next century's hunt for extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole program,'' Chyba said, ``is carrying Carl's torch.''

   In a Bad Mood _ for a Good Reason
</P>
<P>
   According to a researcher at Harvard University, in any 24-hour
period, married women are 50 percent more likely to complain of
being in a bad mood than their Y-chromosomed counterparts. The
reason, he theorizes, is that married women juggle several roles,
so they encounter more opportunities for things to go wrong in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Kessler, a sociologist in the department of
health-care policy at Harvard Medical School, and a colleague
studied 166 middle-class couples who kept a diary of their emotions
for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Women, Kessler said, ``tend to the home, the plumber, their
husband's career, their jobs, and, oh yes, the kids.'' By contrast,
he said, men operate with a narrower focus. ``For men it's `How are
things at work? The end,''' said Kessler.
</P>
<P>
   The study was reported in a recent issue of the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said women also pay more attention to the problems of
friends, co-workers and distant relatives, while men tend to limit
their ``range of caring'' to their spouses and children. ``Men's
emotional antennae are not spread as wide,'' he said, adding, ``Men
get to participate in the good stuff, like parties, while their
wives pay the price for maintaining social networks.''
</P>
<P>
   The research challenges the idea that women are unhappy more
often because they ``hold onto bad feelings more,'' Kessler said.
Women appear no more likely than men to remain in a foul mood.
Wives have more bad days than husbands, said the report, simply
``because they experience more frequent daily stressors.''
</P>
<P>
   _ NANCY STEDMAN
</P>
<P>
   After the Addiction, a Matter of Weight
</P>
<P>
   The longest large study to date on weight gain after quitting
smoking has underscored what many researchers consider one of the
toughest obstacles facing smokers who want to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Lung Health Study, which tracked 5,887 smokers, found that
those who quit put on substantially more weight in the years after
they kicked the habit _ 17 pounds for men and 19 pounds for women _
than earlier, shorter studies had indicated. The results were
published last month in the American Journal of Epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   The first year is the worst. Of those who quit and stayed off
tobacco, the average weight gain was 10.7 pounds for men and 11.4
pounds for women.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest smokers had the biggest weight gains, the
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peggy O'Hare, a professor of public health and education at
Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro and the lead
researcher, said in an interview that she did not view the results
as simply more bad news about the difficulties of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smokers already know this. Ex-smokers know this. I'm an
ex-smoker, and I know this,'' she said. ``I see the point as a
message to physicians and agencies that work with smoking cessation
about the need for a total approach to quitting, for a plan that
includes physical activity and diet control.''
</P>
<P>
   _ JOHN O'NEIL
</P>
<P>
   And, Oh, It Means `Go Back to Topic A'
</P>
<P>
   Most people _ linguists included _ ignore 10 percent of all
conversation, the ums, likes, false starts and repetitions that
litter spontaneous speech.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, these utterances were considered garbage that
hindered communication.
</P>
<P>
   But a study due to appear in the Journal of Memory and Language
argues that the word ``oh,'' when used in the middle of a sentence,
is not a bad habit but in fact plays a pivotal role in
comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ```Oh' subconsciously alerts the listener to remember a
previously mentioned, but then abandoned, idea,'' said the study's
author, Dr. Jean Fox Tree, an assistant professor in the department
of psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz. ``It
helps the listener piece together the concepts in the
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fox in her study asked 180 male and female students at Santa
Cruz to listen to tapes of unrehearsed speech. In one experiment,
subjects were told to push a button when they heard the name
``Roosevelt.'' They then listened to a speaker first discuss past
presidents and then switch to another topic.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker later returned to his original thought and then
said, ``Oh and Roosevelt,'' the prompt the subjects were told to
listen for. The second group heard only a pause _ the ``oh'' had
been digitally removed _ and then ``Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   The group hearing the ``oh'' responded to ``Roosevelt'' more
quickly than the group that did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were writing and realized you had forgotten something,
you would just go back and insert it,'' Dr. Fox Tree explained.
``But you can't do that in speaking, so you say `oh,' to remind
your listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fox Tree, who is also studying ``um'' and ``uh,'' said there
is a downside to her choice of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``My students tease me whenever I say `oh,''' she said. She
added, ``I don't understand why language presented to us by news
anchors or actors _ with this great enunciation and no disfluencies
_ is considered good, and the way we talk considered bad.''
</P>
<P>
   _WENDY MARSTON
</P>
<P>
   A Prescription Pad That Computes
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a cure for doctors' bad handwriting: the computer. When
doctors put down their pens and typed prescriptions into a
terminal, serious medication errors dropped by half, researchers at
Brigham and Women's Hospital have found.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of the drug reactions of almost 7,000 patients before
and after a $1.9 million computer system was installed at the
Boston hospital, researchers discovered a 55 percent drop in errors
after doctors ordered prescriptions online. The study was published
in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Serious drug errors were those that injured, or had the
potential to injure, patients, the researchers explained. And drug
reactions are the most common cause of injury to hospitalized
patients, accounting for about 19 percent of the 1.3 million
injuries annually to those hospitalized, studies have shown.
</P>
<P>
   However, only about 5 percent of hospitals across the United
States have a computerized ordering system for doctors, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, nobody used ATMs, and now it's the routine
method of obtaining cash,'' said Dr. David Bates, an internist at
Brigham and Women's and a co-author of the study. ``My hope is that
this will increase the demand, and the hospitals will begin to
routinely adopt these systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The improvement can be credited to the efficiency of the system,
which was designed to provide a menu selection of medicines and
dosages and also to check patients' medical histories, drug
interactions and allergy problems.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of the doctors' illegible scribbling, Bates said,
had its benefits. ``When doctors wrote orders on paper, a high
percentage were logged as written by `doctor unknown' because the
pharmacy couldn't read the doctors' signatures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After implementing the computer system,'' Bates added, ``that
problem was eliminated.''

<P>
   When Spinning first reached health clubs a few years ago, it was
an instant hit with gym-goers. The International Health Racquet and
Sportsclub Association estimates that nearly 46 percent of gyms now
offer group cycling classes.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Spinning has spawned a new concept in exercise:
Group classes are moving out of the aerobics studio and onto the
cardiovascular machines found on the gym floor. Treadmill classes
in particular are beginning to appear on aerobics schedules all
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Abbott, director of walking and running programs at the
Boston Athletic Club, started ``Treading'' classes three years ago
in response to members' comments about the tedium of working out
alone on the treadmill. (She has since trademarked the concept.) In
these classes, 25 or more people gather for guided jaunts in one
area of the gym floor. Workouts involve climbing up inclines and
sprinting toward imaginary finish lines while Ms. Abbott barks out
instructions and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Marchal, a private investor who is one of Ms. Abbott's
students, sees Treading as a great equalizer. ``A world class
runner can be beside a beginning walker following the same basic
program but working at different speeds'' she said, noting that
this inspires students to push each other _ and themselves _
harder.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Abbott presented Treading at the recent World
International Dance Exercise Association conference in Anaheim,
Calif., it caused a sensation among exercise instructors. Other
similar programs soon followed. StarTrac Treadmill's Trekking
program was rolled out, as was High Energy Aerobic Training, which
licenses programs to health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of stair climbers, recumbent cycles and other
types of cardiovascular machines are now considering the
possibility of creating group programming centered around their
equipment. Concept II, a company that sells stationary rowing
machines, recently started Boat House, an organized rowing class,
which is an evolution of the worldwide indoor rowing regattas held
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Maeve McCaffery, of the sportsclub association, said these
classes offer the camaraderie and energy of an aerobics class minus
the confusing choreography. ``They appeal to people who would never
set foot in low-impact aerobics because they would have to think
too much,'' she said. ``They also generate a lot of buzz by adding
pizazz to the same old activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Julie McNeney, of the dance-exercise association, sees
equipment-driven classes as an exciting new wave in fitness, she
cautions that it translates better with some machines than with
others. ``The skill level that is required to row properly is
higher than what you need to walk on a treadmill or pedal a studio
cycle,'' she said. ``Therefore, exercisers may get hurt before the
learning curve kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe there is a tendency for students to push
harder than usual, which may cause frequent participants to burn
out and develop overuse injuries. They caution exercisers to start
slowly with no more than one or two classes a week.
</P>
<P>
   Although some health clubs in New York City feature equipment
classes beyond Spinning, they are less popular than in other areas
because the clubs often do not have enough room for this
space-gobbling activity. Some limit the number of students or
schedule classes only during off hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our treadmill classes sometimes interfere with people who
don't want to join in,'' said Terry Certain, who manages a
corporate fitness center for Scholastic Inc. in Manhattan. ``But
they are very popular.''

NEXT CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR FACES SLEW OF DEATH-ROW DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Although Gov.-elect Gray Davis would invoke
former Gov. Pat Brown's legendary name on the campaign trail, it's
unlikely Davis will follow Brown's path on one critical issue:
clemency for inmates on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency was a decision so painful, Brown once wrote, that it
``took something out of me that nothing ... has ever been able to
replace.'' During his tenure, from 1959 to 1966, Brown commuted a
state record of 23 death sentences, including that of a man who was
released on parole and went on to kill again.
</P>
<P>
   As one of his first tasks in office, Davis could face a clemency
decision in the case of Jaturun Siripongs, convicted of killing an
Orange County store owner and a clerk. A hearing on Thursday may
decide whether Gov. Pete Wilson unfairly denied Siripongs clemency,
and the court's action could push the case past Jan. 4, when Davis
will be inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens later this week, the notoriously slow appeal
process for death penalty cases is speeding up for the state's 517
death-row cases. Davis will undoubtedly have to consider more
capital cases than any other governor in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But in California and across the nation, the long-held
constitutional right of chief executives to bestow mercy through
clemency has died its own death, the victim of a political lethal
injection and a public that overwhelmingly supports the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 69 people set for execution so far this year in the
United States, only one was granted clemency, a Texas man who
confessed to 600 murders but was found to be in Florida during the
one killing for which he received the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade in the United States, one to three death-row
inmates have been granted clemency every year, out of as many as 80
executions each year.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dramatic shift from three decades ago, when governors
granted clemency in at least 20 percent of the death penalty cases
they reviewed, according to a 1993 University of Richmond study.
The study found, for example, that Florida governors had commuted
23 percent of death sentences between 1924 and 1966. No Florida
death penalty sentences have been commuted in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In California, death penalty attorneys say it is unlikely Davis
will change the modern trend set by Wilson. Wilson has denied all
five clemency requests that have reached his desk. A sixth killer,
David Edwin Mason, who was executed in 1993, did not ask for
clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of clemency no longer exists in California,''
said Robert R. Bryan, a San Francisco attorney who has handled more
than 100 death-row cases. ``They give lip service to it, but it's a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Siripongs believed that they had a strong case for
clemency, but the Wilson administration declined to let them
present evidence that Siripongs had had an accomplice and had not
committed the actual murder.
</P>
<P>
   They did present evidence that Siripongs, 43, was remorseful and
was an exemplary prisoner of deep Buddhist faith. They noted that
the families of the victims, as well as a former San Quentin warden
and the Thai government, believed the death penalty was
inappropriate for Siripongs.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney may
compel Wilson to reconsider his decision denying Siripongs
clemency, prompting the process to begin again and perhaps forcing
Davis to make the ultimate decision.
</P>
<P>
   In denying clemency, Wilson said Siripongs' reasons were not
enough: His ``remorse is infrequent, his callous crimes
unmitigated, his justifications nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His principal grounds for clemency _ an unfortunate childhood,
his good behavior while in confinement _ are inadequate and could
be invoked for nearly every death sentence,'' said Wilson, who is
retiring after two terms as governor.

KEEPING SAGAN'S LEGACY ALIVE AND VIBRANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Carl Sagan's legacy lives on in the popularization of
science as well as in the practice of it. For instance, Bill Nye,
``the science guy'' who is the host of popular science television
programs for children, took an astronomy course from Sagan at
Cornell University and consulted with him after graduation on how
to shape a science-communications career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to come into class with astonishing pictures from
Mars,'' Nye recalled. ``He made quite an impression on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Planetary Society, a group in Pasadena, Calif., that
promotes space exploration and publishes a bimonthly magazine, The
Planetary Report, was founded in 1980 by Sagan and two other
scientists, Bruce Murray and Louis Friedman, who are still
advancing the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an enormous influence,'' said Murray, a planetary
scientist at the California Institute of Technology. ``He was such
an extraordinary communicator and popularizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Many writers claim to have been touched by Sagan, including his
son, Dorion, a science journalist and the co-author, with Lynn
Margulis, of ``Microcosmos'' (Summit, 1986), ``Garden of Microbial
Delights'' (Kendall-Hunt, 1995), ``What is Life?'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1995) and ``What Is Sex?'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997). Ms.
Margulis is a biologist at the University of Massachusetts, Sagan's
first wife and Dorion Sagan's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Sagan's closest literary collaborator was his third wife, Ann
Druyan, a novelist who worked with him on ``Contact'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1985) and wrote with him ``Comet'' (Random House, 1985),
an overview of what science knows about these icy visitors from
outer space, and ``Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors,'' (Random House,
1992), a look at human origins.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Druyan said she is working on several science films and
television shows. She also gives talks and advises charitable
groups. On Nov. 17, she spoke at Washington National Cathedral on
what science knows about the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the things he gave me was a deeper respect for truth,''
she said in an interview. ``You have to have rigor and discipline,
and he helped me develop that. I absolutely maintain that the
closer you got to Carl, the more impressive he was, unlike some
public figures. Knowing him was the signal honor of my life.''

THEY DRANK THEIR MILK  
 ISOTOPE DATES QUAKES  
 SNIFFING OUT TERMITES  
 SALAMANDER MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Got milk?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Britain have figured out a way to tell if ancient
people got it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, archeologists have had to rely on indirect evidence _
largely pictorial or written records _ that ancient cultures milked
domesticated cows or goats. Ceramic vessels found in excavations
often have a residue of animal fat, but because the fat has
degraded there has been no way to tell whether it had come from
meat or milk.
</P>
<P>
   But using gas chromatography, the scientists have shown that
degraded animal and milk fats have distinctive signatures related
to the relative abundance of a particular carbon isotope. The
researchers, reporting in a recent issue of Science, said they
found evidence of milk fat in pottery shards from an Iron Age Roman
site at Stanwick, England. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another group of scientists is using an isotope to delve into
history. But in this case the isotope is of chlorine, not carbon,
and the history is of the earth's surface, not its civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, from the University of Arizona and Vanderbilt
University, have developed a method of dating earthquakes by
measuring trace amounts of chlorine-36 isotope on exposed rock in a
fault zone.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorine-36 is produced when the subatomic particles in cosmic
rays react with surface elements on the rock. The longer the rock
has been exposed, the more chlorine-36 will be produced. And
because the rate of cosmic ray bombardment is predictable for any
spot on earth, the approximate date that the rock was first exposed
by an earthquake can be calculated.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, described in a recent issue of Science, works
only in faults where the rock slips vertically in a quake, not
horizontally (as is the case with the San Andreas fault in
California).
</P>
<P>
   But applying the method to a vertical fault in Montana, the
researchers discovered evidence of six earthquakes, and dated them
as occurring about 400, 1,700, 2600, 7,000, 20,300 and 23,800 years
ago. They hope the technique can be used to provide information to
help predict quakes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Termites, the scourge of wood-frame houses, are usually
discovered through inspection, and only after they have feasted
unnoticed on a beam here, a stud there, often for months or years.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at Louisiana State University have come up with a
way to detect their presence early on, before they cause too much
structural damage. The detector makes use of a fact the researchers
recently discovered about termites: they smell like moth balls.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, the scientists discovered that termites produce
naphthalene, an aromatic hydrocarbon that is the major component of
moth balls. (Apparently the termites use the chemical for much the
same reason humans do: as a defense against bugs.)
</P>
<P>
   The detector, now being developed, samples and analyzes the air
in building walls. When it senses naphthalene, it signals the
possible presence of termites. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of large numbers of salamanders in Utah, Maine and
North Dakota since summer have prompted United States Geological
Survey officials to issue an alert asking biologists to report
unusual observations of mortality or disease in the amphibians.
</P>
<P>
   The latest event occurred in September at a lake east of Salt
Lake City, where 200 dead tiger salamanders were found. Like
earlier die offs, a virus was believed responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The die offs are a concern because of recent sharp population
declines among many species of amphibians around the world. Among
the theories for the declines are a rise in viral, bacterial or
fungal infections, increased ultraviolet exposure because of a
thinning of the ozone layer and rising global temperatures.

 &HT;    Researchers may have to skip goal of complete cure
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps Dr. Edward Jenner swallowed hard when he steadied the
syringe containing the deadly virus smallpox, just before he
injected the contents into 8-year-old James Phipps.
</P>
<P>
   Jenner must have been acutely aware that he was deliberately
imperiling the boy's life.
</P>
<P>
   The date was July 1, 1796, and Jenner was performing a daring
experiment that, if reproduced today, would shock and outrage our
1990s sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks previously, Jenner, a British surgeon, had
inoculated Phipps with fluid from the sores on a milkmaid's hand.
The sores were cowpox, a harmless disease in humans. Jenner had
noted that milkmaids and others who had cowpox did not suffer
smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did James Phipps.
</P>
<P>
   Jenner was lucky. HIV vaccine researchers know they will need
luck, too, if they are to meet President Clinton's goal of
developing a working HIV vaccine by 2007 _ a goal some think is
impossible or at least highly implausible.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 experimental HIV vaccines are being developed, but only
one, AIDSVAX, has entered Phase III, in which thousands of people
are being tested. In Phase I, a few dozen people are tested; in
Phase II, hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other HIV vaccine, based on the canarypox virus, is
expected to enter Phase III testing within the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much believe that for the vaccine effort to succeed,
we're going to need a lot of vaccine concepts tested
systematically, in both primates and in people,'' said Sam Avrett,
executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, based in
Washington. ``The question we should be asking is, `Why are there
not more products?'''
</P>
<P>
   Vaccine process costly
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer has to do with economics, say researchers and
government health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines generally take longer and cost more to develop than
drugs, making them a high-risk venture for pharmaceutical
companies. The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative estimates that
developing and testing an experimental HIV vaccine will take seven
to eight years and cost more than $25 million. VaxGen Inc. expects
to spend ``tens of millions'' on its Phase III AIDSVAX trials, said
Dr. Don Francis, its president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't blame the companies for not doing more,'' said
Margaret Johnston, assistant director for AIDS vaccines at the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda,
Md. ``They're doing what they can, based on what they see as the
cost and benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   New HIV drugs are guaranteed instant demand, especially as drug
resistance forces people with HIV to frequently switch medicines.
And they are profitable: A year's worth of combination drug therapy
averages $10,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such treatments are available only to people in
wealthy, industrialized countries. By contrast, the greatest need
for an HIV vaccine is in the Third World, where more than 90
percent of new infections occur.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't all about money. In pursuing HIV treatment advances,
pharmaceutical firms can use knowledge gleaned from the successes
and failures of existing HIV drugs, of which there are now 13.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccine research just isn't as advanced, and no clear
developmental path has been established.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidity of the epidemic's spread is so fearsome, though,
that most scientists would support an HIV vaccine that is only
partially effective. A 30 percent efficacy rate would mean at least
fewer new infections, they reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to the concept of vaccines that protect to a very
high level, but that may not work here,'' said Dr. Mark Feinberg,
associate director of AIDS research at Emory University's Rollins
School of Public Health(Ga.). Emory's newly built vaccine center
will open in March.
</P>
<P>
   But the real root of the lack of HIV vaccine research, lament
researchers, is that society still emphasizes treatment over
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will pay tens, hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat
people once a disease hits, but we don't value prevention as
much,'' Johnston said. ``It's a societal thing. You can get people
treated for cancer, but having them change their diet or do things
to prevent cancer in the first place is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning from failure
</P>
<P>
   Francis says he won't be satisfied ``until we have close to 100
percent (efficacy),'' but he realizes that the Phase III AIDSVAX
trial is probably an interim step toward that goal. He hopes the
tests will provide enough information to tweak the vaccine and
resolve any weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going under the presumption that we can spin the
technology around to fill the holes in the sieve,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg isn't as hopeful for AIDSVAX, because it generates only
one type of immune system response: antibodies that kill the virus
itself. Many vaccine researchers advocate a two-pronged approach
that also would eliminate infected human cells. Such a vaccine
would have to generate killer T-cells, immune system warriors that
recognize and destroy infected human cells.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Francis says he thinks AIDSVAX will work, based on studies
in chimpanzees and humans. An earlier version of AIDSVAX has been
given to 1,200 people, with some infections, but the new version is
expected to have greater success, since it is designed to resist
two different subtypes of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next year, 150 Atlanta volunteers will begin a series
of seven shots, the first two within a month of each other and the
remainder spaced at six-month intervals. Two out of every three
volunteers will receive AIDSVAX; the rest will get a placebo, an
inactive substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many vaccines for diseases such as polio, measles and
rubella, AIDSVAX does not contain live, weakened virus. Instead, it
contains only a protein called gp120 that forms a key part of HIV's
outer envelope, or coat. The protein fools the body into believing
the virus itself is present, and the body's immune system
manufactures millions of antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Even if AIDSVAX fails completely, researchers will have learned
something. But more likely the vaccine will work to at least some
extent. That is a necessary beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone shows that a vaccine is even partially effective,
that will do more to stimulate interest than any other activity,''
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that breeds success like success.''

OVERTURNING THE MYTHS OF SAFETY IN SOCCER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PAUL GAINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For every football player who limps or is carried off the field,
there is a soccer player who gloats that soccer is the safer of the
two sports. But a study published in the current issue of the
British Journal of Sports Medicine reveals that the risk of injury
in soccer may have been downplayed, at least at the professional
level.
</P>
<P>
   Using videos from 171 domestic and international matches in
Britain's professional soccer league, researchers at the Center for
Hazard and Risk Management at Loughborough University found that
players had a 12 percent risk of injury every game. More
significantly, they reported that almost a third of professional
players would suffer at least one injury this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury rate, is about 1,000 times what you'd find in
industry,'' said Dr. Colin Fuller, a lecturer of health and safety
management at the center and director of the study. ``It works out
to every employee having a reportable injury once every three
weeks, which, of course, would be completely unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Loughborough researchers, only a third of the
injuries resulted from fouls. The rest involved legal contact
between opposing players. Muscle strains were the most common
injury, often resulting from improper warming up, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing soccer and football injuries is difficult. The
National Football League does not keep track of injuries, although
the NFL Players Association and Federal regulators are conducting a
study to find ways to reduce the high number of concussions players
suffer. Eight years ago researchers at Ball State University
surveyed retired NFL players and discovered two out of every three
players reported suffering serious injuries in their careers. These
required surgery or caused them to miss a minimum of eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Especially at risk are the quarterbacks, who are generally
smaller than the linemen they oppose. In the English soccer study,
player position was of no consequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two percent of all (soccer) players end their careers
prematurely because of injury,'' said Scott Drawer, who contributed
to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when there are 2,600 players in the English Leagues,'' he
added, ``that is a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect the injury risk to be this high,'' he said.
``But then some are playing 60 to 70 games a year.''

AIDS ADVOCATES GIVE U.S. A MIXED REPORT CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government scores high marks for
bankrolling AIDS research but rates poorly when it comes to pushing
prevention programs and helping developing nations battle the
deadly disease, the advocacy group AIDS Action reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years into the epidemic, America's record on AIDS
remain uneven,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director of AIDS
Action. He said Africa is experiencing ``an AIDS holocaust because
of our failure to address prevention and international efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   A panel of AIDS advocates and health-care policy experts
including former U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, former U.S.
Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., and Jeanne White, president of the
Ryan White Foundation, graded the federal government in four areas.
Gunderson is openly gay and the Ryan White Foundation is named
after a hemophiliac who died of AIDS after receiving an infected
blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   The panel gave the government an ``A-'' for AIDS research, a
``B'' for the care and treatment of people with AIDS, a ``D'' for
AIDS prevention and education efforts, and an ``F'' in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in the battle against AIDS is that the U.S. death
rate has dramatically plummeted because government- and
industry-sponsored research have produced effective new anti-viral
drugs and an entire new class of AIDS treatments known as protease
inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal Centers for Disease Control, the number
of U.S. deaths from AIDS fell 29 percent in 1996 from the previous
year and 47 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS fell from the eighth leading cause of death in the nation
in 1996 to the 14th in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But because most developing nations cannot afford the costly
drugs, the death rate from the disease is spiralling upward in the
Third World.
</P>
<P>
   According to a separate study released last week by the United
Nations, 2 million Africans will die from AIDS this year, four
times the total for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the 33 million people around the globe who
are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, reside in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, current
estimates show that between 20 percent and 25 percent of people
aged 15-49 are living with HIV or AIDS,'' said the U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS Actions also charged that the U.S. government is doing
little domestically to halt the spread of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Official Washington has flat-funded domestic prevention and
has failed to launch new initiatives around HIV prevention and
education,'' Zingale said.
</P>
<P>
   Federally funded AIDS research receives about $1.5 billion
annually, while AIDS prevention programs receive approximately $657
million.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials acknowledge that prevention and education
efforts have lagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been the same focus on prevention as there is on
treatments,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the Center for
Prevention Services, part of the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   An ironic result of the highly effective new drug treatments is
that Americans are beginning to relax safe-sex behavior, Gayle
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see folks with HIV living more normal lives and some
are saying, `I'd rather have my fun and worry about the
consequences later,''' Gayle said.

BIOLOGICAL INSURANCE: PAYING A BLOOD BANK TO SAVE CORD BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(rl) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should parents pay a blood bank to store the blood from their
newborn baby's umbilical cord and placenta, in case that child or
another family member ever needs it to treat cancer or leukemia?
</P>
<P>
   Expectant parents are being urged to do so by companies that
have sprung up during the past few years to sell cord-blood banking
as a form of ``biological insurance'' against such dreaded
diseases. The pitch is based on reports in medical journals, such
as a major study published last week in the New England Journal of
Medicine, showing that cord blood can sometimes be used in place of
a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Like bone marrow, cord blood is rich in stem cells, which can
churn out many different types of cells to rebuild a patient's
blood supply and immune system after high doses of radiation and
chemotherapy. A patient's own cord blood, or that from a relative,
is more likely than cord blood from an unrelated donor to be a good
tissue match and to be accepted by the recipient's body.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts in bone-marrow transplantation and blood banking
frown on the cord-blood business, arguing that people are being
frightened into wasting money on a service they will probably never
need. Moreover, private companies are growing in tandem with public
banks, and some scientists worry that private banking will limit
public access to cord blood. They are concerned because the cord
blood in private banks remains the property of the donor family and
is not available to patients seeking a compatible donor.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies say that however remote the possibility that
the blood will be needed, people who choose to bank their own cord
blood have a right to do so. In most cases their cord blood would
be thrown away in the delivery room if they did not pay to bank it.
There are only a few cord-blood banks in the United States, and
most hospitals do not have specially trained staff members to
collect the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Like bone marrow, cord blood must be matched to the recipient by
tests for six inherited traits that determine an individual's
tissue type. Cord blood does not have to be as precisely matched as
bone marrow, but still, the closer the match, the better the odds
of success. The weaker the match, the more likely it is that the
recipient's body will reject the transplant, or the transplant will
attack the recipient's tissues, in a life-threatening reaction
called graft vs. host disease.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that freeze cord blood and bank it point out that
a person's own cord blood is a perfect match, and a sibling's cord
blood a more likely match than a specimen from a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Promotional literature for one company, Cord Blood Registry, in
San Bruno, Calif., emphasizes that people with cancer in the family
may have a special interest in cord-blood banking, along with those
who have the hardest time finding matches. Those include members of
racial minorities, especially families in which the parents are of
different races.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman, Scoti Kaesshaefer, said the company reaches
parents-to-be by promoting itself to doctors, nurses and childbirth
educators, and by leaving information at hospitals. For example,
the company is distributing copies of newspaper articles suggesting
that cancer among children is on the rise. The company also has a
Web site and an 800 number.
</P>
<P>
   Cord Blood Registry describes itself as the largest private
cord-blood banking firm in the country. It has stored 10,000
samples during the past three years: 1,500 in 1995, 3,000 in 1996
and 6,000 in 1997. The company charges an initial fee of $1,200 to
collect a sample and freeze it, and then $95 a year to keep it
stored in liquid nitrogen at the blood bank at the University of
Arizona. Customers include people with perfectly healthy children,
who just want extra peace of mind, as well as some families who
have lost a child to leukemia or another disease and fear for the
health of their other children.
</P>
<P>
   In its three years of operation, eight customers have retrieved
their cord blood for use in medical treatment, said Ms.
Kaesshaefer. All eight samples were used for siblings or relatives,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest public-access bank of cord blood, at the New York
Blood Center in Manhattan, has collected 8,686 specimens in six
years. Nearly 800 of those samples have been used to treat
patients, many of them children, in the United States and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pablo Rubinstein, who directs the cord-blood program at the
New York Blood Center, said there is a compelling medical argument
against using a patient's own cord blood in some cases. In some
young children with leukemia, he said, malignant cells are present
at birth in the cord blood, and transfusing those cells back into
the child later might contribute to a relapse. In addition, he
said, bone marrow from a donor could help destroy diseased cells,
an effect known as graft vs. leukemia. A person's own cord blood
might not have that effect, and in some cases even a sibling's
might not.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Wagner, associate director of bone marrow
transplantation at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said
that for a child being treated recently, he deliberately rejected
cord blood from a sibling in favor of a well-matched unit from an
unrelated donor, hoping to take advantage of its antileukemic
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robertson Parkman, director of bone marrow transplantation
at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, said he saw no point in
banking cord blood for most families. ``It's motivated by fear,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in families with an ill child who might need a bone-marrow
transplant, he said, it makes sense to save cord blood from any
siblings born later. Medical centers with transplant programs will
often perform that service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So will some of the private companies, without a fee. When a
bone-marrow donor could not be found for 4-year-old Joshua Kelton,
who was suffering from leukemia, his parents, stationed at a
military base in Honolulu, conceived another child in the hope that
the baby's tissues would match Joshua's. They did, and Cord Blood
Registry collected the cord blood at birth, stored it in Arizona
for a month, and then, when Joshua was ready for the procedure,
transported it to a medical center at Stanford University. Joshua
was treated with his infant brother's cord blood in August, and has
been declared free of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's 100 percent,'' his father said in a telephone
interview, ``a normal child, the way he was before this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Keltons' experience is hardly representative. That the
family was certain it would need the cord blood sets it apart from
most families that store the blood. Wagner is wary of the hard sell
of some of the cord-blood companies. ``My concern is that it be
presented fairly to expectant mothers, who are already fairly
vulnerable,'' he said. ``I have a lot of obstetricians and parents
calling me and complaining it's too late, they missed the
opportunity. Others call saying, `Should I do this?' It's hard to
answer. I don't want to bias them.''

 &HT;    WebMD lands GilbertsonBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Less than two weeks after his high-profile departure
from HBO &AMP; Co., Jay Gilbertson was named Monday to a top slot at a
company part-owned by HBO &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson, who had been co-president, co-chief operating
officer and chief financial officer of HBO &AMP; Co., will be president
and chief operating officer of WebMD, a tiny but ambitious company
that aims to use the Internet to connect medical professionals and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   During his decade with HBO &AMP; Co., which sells software and
services for the healthcare industry, Gilbertson saw the company
boom. Well-respected in the industry, he surprised analysts by not
resurfacing at an established company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like hunting squirrel with an elephant gun,'' said
Charles Trafton of Adams Harkness. ``This is a guy who could write
his own ticket, so you have to believe (he thinks) this is the best
match for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson said Monday that he looked at about 60 possible
employers, including some outside the area, before settling on
WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a company that would give me the opportunity to lead
versus a company where I'd probably just run a division and not
have as big an impact,'' he said. ``WebMD could be very large very
quickly. I don't think there's a company out there that can touch
them.''
</P>
<P>
   While offering some consumer services, WebMD's Net site focuses
on doctors, who can verify patients' insurance coverage, read test
results, process claims, communicate with hospitals and order
supplies online.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 17 announcement of Gilbertson's split from HBO &AMP; Co.
was somewhat awkward because it came in the aftermath of word that
HBO &AMP; Co. had a $12.1 billion agreement to sell itself to McKesson
Corp., the nation's largest drug wholesaler. The deal seemed to
close out the chance of Gilbertson rising to the chief executive's
job. News of his exit sent HBO &AMP; Co. stock into a one-day slide.
But the stock price quickly recovered after Gilbertson _ and the
company _ reassured investors that his leaving was not a reflection
on HBO &AMP; Co.'s health.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson said Monday he harbors no ill will toward HBO &AMP;Co. A
good working relationship is important, since HBO &AMP;Co. has invested
$10 million in WebMD, owns 5 percent of the company and holds one
seat on the WebMD board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson said he took the WebMD post on the condition that the
current management team remain. However, with his arrival, Blake
Whitney will shift from president of WebMD to executive vice
president, specializing in new business applications. Whitney will
report to Gilbertson, said Jeff Arnold, WebMD's founder, chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD filed for an initial public offering of stock in the
spring, retreating when the market turned sour. Arnold, in New York
Monday to speak to analysts and potential investors, said an IPO
early next year is possible _ but not necessary. ``I like working
with strategic partners because they bring so much more than cash.
I am leaning in that direction.''

 &HT;    Assembly required: Hard-hats take on the final frontier
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The space shuttle Endeavour is packed. The toolboxes are on
board. The first of a new generation of astronaut hard-hats are
ready to go to work. And 242 miles above the Earth, a Russian space
module called Zarya _ Sunrise _ awaits the dawn this week of the
most ambitious construction project in history.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years of engineering, a half-dozen major redesigns and
a spiral of escalating costs, the assembly of the International
Space Station is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   It's time, NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin says, to begin
``laying the foundation for a multinational permanent human
presence in space.'' Well past time, say critics in the scientific
community and in Congress, who have watched the station's
capabilities shrink as costs and delays have mounted. Completion is
now expected no earlier than 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the U.S. share of the new place in space is expected
to total at least $24.7 billion. Adding shuttle flights and
operational costs, the final tab is expected to reach $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For NASA, the start of space station assembly is a political as
well as a technological milestone. The presence of real hardware in
space will provide the agency new leverage in wresting money for
the project from a reluctant Congress. It's too late to turn back
now.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, the focus is on the immediate challenge _
tool time in space. The final countdown began Monday. Liftoff of
the shuttle Endeavour from the Kennedy Space Center is set for 3:59
a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's six-person crew, commanded by veteran shuttle
astronaut Robert Cabana, will spend 12 days in space, assembling
the initial pieces of what will, over the next several years,
become a sprawling patchwork of modules and metal trusses that will
span the length of two football fields. Up close it will look a
little like a large hamster habitat. Completed, it will be large
enough to easily be visible from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This flight will demonstrate the unique capabilities of the
space shuttle and of astronauts and cosmonauts to assemble large
structures in space,'' says George Abbey, the director of NASA's
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The first hints of just how demanding the task will be will come
early next week, when Endeavor reaches the orbiting Russian module,
launched late last month, and the assembly work begins.
</P>
<P>
   Three demanding six-hour spacewalks will be required to attach
the waiting Russian module, which contains fuel and power for the
protostation, to the six-sided connecting node, called Unity, which
the shuttle will carry into space. Like the hub of a giant
Tinker-toy, the 13-ton node will serve as the connecting point for
future station modules.
</P>
<P>
   NASA visionaries weren't the first to imagine a permanently
manned outpost in space. That distinction goes to 19th century
clergyman and author, Edward Everett Hale, whose fictional ``brick
moon'' was populated by people who communicated with Earth by
jumping up and down in Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to preflight publicity about ``humankind's first
permanent extraterrestrial colony of orbiting pioneers,'' NASA
wasn't the first to build a space station either. Russia's Mir has
been circling the Earth 16 times a day since 1986 _ long enough to
outlast the nation, the former Soviet Union, that launched it.
</P>
<P>
   For well into the new millennium, however, both American and
Russian space programs will be, for better or worse, inextricably
wedded to the fate of the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the crew, including Russian cosmonaut
Sergei Krikalev, will be home for the holidays, and the newly
joined Zarya and Unity modules will form the nucleus of a new era
in space.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming mission, however, could be a cakewalk compared with
the challenges _ political as well as technical _ that the
station's 16 international partners will confront in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, nearly a million pounds of hardware _
100 major components in all and countless nuts, bolts and
connecting cables _ must be delivered to the construction site in
the sky on time and in perfect condition.
</P>
<P>
   At least 45 U.S. and Russian launches, including 34 shuttle
flights, will be required to carry the building material and
supplies into orbit. Eighty percent of all shuttle flights between
now and 2005 will be devoted to station logistics. Any launch
failure, whether American or Russian, could be disastrous. For most
major parts, there are no spares.
</P>
<P>
   Some assembly will be required. Current estimates are that it
will require 1,800 hours of spacewalks _ as much as Russian and
American astronauts combined have logged outside the protection of
their capsules in the previous 40 years of human space travel.
</P>
<P>
   In the airless environment of space, where temperatures can vary
by 500 degrees from the shade to the sunlight, 30-ton pieces of
structural aluminum will have to be fitted together with
submillimeter precision - all while hardware, human work crews and
their tools hurtle around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The station is expected to be ready for limited occupancy, by a
crew of three, early in the year 2000. But the human presence
aboard the station will bring new risks.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Johnson Space Center analysis concludes that the
station is such a large target that damage from orbital debris or
meteoroids is inevitable. The same analysis concludes that there is
a one in 71 chance of losing the station over the course of its
10-year design life.
</P>
<P>
   Back on planet Earth, however, other problems must be resolved
if construction is going to proceed according to NASA's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The next major piece of hardware needed for the space station is
a Russian-built service module, which provides the navigation,
propulsion, communications and limited living space during the
construction phase. The module, two years behind schedule, is now
set for launch in July 1999, but the bankrupt Russian Space Agency
isn't expected to have it ready in time.
</P>
<P>
   NASA, which has paid $235 million for Zarya, has crafted a $1.2
billion program designed to complete the work on time. Growing
doubts about Russia's ability to deliver vital parts on time have
forced NASA to begin work on a temporary service module of its own.
It won't be ready by July either. Major delays could send the newly
linked Zarya and Unity plunging back into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Science
Committee and an outspoken critic of Russia's failings, has fumed
that NASA is, in effect, paying ransom for components that were
supposed to be ``contributed'' by its major partner.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian space analyst James Oberg says NASA itself is
holding the station hostage with its ``foolhardy'' decision to
start assembly without assurances that the hardware for subsequent
missions would be ready on time. Some U.S.-built components,
including those made by prime contractor Boeing, also are behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   With the first pieces of the space station now in orbit,
however, Congress is likely to have trouble refusing expanded
station funding. The ante will be upped early next year when NASA
seeks an additional $1.2 billion for cost overruns _ on top of the
$2.1 billion now earmarked for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Even as station costs have soared, however, its capabilities
have been steadily downsized. Initial plans for the station to be a
staging area for missions to the moon and planets have long since
been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, NASA now envisions the completed station as a permanent
base for the study of human adaptation to the space environment _
as well as a place for basic research on astronomy, microgravity
and materials science.
</P>
<P>
   But as the station's share of NASA's budget has grown, it has
had a devastating effect on the agency's other programs. A study by
the National Academy of Sciences has found an ``alarming'' decline
in NASA's basic space science research in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers contend that the station has cannibalized funds
that could have been used far more productively.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000-member American Physical Society, a persistent critic
of the station, points out that the highly successful Pathfinder
mission to Mars in 1997 cost less than a single shuttle flight.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years in the planning stages, however, NASA sees the
International Space Station as a triumph of politics as well as
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The International Space Station will be a world community
living and working together in space, improving life on Earth and
expanding humanity's horizons for the 21st century,'' says Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In doing so, we will truly open the space frontier.''

`AMSTERDAM': DARK TOUR DE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ian McEwan's new novel, ``Amsterdam,'' which won the Booker
Prize in Britain this autumn, is a dark tour de force, a morality
fable, disguised as a psychological thriller.
</P>
<P>
   A chilling little horror story, easily read in one enjoyable
gulp, ``Amsterdam'' is by no means McEwan's finest work: It is less
ambitious than ``Enduring Love'' (1998) and ``Black Dogs'' (1992),
and less resonant than ``The Innocent,'' his 1990 masterpiece of
Cold War suspense. One can only hope that this small, perfectly
fashioned novel _ novella, really _ will send readers back to the
rest of the talented McEwan's oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of the author's stories, ``Amsterdam'' concerns the
sudden intrusion of violent, perverse events into his characters'
mundane lives, events that cruelly expose the psychological fault
lines running beneath the humdrum surface of their world. In ``The
Comfort of Strangers,'' a pair of middle-class tourists fall prey
to a Machiavellian sadist during a trip to Venice. In ``The Cement
Garden,'' a group of children are orphaned and bury their mother in
the basement. And in ``The Child in Time,'' a man's 3-year-old
daughter is kidnapped during a trip to the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Amsterdam,'' two old friends _ one a famous
composer named Clive, the other a mercenary newspaper editor named
Vernon _ enter into a strange euthanasia pact that will determine
both their fates and send shock waves through their privileged
world.
</P>
<P>
   Now in their middle years, Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday have
both achieved prosperity and influence. How lucky they were, Clive
thinks, to have been ``nurtured in the postwar settlement with the
state's own milk and juice, and then sustained by their parents'
tentative, innocent prosperity, to come of age in full employment,
new universities, bright paperback books, the Augustan age of rock
and roll, affordable ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive, who regards himself as Vaughan Williams' heir, has been
commissioned by the government to write a Millennial Symphony; in
his more optimistic moments, he dares to think of himself as a
genius, an artist worthy of comparison to Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon, who has become editor of a tabloid paper by default, is
decidedly less confident: There are moments, alone in his office,
when he wonders whether he even exists. All the exchanges in which
``he had decided, prioritized, delegated, chosen or offered an
opinion'' made him feel he was ``infinitely diluted; he was simply
the sum of all the people who had listened to him, and when he was
alone, he was nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in their impoverished, bohemian youth, Clive and Vernon had
been lovers of a ``restaurant critic, gorgeous wit and
photographer'' named Molly, a daring, glamorous woman who also had
an affair with Julian Garmony, a conservative, xenophobic
politician who would go on to become Britain's foreign secretary.
Molly would eventually marry a rich, stuffy publisher named George
Lane, who detests (and is unanimously detested by) her former
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   When a sudden illness leaves Molly delirious and incompetent,
George seizes control of her life, forbidding her old friends to
visit her sickbed. In the wake of her funeral, Clive and Vernon not
only commiserate over her death but also make a pact with each
other to avoid ever suffering such an undignified end: Should one
of them become as sick and incoherent as Molly, the other will help
him finish things off.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in his usual spare, evocative prose, McEwan deftly
conjures up the glittering London world Clive and Vernon inhabit,
and he also does a nimble job of depicting them at work, showing us
how Vernon is trying to boost his paper's falling circulation with
trendy, tasteless stories, how Clive is trying to create an ending
for his symphony commensurate with his ambition to commemorate the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Though there's a faint satiric edge to McEwan's portraits, he
uses his psychological insight, as he's done so often before, to
create sympathy for some decidedly unsavory people. Indeed, we find
ourselves rooting for Clive and Vernon, even as it becomes clear
that both of them _ much like James Penfield, the hero of ``The
Ploughman's Lunch,'' a movie written by McEwan back in 1984 _ are
conniving opportunists, willing to use virtually any means
necessary to achieve their ends.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of each other, Clive and Vernon are both faced with
moral dilemmas that will test just what sort of people they are.
Clive must decide whether to put aside his beloved symphony to help
a woman who may be in trouble, while Vernon must decide whether to
publish some compromising photos of Julian Garmony that could end
his political career. Their respective decisions will forever alter
their careers, and imperil their decades-long friendship.
</P>
<P>
   For all the appeals to high-flown principles like art and
freedom that Clive and Vernon make in coming to their decisions,
their problems do not really open out into the sort of weighty
philosophical debates that animated ``Black Dogs'' and ``Enduring
Love.'' Nor, given the predictable outcome of the story, is there
the sort of grisly narrative tension that made ``The Innocent'' so
suspenseful to read. Instead, there are the simple pleasures of
reading a writer in complete command of his craft, a writer who has
managed to toss off this minor entertainment with such authority
and aplomb that it has won him the recognition he has so long
deserved.

<P>
   If laying the cornerstone of the International Space Station can
be considered the act of any one person, the distinction probably
belongs to 39-year-old Nancy Currie, one of the six astronauts who
will be aboard the space shuttle Endeavour when it thunders into
space early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As a mission specialist for the flight, it will be Currie, at
the controls of the shuttle's mechanical arm, who first joins the
12.8-ton American-made connecting node, Unity, with the
Russian-built module that is in orbit. That union will mark the
formal start of a construction project expected to span at least
six years.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's rendezvous with the Russian module Zarya, is
scheduled for Sunday, the third day of the mission. Sometime on
Saturday, Currie, who is on her third shuttle mission, will set the
stage for the crucial moment when she uses the remote manipulator
arm to upend the cylindrical connecting node in the shuttle's open
cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, shuttle Commander Robert Cabana will guide the
Endeavour to within a few feet of the Russian module. Currie will
reach out with the 50-foot arm and grab the Russian module, pulling
it gently into position over Unity's docking ring.
</P>
<P>
   Cabana will then tweak the shuttle's thrusters, providing enough
of a push to firmly join the first two elements of the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six days, mission specialists Jerry Ross and James
Newman will don their spacesuits and make three separate, six-hour
spacewalks to finish connecting the two modules to make them work
as a single unit _ the core of the new station.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule for the workweek in space goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   Monday: Ross and Newman go into the shuttle's cargo bay to
connect safety cables and electrical umbilical cables from Unity to
the space tunnel that will enable humans to pass from one module to
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 8: The rest of the crew, including pilot Frederick Sturckow
and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, conduct communications and
pressure checks on the docking system.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 9: Ross and Newman go back outside to install handrails and
antennae on the station modules and a sunshade for an external
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 10: Astronauts enter Unity and Zarya for the first time
through the tunnel connecting them to the shuttle. They install
fans, lights and communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 11: The crew again enters the protostation to check the
previous day's work and get it ready for the arrival next year of
the next major station element, the Russian service module.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 12: Ross and Newman perform a final spacewalk,
disconnecting all unnecessary cables and testing a spacesuit jet
backpack which failed on an earlier mission. A fully functioning
backpack system will be needed on future assembly flights.
</P>
<P>
   After disengaging from the station, Endeavour's crew will launch
several secondary payloads and perform a number of experiments
before returning to Earth on Dec. 15.

NEW NO-LONGER-A-KID ON THE BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Rick Schroder begins his run on ``NYPD Blue''
tonight, and you might as well check your misgivings at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, who made his name as a kid in ``The Champ'' and on
``Silver Spoons,'' shows up at the 15th Precinct as the third
partner of detective Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mere mentions of his name in the same sentence as ``NYPD Blue''
often evoke panic or ridicule from fans of the series, who fear the
worst. But any doubts that Schroder can make the leap into grown-up
acting are erased moments after his character Danny Sorenson walks
into the squad room.
</P>
<P>
   An early scene in which Sorenson makes the acquaintance of Lt.
Arthur Fancy (James McDaniel) while the rest of the squad room
reacts is especially telling.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson's first day coincides with detective Diane Russell's
(Kim Delaney) first day back after grieving over the loss of her
husband, detective Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits). Sorenson is
transferred from the narcotics squad to replace Simone, who died
from an infection he contracted after receiving a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   In his first hour, Sorenson, a 28-year-old veteran of Operation
Desert Storm, has to walk the fine line of succeeding at his new
job and not offending his new co-workers still devastated by the
loss of Simone.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson is a complex character who seems to get as annoyed when
a guy rides his bike on a sidewalk as he does when a gunshot victim
holds out information on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot going for him,'' Schroder said of Sorenson.
``He's a smart guy. He and Sipowicz have a different way of
approaching their job, but they are also very similar in a way.
They are both very committed to their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson is further from a strait-laced, by-the-book cop than
his crystal blue eyes and close-cropped military haircut would
indicate. He is savvy to the ways of the streets, has his own
contacts and wants to make the collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who comes into the pokey tries to use a different
angle on him,'' Schroder said. ``Sometimes he's as sweet as honey,
and sometimes he's an absolute badass who is in their face.
Everyone wants to give it up a different way. The trick is to find
out how the guy in front of you is going to break.''
</P>
<P>
   If tonight's show is any indication, the addition of Sorenson
should help pump new life into a series that was showing its age
last season.
</P>
<P>
   So far, thanks to a compelling story arc revolving around
Simone's tragic demise, ``NYPD Blue'' already seems back in the
groove.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after spending four weeks in a vacuum (he has already
filmed four episodes that no one has seen), Schroder finally gets
his shot tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has seen anything I've done yet,'' he said. ``I can't
wait to see the reaction. Depending on the reaction, maybe I can
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have anything to worry about.

NETANYAHU STOPS SHORT OF UNCONDITIONALLY WITHDRAWING TROOPS FROM
LEBANESE SOIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Monday that he felt the pain of every mother whose son had died
fighting in Lebanon, but stopped short of siding with those who
would withdraw troops from Lebanese soil unconditionally now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heart is with every mother and every person who has
suffered,'' Netanyahu told Israel Radio. ``(But) we have the
responsibility to do the right thing for the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of seven young soldiers in Lebanon in the past two
weeks have added urgency to an on-going debate here: Should Israel
unilaterally withdraw troops from a self-declared ``security zone''
set up in southern Lebanon in 1985 or should it stay put until an
agreement is reached with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Israel's parliamentary defense and foreign affairs
committee met Monday to discuss that question and, in the meantime,
how Israel should respond to the upsurge in casualties from
roadside bombs placed by the Hezbollah, Iranian-backed guerrillas
who want to force Israel to withdraw from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   During what turned into a stormy meeting, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai ruled out moving troops from the 10-mile-wide
zone without some kind of negotiated settlement that would
guarantee the security of Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the opinion of security officials after they examined
all the possibilities,'' Mordechai said after convening top army
officers for an emergency meeting late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai's statement prompted a sharp response from Yossi
Beilin, an opposition Labor member of the parliamentary committee
who has been pushing for unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin walked out of the committee meeting slamming the door and
called Mordechai a ``liar'' and Israel's policy in Lebanon a
``death trap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonsense,'' Beilin huffed. ``There are many (Israeli)
generals who believe we must leave this area and I'm sure the
minister (Mordechai) knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time Israel sustains heavy casualties in Lebanon, a nation
weary of what seems like a costly no-win situation reexamines the
possibility of a quick exit from its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, a growing number of Israelis seem to be siding
with Beilin in favor of unilateral withdrawal. An opinion polls
published by the daily newspaper Maariv found that 40 percent want
to leave Lebanon now, up from just 22 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   These Israelis are willing to take a calculated risk: by
withdrawing from Lebanon without an agreement on security
arrangements, they are betting that the Hezbollah will have reached
its objective and will not launch rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, superhawk Ariel Sharon, Israel's foreign
minister, has moved toward this camp. He wants to implement a
unilateral troop withdrawal, but in stages. If there is peace after
an initial withdrawal , he says, more troops will leave. If not,
the gradual pullout will not proceed. And if, after the withdrawal
is complete, Hezbollah strikes Israel's northern border, Israel
will respond with a heavy attack.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli analysts say both Beilin's and Sharon's calls for
unilateral withdrawal might win over the public, but they fail to
address the underlying cause of Israel's recurrent problems in
Lebanon: Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Until Israel is willing to return the Golan Heights, a grass and
snow-capped mountainous plateau captured from Syria in 1967, it can
expect Syrian President Hafez Asad to pressure Israel by unleashing
the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows is that the address, the solution, the key, is
Damascus and the price is the Golan Heights,'' said Moshe Maoz, a
political analyst at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and
African Studies and a leading Israeli expert on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can overlook this very hard reality,'' said Maoz. ``But
the government tries to overlook this because it is unpopular to
talk about negotiating the Golan Heights. There is no military
solution, only a political solution.''
</P>
<P>
   By adopting a phased withdrawal, Sharon said he hopes to isolate
the conflict with Lebanon from the Israeli-Syrian negotiating
track. The negotiations have been at a standstill for three years
over whether to resume talks based on verbal understandings reached
with Israel's previous Labor-led government or to restart them
without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel wants peace negotiations with Syria ... but we cannot
link negotiations with Syria with what is happening with Lebanon,''
Sharon said on Sunday. ``The two issues must be separated.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, other Israeli ministers backed limited
airstrikes against Lebanon's infrastructure, including its power
and water supplies, if that government failed to reign in
Hezbollah. Such a task is not likely, analysts say, with 35,000
Syrian troops based in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Netanyahu said only that Israel's priority would be
to ensure the safety of Israeli soldiers and its ally, the South
Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon in an
arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, our
main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Army Radio reported Monday that Asad had reiterated his
call to pick up negotiations with Israel where they left off three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The radio, citing U.S. officials, said President Clinton was
working to revive the moribund talks and had sent a message to Asad
asking whether the Syrian leader was willing to resume
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu denied knowledge of any message and said again that he
would not start negotiations based on verbal understandings or
proposals for territorial compromise and for security arrangements
that were made by his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to enter into renewed negotiations with Syria
but we are not prepared to accept dictation of terms that in fact
empty the negotiations of all content,'' he said.

UNIVERSAL DISMISSES CHAIRMAN AFTER FILMS FLOUNDER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Casey Silver, the chairman of troubled Universal
Pictures, was ousted Monday after the dismal box-office results of
the studio's most recent big-budget films, ``Meet Joe Black'' and
``Babe: Pig in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver, a low-key and popular figure at Universal, will be
replaced by his boss, Ron Meyer, who is president and chief
operating officer of Universal Studios. Meyer told Silver of his
removal Sunday night after Meyer consulted with Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
the president and chief executive of Seagram, which owns the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to change the dynamic,'' Meyer said. ``It's not
about one movie or two movies. It's about the direction we've been
in. It's time to change the course a bit.'' He added, ``We haven't
had the success some of our films deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie business is about good product, luck, timing,
minimizing your losses and being as financially responsible as you
can possibly be,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, who has worked as a top executive at Universal for 12
years and has run Universal Pictures for the last three of those
years, will become a producer there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred to finish the job I started,'' Silver
said. ``We're coming off a disappointing year. It's management's
prerogative to change the team, and I respect that.'' He predicted
that the company's two forthcoming films, ``Psycho,'' a remake of
the Alfred Hitchcock classic, and ``Patch Adams,'' a comedy-drama
with Robin Williams, would prove successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a really deep program of movies coming up over the
next couple of years, which is a testament to the entire team
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, a former talent agent and founder of the Creative Artists
Agency, is on the firing line for the first time as a studio chief
with direct responsibility for the production and marketing of 20
or so films a year. Only two weeks ago, Meyer took over the
responsibilities of his boss, Frank Biondi Jr., the chief executive
of Universal Studios, who was dismissed by Bronfman. Biondi, who
left with a settlement of about $30 million, oversaw films, theme
parks and television.
</P>
<P>
   Across Hollywood, talent agents and producers said they doubted
that Meyer would assume the long-term responsibilities of running
the studio day to day as well as do his other jobs. Several
executives at rival companies have been mentioned as replacements
for Silver, notably Mike De Luca, president of production at New
Line Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Monday also named Stacey Snider, a Universal
executive, as president of production and Kevin Misher as
co-president of production. Misher will report to Ms. Snider. Both
will work with Meyer and are expected to play an increased role at
the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said the decision to oust Silver had little to do with the
weekend's disastrous box-office revenues for ``Babe: Pig in the
City,'' the sequel to ``Babe,'' a 1995 children's fable about a
talking pig. The newer film, which cost at least $90 million to
produce, took in only $8.5 million over the five-day Thanksgiving
holiday and was overwhelmed by three family films: ``A Bug's
Life,'' made by Pixar and Disney, which took in a record $46.5
million during the five-day Thanksgiving holiday; ``The Rugrats
Movie,'' based on the television series, and ``The Waterboy,'' the
Adam Sandler comedy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``Meet Joe Black,'' a romantic drama starring
Brad Pitt, which also cost at least $90 million to produce and $25
million to $30 million to market, has grossed only $36 million
since it opened on Nov. 13. The film's box-office revenue was a
bitter disappointment to Universal executives.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the ``Babe'' sequel and ``Meet Joe Black,'' Universal
stumbled at the box office with critically acclaimed films like
``Primary Colors,'' ``One True Thing'' and ``Out of Sight,'' as
well as duds like ``Mercury Rising,'' ``Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas'' and ``Blues Brothers 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal has two more films scheduled for release before the
end of the year. One, ``Patch Adams,'' is about a real-life doctor
who uses humor to help treat patients. More problematic is a remake
of ``Psycho,'' which opens Friday. The new version, directed by Gus
Van Sant, is a scene-by-scene replica of the Hitchcock classic. Van
Sant and the producer, Brian Grazer, have taken the unusual step of
not showing the film to critics or journalists before its opening.
This is often a sign of a poor movie, but Grazer insists that this
is not the case in this instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made this choice before even preproduction when we met with
Patricia Hitchcock,'' said Grazer, referring to Hitchcock's
daughter and heir. ``Hitchcock didn't have a premiere, he didn't
have sneak previews or have the press see the movie early. He made
the movie for $1 million. We made it for $20 million, which is
exactly the same amount based on inflation. He made it in six
weeks, we made it in six weeks. We made the decision early on to do
everything the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal and Seagram have been in turmoil over the last year or
two, with a revolving door of executives and some high-level
dismissals. Aside from Biondi, two other top executives, Howard L.
Weitzman and Sanford R. Climan, have been forced out, together with
the movie studio's president of production, Marc Platt, and its
marketing chiefs, Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones.

ON TOP OF THE WORLD IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lately I've been reading ``Into Thin Air,'' the
wrenching first-person account of an expedition that takes the
reader to Mount Everest and back, with a stream of bodies left
behind along the way.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco Bay area, up on the summit of my favorite
mountain, Montara Mountain, I kept thinking about how beautiful,
diverse and engaging this region is (even compared to the
Himalayas) with the Bay, coast and ocean circled by a greenbelt and
a mountain rim featuring a series of peaks that is accessible to
nearly everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever says Everest is fun. In the Bay area, hitting all
the peaks is fun.
</P>
<P>
   At Mount Everest, what is called the ``Death Zone'' starts at
25,000 feet, where the air is so thin that the capillaries in your
retinas can explode without warning. In the Bay area, the most
dangerous part of the trip is the drive to the trail head, and the
only things that are eye-popping are the views.
</P>
<P>
   Everest, at 29,028 feet, is called the Roof of the World, and it
can only be climbed with a degree of hope during a few days in
spring and fall, when a 100-knot jet stream and procession of
storms shift away from the peak. The weather in the Bay area, on
the other hand, makes it one of the few regions anywhere in North
America where you can reach your choice of several summits 365 days
a year.
</P>
<P>
   It can cost $75,000 for a guided trip on Everest. It costs $4 to
try Montara Mountain (from San Pedro Valley County Park), $5 for
Mount Tam, and Mount Hamilton is free.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my ratings of the best of them, 1 to 5, considering
views, scope of adventure, and fun, along with five honorable
mentions, rated 6 to 10:
</P>
<P>
   1. Mount Tamalpais, 2,571 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn or dusk, the Bay Area looks like the Land of Oz from the
East Peak, one of the top lookouts in North America; from here, you
can see why so many call San Francisco ``The Emerald City,'' a
phantasmal vision of lights. To the east, the Bay looks like a calm
azure pool sprinkled with islands, and Mount Diablo beyond seems so
massive that it's as if you could take a flying leap across the Bay
and land on its top. Though people pray for clear sunsets, it is
often even prettier when a sea of fog is layered over the Pacific
to the west, where the orange light can filter through the stratus.
Oz? ``Pay no attention to that man standing behind the curtain.''
Hiking demands: A 15-minute walk, with a climb of 330 feet to a
lookout station perched on rock. (For information, call
415-388-2070 or 415-893-1580).
</P>
<P>
   2. Montara Mountain, 1,894 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you think the Bay area is jammed full, make the
trip to San Pedro Valley County Park in south Pacifica, then relish
the 7-mile round trip to the Montara Mountain summit and back. In
the process, you will pass Brooks Falls, a thin, three-tiered
waterfall (a wisp most of the time), a nearby lookout of the coast
(from an obvious rock outcrop, looking north), then the tromp to
the top for a long-distance view of the Farallon Islands out to
sea, the south coast, and an adjoining 100,000 acres of wildlands,
including the off-limits San Francisco Fish and Game Refuge. Note
that the hike is far more demanding from the opposite flank, with
access from McNee Ranch State Park. Hiking demands: 7-mile round
trip, moderate grade, sea level to summit. (650-355-8289).
</P>
<P>
   3. Castle Rock, 3,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For a fresh perspective across familiar territory, try the view
from the top of Goat Rock. You scan across miles of Douglas fir and
redwoods, Big Basin and beyond to Monterey Bay, one of the region's
most beautiful landscapes. This is the highlight at Castle Rock
State Park, located on Skyline Boulevard (Highway 35), just south
of the junction with Highway 9. Unlike the other top summits, you
hike down, not up, past a waterfall (quite dramatic after a big
rain), then loop up to the top of Goat Rock, a honeycombed
sandstone formation popular among rock climbers, and the best
picnic spot in the Bay area. Hiking demands: 5 1/2-mile round trip,
easy, out on Saratoga Gap Trail, return on Ridge Trail.
(408-867-2952 or 831-429-2851).
</P>
<P>
   4. Mount Hamilton, 4,209 feet.
</P>
<P>
   This is the highest drive-to point in the Bay area. The Mount
Hamilton Observatory is at the top, and the views are unique and
spectacular. To one side, you look down and across the Santa Clara
Valley and its wall-to-wall congestion. To the other side is
country so remote and wild that herds of wild goats and elk are
sometimes spotted. Getting here is a great driving tour, providing
you don't mind the twisties. From Alum Rock in San Jose, the road
winds all over the foothills in its climb to the Mount Hamilton
summit, a route originally designed when the observatory was
selected in order to ease the effort required for horses towing
supply wagons. The road continues down the east flank into
wilderness, and eventually links to Mines Road and continues all
the way to Livermore. Hiking demands: None. (408-274-5061).
</P>
<P>
   5. Mount Diablo, 3,849 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The time to go to Mount Diablo is in the winter after a fresh
storm, when the air is crystal clear. That is when you get
unlimited visibility: a clear view of the Sierra Crest to the east,
and the Farallon Islands to the west. The actual area _ in square
miles _ visible from this lookout is greater than from any other in
Northern California, but the best views are distant, ruined by much
haze. The visitor center perched on the exact summit is one of the
best anywhere. Hiking demands: None required (but a good trail head
to Diablo's sub-peak is available about a quarter-mile below the
parking area). (925-837-2525).
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mentions: 6. Mission Peak, Fremont, 2,517 feet,

FORMER MEDIATOR URGES IRISH LEADERS TO END IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Former Sen. George Mitchell, who was
instrumental in arranging the Northern Ireland peace agreement in
April, returned to the British province Monday to discuss the
impasse that has stalled the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and experts in Belfast, the northern capital, and
Dublin, the capital of the Irish Republic, said Mitchell's
discussions with Roman Catholic and Protestant leaders indicated
that the Clinton administration was worried about the possible
breakdown of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The accord has reached a standstill over several issues. They
include disarming the Irish Republican Army and creating
governmental structures that are to lead to more power for the
northern Catholic minority and for the Catholic Irish Republic in
the affairs of the predominantly Protestant British province of
Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Mitchell received two awards for his work as a
peacemaker, then met at a hotel in Cork, south of Dublin, with
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he was on an ``entirely private'' visit and that
although he was not officially representing the White House he
would brief Samuel Berger, President Clinton's national security
adviser, or his assistant, Jim Steinberg, this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised there are difficulties,'' Mitchell said in
an interview. He added that he was ``encouraging all the people
involved'' to end the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a huge tragedy if this were to fail because of
inability to implement the agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, chairman of the talks until the agreement was reached
on April 10, said he was not considering a formal return to the
peace effort as a mediator. He is now a lawyer in the firm of
Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He talked with Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, and with the two leaders of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly, which is to put the provisions of the
peace accord into effect in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders, assembly First Minister David Trimble, a
Protestant unionist, and his deputy, Seamus Mallon, a Catholic
nationalist, are to visit Washington early in December and are
expected to seek meetings with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell also spoke with John Hume, head of the Catholic
mainstream Democratic Labor Party, and David Ervine, head of the
Progressive Unionist Party, which has ties to Protestant
paramilitary groups. He did not talk with the Rev. Ian Paisley,
head of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, which boycotted
the peace talks. Paisley has attacked the agreement as treachery
that will lead to the subsuming of the North into the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he had spoken to White House officials over the
weekend, asking for their intervention. Adams and his party have
been excluded from the new provisional government that is being
formed in Belfast until the IRA agrees to start disarming. He
pointed out that the April agreement stipulated only that
disarmament occur by the spring of 2000, when the agreement is to
be fully enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble insists that disarmament has to begin long before that.
The IRA, which has held a cease-fire for 16 months, refuses to
disarm until the peace agreement is fully enacted.

`FRIENDS FOR LIFE' AND `IT COULD BE YOU': YOUNG FACES OF AIDS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Two pointed, moving new documentaries share one inarguable
premise: No one on the outside can know what it's like to live with
HIV, the AIDS virus. So these programs shrewdly allow people with
HIV to tell their stories without narrative interference. That the
speakers are children and young adults, fitting no one's stereotype
of a person with AIDS, makes their comments all the more
enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends for Life: Living With AIDS'' is the Disney Channel's
lucid program about children with HIV. Directed by Barbara Kopple
(who made the classic ``Harlan County U.S.A.'' and the recent
``Wild Man Blues'' about a Woody Allen jazz tour), it means to spur
discussion between parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It Could Be You,'' Tuesday's episode of MTV's ``True Life''
series, is made by two women in their 20s who got the virus while
in their teens.
</P>
<P>
   Being shown on World AIDS Day, these unrelated programs have
other stirring elements in common. Both are effective as personal
drama rather than raw information. The people profiled are
thoughtful, healthy and average-looking, though they depend on more
medications than a viewer can count. And the programs' tone is not
tear-jerking but reflects the toughness that coping with AIDS
requires day after day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends for Life'' may seem an unusual project for the cheery
Disney Channel, but its positive approach is familiar, showing that
children with HIV are just as playful and hopeful as their
schoolmates, with an even more extreme need for friends.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the program focuses on Chris Edwards. An 11-year-old
with a baseball cap on backward, he climbs a jungle gym and stops
to tell the camera: ``I enjoy climbing and dirt-bike riding and
wrestling. I like just doing what a regular kid would like.'' To
other children, this makes the point that he can be a friend; to an
adult, his assumption that he is not ``a regular kid'' is among the
heart-wrenching details.
</P>
<P>
   These children often parrot adults and sound too old for their
years, with a sad mix of adult cares and childish emotions. ``I was
born with HIV,'' Chris says. ``I want to keep it a secret because
I'm afraid if I tell everybody, they'll turn against me and be
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scenes of boys and girls white-water rafting, and at a
camp for children with HIV. (The program rarely distinguishes
between those carrying the HIV virus and those who actually have
AIDS.) Throughout, their major theme is the isolation of living
with a condition that often makes them outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Though the emphasis is on living, the program can't avoid the
subject of death. Stephanie, 12, says that when she gets depressed,
she reminds herself she's still alive. When Chris gives a talk at a
school, he is asked by another child, ``What's the scariest part
about having AIDS?'' He ticks off his answers: ``Let's see. Dying,
afraid someone's going to bomb your house if you tell, and losing
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's weakness is that it includes so little information
about what HIV is and how it is transmitted, largely throwing
parents back on their own resources. But then its purpose is to
start a conversation between parents and children who are ready to
deal with the issue, not be a substitute for one.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's program has a more cautionary and harrowing tone. For its
teen-agers and young adults, the determination to have long lives
coexists with the harsh knowledge of what they're up against.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people profiled by the filmmakers, Jennifer Jako and
Rebecca Guberman, were also infected as teen-agers, often through a
blase attitude about sex and drugs. They do not beat themselves up
about it here, but go on to explain how their lives have changed
forever.
</P>
<P>
   With a more stylized approach, ``It Could Be You'' occasionally
flashes statistics about HIV on screen against a red background of
blood seen under a microscope. ``Every hour, two Americans under
the age of 20 become infected with HIV,'' is one, reflecting the
young men and women's sense of astonishment that this has happened
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought HIV only happened to gay men and people who used
drugs,'' says Ms. Jako, who got the virus from unprotected sex. A
woman named Jasmine, who got the virus from her only sexual partner
when she was 13, five years ago, still finds her situation hard to
accept. One especially alarming statistic notes: ``A recent survey
of HIV-infected people says 40 percent had not told their status to
their sexual partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their more mature attitude, the people on the MTV
special echo the emotional themes of the children on the Disney
Channel. They are saddened by people who are afraid to touch them,
and fear never finding anyone who will love them.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these half-hour specials says what percentage of
people with HIV are children or young adults. Focusing instead on
the need to tell their stories, these programs constitute eloquent
pleas for understanding.

TEXAS GOV. BUSH PRAISES ISRAEL AS `COUNTRY OF GENIUS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Sounding more like a presidential candidate than
he's willing to admit, Texas Gov. George W. Bush Monday praised
Israel as a ``country of genius'' and avoided a brewing controversy
by canceling a planned trip to a West Bank Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful to see first hand not only the challenges
facing Israel, but also the opportunities,'' Bush said at a dinner
hosted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is a country of genius, Israel's got tremendous
talent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments capped a day of meetings with Israeli government
officials, including Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, on his second day of a three-day visit
to Israel. He also held talks with opposition Labor leader Ehud
Barak and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Bush visited Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, laid a
wreath at the grave site of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
and visited Israel's Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very powerful,'' Bush said after seeing the museum dedicated
to the 6 million Jews who perished during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited Jerusalem's walled Old City, where he toured the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built over the site where most
Christians believe Jesus was buried, and the Western, or Wailing,
Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wall, Bush was greeted by a crowd of U.S. tourists,
including several from Texas, who waved, snapped pictures and shook
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised to see him at the Wailing Wall,''
said Dwight Burgess, a travel agent from Dallas who was wearing a
Rangers baseball cap. Bush formerly had a financial interest in the
Dallas team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised at all the warmth he got from the people,
Israelis and Americans alike,'' Burgess said, adding that he hoped
Bush would run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to remain tight-lipped about whether he would
seek the GOP presidential nomination. He also sidestepped questions
that might shed light on what his policy in the Middle East would
be if he were to win the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between Israel and the U.S. is a very special
relationship,'' was all he would say. ``It will always be that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, former President George Bush, was often at odds
with Israel over the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza, one of the most difficult issues facing Israelis and
Palestinians in their quest to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said privately that they had hoped that the
younger Bush would offer a glimpse into whether he would follow his
father's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, traveling with other governors from Massachusetts, Utah
and Montana, was invited by the National Jewish Coalition, a
Republican lobby group that holds views on the peace process
similar to Netanyahu's conservative government.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the group had been scheduled to visit two West Bank
settlements, Alfei Menashe in the northern West Bank and Kochav
Hashachar in the Jordan Valley. The plans were canceled, apparently
at the urging of the Clinton administration after Palestinians
objected, according to an Israeli official in the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary, organized by the NJC, did not include a visit
with any Palestinian official. An NJC member said the group had
tried but failed to fix a meeting with Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat, who is in Washington this week.

 &HT;    Commentary: Georgia GOP have trouble with direction
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a sense, the identity crisis in which the Georgia
Republican Party finds itself this holiday season has been made
worse by political science.
</P>
<P>
   By now there are textbooks full of graphs showing the steady
rise of Republican influence in the state and the region, lending
to an assumption of inevitability that took a hard rapping in the
past election.
</P>
<P>
   The party lost with Guy Millner leading the ticket for a third
time, but this time the margin of defeat widened considerably. For
the first time in the decade it lost seats in the Legislature: one
in the House and probably one in the Senate, depending on the
outcome in the 38th District, whose weary voters trudge to the
polls again today in another effort to sort out that confusing
situation, and pending legal action in the disputed 53rd Senate
district
</P>
<P>
   While nothing disastrous in terms of the statistical curve,
these setbacks, in combination with Newt Gingrich's surprise
departure, leave the Republicans contemplating a future not
forecast in the graphs. With the Democrats positioned to control
the next redistricting, the uncertainty suddenly extends into the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans looked forward to having one of their own as
the governor's floor leader in the Senate. But few would ever have
guessed that the Republican, Sen. Charlie Tanksley of Cobb County,
would be handling legislation for a Democrat _ his law partner,
Gov.-elect Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Tanksley said Monday his new post gives him an opportunity to be
involved in policy-making that a Republican wouldn't otherwise
have.
</P>
<P>
   Tanksley said Barnes's position on issues such as property tax
relief and giving businesses a moratorium on paying unemployment
taxes are ``consistent with what a lot of Republicans think should
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   While this may bode well for the next administration, it
underscores the difficulty the Republicans, so confident of their
direction throughout most of this decade, currently have in finding
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction of the party is really up in the air, and I'm
not sure we really understand what the problem really was in the
past election,'' Tanksley said. One subject on which Tanksley has
differed with others in his party is affirmative action, sure to be
a prime topic in the soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   It's a time for the party to re-evaluate its leadership ``from
top to bottom,'' departing state chairman Rusty Paul said Monday.
Paul, who has signed on with Steve Forbes' presidential campaign,
is supporting Florida chairman Tom Slade's bid to unseat Republican
national chairman Jim Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's decision not to seek another term next May helps the
soul-searching along in Georgia by throwing open the state
chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Several names already are being tossed around as possibilities,
including three refugees from this year's lieutenant governor's
race: Sen. Chuck Clay, Rockdale Commission Chairman Randy Poynter
and former Sen. Clint Day. Fulton GOP chairman Ron Jackson and
party vice chair Linda Herren have also been mentioned.

 &HT;    2000 census creates dissention between Clinton administration,
House GOP, firm
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Atlanta public interest law firm and House
Republicans asked the U. S. Supreme Court Monday to bar the Census
Bureau from using certain estimates in the 2000 census even if they
prove to be more accurate than a traditional head count.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to use scientific sampling to
get a better count of minorities and other hard-to-reach groups,
which could boost the population totals for Atlanta and other big
cities that claimed to have been shortchanged in the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   The once-a-decade census helps determine each state's
representation in Congress, the drawing of electoral boundaries and
the distribution of more than $175 billion in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, arguing on behalf of the
administration, told the justices that every census since 1790 has
been an estimate of the population since no census has physically
reached every person in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling, the use of a randomly selected cross-section of the
population to estimate the entire population, would be a ``quality
check'' on the accuracy of the Census Bureau's more traditional
methods of trying to count every American household through
mailings and follow-up visits, Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the Census Bureau to use sampling ``will best achieve
the Constitution's goal of determining the number of persons in
each state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the House of Representatives and a group of
individuals that includes Matthew Glavin, president of the
Southeastern Legal Foundation, and Rep. Bob Barr agreed that no
census is likely to count everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But, they argued, the Court should uphold lower court rulings
that blocked the sampling plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of accuracy, it is both illegal and
unconstitutional,'' said Michael Carvin, who represents Glavin and
Barr in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 100 percent head count is the only permissible means of
apportioning the population,'' Carvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The census will begin April 1, 2000, in traditional fashion with
the mailing of census forms to every known household in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau expects about two-thirds of those households
to respond. Intensive follow-up efforts are intended to bring the
response rate up to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The sampling plan would estimate the population of the remaining
10 percent of the households based on the characteristics of
similar households that did fill out census forms.
</P>
<P>
   A second rigorous survey of 750,000 households across the
country would allow the Census Bureau to adjust the population
totals.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's rationale perplexed several justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know what the 'true number' is,'' if the Census
Bureau is producing an estimate of the population, Chief Justice
William Rehnquist asked Waxman.
</P>
<P>
   When Waxman sought to assure him that the bureau's estimates
would be very accurate, Rehnquist responded, ``Why do we have a
census then?''
</P>
<P>
   He knew the answer: the Constitution requires one.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Mahoney, who represents the House of Representatives,
found herself arguing against counting the residents of an
apartment who did not fill out a census form and never answered a
knock on the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put down zero?'' Justice John Paul Stevens asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney replied, ``That's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer provoked laughter in the august courtroom
when he chimed in, ``You mean even if the lights go on and off each
evening?''
</P>
<P>
   While both sides passionately argued the merits of their case,
they also spent a good deal of time on a more technical issue that
could prove decisive for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman argued that neither the House nor Glavin and his group
has the right, or standing, to sue at this point because the census
has yet to be taken and no damage has yet been done that could give
rise to a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to find some support among the justices, including
Justice Antonin Scalia, who expressed his distaste for mediating a
dispute between the executive and legislative branches of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 900 ways to stymie the president if the House has
the political will to do it,'' including cutting off funding for
the Census or other programs that are important to the White House,
Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides said they hope to receive a ruling by late
winter, which would give the Census Bureau barely a year to make
its final preparations for the census.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, however, is unlikely to be the final act
in the census dispute.
</P>
<P>
   While expressing confidence his side would win, Glavin said that
if the court rules for the administration, ``We'll be back.''

 &HT;    A tour of Southern backroads finds downhome cooking alive and
well
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, scholars have been telling us that the South is
becoming as homogenized as the rest of the country because of
television and cookie-cutter malls.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are Wal-Marts and McDonald's in every town big
enough to have two traffic lights, but regional cuisine is still as
distinctive as fingerprints or biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe that, then you haven't eaten the Cajun
peppered shrimp at the Blue Desert Cafe in Cedar Key, Fla., or the
roast beef and ``debris'' po-boys at Mother's in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the chitlins and fried fatback at the Toot-N-Tell
in Garner, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who rarely leave the interstates when traveling, I
didn't realize how much the food varies from state to state until I
embarked on a 25,000-mile tour of the South to write ``Backroad
Buffets and Country Cafes,'' a guidebook to meat-and-threes and
other places where the local folks eat.
</P>
<P>
   I was looking for restaurants where conscientious cooks still
peeled and mashed real potatoes and pan-fried chicken, where banana
pudding was a
</P>
<P>
   staple and the meringue on the homemade pies was as high as the
waitresses' hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   What I discovered was as eye-opening as it was mouthwatering.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there is an explosion of all-you-can-eat
catfish-and-chicken restaurants and seafood buffets where you can
gorge yourself for $10 or so. Southerners _ and apparently
Northerners, too _ love to get their money's worth. The closest
thing I have seen to these gatherings is a shark feeding frenzy on
the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   For noonday meals, fried chicken and country fried steak are
still the mainstays in most meat-and-threes, but several restaurant
owners insist that turkey or baked chicken and corn bread dressing
are their most popular offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Hush puppies are a mystery and vary from state to state. Some,
particularly in North Carolina, are sweet and yeasty and the shape
of an index finger, while others in the South are round lumps with
lots of onion bits and no sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Tamales are another enigma. I mistakenly thought you had to go
to Texas or the Southwest to get tamales, but these Mexican
delicacies are regularly eaten in Mississippi and Arkansas. At
Doe's Eat Place, a disreputable-looking establishment in
Greenville, Miss., they are served by the dozens, along with
28-ounce steaks, to a clientele that includes senators and
congressmen as well as construction workers.
</P>
<P>
   And at McClard's Bar-B-Q in Hot Springs, Ark., they offer
tamales as a side dish to their spicy ribs. Bill Clinton, by the
way, used to eat at McClard's frequently when he was in elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
   Why tamales? Marcia Schnedler, a food critic in Arkansas, says
they are the result of Italian and Mexican grandpas and grandmas
trading recipes while working on a Mississippi Delta farm in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Besides serving good local cuisine, many of these establishments
provide colorful glimpses into Southern culture. The Bell Buckle
Cafe in Bell Buckle, Tenn., for example, features a live radio show
every Saturday night with local country and blues singers. And at
the Lantern Inn in Cumming, Ga., Mike Jones does triple duty as a
garbage collector by day and an Elvis impersonator and cook by
night.
</P>
<P>
   After frying up a batch of catfish and chicken, Jones dons black
leather for the early show and performs an act from the early Elvis
days, before too many fried peanut-butter-and-mashed-banana
sandwiches went to his love handles. After an intermission, Jones
returns as the Vegas Elvis in a white sequined jumpsuit singing,
``I can cook a hunka, hunka burning catfish.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't find that kind of combination of food and
entertainment just anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some sad notes. Cracklin' corn bread, that
Southern delicacy laced with bits of fried hog fat, is practically
extinct. (Harold's Barbecue in Atlanta still has it, but few others
do.) Lard is not used nearly as frequently as it used to be, and
sweet tea is not universally available in every restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that in a region once beset with racial
turmoil, I discovered that food, among other things, has helped
break down barriers. In Carrboro, N.C., for example, there's a
little restaurant called Country Junction where the owners and
cooks are Chinese and the customers are a melting pot of
socioeconomic and ethnic groups. The one thing they have in common
is a taste for Southern vegetables at a cheap price.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilson, N.C., Ed Mitchell, a successful African-American
barbecue entrepreneur, explained that when blacks and whites,
Democrats and Republicans come into his restaurant, they break
bread together and forget their differences for at least an hour,
maybe longer. ``All the titles and pedigrees are left at the
door,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I think he's onto something. It's hard to be angry with someone
from another race or political party when you're both sitting in a
cafe eating barbecue that practically melts in your mouth.

 &HT;    A place in space: Some facts about the International Space
Station
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPACE STATION FACTS:
</P>
<P>
   _ The space station will circle the Earth once every 92 minutes.
As it is expanded, it will be visible from the ground _ reflecting
enough sunlight to be visible as a bright point of light moving
across the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   _ A crew of three hopes to occupy the partially completed
station in the year 2000. Later, the station will be able to
accommodate up to seven people. NASA's emergency escape, the X-38,
won't be ready until at least 2003. In the meantime, crews will
keep a Russian Soyuz capsule on hand as a standby ``lifeboat.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Upon completion, the station will have a mass of 470 tons,
nearly one million pounds. The solar panels will cover an area of
more than a half-acre. The interior living space will be the
equivalent of a 747 jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 100,000 people have been involved in planning and
building the space station. Several key components, including two
connecting nodes and the U.S. laboratory module and the joint
airlock, were manufactured at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   _ The space station is the largest international program ever
undertaken in space. The U.S. partners are Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway,
Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   _ The station's electrical power system contains eight miles of
wiring. There will be 52 computers to control power, flight
orientation, heat, light, and other critical concerns. And there
are four windows, at least one of which will always afford a view
of the Earth below.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starting this month, two flight control rooms _ one at NASA's
Johnson Space Center in Houston and one outside Moscow _ will be in
contact with the space station 24 hours a day for as long as it
remains in orbit.

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Dec. 13, Roger Berlind will put on a tuxedo for
his 33d opening night in the 22 years since he left investment
banking and became a producer, then he will take his aisle seat for
``The Blue Room,'' starring Nicole Kidman, which he helped import
from London.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't excitement or nervousness Berlind feels in those
moments when the lights dim and the curtain rises. It is relief. He
knows there is nothing more he can do. ``I don't get carried away
with opening night magic,'' he said. ``This is a business.''
</P>
<P>
   As businesses go, producing on Broadway is increasingly risky.
Shows are more expensive than ever to mount _ musicals can cost as
much as $10 million _ and rarely do investors recoup, much less
make a profit. Berlind is just one of many who risk fortunes on
shows that are statistically more likely to fail than succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrical producers come and go, particularly after confronting
the reality of a show's punishing losses. Yet Berlind, 68, has hung
in there year after year, taking chances on plays because he
believes in them and because he can afford to lose as often as he
wins. And these days on Broadway, with the influx of large
corporations like Disney and Livent transforming the business, that
kind of individual risk-taking is increasingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're going to see the money that was lost by a
Roger Berlind in the future,'' said John F. Breglio, an
entertainment attorney and chairman of the Theater Development
Fund. ``Who is going to lose the big money and really throw the
dice?''
</P>
<P>
   Monday the McCarter Theater Center for the Performing Arts and
Princeton University announced construction of the Roger S. Berlind
Theater, a 350-seat expansion of the McCarter made possible with a
$3.5 million gift from Berlind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this because I enjoy it,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``There is not an activity I can think of that wouldn't
be more remunerative. I know it's not worth it economically, but I
love theater. It is addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   With labor costs and ad rates increasing faster than inflation
and ticket prices, Berlind said, as well as rising costs of theater
rentals and lighting and sound equipment, the prospect of producing
has become considerably more daunting. While Berlind's first show,
the Richard Rodgers musical ``Rex,'' cost $800,000 in 1976, the
producer said it would cost $10 million today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dicier and dicier,'' Berlind said. ``I think we really
need to address the fundamental cost structure in a way that
incorporates unions and guilds and makes everybody realize this is
a golden age that's turning rotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlind is a wealthy man but he would have been far wealthier
had he not altered his course so drastically 23 years ago. He was
one of the founders of the brokerage firm Carter, Berlind, Potoma &AMP;
Weill, which eventually became Lehman Brothers Inc. Among his
former partners are Sanford I. Weill, now the co-chairman of
Citigroup; Arthur L. Carter, owner of The New York Observer; and
Marshall S. Cogan, a businessman and art collector who once owned
the restaurant ``21.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 24, 1975, everything changed. Berlind went to the
airport with his 2-year-old son to pick up the rest of his family _
his wife and three other children _ and the plane crashed, killing
all of them. Berlind felt he had no choice but to start over. ``The
whole idea of building a business and making money didn't make
sense anymore,'' he said. ``There was no more economic
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then Berlind's many projects have included hits _
``Amadeus,'' ``City of Angels,'' the revival of ``Guys and Dolls''
_ and about as many misses: ``Precious Sons,'' ``Getting Away With
Murder,'' ``Elliot Loves.'' Berlind's co-producers often include
Scott Rudin, the Shubert Organization, Robert Fox and ABC, although
sometimes, as in the case of ``Getting Away With Murder'' by
Stephen Sondheim, he goes it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's unlikely to be a success, I won't raise money,''
Berlind said. ``It's too much of a fiduciary obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year two big musicals he took to Broadway failed to recoup:
``The Life,'' which ran for just over a year, and ``Steel Pier,''
which closed after about three months, including previews.
</P>
<P>
   To trawl for material, Berlind sees about 100 shows a year in
New York, in London and around the country. He goes to backer
auditions for investors, meets with other producers, reads scripts.
Sometimes he just writes a check, but he prefers a more active
role, helping writers shape the material and directors come up with
a concept and taking part in the mechanics like advertising and
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as much fun when you have your nose pressed against
the pane,'' Berlind said, ``and all the fun is happening on the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He likes to see auditions and rehearsals and to work with
creative people who welcome his views. Some say Berlind is
appropriately respectful of the limits of his role. ``He gives his
opinions but lets the authors decide,'' said the composer and
lyricist Stephen Sondheim, ``and that seems to me the best kind of
producer you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like the late Jerome Robbins _ Berlind produced ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' in 1989 _ apparently found him more intrusive.
``Jerome Robbins, when you hired him, you knew your involvement
would be minimal,'' Berlind said. ``He was hard to talk to and
didn't take suggestions well.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlind said he finally wrote Robbins a seven-page,
single-spaced typed letter containing all his ideas for the show,
and Robbins wrote him back saying simply: ``Thank you for your
thoughts. I will take them into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlind, who remarried 19 years ago, seems well liked in the
theater world. People often refer to him as a gentleman and
describe him as kind. They're also grateful that he has been
willing to gamble so much of his own fortune on producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger is an example of someone who came from another industry
and didn't carpetbag on the theater,'' said Nick Scandalios,
executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization. ``He came
and he stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlind's choice in plays, however, is not universally
respected. Because his background is in finance and not the arts,
some theater veterans say, Berlind does not have as reliable a gut
feeling as, say, producers with more theatrical flair, like Cameron
Mackintosh. They also say Berlind plays it safe by importing shows
from London and does not take chances on new work.
</P>
<P>
   Berlind seems confident in his instinct but acknowledges some
major mistakes. ``When I fall in love,'' he said, ``sometimes I let
my judgment suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his buttoned-down appearance and banker's reserve, he
describes producing with passion. ``It's like life or death,'' he
said. ``You're with a group of people so intensely that you tend to
lose sight of what's important to the world. Everything comes down
to making this show work. That's what makes it an amazing
experience, and it's also what allows you to get in serious
trouble. It's a very emotional product. You wouldn't feel that way
if you were manufacturing shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Berlind is no philanthropist. He is in this to
make money, and the bottom line is his top priority. ``Each
production is designed to return a profit,'' he said. ``I never do
anything when I think, `I'm only doing this for love.'''
</P>
<P>
   Plays, particularly musicals, can be years in the making,
Berlind said. First he obtains the production rights, which can
entail long negotiations. Then he hires his creative team:
director, designers, choreographer. Finally, he moves on to
auditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At each of these steps you have to mentally _ in fact, rather
specifically _ determine the cost factor: how is it going to impact
your production budget as well as your operating budget,'' Berlind
said. ``And the hope is that you can break even at a low enough
number so that what you earn above that is sufficient to pay back
the cost of a production and be running long enough after that to
give a profit to the investors.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the lack of this kind of watchfulness, Berlind said, that
led to the trouble facing Livent Inc., the public production
company founded by Garth H. Drabinsky, which is now in bankruptcy.
``I think it's a good case study in the need to control costs,''
Berlind said. ``While I admire Garth Drabinsky's creativity and
passion very much, I think he didn't pay sufficient attention to
the production costs and the operating costs.''
</P>
<P>
   When he raises money from other sources _ people, Berlind said,
``in a position to lose 100 percent of their investment'' _ he
always keeps those investors in mind.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, he said, because of the subjective, mysterious
quality of what makes a hit, the result is out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit like wildcatting for oil: you can always hit
a gusher and then not get paid for six dry holes,'' he said.
``Gushers are harder and harder to come by because the economics of
the business have deteriorated so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tony Awards do not guarantee financial success, said
Berlind, who has won nine of them. Last spring, for example, ``A
View From the Bridge,'' for which he was a co-producer, won the
Tony for best revival but never made its money back and closed
after five months. ``It should have worked,'' Berlind said. ``There
is no explanation for that.''
</P>
<P>
   While he often sees the logic of the critics, Berlind said,
there are some shows whose failure continues to mystify him, like
``Steel Pier,'' which he nurtured from the beginning. In a review
in The New York Times, Ben Brantley said of the show, set in the
world of marathon dancing in Atlantic City in 1933, ``The entire
effort feels soft at the edges, and it never really finds its
motor.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlind continued: ``There was a miscalculation which we still
can't identify _ why it didn't work. So you put a lot of your
emotions into a project like that over a two-year or longer period
and it all comes down to opening night, which makes it absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the absurdity of producing on Broadway makes
Berlind ask how long he'll stick with it. ``It's something I ask
myself all the time,'' he said. ``How joyous is it and is there any
objective reason to continue doing this as being an independent
producer becomes less and less rewarding?''
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, Berlind says, his heart wins out over his head.
So his schedule remains full. This spring he is taking two
consecutive plays to Broadway from London, Patrick Marber's
``Closer'' and David Hare's ``Amy's View.'' And next season he
plans to produce two musicals, a revival of ``Kiss Me Kate'' and
the new Stephen Sondheim musical, ``Wise Guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying for 10 years, `This is it,''' Berlind said.
``And then I get seduced by a script or a production I see. And I
want to do it.''

CLINTON BOLSTERS MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS WITH $400 MILLION AID
PACKAGE TO PALESTINIANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sought to bolster the Middle East
peace process Monday as he proposed a U.S. aid package of $400
million to Palestinians and downplayed renewed strains between
Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been bumps in the road, to be sure, but the
agreement is on track, and we must keep it on track,'' Clinton told
representatives of 50 nations and organizations convened at the
State Department. The U.S.-led conference generated $3 billion in
pledges to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton met in the Oval Office with Arafat who enraged
Israelis this weekend by again voicing hopes for creating a
Palestinian state next year. Netanyahu dismissed Arafat's statehood
comments as ``serious and insufferable.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the two sides were called off after Israel balked
at releasing more Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will fly to the Middle East Dec. 12 to urge the
Palestinian National Council to revoke language in its charter
calling for Israel's destruction. Clinton will be the first
president to visit the Gaza Strip and the West Bank territories now
partially controlled by Arafat's forces.
</P>
<P>
   The donors conference here comes on the heels of the Wye River
Memorandum reached after marathon negotiations between Clinton,
Arafat and Netanyahu at the Maryland conference center last month.
The accord revived stalled Middle East peace talks as Israel agreed
to cede more territory to the Palestinians in return for crackdowns
on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Arafat reaffirmed his pledge to uphold his side of
the agreement and to work with Israeli authorities to promote
Israel's security. I promised the continuing support of the United
States as we move ahead in the next phase of the peace process.
That phase begins today with this conference,'' Clinton said.
``Today, our purpose is to send a clear signal that this peace is
more than a piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will work with Congress to craft a $400 million
package to help Palestinians create jobs, to improve education, to
improve access to water and to support the rule of law. The amount
will be in addition to the annual $100 million in support from the
United States, Clinton said. The United States currently provides
more than $3 billion a year to Israel and pledged an increase to
help with security needs.
</P>
<P>
   The donors' conference netted $3 billion in pledges from the
representatives of other nations and organizations for development
in the Palestinian controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this was ``the
beginning of a process which will turn words on paper into
contracts, construction sites and commerce in the West Bank and
Gaza, and throughout the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the initial 1993 peace accord, international commitments
have totaled $4 billion but only half the amount has actually been
disbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No peace stands a chance of lasting if it does not deliver
real results to ordinary people. Our challenge today, therefore, is
to do more to deliver these results and to do it sooner rather than
later,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first peace accord was signed in 1993, there has been
``too little tangible improvement'' for Palestinians, Clinton said,
noting income is down and unemployment is up. ``Living conditions
are extremely difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton encouraged the representatives to also do their part to
make contributions to economic development in the region.
Palestinians also are working to construct several industrial parks
as well as a seaport at Gaza. An airport opened there several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were allowed to attend the conference and listen to
Clinton speak, but were forced to leave before Arafat made his
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft copy of Arafat's speech, he told the
potential donors that Israel bears much of the blame for the poor
Palestinian economy because of its ``continued siege and frequent
closure'' of borders into Gaza and the West Bank. Israel repeatedly
has closed its borders following terrorists attacks, a move that
also bars Palestinian workers from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli closure policy is the primary and direct cause for
the dangerous decline in the performance of the Palestinian economy
over the past five years,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Arafat spoke to the Arab-American Institute, inviting
guests to the region in celebration of Christmas and the upcoming
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also hope that this year will be the year of the
independent Palestinian state. On the fourth of May, 1999, the
interim (peace) period will end. And we should by that time be
prepared to declare our independent Palestinian State,'' Arafat
said through a translator whom he corrected repeatedly during his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's capital, Jerusalem, the Holy City,'' Arafat said,
adding that ``western Jerusalem could be the capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials sought to downplay Arafat's remarks
although the Palestinian leader in recent weeks has repeatedly
suggested he would declare Palestine an independent state by next
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has been clear, as we have stated many times; and
we believe that statehood is an issue for final-status talks, an
issue to be negotiated between the parties, and not unilaterally
decided,'' said Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The final status talks include the most divisive and sensitive
issues left unresolved. &QL;

COLOMBIA COURTS CONGRESS, BECOMES A TOP RECIPIENT OF U.S. AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By Diana Jean Schemo   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration initially opposed it, and the
Colombian government was taken by surprise. But a recent
congressional initiative, spurred by direct appeals to conservative
Republicans by the Colombian national police, has more than doubled
drug-fighting money to Colombia and made the country a top
recipient of United States foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The increase brings the assistance to $289 million for 1999,
compared with $80 million in 1997 and $88.6 million this year. It
is mostly in the form of weapons, helicopters and surveillance
planes and will sharply increase the American-supplied firepower to
the Colombian police.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are calling it the first installment
of a three-year campaign to reduce substantially the flow of
illicit drugs into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But critics fear that the huge jump in aid and the heightened
U.S. interest in attacking the drug trade at its source will lure
Washington into supporting the seemingly endless war by Colombia's
armed forces against leftist guerrillas, which has slowly bled
Colombia of tens of thousands of lives and untold resources for
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the money has been designated for use against drug crop
growers and drug traffickers, much of the equipment could easily be
used against the guerrillas. The equipment will require substantial
American training of pilots, maintenance workers and support staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal for aid by the Colombian police, and in the
congressional response, the distinction between drug traffickers
and guerrillas usually insisted on by officials of the State
Department and other American agencies has become blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Some guerrilla groups are involved in protecting coca crops and
landing strips in southern Colombia and skim a commission from the
drug trade. A report last year by the Colombian drug police
estimated that 3,155 of the country's 15,000 guerrillas were active
in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers like Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., have adopted
the label applied to the rebels by the Colombian police and
military _ narcoterrorists _ lumping the insurgency and drug
traffickers into a single threat to United States interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian drug police have at times dropped the distinction
altogether. For instance, they recently highlighted an army defeat
at the hands of rebels to press the case for acquiring
American-made Blackhawk helicopters, even though the combat had
nothing to do with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase in aid will come as part of a $690 million
package of supplemental appropriations for drug interdiction
throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional aid for the national police includes the
following:
</P>
<P>
   _$96 million for six Blackhawk helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   _$40 million for upgrading and arming 34 Huey helicopter
gunships, which can fire high-powered machine guns over long
distances.
</P>
<P>
   _$6 million for beefing up a crop fumigation air wing, in part
with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Administration-sponsored aid for Colombia also approved by
Congress includes the following:
</P>
<P>
   _$70 million for aerial fumigation of drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   _$20 million in helicopters, transport and surveillance planes,
weapons and other equipment for the Colombian National Police.
</P>
<P>
   _$20 million in patrol boats, weapons, ammunition and other
supplies for the Colombian military.
</P>
<P>
   The $165 million in supplemental aid from Congress is in
addition to $124 million already appropriated for Colombia, and
represents a tenfold increase in counter-narcotics funding over
five year period. Roughly 80 percent of the cocaine in the United
States originates in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a decision that surprised everybody,'' Colombia's
defense minister, Rodrigo Lloreda, said in an interview. He added
that the Clinton administration had previously supported
drug-fighting efforts in Colombia, ``but they kept a certain
balance between Colombia, Peru and other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Both administration and congressional officials described the
appropriation as a kind of ``wish list,'' that they were surprised
to see pass virtually in its entirety. Administration officials
like Barry McCaffrey, the retired general who is in charge of
anti-drug efforts, initially complained that the congressional
authorization _ which at first specified that $1.2 million should
go for concertina wire around a Bogota prison _ ``micromanaged''
drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials said the initial spending plan
overextended the American commitment to Colombia, and was too
costly. But in the end, the plan won White House backing because it
was more attuned to overall strategy, and won their support.
</P>
<P>
   Though Congress took the lead, the increased spending matches a
growing closeness between Washington and Bogota since Andres
Pasrtrana was elected president last summer. Pastrana, who has
visited Washington three times in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum for the increase came from a group of conservative
Republicans who have embraced the Colombian national police and who
are determined to increase anti-drug efforts and lend a show of
force as Pastrana sets the stage for peace talks with leftist
rebels.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With government forces having temporarily evacuated an area of
Colombia as big as Switzerland, congressional Republicans describe
the infusion as a signal of American interest in the outcome of
peace talks. It will also shore up Colombian security forces, which
have been humiliated by the rebels in a series of clashes over the
last two years, they say. Until now, a de facto division of labor
has had the Colombian military leading the fight against rebels,
while the police tackled drug trafficking.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I look at this as giving Colombia the support it needs to do
what it wants to do,'' Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said. ``It will
put the government in a better bargaining position.''
</P>
<P>
   The major share of Washington's anti-drug aid is trained on
stepping up aerial eradication in zones under rebel control and
intercepting boats and planes transporting drugs. Officials say the
Blackhawk and upgraded Huey helicopters are better for reaching
high altitudes, where opium poppies are grown. The Blackhawks,
armored and able to transport up to 15 troops, would also represent
greater firepower and maneuverability in Colombia's continuing war
against leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to perhaps appease Washington and the Colombian
government, the rebels have said they would eliminate the drug
trade in areas they control as part of an eventual peace agreement.
Respected political analysts in Colombia, including Alejandro
Reyes, a professor at the National University in Bogota, contend
that the guerrillas are the only authority with enough credibility
among peasants to eliminate the trade.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the insurgents' fighting strategy has grown from
hit-and-run ambushes of soldiers to more conventional assaults on
military and police bases, in which the rebels have repeatedly
outnumbered and overrun government security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent of these occurred last month in an attack
against the police base at Mitu, where Lloreda said 45 policemen
and civilians were known to have been killed and 48 people were
abducted. He said 82 others had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mitu attack bolstered Colombia's case for the
Blackhawks, the police had earlier cited military defeats _
unconnected to the drug trade _ in appealing for the more
sophisticated helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last March to Rep. Dan Burton, R.-Ind., Col. Jose
Leonardo Gallego reiterated an appeal for Blackhawk helicopters he
made in testimony before Congress only a month earlier. In
requesting the helicopters for drug-fighting missions he cited the
deaths of hundreds of government troops in rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those deaths, however, occurred early this year after
rebels ambushed the Colombian army's third brigade at a canyon in
El Billar. The operation was unrelated to any fumigation or
anti-drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the State Department had initially opposed sending
Blackhawks to Colombia, largely because of the higher expense and
maintenance costs involved, Colombia's national police chief, Gen.
Rosso Jose Serrano, has set up direct lines of contact with the
congressional committees controlling the pursestrings. He has acted
as host to most of the key figures in the congressional debate on
their visits to Colombia, making his case for increased firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano has also been adopted by conservative policy advocates
influential with congressional Republicans. One of these is F. Andy
Messing Jr., executive director of the National Defense Council
Foundation, a conservative think tank whose chairman is congressman
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Messing, a retired Special Forces major, has been a frequent
visitor to Colombia and was honored with an anti-narcotics award
from the Colombian police last year. He predicts that as the
situation stands now, the rebels will take control of the Bogota
government in one year, regardless of the outcome of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   During the years of alienation between Washington and Colombia
during the presidency of Ernesto Samper, who was accused of
accepting $6 million from drug traffickers, Serrano became the face
of the Colombian government on Capitol Hill, as relations between
the United States and Colombia narrowed down to the drug issue. In
congressional hearings, Serrano has been hailed as ``a cop's cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was someone during that administration who Congress felt
comfortable with,'' said Senator DeWine.
</P>
<P>
   In the atmosphere of violence that dominates Colombia, the
rebels and the government forces have continued to wage war while
talking peace. ``You can't negotiate unless you have strength,''
LLoreda, the defense minister, said. ``We would all like peace to
come spontaneously out of good will, but it doesn't always work
that way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The newest danger awaiting motorists on the mean
streets of Mexico City comes from revolver-waving bodyguards in
speeding unmarked cars, who swerve from lane to lane to make sure
no one gets close to the chauffeur-driven limousines they follow.
</P>
<P>
   A bump from one such escort car almost sent Humberto Cantu and
his humble Ford sedan careering into a tree. Cantu, a radio disk
jockey on his way to work, caught up to the bodyguards at the next
stoplight to berate them. One of them pointed a pistol at his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax, buddy,'' the man told Cantu. ``Can't you see that we're
working?''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, violent crime in the capital and other
major Mexican cities has surged out of control while police forces,
disabled by decades of corruption, have all but collapsed. So rare
is it for the capital's regular police officers to stop a crime
that they often make newspaper headlines when they do. As a result,
frightened citizens who need help to defend their loved ones or
their property have turned to private security guards, legions of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The huge growth of private security is a new complication for
Mexico's efforts _ so far in vain _ to subdue a tidal wave of
crime, especially robbery and kidnapping. Most guards are armed but
few are trained or licensed, and the authorities acknowledge they
have little control over them. Abuses against unsuspecting
passers-by grow more frequent every day, as do violent crimes by
crooks posing as private policemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have allowed a bunch of fly-by-night security companies to
arm a huge number of people, basically an entire army,'' said
Victor Manuel Soto Camacho, a Mexico City councilman from the
opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution who is an expert on
local crime. ``In many cases our citizens, instead of getting
security, are getting more danger.''
</P>
<P>
   In affluent neighborhoods the bodyguards seem to rule the
streets. They strong-arm pedestrians, charge through red lights and
brandish weapons, all in the name of defending ``the boss,''
whoever that may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who has not been insulted or threatened?'' Arnoldo Kraus, a
newspaper columnist, wrote. ``All because we deign to travel on the
same street as them. The aggression of those wardens of 25-year-old
rich kids and their Mercedeses and BMWs is downright degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 200,000 Mexicans are employed as guards by some
3,000 private companies, industry figures show. Only 275 companies
are properly registered with the government. As many as 90,000
private guards work in Mexico City, 11,000 more than the number of
uniformed policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of private bodyguards is not new in Mexico, which
even contributed its own word for them to the Spanish lexicon:
``guaruras,'' a term handed down from the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   Its original meaning is not known but the current one, according
to a standard dictionary of Mexican phraseology, is unambiguous:
``A strong and overbearing individual ready to draw his weapon, who
is in charge of protecting another person.''
</P>
<P>
   In past decades only the most powerful politicians and
conspicuous tycoons had their own security guards. Now practically
any office building, middle-class neighborhood or prominent
business executive needs protection.
</P>
<P>
   Even Homero Aridjis, a leading intellectual who is the president
of the writers' group International PEN, travels with burly men at
his back since he received telephone death threats late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a culture of fear,'' Aridjis said. ``And we don't
really know if the men watching out for us are good or bad, honest
or criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The guaruras' style is unmistakable. They gather in forbidding
clusters outside business conferences and power-elite restaurants
during Mexico City's late-afternoon lunch hour. Their vehicles of
choice are either a Chrysler Spirit or a Dodge Stratus, with
hubcaps removed and four doors for quick exit. A heavy black steel
grate, known as a burro-bouncer, shields the front fender so the
driver can ram other cars without denting his own.
</P>
<P>
   Subtlety is not a feature. The guaruras all seem to wear shiny
suits, black ties and dark glasses. Their belts hang heavy with
beepers and cellular phones and their jackets bulge with barely
concealed handguns. They ride four to a car, each one peering
warily out his window. And Cantu, the disk jockey, is an example of
what happens to the unwary driver who wanders in between them and
their clients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A professional bodyguard should be discreet,'' said Ramon
Requeijo Abad, president of the Mexican branch of Nutronica, an
international security company that is one of the few to fully
screen and train its guards. ``But in this country they love to
make a show of their arrogance. If there is a fight, they jump in
and make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Most guards are not personal escorts but lowly watchmen,
standing duty in stores and building lobbies. Often they make less
than $50 a week, so the incentive for them is to commit crimes
rather than prevent them. Over the last year city police have seen
a rash of break-ins that appear to be inside jobs by doormen and
night watchmen.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Alejandro Gertz Manero opened a campaign in Mexico
City recently to impose tight supervision on the security industry.
He wants all guards to be registered and to pass drug,
psychological and weapons-handling tests as well as undergo
criminal-background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz started the crackdown after he noticed two police patrol
cars escorting a private vehicle, a practice that is prohibited.
After stopping the patrol cars himself, he quickly discovered that
they were private vehicles illegally painted with the colors of the
police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has the right to seek protection for himself,'' Gertz
said. ``No one has to the right to offend or humiliate others.''

the nation's fourth largest fund house. Recognizing that fund
performance is not enough, Putnam is seeking greater influence over
the various channels through which it sells its investment
products. Secondly, Putnam had worried that the recent retirement
of top executive William N. Shiebler, who turned Putnam into a
marketing machine this decade, might leave a hole in the firm's
ability to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Kuo, 35, comes from Prudential Investments, where she was a
senior vice president in charge of marketing and strategy. She
reports to Thomas J. Lucey, who heads the business side of Putnam's
retail and institutional funds. Starting in January, Kuo will
consolidate marketing in Putnam's four core units _ mutual funds,
institutional money management, defined contribution pension
schemes, and international businesses. Previously, the groups had
their own marketing units, each with slightly different messages
and approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to unify the message across all channels,'' Lucey
said. No layoffs are planned, he said, although some marketing
staffers will be redeployed within the company.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam does not sell its mutual funds directly to consumers or
through ``supermarkets,'' such as Charles Schwab's OneSource.
Instead, it vends funds through banks, brokers, and financial
advisers. Shiebler _ whose successor, former Merrill Lynch
executive Richard A. Monaghan, had his first day on the job Monday
_ cultivated enviable relationships in those three channels as head
of fund sales to individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, with $275 billion in assets under management and over 10
million fund shareholders, burst onto the investment scene in the
1990s with high performing funds and strong marketing. The firm, a
unit of insurance broker Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos., drew in $21.7
billion in new cash last year, about 25 percent more than Fidelity
Investments, the nation's largest fund house and Putnam's crosstown
rival, according to Financial Research Corp. So far this year,
Putnam is second in sales only to The Vanguard Group.
</P>
<P>
   With those numbers, some might ask what needs to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to beef up an area that had been well taken
care of but never had one person handling it,'' said fund marketing
consultant Geoff Bobroff.

 &HT;    CLINTON PLEDGES $400 MILLION TO HELP PALESTINIANS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Hoping to nurture the seeds of Mideast peace,
President Clinton on Monday pledged $400 million to help
Palestinians build a working economy in the West Bank and Gaza,
saying jobs and growth can lead a new generation away from violence
in the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   His pledge kicked off an international donors' conference here
that raised some $3 billion in promised aid meant to help
Palestinians build roads, water systems, schools, clinics and other
facilities deemed essential to their social well being and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who plans to visit Israel and the Palestinian
territories in two weeks, stopped short of calling for a
Palestinian state. He said, however, that building a viable
Palestinian society is essential to lasting peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   ''Palestinians have a right to the same things all people aspire
to,'' Clinton said, ''to be part of a normal, even happy, society,
where children receive a decent education, where there are jobs to
go around and decent health care, where people's memories are
reconciled with their hopes for the future, and there is no fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pledge is subject to congressional approval. It would
come on top of existing U.S. aid to Palestinians, which is
scheduled to hit $100 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aid to Palestinians would still be dwarfed by the roughly
$3 billion in assistance, mostly security oriented, that Washington
provides to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who helped broker a set of Israeli-Palestinian accords
in October that breathed life into a Mideast peace process that had
been stalled for 18 months, is traveling on Dec. 12 to Israel and
Palestinian territories to try to build on the momentum toward a
comprehensive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Central to an overall peace treaty would be the disputed issues
of Palestinian statehood and the future of the city of Jerusalem.
It is now Israel's capital, but the Palestinians claim part of it
as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has taken no public position on either issue, saying
both are to be decided in so-called final status talks.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat, who met with Clinton
on Monday, has threatened to unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state unless final status talks are completed by May. That is the
deadline set under the Oslo peace process agreed upon in 1993 by
Israel and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials have repeatedly cautioned Arafat against
reiterating the threat, he alluded to it again on Monday. He
thanked donors for their assistance and said, through an
interpreter, that the money has ''enabled us to continue with our
efforts to advance the peace process, develop our economy and
proceed towards realizing our independence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israeli government officials have said in recent
days that such talk threatens the peace process and government
officials have reiterated their own position that Jerusalem is to
remain in Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat contended on Monday that part of the ancient city, what
Palestinians call ''Holy Jerusalem,'' is territory Israelis
occupied in the 1967 war and should be returned to Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Jerusalem issue remains the number one issue,'' said
Arafat. ''Jerusalem will remain the item number one on the agenda
of the permanent status talks.''

</P>
<P>
   Even as Israelis and Palestinians appeared to harden their
battle lines, Clinton said that economic growth could go a long way
toward building public support for the hard choices needed to forge
a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Public and private money will be needed, he said, to jump start
growth, spur investment and demonstrate the benefits of peace to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''For too long, too many young people have turned to terrorism
and old hatreds, partly because they had nothing better to do,''
Clinton said. ''We must give them a different future to believe in.
Every step toward opportunity is a step away from violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his pledge during opening remarks at a donors'
conference held at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from more than 40 countries attended the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not have exact pledges, but it appears that delegations
pledged more than $3 billion today,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told reporters after the conference ended.
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, was well above the $2.3 billion pledged by the
world community at a similar conference in Paris five years ago,
just after the breakthrough Oslo peace accords inked on the White
House lawn between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the money pledged has been disbursed. While
privately some critics have accused donors of not ponying up their
pledged amounts, others contend that the hold-up is implementation.
Starting from nearly scratch, these analysts say, the Palestinian
territories are absorbing the money as quickly as can be done
without rampant waste or ineffectual spending.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the causes, the Palestinian economy has been
backsliding for several years, with per capita income falling and
job growth stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Clinton said, the momentum of the Oslo accords has
bogged down, in part because ''There has been too little tangible
improvement in the lives of the Palestinian people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   '''We must convince those who have invested so much in this
process that it was a sound investment,'' said Clinton. ''We must
look at Gaza and the West Bank in a new light, not as
battlegrounds, but as energetic places at the crossroads of the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Monday's donor conference was aimed at helping to
realize those aims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is also the beginning of a process which will turn words on
paper into contracts, construction sites and commerce in the West
Bank and Gaza and throughout the Middle East,'' said Albright.
''And the dividends of peace will become increasingly tangible and
enduring in the lives of the Palestinian people.''

ACUSHNET IRED BY PROPOSED BALL-TESTING RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A proposed change in the required testing of all golf balls
before they hit the market has at least one manufacturer more than
a little teed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' said Wally Uihlein, president and chief
economic officer of Acushnet Co. of Fairhaven, Mass., who blasted
the US Golf Association's plan to change a 57-year-old test for
golf balls, just weeks after adopting a new measurement for the
so-called spring-like effect of clubs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Supported by a cash-rich balance sheet, the Executive
Committee of the USGA is abusing its power and engaging in action
which it has yet to prove is wanted or asked for by the 25 million
golfers and 10,000 member clubs they profess to represent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the USGA has battled with golf
manufacturers over concerns that technology is out-distancing human
skill as a key to success in the game. &UR;  &LR; The USGA sets national
rules for playing the game that govern professionals on the tour,
which are generally respected worldwide, even by casual players.
</P>
<P>
   The manfacturers assert the USGA is intent on stifling
improvements in the design and performance of the equipment, major
factors in driving new sales.
</P>
<P>
   Among the industry leaders, Acushnet _ including the
ball-manufacturer Titleist, the club manufacturer Cobra, and the
footware manufacturer FootJoy Worldwide _ had $911 million in sales
in 1997. But observers of the sporting goods industry say the
market for golf equipment is flat, with many manufacturers showing
large inventories, and at least one company, Callaway, of Carlsbad,
Calif., announcing layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, the USGA adopted a proposal to measure the
``spring-like effect'' of clubs over the near unanimous objection
of manufacturers, who spend millions of dollars every year for
research to develop new products and expand their markets.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA now wants to address the technology of balls, proposing
new tests last week to update the current ``overall distance
standard,'' and to substantially upgrade its ``initial velocity
test.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, testing of the distance standard would be brought
indoors and would measure the speed, launch angle, and spin of the
ball, as opposed to merely the distance. And the USGA would
increase the striking velocity from 143 feet per second to 180 feet
per second, to better replicate today's stronger players.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA is seeking comment on the proposed ball regulations
this winter, with an eye toward adopting new rules on balls in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Uihlein is concerned in part that the USGA adopted the new
regulations on clubs despite vehement, unified protests from the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of repeated requests to document where the game is
experiencing some technological Armageddon,'' he said, ``the USGA,
under the pretense of changes to its test procedures, continues to
march forward with plans to modify the Rules of Golf concerning
equipment without serious input from those affected.''

   BUS-CRASH-FOLLOW (Seattle) Police confirm the scenario: A .380
automatic was the murder/suicide weapon in the fatal bus crash in
Seattle last week. The suspect, Silas Cool walked up to the driver
and fired two shots. The first was the fatal shot, in the arm and
through the chest cavity. The second shot also was in the
chest.There are conflicting reports of whether he had any
conversation with the driver or just walked up and shot.Cool's own
wound went right through his temple, through the brain, and ``most
likely killed him instantly.'' Police yesterday searched his
apartment and found a collection of knives (switchblades, hunting,
carving, etc.) and two pellet guns, plus ``a lot of pornography.''

ARTISTIC LEGACY OF AIDS, ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By EDWARD LEWINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Dugdale is a photographer who can barely see. In
1993, diseases resulting from his infection by the AIDS virus took
most of his vision and hearing. He thought he had months to live,
but he's still here. That is why, Dugdale said, he is qualified to
talk about the importance of a new online gallery of works by
artists with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to say that having a lasting record of my work would
have been so important to me when I was suffering five years ago,''
said Dugdale, 38, whose work is also on display at the Wessel &AMP;
O'Connor Gallery in Chelsea through Jan. 3. ``I know what it would
have been like for me to exit with no record.''
</P>
<P>
   The online gallery, the Virtual Collection
(www.artistswithaids.org) is to have its premiere Tuesday, World
AIDS Day, with ceremonies in five museums nationwide, including the
Museum of Modern Art and the Los Angeles County Museum.
</P>
<P>
   It has some 3,200 images of objects made by some 150 artists who
are HIV-positive, are dying from AIDS or have died. For many of the
artists the Virtual Collection is a means to show their art to a
wider audience and to feel that it will live on after them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Virtual Collection is also meant to be a historical
record of the AIDS era. It was founded by the Estate Project for
Artists With AIDS, an 8-year-old program that helps HIV-positive
and AIDS-stricken artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an art catalog,'' said Randall Bourscheidt,
president of the Alliance for the Arts, the nonprofit arts advocacy
group in Manhattan that runs the Virtual Collection and the Estate
project. ``Our goal is to create something which is a powerful
testament to the effect of this epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Virtual Collection each artist gets his own page. To the
left is a 100- to 300-word biography of the artist. To the right
are small images of 20 or so examples of the artist's work. Each of
these images can be expanded by a double click of the mouse to
larger, high-resolution digital pictures. Each picture is
accompanied by detailed cataloging, including size, medium and even
a contact number for the artist or the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Users can put together pieces by different artists and save them
on their own private pages. This feature and the contact
information are intended to allow teachers, curators and collectors
to study objects in different combinations online and borrow or buy
the pieces themselves for exhibition in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real gallery doesn't exist,'' said Glenn Lowry, director
of the Museum of Modern Art. ``These works are spread out; this is
a way of bringing them together in a context.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of well-known artists on the Web site,
including Keith Haring, Robert Mapplethorpe, Bruce Cratsley and
David Wojnarowicz, but most of the names are obscure. The only
requirement for inclusion in the Virtual Collection is that the
artist be HIV positive or have AIDS and submit around 20 slides of
his work. If artists cannot make slides, the Estate Project will
help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether these are achieved works of art isn't for us to
judge,'' Bourscheidt said. ``The result we are striving for is to
preserve the historical context of the artists' community during
the AIDS crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Estate Project was founded in 1991 to address the fact that
artists of all stripes, including painters, sculptors, writers,
poets and choreographers were dying of AIDS and their works were
being sold off, given away, or even thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Estate Project raised money for groups
in the mid-'90s that were making slide archives of works by artists
with AIDS. Slides, however, are fragile and inaccessible, so in
1995 the Estate Project decided to gather the images together and
put them online.

   ``This gives incredible access to these works,'' said Barbara
Hunt, the director of Visual AIDS, an advocacy group in Manhattan
that was the largest single source of slides along with groups in
Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco. ``It brings together
archives from around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York the Virtual Collection is to be celebrated on
Tuesday at the Museum of Modern Art with a public demonstration of
the Web site at 10:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum has an exhibition of pieces by some artists
in the Virtual Collection and there is to be a public reception for
the artists at 6:30 Tuesday evening. And the Studio Museum in
Harlem will display on Tuesday only a computer with images by
African-American artists in the Virtual Collection.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how many artists have HIV and AIDS, but most
of the advocates for artists with AIDS say there are many thousands
of them. The director of the Estate Project and the Web site,
Patrick Moore, said it was likely that the Virtual Collection would
grow to more than 6,000 images in the next few years. It costs
around $150 to put one artist's works online, he said, and the
Estate Project plans to continue raising funds for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he hoped that the Virtual Collection would still be
up and running long after the artists and many of their works had
disappeared. ``The reality is that not of all these artworks will
survive,'' he said. ``All we can do is preserve their images
electronically.''

DEFECTIVE RIVETS MAY HAVE CAUSED TITANIC TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pieces of metal retrieved from the hulk of the Titanic on an
expedition last August have provided strong confirmation of a
recent theory about what really caused the ``unsinkable'' ship to
sink 86 years ago. In a word: rivets.
</P>
<P>
   The rivets used to hold together the massive steel plates of
Titanic's hull, it turns out, were made of improperly annealed
iron. As a result, defects in the metal itself made the rivets
weakest at just the place where their strength was most needed in
an impact: where the rounded heads connect to the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 rivets recovered from the wreck have now been
analyzed, and 14 of them ``have some kind of problem,'' according
to metallurgist Timothy Foecke of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. Foecke said that as
soon as the impact with the iceberg occurred, the heads simply
popped off many of the rivets, causing long, narrow seams to open
up in the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Microscopic analysis of rivets that were recovered and sliced
open show the reason starkly: Slag in the iron, a glassy material
that is strong but brittle, should account for 2 to 3 percent of
the material, but instead is 8 to 9 percent in the bad rivets.
Whereas the smaller amount actually adds strength, the larger
amount makes the iron too brittle and subject to breakage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of things,'' said Foecke, ``a little bit is a good
thing, but too much is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem rivets were not really anybody's fault,
explained William Garzke, a naval architect with Gibbs and Cox Inc.
of Virginia, who is in charge of analyzing the Titanic material.
The techniques used today to analyze the defects in the metal did
not exist back in 1910 when the ship was being built, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Titanic's hull was held together by 3 million rivets, Garzke
said. The failure of just a few dozen of them from the tremendous
force of the ship's impact with an iceberg may have caused
Titanic's sinking.
</P>
<P>
   With today's analytical methods, it is now clear that the larger
amount of slag in some rivets formed larger tubes or sheets inside
the iron, instead of the tiny filaments slag forms in smaller
quantities. These caused weak areas in the metal, and when the
rivets were flattened out to form the outside rivet head, the weak
areas ended up lined up with the hull plates, instead of running
along the length of the rivets. Like the grain in a piece of wood,
these defects make it easier for the metal to break in one
direction than another, and in this case it was the worst possible
direction, making it easy for the rivet heads to pop right off.
</P>
<P>
   Titanic's sister ship, the Olympic, was built in the same
shipyard at about the same time and was damaged by a collision in
1911. Photographs of its hull show many missing rivets and a gaping
opening between hull plates, adding further evidence to the
case &UR;  &LR; today that it was bad rivets that caused the large openings
in the hulls of both ships.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier theory that it was bad steel in the hull plates
themselves that caused the great ship's sinking does not stand up
under the new evidence, Foecke said. While some earlier tests had
suggested that the steel became as brittle as glass in the cold
water of the North Atlantic, more recent tests on a section of the
hull recovered from the wreck do not support that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found some values of the fracture resistance'' of steel
from Titanic's hull ``that are not terribly different from modern
steels,'' Foecke said. ``We feel this is enough to put to bed the
brittle steel theory.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rivets tell another story. The theory was first
suggested last year, based on an analysis of just two recovered
rivets, leaving open the possibility that these were simply an
anomaly. Now that 40 rivets have been analyzed, recovered from 11
different places on the ship, Foecke said, ``the rivet theory seems
to be holding up. There seems to be a fundamental problem with the
rivets.''
</P>
<P>
   Foecke presented his latest findings Monday at a meeting in
Boston of the Materials Research Society. The research on the
Titanic parts is continuing, Foecke and Garzke said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the surprising revelations to come from the recent
analysis of the wreck is that the amount of damage to the ship was
actually much less than people thought at the time. Contrary to a
longstanding claim that the ship had suffered a huge 300-foot-long
gash, it turns out that the total opening caused by the impact
amounted to only about 12.5 square feet, Garzke said. Most of this
was in the form of gaps less than an inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   If the Titanic's captain had known that, Garzke said, it is
quite possible that simple countermeasures, such as stuffing
clothing or mattresses into the narrow, leaking seams could have
slowed the inrushing water enough to keep the ship afloat until the
Carpathia arrived to rescue survivors, possibly saving all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Garzke said that during last August's expedition he was able to
see a section of this open seam firsthand for the first time. Most
of this crack is below the mud line, he said, but it is exposed in
at least one place.

THE ROMANCE IS BACK FOR TOM HANKS 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

 Includes a color slide of Tom Hanks with Meg Ryan in a scene from
``You've Got Mail.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He may be one of America's favorite romantic-comedy stars, but
Tom Hanks doesn't believe in destiny, love at first sight or
kindred spirits. Never did, he says.
 &HT;    ``Before I got married _ jeez, man, I just wanted to get laid,''
Hanks says playfully. ``If somebody said, `What were your dreams
and hopes while you were in high school?' I'd say, `To get laid at
some point in my life, to have sex with a woman.'
 &HT;    ``That was the main, single goal, and everything else was chaff
compared to that. And it took a while.''
 &HT;    Now, of course, Hanks is a top movie star, a two-time Oscar
winner, a $20 million man, one of America's favorite personalities.
 &HT;    ``Everything changed,'' he says, laughing. ``Now I just get laid
all the time!''
 &HT;    Hanks, still boyishly handsome at 42, finishes with an aw-shucks
grin. He's kidding, of course.
 &HT;    ``I'm sorry,'' he says. ``We can't talk about that. What about
my nice-guy image?''
 &HT;    That nice-guy image is a key asset of Hanks's latest film, the
romantic comedy ``You've Got Mail.'' Opening nationwide on Dec. 18,
``You've Got Mail'' reteams him with Meg Ryan, his co-star in ``Joe
Vs. the Volcano'' (1990) and ``Sleepless in Seattle'' (1993), as
well as with Nora Ephron, the writer/director of ``Sleepless.''
 &HT;    ``You've Got Mail,'' based on the 1940 James Stewart/Margaret
Sullavan charmer ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' casts Hanks as Joe
Fox, a chain-bookstore executive who is the obvious nemesis of
small, personal-touch bookshops and their owners, such as Kathleen
Kelly (Ryan). The two clash immediately _ not dreaming that they're
simultaneously falling in love online, via the anonymous circuitry
of the Internet.
 &HT;    ``This movie is absolutely rooted in who we are right now,'' the
always-affable Hanks says during a conversation at a Los Angeles
hotel. ``It's about the Wal-Martification of the world, about that
intangible quality human beings have to fall in love with somebody
they don't know
 &HT;    ``On top of that,'' he adds, ``it was Nora, who I know and who I
know will make a good movie. It ended up being with Meg, who always
gets a good game out of me one way or the other.''
 &HT;    In fact, it was Hanks who, after reading the script, called Ryan
and essentially said, ``We should do this together.''
 &HT;    ``Meg is very smart, doesn't lie and she doesn't acquiesce to
somebody's personality just to fold into a conversation,'' he says.
``Meg acts exactly who she is.
 &HT;    ``So without it being competitive in any way, shape or form, the
level of the game is constantly raised with Meg,'' Hanks says
enthusiastically. ``Meg scares you, in the way you want to be
scared by someone you're working with, yet she also intrigues you
the way you want to be intrigued by someone you're working with.''
 &HT;    Hanks is less Web-savvy than his character in the film. He's
simply too busy to spend much time online, he says.
 &HT;    ``All I really do is search for those nude pictures I did 20
years ago,'' he says. ``And, thank God, I have yet to find them!''
 &HT;    Currently, the actor juggles his work on his next film _ an
adaptation of Stephen King's novella ``The Green Mile'' _ and his
commitment to spending time with his wife, actress Rita Wilson, and
their children.
 &HT;    Right now, the movie is winning. Starring Hanks as a brutal
prison guard _ a role for which he has gained about 25 pounds _ the
film is behind schedule and gaining a reputation as what the
sinister Hollywood lexicon calls ``a troubled project.''
 &HT;    ``It is still going on,'' Hanks says. ``It's just one of those
movies that is taking this much time. Some movies you can just
crank out _ this isn't one of them.
 &HT;    ```Green Mile' is a death-row movie,'' he explains. ``We're on
death row for a long time, and you've got to have that look a
little different every time. It was never going to be easy to make,
and it's not _ that's just the way it is.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, much of Hollywood seems to agree that his previous
film, Stephen Spielberg's summer hit ``Saving Private Ryan,'' will
earn Hanks his third Best Actor Oscar.
 &HT;    The actor himself dismisses such speculation as premature.
 &HT;    ``Oh, are the nominations in already?'' he asks teasingly.
 &HT;    Still, he can't deny the power of Spielberg's World War II
drama. A flood of mail that he's received from veterans has proven
that point.
 &HT;    ``I'm not surprised,'' Hanks says. ``I was blown away by `Saving
Private Ryan,' just like everyone else was.
 &HT;    ``Look, `Private Ryan' was a movie unlike any other,'' he says.
``I don't think any movie like it has been made, and I don't think
any other movie has been embraced by the public the way `Private
Ryan' was.
 &HT;    ``And I'm not surprised at all that veterans are saying, `My
God, they actually made a movie about what it was like.'''
 &HT;    After ``Green Mile,'' Hanks will star in ``Castaway'' for his
``Forrest Gump'' (1994) director, Robert Zemeckis. The film's
unique schedule calls for shooting half the movie in early 1999,
taking a year's break for Hanks to shoot another movie and, under
careful medical supervision, to drop enough weight to give him the
emaciated physical appearance of a man marooned far from
civilization. Then everyone will regroup in 2000 and complete
``Castaway.''
 &HT;    ``It's a risk,'' he concedes. ``There's a lot of money at stake.
Someone could die. But they're trusting us to do it, so we're going
to try.''
 &HT;    Hanks has come a long way from his breakthrough _ but inane _
television sitcom ``Bosom Buddies'' (1980-82) and such early
features as ``Bachelor Party'' (1984), ``Dragnet'' (1987) and
``Turner and Hooch'' (1989). Few people, watching those efforts,
would have predicted that, a decade later, he'd be one of America's
most admired actors, winner of Best Actor Oscars for Jonathan
Demme's ``Philadelphia'' (1993) and for ``Forrest Gump.''
 &HT;    Part of his success, Hanks says, is as simple as growing older,
maturing as a person and gaining experience as an actor.
 &HT;    The rest, he adds, is pure luck _ that, and a willingness to
grab whatever opportunities were offered and make the most of them.
 &HT;    ``Look, I didn't have a lot of choices for the longest time,''
he says. ``I didn't have a real broad horizon as far as things
they'd consider me for. But as soon as they did, I leapt at the
opportunities to do different kinds of stuff.
 &HT;    ``When Jonathan offered me `Philadelphia,' I realized, `This is
a whole new gig.'''
 &HT;    Not that Hanks approached that role as a dying AIDS patient any
differently than he had his parts in ``Bachelor Party,'' ``Turner
and Hooch'' or even ``Bosom Buddies.''
 &HT;    ``My job was still the same _ hit the marks and tell the
truth,'' he says. ``But the nature of what it is was different.
 &HT;    ``Look, you're talking to the luckiest man in the world when it
comes down to having opportunities to go off and do different
brands of movies,'' he says. ``I think you have to put out a mix of
messages _ you have to be that repertory actor in the great
repertory company that's doing something very light and frothy one
night, and the next night is doing `Hamlet.'
 &HT;    ``That's pretty much what I've been going for all along.''

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He remembers sitting in the back row at a matinee. Unemployed,
angry and underfoot, he'd been banished from the house by his wife.
 &HT;    Naturally, Jeffrey Katzenberg went to the movies.
 &HT;    After all, he'd been a fixture at Walt Disney Pictures, head of
the animation division and the man behind such hits as ``Aladdin''
(1992) and ``The Lion King'' (1993) until only a few months before.
Movies were his life.
 &HT;    That had ended one August morning when his boss, Disney chairman
Michael Eisner, handed him a press release that was about to be
distributed. It reported that Katzenberg _ who initially thought it
hailed a promotion _ instead would be leaving the company.
 &HT;    Consumed with anger, Katzenberg launched several legal suits
against Disney and otherwise didn't work at all, running over in
his mind again and again the apparent ruin of his career.
 &HT;    Then William Shatner saved him.
 &HT;    ``It's so embarrassing, but Captain James T. Kirk and my rabbi
helped me get over my anger,'' Katzenberg says.
 &HT;    The film was ``Star Trek: Generations'' (1994), a natural choice
for Katzenberg, a ``Star Trek'' fan who'd help supervise the first
``Trek'' film in 1979 as a Paramount executive.
 &HT;    Katzenberg remembers the exact moment that turned things around
for him.
 &HT;    ``Kirk dies in `Generations,' and he lies in the arms of Picard
moaning, `What was it all for?''' Katzenberg recalls. ``Picard says
to him, `Captain, it's not the monuments that we build, nor the
legacies that we leave behind that matters. What matters is the
journey. And who, captain, has had a richer or fuller journey in
his life than you?''
 &HT;    At least one man in that dark theater sat up straight.
 &HT;    ``So Captain Kirk croaks,'' Katzenberg says. ``And a light bulb
goes off in my head. I'm going, `I get it! I get it!'''
 &HT;    What he got was that he couldn't be mad at Eisner or Disney
forever.
 &HT;    ``I said to myself in that theater, `Forget it. It doesn't
matter,''' he says. ```You can't take this with you. Live your life
and do good work. Oh, and have a good time.'''
 &HT;    Four years and change later, Katzenberg is having a good time.
As he sips a Diet Coke at 8 a.m. in a Chicago hotel room, he looks
happy, fit and anything but angry. Which comes easily to a man who,
as co-founder of the studio Dreamworks SKG, has a much-touted
animated film, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' opening on Dec. 18.
 &HT;    And to one who was up for a 5 a.m. workout at the hotel gym.
 &HT;    ``People always say to me, `Jeffrey, what is the secret of your
success?''' the 47-year-old, New York-born executive says. ``It's
very simple: I sleep five hours a day, which means I've got three
hours more on every normal human being.''
 &HT;    Those extra hours must have come in handy in making ``The Prince
of Egypt,'' a dazzling, epic retelling of the Moses story, complete
with the celebrity voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle
Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum, not to mention a
much-hyped duet between pop divas Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.
 &HT;    The early word is good, but Katzenberg admits to being nervous.
An animated, feature-length Biblical story is no sure thing by any
measure.
 &HT;    But when he and partners Steven Spielberg and David Geffen first
conceived Dreamworks SKG, Katzenberg says, the whole idea was to
try new things, and that included animation.
 &HT;    ``For 60 years, since Walt Disney made `Snow White' (1937),
animation has been mostly used to tell fairy tales,'' Katzenberg
says. ``I love the fairy tales and I loved making them. It didn't
make sense to me why we couldn't make completely different kinds of
stories.''
 &HT;    Katzenberg thought of an animated ``Raiders of the Lost Ark.''
An animated ``Terminator''-style science-fiction story. Even an
animated ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
 &HT;    It was Spielberg who suggested revisiting the Cecil B. DeMille
classic, ``The Ten Commandments'' (1956).
 &HT;    ``What I remembered the most about Moses is that he was this
innocent everyman,'' Katzenberg says. ``He was imperfect, flawed,
unsure of himself and reluctant to accept this extraordinary
mission. It's a story any of us can identify with, because we're
all flawed _ especially me. But we all wish that within us is the
ability to do something great.''
 &HT;    Katzenberg spent the next three years with 500 artists, learning
about ancient Egypt and Biblical stories. But the resulting film is
widely seen as a personal statement from him to Disney, a
validation of his contribution to the studio's immense success.
 &HT;    Katzenberg won't hear of it.
 &HT;    ``This film was not about proving myself,'' he says, visibly
annoyed. ``It drives me crazy when I hear it's just me behind this
movie _ it really offends me. This demeans a group of 500 artists
who sat in Glendale, Calif., and devoted themselves to every moment
of this movie.
 &HT;    ``I'm just the quarterback.''
 &HT;    But even the quarterback knows a smart play when he hears one.
 &HT;    Take the parting of the Red Sea. A 7-year-old son of one of his
animators told Katzenberg that when the water parts, ``It better
rock.''
 &HT;    ``That was my goal,'' he says. ``I would walk around going, `You
better make the chariot race and the Red Sea rock.'''
 &HT;    Dreamworks's 1998 has certainly rocked, with $100 million-plus
hits such as ``Deep Impact,'' ``Antz'' and, of course, ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' which to date has grossed more than $190 million
and is Oscar bound.
 &HT;    ``Antz'' sparked its own, appropriately small-scale controversy
when it was unexpectedly released early, ``scooping'' the similar
Disney-Pixar film, ``A Bug's Life.''
 &HT;    ```Antz' was finished early,'' Katzenberg says dismissively. ``I
showed it to Steven and David, who were blown away. Steven said,
`If you can get it out sooner, you should.'
 &HT;    ``The whole thing has been so autopsied by the press _ who did
what to whom? None of it is true. Our movie was just ready first.''
 &HT;    He swears that he doesn't carry any particular grudge against
Disney.
 &HT;    ``I have no rear-view mirror in my life,'' he says. ``I don't
look back. I'm too excited about what's in front of me, and I'm
driving too fast. If I took my eye off of what's in front of me, I
would crash.''
 &HT;    His troubles began in 1994 when Frank Wells, Eisner's No. 2 man,
died tragically in a helicopter crash. Katzenberg expected to
inherit the job. After all, his animation unit had revived the
studio and earned it billions of dollars.
 &HT;    Eisner didn't agree, which led to Katzenberg's departure and a
lawsuit which was subsequently settled out of court.
 &HT;    ``I loved my years at Disney,'' Katzenberg says. ``I loved
working for Michael. I really, genuinely don't have any anger or
hostility or animosity or anything. I let go of it all a long time
ago.
 &HT;    ``I've been very lucky,'' he adds. ``I've had some great mentors
in my career. People took me under their wings _ they trained me,
they taught me.''
 &HT;    Spielberg and Geffen both included.
 &HT;    ``Let's be clear,'' Katzenberg says. ``This is not an equal
partnership. These two guys are trillionares, and much more
accomplished, much more successful and much smarter than I am.
 &HT;    ``They're like two older brothers who are taking care of me,
helping me and teaching me.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, all three are doing their best to make film history.
 &HT;    ``We're having fun,'' Katzenberg says. ``The spirit of
Dreamworks is, `Let's do something better, bigger, different.'
That's all it is for us.
 &HT;    ``I want the adventure,'' he adds. ``Of course, along the way
there are some misadventures. That's just part of it. But that's
the pioneer, take-a-risk spirit.''
 &HT;    Capt. Kirk would understand.

 Includes a color slide of Burt Reynolds in a scene from ``Hard
Time.'' 
 By JEAN OPPENHEIMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There was a time in the early 1990s when Burt Reynolds seemed to
be single-handedly keeping the tabloid press in business.
 &HT;    The man who had reigned as Hollywood's No. 1 box-office star
from 1978 to 1982 found his marital and financial woes played out
in the headlines and on tabloid television. There were even rumors
that he was dying.
 &HT;    For a while, Reynolds fought back as best he could. Today,
however, he manages to laugh at it all _ fortified as he is by a
renewed career including an Oscar nomination for ``Boogie Nights''
(1997), several upcoming movies and a three-picture
acting/directing deal with TNT.
 &HT;    The actor recently wrapped Disney's ``Mystery Alaska,'' and on
Dec. 13 will be seen in the first of his three TNT productions,
``Hard Time.'' He plays a veteran police officer who is framed for
murder and sent to prison. Two follow-up films _ one due in
February, the other later next year _ will follow the character as
he is released from prison and sets out to clear his name.
 &HT;    It's a part he can relate to, a character who's been up, been
down and knows about coming back for more.
 &HT;    ``This guy's a survivor,'' Reynolds says.
 &HT;    Not that the actor will admit to being in the middle of a
comeback.
 &HT;    ``I'm not coming back,'' he insists. ``I have been sitting on
the bench, just waiting for them to put me back in the game. Nobody
ever carried me out of the stadium. I was taken out of the game,
but not out of the stadium.''
 &HT;    Sports metaphors come naturally to Reynolds, a former athlete.
In fact, during his high-school and college days, he'd planned to
be a professional football player. But a car accident during his
sophomore year at Florida State University injured his knee, ending
any hopes of a professional career.
 &HT;    Having noticed a lot of pretty girls hanging around the theater
department, he recalls, he limped across campus to investigate. But
it wasn't until he transferred to a small junior college that he
really got serious about acting, thanks to a literature professor
named Watson Duncan.
 &HT;    ``Like all athletes, I sat in the back row of class,'' Reynolds
recalls. ``But he was a brilliant teacher, and slowly I moved down
to the front row. One day he said to me _ I didn't even know he
knew my name _ `You'll be in the play.'
 &HT;    ``I said, `I won't be in any play.'
 &HT;    ``And he said, `Yes, you will. You are going to be an actor.'
 &HT;    ``I said, `You're out of your mind.'
 &HT;    ``And he said, `The reading is at 3.'''
 &HT;    Reynolds got the part, to his own surprise.
 &HT;    ``I have no idea what he saw in me,'' he says with a shrug.
``The first time I got on stage in front of an audience, though, I
felt like I was on the field. I wasn't nervous _ I thought, `I can
play. I'm home.'''
 &HT;    That summer Reynolds was accepted into an apprentice program at
a summer-stock theater in Hyde Park, N.Y., which featured a rising
young actress named Joanne Woodward.
 &HT;    As an apprentice, Reynolds was largely relegated to painting
flats and sweeping floors, but one day Woodward called him over.
Back then Reynolds still went by his nickname, ``Buddy.''
 &HT;    ``She said, `Buddy, you're from the South, aren't you?'''
Reynolds says, slipping into Woodward's languorous Southern accent.
```Yes, ma'am,' I replied.
 &HT;    ```Are you an actor?' she said.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Well, I'm an apprentice.'
 &HT;    ``And she said, `I bet you can act. The next play is `Tea and
Sympathy,' and you'd be wonderful as the athlete.'''
 &HT;    Reynolds, who had never heard of the play, raced off to read it.
The following day Woodward took him to see the director.
 &HT;    ``Buddy is going to read for the part of Al,'' she announced.
 &HT;    The director tried to explain that the role already had been
cast, but Woodward remained steadfast.
 &HT;    ``Let Buddy play the part,'' she said sweetly. ``And pay him.''
 &HT;    Reynolds got the role, his first paycheck and excellent reviews.
 &HT;    Woodward's largesse didn't stop there. She persuaded her agent
to see the play. He signed Reynolds, and the actor _ veteran of
only one play _ was headed for New York, where he got the first
role he tried out for, a part in the road company of ``Mr.
Roberts.''
 &HT;    ``I thought, `This acting thing is good,''' Reynolds recalls,
laughing.
 &HT;    It was the Golden Age of Television, and Reynolds began doing
live television, aided by a friendship with the established actor
Rip Torn. Whenever Torn was doing a show and the producers needed
an actor they could rough up _ toss down a stairway, say, or set on
fire _ Torn would suggest his pal, Burt Reynolds.
 &HT;    ``This was live TV, so you couldn't use a stunt man,'' Reynolds
says. ``Now, where are you going to get a guy you can set on fire?
There aren't a lot of actors who will do that. But I said, `Hey,
that's great. How much money do I get?'''
 &HT;    After a couple of years Reynolds headed to Hollywood, where he
guest-starred on several television series and appeared in a couple
of forgettable films.
 &HT;    The movie that finally made people sit up and take notice was
``Deliverance'' (1972), the harrowing tale of four men on a
canoeing trip down a raging Appalachian river. The actors did all
their own stunt work, including crashing their canoes into rocks
and being swept down dangerous rapids.
 &HT;    ``You couldn't get four actors to do that today,'' Reynolds
says. ``Nobody's that crazy.''
 &HT;    Reynolds was widely touted for an Oscar nomination, but
``Deliverance'' was released only a month after Reynolds's
controversial nude centerfold in Cosmopolitan magazine. While it
may have cost him a shot at the gold statuette, the Cosmo
photographs made him a major sex symbol.
 &HT;    A succession of good-old-boy action films followed, including
the wildly popular ``Smokey and the Bandit'' (1977). But despite
his box-office pull, Reynolds never got the kind of roles that
would help him fulfil the promise of ``Deliverance.''
 &HT;    His most substantive role during those years was an atypical one
in ``Starting Over'' (1979), a story of a man recovering from a
messy divorce. The film was directed by the late Alan Pakula.
 &HT;    ``Everybody told him I shouldn't get the role,'' Reynolds says.
```Burt can't play that part. Nobody will ever believe he's a shy
person who is lost in a singles bar.'
 &HT;    ``But I knew that I was playing a guy who was just acting
cocky,'' he says. ``The guy in ``Starting Over' was closer to me
than anything I have ever played in my life. Pakula knew that.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Reynolds admits, he made a lot of movies he
shouldn't have made and passed on a lot of pictures he should have
made. But he refuses to take time for regrets.
 &HT;    ``That took place in the second round,'' he says. ``This is a
12-round fight, and I'm in the 11th round. You have to forget them
or you won't do well. And you have to make other people forget
them, too.
 &HT;    ``This is a business that is based totally on rejection, and if
you take it personally you will die,'' he says, shaking his head.
 &HT;    When his career faltered, he recalls, a lot of friends and
associates vanished. But he found solace in his work itself.
 &HT;    ``The ship doesn't sink to the bottom when everybody leaps
off,'' he says. ``It keeps going _ thupp, thupp, thupp.
 &HT;    ``If somebody said to me, `You can't act, you can't direct, you
can't produce,' what would I be? Well, I just couldn't do anything
else.''

 Includes a color slide of David Spade in a scene from ``Just Shoot
Me.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mother knows best.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, comedian David Spade appeared on Howard
Stern's no-holds-barred radio show and let loose with a scathing
barb about JonBenet Ramsey, the murdered child beauty queen.
Minutes after the broadcast, Spade's mom was on the phone,
reprimanding him for his tastelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a terrible thing to say,'' she scolded him. ``I hated
myself for laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   With those five words, she unintentionally provided a perfect
encapsulation of her son's comic style.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing at Spade's vitriolic antics is like slowing to check
out a roadside car wreck. You know you shouldn't, but it's
virtually impossible to avert your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Week after week, as ``Just Shoot Me's'' acerbic office lackey,
Dennis Finch, Spade shakes up the traditional conservatism of
prime-time sitcoms. His noxious territory has long been mined
overseas by Brits such as John Cleese in ``Fawlty Towers'' and
Joanna Lumley in ``Absolutely Fabulous,'' but in America it was
previously limited to safer zones such as late night _ ``Saturday
Night Live'' _ and cable _ ``Larry Sanders'' and ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Finch, for example, could get away with responding to a
co-worker's adoption of a kitten with the catty comment, ``Poor
little tabby, moments away from a humane death,'' or rattle off
every slang term he can think of for women's breasts and then tell
an insulted Laura San Giacomo, ``I do bottoms, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Spade's envelope-pushing depiction of Finch is the latest result
of 10 years of methodical career planning. Unlike so many fellow
``Saturday Night Live'' alumni who tried to rise too high too fast,
the comedian has opted for a steady series of base hits instead of
one grand-slam home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' he says, nodding. ``I think it's the best way
to keep your sanity. You have to avoid that sudden, white-heat
attention, where there's nowhere to go afterward. Eventually it
fades, and you're almost in a worse spot, because it's like having
it all and then having it all go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather just keep making money and keep being funny, and
pretty soon a few years have gone by and you haven't disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanning Spade's early credits, one line that jumps out is a
1989 appearance on ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Spade says. ``Hey, why don't you hand me some Wite
Out and we can take care of that right now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he says, ``I love it when people say things like,
`I can't believe you were on `Baywatch' or `I can't believe George
Clooney was on `The Facts of Life.' I can. Because you get out here
and you're nobody. You're not going to be offered anything good, no
matter how good you are. And, of course, you'll do anything to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a bad guy on `Baywatch.''' he recalls. ``That was
before I had a persona of my own, something that people could
relate to me. I was just another dipsh-t trying to find an angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first three years on `SNL' I couldn't find it
either,'' he adds. ``I didn't do much heavy character work, and any
that I did, Dana Carvey could do better. That's what kept me back.
I watched all the guys I started with _ Chris Farley, Chris Rock,
Rob Schneider _ all kind of pass me. I was the last one to do any
real damage out there. It was definitely frustrating and hard to
keep my head together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I did `Hollywood Minute,' and the boss said, `That's you.
Why don't you keep writing stuff like that?' And I was loving it,
because I was getting a persona.''
</P>
<P>
   Spade quickly parlayed his ``Hollywood Minute'' bitchiness into
several of ``SNL's'' most popular characters, including the
obnoxious flight attendant from Totally Bastard Airlines who
dismisses each departing passenger with a condescending
``buh-bye,'' and Dick Clark's office receptionist who screens even
the most famous callers with a patronizing, ``And you are ... ?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, tiring of ``SNL's'' overheated competitiveness _ an
atmosphere he says ages performers ``in dog years'' _ Spade traded
up to the big screen, playing a snide Stanley to pal Chris Farley's
jolly Oliver in the back-to-back hits ``Tommy Boy'' (1995) and
``Black Sheep'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after coming within inches of a co-starring role
on the short-lived Tea Leoni sitcom ``The Naked Truth,'' Spade
hesitantly accepted producer Rod Grey's invitation to join the
``Just Shoot Me'' ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was already a show without me,'' Spade says. ``Rod Grey
showed me a tape and said, `Do you think you could fit into this
thing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to play another assistant,'' he recalls,
``since I'd already done that like 10 times. I didn't want all the
stories to revolve around me being the secretary. Also, they wanted
him to be kind of gay, and that's really the only thing I can't do
_ I can't play it fruity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was no one like me on the show,'' the comedian says,
``so I thought it might be a good mix. All I asked is that they
give me some kind of vague office-manager role so that I'd have a
reason to stand outside Jack's (George Segal) office and observe
everything that's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Finch may be best known for his waspish ways, but he's more than
just a smarmy smart aleck. Scratch the surface of Finch's slick,
slacker veneer and you find the quintessential little boy lost, a
guy whose desperation to be part of the in crowd is constantly
thwarted by his own nerdiness.
</P>
<P>
   It's a side of Finch that closely parallels Spade's own
less-than-idyllic youth in the Phoenix suburb of Casa Grande, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it seems like a blip on the radar,'' he says, ``but back
then it was a rough ride. It was fun being a kid, but it was also a
time of living in fear. I remember being beaten up a lot. I was a
bit of a brainiac, really good in math and reading, because I
really didn't want to have to do anything outside of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Finch recently explained to his office mates, ``I have an
acute sense of when someone is threatening me. I get it from my
mother, along with my fear of owls.''

ZIMBABWE SAYS IT OWNS 841 BIG, MOSTLY WHITE, FARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Commercial farmers in Zimbabwe,
under a constant threat of having their land seized, have been
thrown into confusion again by notices in which the government says
it owns 841 of their farms.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe's government is under pressure to show
progress on improving the distribution of farmland, which is mostly
in whites' hands, as it faces strikes and riots over rising food
and gasoline prices and the involvement of 6,000 Zimbabwean troops
in the war in nearby Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The notices have added to a sense of crisis in Zimbabwe, where
unions have shut down the country twice in the last two weeks. The
currency, the Zimbabwe dollar, has fallen to less than 3 U.S. cents
from 12 cents in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the International Monetary Fund said it was suspending
$55 million in aid because the farm seizures violated agreements
between the fund and the government.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers say they see an even greater threat in the hundreds
of squatters who are forcing their way onto many farms. In contrast
to groups that invaded a few farms in June but stayed on distant
corners and were careful about the property, many in the new wave
are armed and led by angry veterans of the 1970s liberation war.
</P>
<P>
   Some are trampling crops and threatening farmers and their
workers. The police have generally refused to stop or evict them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the notices were mailed two weeks ago Mugabe and the lands
and agriculture minister, Kumbirai Kangai, have begun long trips
abroad. That leaves junior officials to fumble to explain the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the notices, the farms, one-fourth of the
export-producing farmland, are government property. The notices do
not specify when the owners have to leave, whether they will be
paid or what will happen to the tens of thousands of workers who
live there.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch that may mean no farms will be taken. The
government has 60 days to have a court confirm each notice. Local
journalists say that is administratively impossible. So there is
some suspicion that Mugabe only wants to be able to tell his
party's annual congress next month that he has seized vast tracts
for the poor, a program that he has been promising since
independence in 1980. Then in January the lands would revert to the
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Whites, fewer than 2 percent of the population, own 70 percent
of the land. Millions of rural blacks are crowded onto ``communal
areas'' of stony depleted soil.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the government identified 1,503 farms that it intended
to seize. An outcry ensued, and the government was accused of
eyeing the best sites not for the poor but for wealthy party
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures were delayed. About 500 farms were removed from the
list when their owners showed that they did not meet the legal
conditions for seizure. An additional 120 were offered for sale,
and at a conference in September with donor nations the government
agreed to limit its interest to those.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the government lacks the money to buy the farms or
resettle peasant farmers on them. The 841 are in addition to those.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many people, even in his own party, have called in the last year
for Mugabe's resignation. The Congress of Trade Unions has held
general strikes each Wednesday for two weeks, demanding wage
increases, price cuts, the return of money stolen from the
government, a new constitution and an end to intervention in Congo
without Parliament's consent.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Congo is estimated to cost Zimbabwe $1 million a day.
It is widely assumed that Zimbabwean troops, who kept the Congo
capital, Kinshasa, from falling to the rebels, were sent to protect
mining concessions and lucrative contracts awarded to Zimbabwean
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The government is accused of lying about how many men have been
killed or captured. An independent newspaper reported last week
that 1,500 military police officers were being sent to Congo to
prevent a troop mutiny.

GOVERMENT ORDERS HOSPITALS TO ABIDE BY EMERGENCY CARE LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yielding to a stream of complaints from patients
who say they were illegally denied emergency care, the Clinton
administration told hospitals Monday that they must examine and
stabilize patients without any delays to ask about insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 law prohibits hospitals from rejecting or ``dumping''
patients who request care in emergency rooms. But consumer
advocates say the law was not aggressively enforced until two years
ago, after Congress provided more money to the Department of Health
and Human Services and the Justice Department to investigate
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the government has obtained settlements
in 67 dumping cases and has collected $2.3 million in penalties _
more than in the previous 10 years combined.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a West Virginia doctor was fined $100,000 for
rejecting two patients who had been severely injured in an auto
accident. The government says the patients were transferred in
unstable condition to another hospital, traveling 80 miles in an
ambulance on winding mountain roads in poor weather. One patient
died.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the new policy statement, June Gibbs Brown,
inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services,
said that hospitals must provide emergency care to all patients who
need it and may not delay services while they seek approval from a
health maintenance organization or other insurer.
</P>
<P>
   No HMO contract ``can excuse a hospital from providing needed
emergency medical screening and stabilizing care,'' even if the
contract requires the patient or the hospital to get prior
authorization, Ms. Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy statement, reported by USA Today, will be issued by
the government as a special advisory bulletin. The public will have
30 days to comment on it before it becomes final.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and hospitals had asked the government to clarify its
interpretation of the 1986 law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and
Labor Act. Under the law, if a person seeks care at an emergency
room, the hospital must provide ``an appropriate medical screening
examination'' and ``such treatment as may be required to stabilize
the medical condition'' of patient.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general receives 200 complaints a year from
patients who say they have been denied emergency care.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said her investigations of complaints showed that
``managed care patients are more likely to be victims of dumping
than other patients.'' HMOs challenge this contention, and the
government is not issuing detailed data to show the number of
complaints from patients with different types of insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, a trade group for HMOs, said she had no reason to
believe that HMO patients were more likely to be denied treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen no data to support that statement,'' Ms. Ignagni
said. ``If the inspector general has such statistics, we would
certainly like to see them and will work with the administration to
address any problems that may exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Ignagni said: ``If people feel they need to go to
an emergency room, they should go. They will be covered. They won't
be denied coverage if they believe that they have an emergency.
That's part of our code of conduct, endorsed by 1,000 health
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many patients, doctors and hospitals have
become embroiled in disputes with HMOs over payment for emergency
room services.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, a consumer organization, said: ``There has been a
dangerous lack of enforcement of the anti-dumping law. One of every
10 hospitals in the United States has been caught violating the law
at least once. We believe the number of violators is much larger.
Until two years ago, few of the hospitals that violated the law
were fined.''
</P>
<P>
   In its policy statement, the government suggests ``best
practices'' that hospitals should follow to avoid violating the
law. These recommendations are not legally binding. But if
followed, they would profoundly alter current practice. For they
say that a hospital should not even ask a patient or an HMO about
insurance coverage or financial liability until the patient's
condition has been evaluated and stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1986 law, a hospital stabilizes a patient's condition
by providing whatever treatment is needed to assure that there will
be ``no material deterioration'' of the patient's condition when
the person is discharged or transferred from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Emergency Physicians, which represents
nearly 20,000 doctors, applauded the efforts of the Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guidelines will be helpful to patients, doctors and
nurses,'' said Dr. Charlotte S. Yeh, chairwoman of the college's
government affairs committee. ``Many HMOs want hospitals or
emergency room employees to contact them before we provide
screening and stabilization services _ before we even determine the
full scope of a patient's problems. They give us a hard time if we
don't ask for prior authorization, and HMOs sometimes deny payment
after the fact, saying the situation was not a true emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As emergency department personnel, we feel obligated to
examine and stabilize patients regardless of their ability to pay.
That's what the law says. Morally and ethically, we believe that's
the right thing to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In May, President Clinton reprimanded Ravenswood Hospital in
Chicago, saying it had allowed a 15-year-old boy to die of gunshot
wounds outside its doors. ``No one should be left untreated just
footsteps from a hospital entrance,'' Clinton said then, and he
vowed to prevent any recurrence of ``this inexplicable tragedy.''

US, EUROPEANS PLEDGE INCREASE IN PALESTINIAN AID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Monday offered to increase aid to
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fivefold next year, to $500
million, while European donors pledged billions more. The total of
more than $3 billion exceeds the goal set by the Clinton
administration for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the end of Monday's donor meeting, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright cautioned that the sum was not exact,
``but it appears that delegations pledged more than $3 billion
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The money, first promised by Clinton during negotiations in
October over the Wye Memorandum, is to improve education, modernize
the Palestinian legal system and build projects to create jobs on
the West Bank and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``No peace stands a chance of lasting if it does not deliver
real results to ordinary people,'' Clinton said at the opening of
the hastily-arranged, day-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton called on other countries to donate generously to the
Palestinians, Washington privately implored Arafat to tone down his
remarks about Israel, according to interest groups that follow the
Mideast. Specifically, they said, Clinton aides urged Arafat to
stop making declarations that he will create an independent state
next year.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's conference with 50 European and Asian donors and
international lending groups, Arafat charged that Israel had
intentionally hurt the Palestinian economy. He stopped short of
repeating comments he had made on Sunday about creating an
independent state. But in a message delivered at the United Nations
to the annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian
People, Arafat asked for support ``to make a reality of the
declaration of independence and to implement it on the blessed soil
of Palestine during the coming year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pledge to increase aid must be approved by Congress,
and the plan will face pointed opposition if Arafat continues to
call for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who supports
the peace process, said that members of Congress are likely to
support more aid to the Palestinians ``but it won't be
unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's comment about statehood ``hurt the Palestinians' cause
in Congress because it goes against the mood and the substance of
the Wye agreements, which prohibit either side from taking
unilateral steps,'' Lieberman said in an interview last night.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kyle, an Arizona Republican who serves on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, has already threatened to cut off aid for
Palestinians if Arafat angers Benjamin Netanyahu's government in
Israel or complains about a plan to relocate the US embassy in
Israel to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   With members of Congress still scrambling for committee
assignments, it is too early to know who will control foreign aid
appropriations next year. But at issue is role that hardliners on
Capitol Hill will play in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Chairman Arafat talks prematurely about statehood,
it erodes support in the Jewish communty for his cause,'' said
Jason Isaacson, Washington representative for the American Jewish
Committee, an influential Jewish group. ``While there is widespread
support for the peace process in the Jewish community, there is
little if any support for premature declarations of sovereignty
that would undercut the process.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the American-Israel Public Affairs
Committee, one of the most important Jewish groups in Washington,
added that it is likely to support the increased aid providing it
goes to private Palestinian groups, not the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer to increase aid from $100 million to $500
million came as the White House finished plans for a three-day,
mid-December visit to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza _ the first
trip to Palestinian-controlled areas by an American president.
Clinton will address the Palestinian National Council, which is
scheduled to amend its charter and drop controversial wording
calling for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's visit stirred controversy because of his remarks about
statehood and because of a London Times report that the Palestinian
Authority had used $20 million in housing aid from European
governments to construct luxury apartments for Arafat's
``acolytes'' instead of for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made no references to the allegations, saying simply that
Palestinians had suffered from ``momentous constraints'' during
five years of economic decline in the West Bank and Gaza. Monday
afternoon, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek said that
Israel's restrictions on people and goods leaving the West Bank and
Gaza since 1993 had caused a loss of more than $3 billion to the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's conference, the European Union pledged about
$480 million over the next five years and Japan promised $200
million as several countries responded at short notice to Clinton's
appeal to help keep the fragile peace process on track. US
officials said that Norway promised $170 million, Saudi Arabia $100
million, Kuwait $80 million and Canada $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges of financial support do not always materialize. Five
years ago, Washington promised the Palestinians $100 million a
year, but it has actually sent about $75 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Albright added that the increased aid to the Palestinians marks
``the beginning of a process which will turn words on paper into
contracts, construction sites and commerce in the West Bank and
Gaza and throughout the Middle East.. the dividents of peace will
become increasingly tangible and enduring in the lives of the
Palestinian people.''

JUSTICES WARY OF ENTERING CENSUS DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the Supreme Court expressed considerable
doubt Monday about whether they should resolve the legal and
constitutional issues surrounding the Clinton administration's plan
to use statistical sampling to make the 2000 census more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The justices seemed to agree with the administration's arguments
that the House of Representatives, which had already lost a
legislative round with President Clinton over sampling, should not
drag the courts into a highly charged political feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like injecting us into a battle between the two
political branches,'' Justice Antonin Scalia told a lawyer
representing the House of Representatives, which sued the
administration this year over the sampling plan. The House won its
case before a special three-judge U.S. District Court here, as did
a group of 16 private plaintiffs, organized by a conservative
public interest law firm, who brought a similar suit before a
three-judge panel in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing its appeal from both rulings before the Supreme Court
Monday, the administration, represented by Solicitor General Seth
Waxman, maintained that neither case should have been allowed to
proceed in the lower courts because the plaintiffs lacked the kind
of concrete injury necessary to have standing to bring a case in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   With the emphasis on jurisdictional issues, very little time was
spent during the 90-minute argument on the intricate legal
framework on which the sampling plan foundered in the lower courts.
Both courts interpreted the opaque provisions of the Census Act to
prohibit the use of sampling for the purpose of allocating
congressional seats among the 50 states. Both courts then found it
unnecessary to address whether the constitutional mandate of an
``actual enumeration'' rules out statistical sampling.
</P>
<P>
   While the courtroom was crowded with members of Congress and
with representatives of groups with a stake in this dispute, there
was only glancing acknowledgment of just what those stakes might be
or of the raw politics at the heart of the matter. Sampling, a form
of statistical estimation, is aimed at correcting an anticipated
undercount of millions of people that disproportionately misses
members of minority groups and poor people living in cities.
</P>
<P>
   These areas tend to be Democratic strongholds _ the three worst
undercounts in 1990 were in congressional districts in the New York
City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, according to
one study _ and Democrats are confident they will gain in political
power if the missing millions are counted. Republicans are
determined not to let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   An exchange between Justice John Paul Stevens and Maureen
Mahoney, representing the House of Representatives, demonstrated
the depth of the Republicans' commitment to the traditional
headcount. What should a census taker be allowed to do, Stevens
asked, when trying to count people in an apartment complex with a
large population of illegal aliens? Suppose an apartment appeared
occupied, but no one answered the door and the neighbors refused to
reveal anything. Would the census taker have any options?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your honor, they can't guess,'' Ms. Mahoney replied.
</P>
<P>
   So the census taker should put down ``zero'' even if an
apartment was evidently occupied? Stevens asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the lawyer replied, because the Constitution requires an
``objective standard,'' not an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``So an objective standard requires `zero'?'' Stevens persisted,
as Justice Stephen Breyer broke in to ask: ``Even if the lights go
on and off in the evening?''
</P>
<P>
   The argument then veered back to whether the House should have
been allowed to bring its suit in the first place. The Republican
leadership went to court to stop sampling after failing last year
to override Clinton's veto of a bill that would have barred ``any
statistical adjustment'' of the population numbers used for
apportioning House seats. Waxman said the House should not be
permitted to accomplish through litigation what it could not
achieve by legislation, a point with which justices across the
ideological spectrum appeared inclined to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a stopping point,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
told Ms. Mahoney. Ginsburg went on to characterize the House's
position as: ``Gee, this is really important, and we want you to
resolve this, court.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia provided the day's most vivid commentary. ``There are 900
ways the House can stymie the president if it has the political
will to do it,'' he said, suggesting as one clearly fanciful option
a refusal to appropriate money for the White House staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your honor, this has become an intractable controversy,'' Ms.
Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say `intractable,' you mean the president has won,
and the House doesn't have the political will to do anything about
it,'' Scalia replied. ``It's a political controversy, and we don't
get into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Various justices also expressed doubt, although less
definitively, about the standing of the private plaintiffs. The 16
individuals, organized by the Southeastern Legal Foundation, of
Atlanta, live in various states, including Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, that the plaintiffs assert are
likely to lose congressional seats under an adjusted census that
they would keep under a traditional headcount. The administration's
position is that the prediction is premature and too speculative a
basis for standing.
</P>
<P>
   The justices indicated discomfort with the lack of agreement on
basic facts; since the lower courts decided the two lawsuits on
summary judgment, without a trial, the two sides' factual
assertions were never tested. The court appeared uncertain on how
to proceed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the justices were to reverse the lower courts by finding that
summary judgment was inappropriate, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
said, ``we'd have no definitive resolution before June,'' by which
time the court's current term is expected to end. In urging the
court several months ago to accept these cases on an expedited
basis _ a request the court accommodated with unusual speed _ both
sides asserted that the dispute needed to be resolved by March in
order to keep the census on schedule. In the budget agreement last
month, Congress agreed to pay for census preparations only until
June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carvin, representing the private plaintiffs, tried
without much success to focus the court's attention on the merits
of his case. ``The key point is that there will be no 100 percent
headcount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has there ever been a 100 percent headcount?'' Ginsburg asked.
``Haven't there always been people missed?''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Supreme Court issues a definitive constitutional
ruling, which does not appear probable, any ruling is likely to
leave some important loose ends, of which an appropriations battle
is only one. The only question actually before the court is whether
sampling can be used for apportionment _ the allocation of
congressional delegations among the states, which is the only
function the Constitution assigns to the census.
</P>
<P>
   But census figures are also used for districting within states,
as well as for determining federal aid under a variety of programs.
The administration takes the view that a statistical adjustment for
those purposes could proceed _ and under one reading of the Census
Act would, in fact, be required _ even if the court ruled it out
for apportionment purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Department of Commerce vs. House of
Representatives, No. 98-404, and Clinton vs. Glavin, No. 98-564.

S. AFRICA HALTS PLAN TO TREAT HIV-INFECTED MOTHERS  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Acting on new evidence that a short course of the drug AZT
sharply lowers an infected mother's risk of transmitting the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to her unborn child, Dr. Glenda Gray
and her colleagues in Johannesburg, South Africa, have been lining
up women eager to receive the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of about $50 per treated woman, Gray figured, the drug
could cut mother-to-child HIV transmission by half _ a payoff
comparable to proven public health measures such as measles
vaccination or prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   But in October Gray picked up the newspaper and read that South
Africa's health minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, had canceled the
pilot project, which was to test the feasibility of delivering AZT
to 2,500 HIV-infected pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said she doesn't understand. ``It doesn't make sense on a
human rights level, on an economic level, or on a moral level,''
she said in a telephone interview. ``I'm still not sure why the
government decided not to go ahead with this intervention in the
face of an epidemic that is unchecked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was primarily for cost reasons,'' Dr. Glaudine Mtshali, a
top aide to Zuma, said Monday in between appearances to mark World
AIDS Day, which is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an easy decision because every single life is
important,'' Mtshali said. The government wants to spend the money
instead on safer-sex education and condom distribution, she added,
``so we don't have to be faced with this very difficult decision
about a baby due to be born with positive HIV status.''
</P>
<P>
   Mtshali said the government would revisit the decision when
``more information becomes available that is pertinent to the South
African context.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's decision threatens to overshadow other recent
steps taken by the government to mobilize the nation against what
many believe is the world's most explosive AIDS epidemic. ``We face
the danger that half of our youth will not reach adulthood,''
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said in a dramatic October 9 broadcast
address to the nation on AIDS, the first by a leading political
figure. ``Our dreams as a people will be shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, who is viewed as President Nelson Mandela's probable
successor, appealed to South Africans to change ``the way we live
and how we love'' and pledged ``to continue our search for a
medical solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki's ``declaration of a Partnership Against AIDS'' was
soon followed by what some call ``Zuma's bombshell'' about the AZT
program. Morna Cornell of the AIDS Consortium, an alliance of 90
South African AIDS groups, said the atmosphere at a recent workshop
of 50 HIV-infected pregnant women was one of ``the most appalling
disbelief and loss of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To learn you're HIV-positive and then to learn that something
can be done to give you a 50 percent better chance you won't
transmit it to your child _ and then to be told by the government
that it is not affordable _ it is just sickening, quite frankly,''
Cornell said. ``And we've just committed ourselves to a $5.3
billion arms purchase. What does that say about the values of the
new South Africa?''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is HIV spreading more rapidly than in sub-Saharan
Africa, and more than half the region's new infections are
occurring in South Africa, according to a report issued Monday by
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, one pregnant South African woman in every seven is
already infected with HIV, according to a 1997 survey. In the
coastal province of Kwazulu-Natal, the proportion is close to one
in three.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's decision to cancel the AZT pilot project, at
least for now, represents a clash between ``soft'' public health
interventions that promise future payoffs for entire populations
and a ``hard'' technology that can rescue individual infants from
certain death in the here-and-now.
</P>
<P>
   Public health authorities around the globe are watching the
South African debate closely as a harbinger of how the most
AIDS-beleaguered nations may deal with the first medical
intervention shown to have potential impact in stemming a virus
that will infect six million people this year worldwide _ 11 every
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``My deep concern about South Africa concerns the balance
between prevention and care,'' said David E. Bloom of Harvard
University's Institute for International Development. ``They're
going completely in the direction of prevention and they're writing
off the millions who are already infected.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, said Monday in an
interview from Johannesburg that implementing AZT programs for
pregnant HIV-infected women, even on a limited pilot basis, is
proving more difficult than he imagined. Last spring, in announcing
the positive results from AZT studies in Thailand, Piot said wider
implementation of such programs was no longer a question of ``when
or if we should act, but simply how.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I deal with this, the more I see it as a very complex
issue,'' Piot said Monday. ``But it's my understanding that the
door is still open.''
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, South Africa is in a better position to test
the feasibility of prenatal AZT treatment than other, poorer
nations that are proceeding with plans to deliver the treatment to
30,000 pregnant women in 11 sites in Africa and Asia. More than
half of South Africa's population lives in urban areas, its per
capita income is more than $3,000, and its adult literacy rate is
82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Shepard of Brandeis University, who recently completed an
analysis of prenatal AZT treatment for the government of
neighboring Botswana, said that nation is considering a pilot
project like the one South Africa recently rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's analysis indicated that AZT treatment of HIV-infected
women would pay for itself by averting about 5,000 pediatric
hospitalizations for every 50,000 women screened for infection and
treatment. ``In the cost-effectiveness literature there are few
interventions that are such good deals,'' Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's reluctance appears to stem from its apartheid
history and the current government's determination to redress its
historical inequities in health care, in which 20 percent of the
population got world-class care and the other 80 percent got
virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of equity is very important in South Africa now,''
said Dr. Joseph Saba of UNAIDS, who has coordinated the agency's
activities on prenatal AZT treatment. ``This situation emphasizes
that we need to be as rational as possible, but the political
decision to move forward is more complex than the rational
parameters suggest.''

SUPREME COURT ASKED TO REFEREE CENSUS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court Monday got between the warring
White House and GOP House on the hot topic of how to count the 2000
Census, and it was notably uncomfortable being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like injecting us into a battle between the two
political branches,'' Justice Antonin Scalia said, echoing the
sentiments of several of his colleagues who heard two highly
charged census cases Monday. ``They will survive, but I don't know
if we would.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue before the court sounds technical: Whether the Census
Bureau, in conducting the 2000 count, can legally supplement its
usual head-by-head enumeration with a statistical estimation, or
sampling, to get a more accurate population figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration vehemently argues yes. Its solicitor
general, Seth Waxman, told the nine justices that sampling would
``best achieve the Constitution's goal of determining the number of
persons in each state.'' He called sampling an effective tool to
reduce the census's chronic undercount, which the Census Bureau
estimated at 1.6 percent of the US population in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Census numbers determine how the 435 House seats will be divided
up among the 50 states, and most Democrats think that correcting
the undercount, which disproportionately misses minorities and
urban dwellers, would benefit them politically.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the stakes in the 2000 Census are high. Maureen
Mahoney, the lawyer representing House Republicans before the high
court Monday, argued that census law and the Constitution forbid
anything but an ``actual enumeration'' for apportionment. ``No
guessing games,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two lower courts have agreed. In August, a three-judge federal
panel in Washington ruled in favor of the House Republicans,
finding that federal law bars the use of sampling for
apportionment. In September, three federal judges in Richmond, Va.,
made a similar ruling in a lawsuit brought against the
administration by a group of 16 individuals who anticipate their
six states would lose seats in the 2000 count.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carvin, representing that group, told the justices
Monday that census accuracy was not the most important issue.
``Regardless of accuracy, (sampling) is illegal and
unconstitutional,'' Carvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman argued that the Founding Fathers meant actual enumeration
to be ``a good-faith, empirical effort'' on the part of census
takers to count people every decade with the best available
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would think an actual enumeration means a count,''
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia sounded skeptical. ``If estimation by statistical
sampling isn't excluded (under actual enumeration), then what is?''
he asked. ``Rolling the dice?''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia also suggested that if estimating the population was what
the Founders had in mind, the young nation would have embraced it.
``The difficulty of finding people in the early frontier days was
much greater than today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also questioned Waxman about the Census Bureau's
plan for counting just 90 percent of the population, beginning
April 1, 2000, and sampling the remaining 10 percent. If
statisticians could produce accurate estimates, Chief Justice
William Rehnquist suggested, ``why do we need a census?''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials and sampling proponents say that in a mobile
nation of private citizens, getting a 100 percent accurate
headcount is impossible. It's a critical issue, particularly for
cities that depend on census numbers for a fair distribution of
billions of dollars in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been there and done that,'' said Barbara Everitt
Bryant, who was the Census Bureau director during the 1990 count.
``I know you can't get it by going out and ringing doorbells.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens suggested sampling might be the only
way to reach some parts of the population. He asked Mahoney, the
GOP's lawyer, what census enumerators would do if a family refused
to answer the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't guess,'' Mahoney said. ``They would have to put
down `zero.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what if the lights go on and off inside'' the house?
Justice Stephen Breyer wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the justices sounded exasperated at being asked to
referee what, in the last 18 months, has been an escalating war of
words and threats between the White House and House GOP leaders
over the census. They indicated Monday they could simply dismiss
the census case on the grounds that no parties have been injured
yet and the House has no ``standing'' to sue the president.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia suggested the House play political hardball and cut off
funds to the administration. ``There are about 900 ways the House
can stymie the president if it has the political will,'' Scalia
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parties to the suit hope the high court will rule quickly so the
Census Bureau can get on with its work. ``The sooner we have a
decision, the better,'' Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau
director, said after the arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The court will issue its ruling by the end of June. The cases
are Department of Commerce vs. House of Representatives, 98-404,
and Clinton vs. Glavin, 98-564.

TEXAS DEATH ROW ESCAPEE'S GRANDMOTHER PRAYS FOR HIS PEACEFUL
SURRENDER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grandmother of Texas death row escapee Martin E. Gurule said
Monday if she could get word to her grandson, it would be to
surrender immediately and peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was to surrender, let it be in peace in God's will,''
said Amalia Marez, Gurule's maternal grandmother who lives in
Corpus Christi. ``I'm hoping for the love of God that he does
surrender and does not let it go any further.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marez also said it is ``to be expected'' that her grandson,
who escaped from the Huntsville prison late Thanksgiving night,
would be shot if he resists capture. She also said she has thought
about the possibility that he may already be dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' Marez said. ``My prayers are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Gurule, who last week became the first condemned
murderer to escape death row since it was moved to the Ellis Unit
in Huntsville, Texas, has been depressed for some time. Marez added
that it was not unusual for him, or other family members, to get
depressed in November, because that is the month in which Gurule's
mother died, shortly after his birth. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Every letter he writes, he says, `Grandma, I'm sorry for not
writing. I've been very depressed,' '' Marez said. She said he has
continually asked over the years why God took his mother away.
</P>
<P>
   She said he never discussed escape plans with her, adding that
she knows none of the facts surrounding his murder of Mike Piperis
and Anthony Staton during a 1992 robbery at a Corpus Christi,
Texas, restaurant, the crime that sent him to death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't question him,'' she said. ``I am very, very proper. I
respect others as well as I wish to be respected. I don't ask
questions. I'm not an inquisitive person. I don't interrogate
nobody, and to this date, as God is my witness, I don't know
nothing, nothing, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marez said she was shocked to learn of Gurule's escape but has
not heard from him, nor did he give any hint to the family of his
escape plans.
</P>
<P>
   The family was contacted by authorities right after the escape
and they are still under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I baby-sit and I'm losing my babies just because of this,''
Marez said. ``I'm not baby-sitting because they (are in) fear, and
I don't blame them. But then again this is the way we make ends
meet, and right now I'm not working. I'm out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ask is for God to give me courage ... more strength to
bear with this problem,'' Marez added.
</P>
<P>
   She said Gurule's father, Eugence Gurule, has been in and out of
the hospital with a virus, and that her husband and Gurule's
paternal grandmother, Lora Gurule, also are depressed over the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm the most courageous here at home, but the
Lord is with me and the Lord is with my husband and my husband
comes from a very religious family,'' Marez said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother-in-law, a minister in Mathis, Texas, and
members of his congregation are praying for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're praying for my grandson everywhere,'' she said. &QL;

 &HT;    Judge to testify on perjuryBy Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Judge Gerald Tjoflat testifies today before the
House Judiciary Committee about the consequences of lying under
oath, he will probably speak his mind and mince few words.
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat, a Jacksonville judge who sits on the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta, has a reputation for being a
no-nonsense jurist. And his strongly worded ruling upholding a 1994
perjury conviction is nothing that ardent supporters of President
Clinton want to hear about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We categorically reject any suggestion, implicit or otherwise,
that perjury is somehow less serious when made in a civil
proceeding,'' Tjoflat wrote. ``Perjury, regardless of the setting,
is a serious offense that results in incalculable harm to the
functioning and integrity of the legal system as well as to private
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Lee Parks said that with regard to perjured
testimony there is no gray area for Tjoflat, who has sat on the
federal bench for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the typical straightforward and blunt way that he's famous
for, I'm sure he'll tell the committee that perjury is perjury is
perjury,'' Parks said. ``If you come in my court and you lie, you
infect the system and mess it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Parker, a former federal prosecutor who has argued
numerous cases before Tjoflat, predicted, ``With his commanding
presence and voice, he's the kind of guy who'll go up to Capitol
Hill and take no prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat is among six witnesses called by the committee
Republicans to testify in what may be the final hearing before the
panel votes on articles of impeachment against Clinton. Tjoflat
will be joined by Judge Charles Wiggins, a former Republican
congressman and a member of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in San Francisco; two military officers; and two convicted
perjurers, including former University of South Carolina basketball
coach and Atlanta resident Pam Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have summoned five witnesses, including Harvard
University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Elliot Richardson, who
in 1973 resigned as attorney general rather than carry out
President Nixon's order to dismiss special prosecutor Archibald
Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat likely is being called to testify because he authored
one of the nation's strongest appellate opinions against perjury.
The 1994 ruling upheld the conviction of Ku Klux Klan grand dragon
David Wayne Holland of Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Holland and 10 other white supremacists had been sued in federal
court in Atlanta after they attacked civil rights marchers during a
1987 demonstration in Forsyth County, Ga. A federal jury assessed a
$450,000 judgment against Holland. He was later convicted of lying
under oath when asked whether he tried to hide his assets to
prevent the marchers from collecting on the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   At sentencing, U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans believed the
federal sentencing guidelines called for Holland to receive lenient
treatment because he committed perjury in a civil _ and not a
criminal _ proceeding. But prosecutors appealed that
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling that directed Evans to re-sentence Holland without
leniency with regard to the perjured testimony, Tjoflat noted that
Holland ``wilfully made material statements under oath that he knew
were false. . . . His actions needlessly consumed court time,
forced the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office to engage in
prolonged investigations and attempted to prevent private citizens
from satisfying their judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hauptman, Holland's lawyer, said he believes Evans
correctly followed the sentencing guidelines. He also noted that
Tjoflat summarily rejected his challenge that Holland's conviction
be dismissed on claims of selective prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Bard Tjoflat, who turns 69 on Sunday, was appointed to
the federal appeals court in 1975 by President Gerald Ford. During
the Korean War, he served as a special agent for the
counterintelligence corps and, over the years, he has been actively
involved in the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   A former chief judge of the 11-member appeals court in Atlanta,
Tjoflat is considered a moderate conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat has testified previously before Congress, urging
lawmakers not to increase the number of judges on his court even
though appeals continue to skyrocket. More judges make confusing
law for the circuit and detract from the collegiality that's needed
to make the court function properly and smoothly, he said. As a
result, the 11th Circuit, which hears federal appeals out of
Alabama, Florida and Georgia, remains one of the nation's busiest
appeals courts in terms of cases decided per judge.
</P>
<P>
   Robust and full of energy, Tjoflat can bark like a marine
sergeant and is often seen with a haggard-looking law clerk at his
heels. He revels in telling a story or engaging in an argument,
often pausing to ask his audience, ``Do you follow?'' He can
dominate oral arguments before the court by peppering lawyers with
questions in an aggressive style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks his mind and has strong opinions,'' said Gary Myers,
a University of Mississippi law professor and former clerk for
Tjoflat's. ``He's very, very thorough. He's very good at looking at
the record and getting to the facts and to the details of the case.
That means he'll be a very well prepared witness before the House
Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Cohen, another former law clerk and now a George Mason
University law professor, said Tjoflat's ethics are beyond
reproach. The judge also has too much energy to take senior status,
to which he's entitled, Cohen said, recalling how Tjoflat could be
a stern taskmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen glumly recalls writing one draft after another for a
ruling in a major death-penalty case. Tjoflat sent them all back,
unsatisfied with each draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally came in to work on it one Saturday and he sat at
his desk and wrote the whole thing in long hand,'' Cohen said. ``My
job was to pass him sharpened pencils. It was not my most
ego-lifting experience, but it was a fine opinion.''

PROTESTERS URGE POSTPONEMENT OF WELFARE CUTOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES   AND HILARY SARGENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ About 30 people were arrested Monday night after
crowding into Governor Paul Cellucci's office to urge postponement
of Tuesday's welfare benefits cutoff for more than 5,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, mostly women, held a day-long sit-in on couches
and on the floor in the lobby outside the governor's third-floor
State House office while six uniformed state troopers guarded the
office entrance. The guards made no efforts to move the protesters
until late in the day when they asked the demonstrators to leave.
When they refused, the protesters were carried by state police
officers to the elevators and booked at an undisclosed location. A
police spokesman said the protesters would be charged with
disorderly conduct and trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last day,'' said Ann Withorn, a professor at
UMass-Boston said before her arrest. ``We don't know what else we
can do.'' Withorn said she wanted Secretary of State William
Galvin, who is the acting governor while Cellucci is in Israel, to
issue an order extending the time limit for welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly would be the right thing to do,'' said Withorn.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said Monday there would be no automatic extensions
or postponment of the cutoff date. However, because of the
mechanics involved in processing the cases, all the families will
receive at least half of their monthly welfare allotment this month
and many will continue getting assistance throughout the holiday
period, said Dick Powers, spokesman for the Department of
Transitional Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that the time limit has been an invaluable tool in
prodding people off welfare,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that when the state law was enacted on Dec. 1,
1996, about 41,000 people fell into the first cutoff group:
able-bodied individuals whose youngest child was age 2 or older. By
this past October, 35,000 of them had left the welfare rolls
because they had gotten a job, gotten enough unearned income to
make them ineligible, or moved to another state.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe that since October, roughly 800 people have
left the welfare rolls, Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that 2,374 of the remaining 5,000 also have managed to
get jobs but are not earning enough to eliminate their need for
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2,800 recipients will receive notice during the week of
Dec. 14 that their benefits are being terminated. In keeping with
standard welfare department policy, these people will be given a
10-day grace period before their benefits actually are cut, Powers
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 2,195 more have applied for individual exemptions from
the Dec. 1 cutoff. Their checks will not be stopped until their
cases can be reviewed _ which may take up to 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the policy worry that too few individual exemptions
will be granted, and only for the most extreme cases.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Working Massachusetts, a coalition of more than 60
welfare, labor, religious, academic and low-income groups, Jeb Mays
said nearly 6,000 individuals have signed petitions urging the
state to extend the cutoff by 3 more years, as federal law allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Massachusetts law is one of the harshest in the country,''
Mays said. ``Our concern is that in one or two or three months, a
large number of women and children will be facing poverty and
hunger and homelessness. And we know the shelters are already
full.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Kennedy, another professor at UMass-Boston who joined the
sit-in at Cellucci's office, said she could not remember being this
angry about and issue since the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be a professor now, but I was on welfare once as a
single mother,'' said Kennedy. ``We call this state the
Commonwealth, but I'd like to know when this wealth is going to be
common.''
</P>
<P>
   Also protesting Monday was Kip Tiernan, the founder of Rosie's
Place, a local women's shelter, and the Boston Food Bank. Tiernan
said already there has been a 25 to 50 percent increase in demand
at Rosie's Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in need has been phenomenal, he said. ``After
(Tuesday), it will be catastrophic. This will determine whether
these people will live or die.''

S. AFRICA HALTS PLAN TO TREAT HIV-INFECTED MOTHERS

<P>
   Acting on new evidence that a short course of the drug AZT
sharply lowers an infected mother's risk of transmitting the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to her unborn child, Dr. Glenda Gray
and her colleagues in Johannesburg, South Africa, have been lining
up women eager to receive the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of about $50 per treated woman, Gray figured, the drug
could cut mother-to-child HIV transmission by half _ a payoff
comparable to proven public health measures such as measles
vaccination or prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   But in October Gray picked up the newspaper and read that South
Africa's health minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, had canceled the
pilot project, which was to test the feasibility of delivering AZT
to 2,500 HIV-infected pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said she doesn't understand. ``It doesn't make sense on a
human rights level, on an economic level, or on a moral level,''
she said in a telephone interview. ``I'm still not sure why the
government decided not to go ahead with this intervention in the
face of an epidemic that is unchecked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was primarily for cost reasons,'' Dr. Glaudine Mtshali, a
top aide to Zuma, said Monday in between appearances to mark World
AIDS Day, which is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an easy decision because every single life is
important,'' Mtshali said. The government wants to spend the money
instead on safer-sex education and condom distribution, she added,
``so we don't have to be faced with this very difficult decision
about a baby due to be born with positive HIV status.''
</P>
<P>
   Mtshali said the government would revisit the decision when
``more information becomes available that is pertinent to the South
African context.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's decision threatens to overshadow other recent
steps taken by the government to mobilize the nation against what
many believe is the world's most explosive AIDS epidemic. ``We face
the danger that half of our youth will not reach adulthood,''
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said in a dramatic October 9 broadcast
address to the nation on AIDS, the first by a leading political
figure. ``Our dreams as a people will be shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, who is viewed as President Nelson Mandela's probable
successor, appealed to South Africans to change ``the way we live
and how we love'' and pledged ``to continue our search for a
medical solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki's ``declaration of a Partnership Against AIDS'' was
soon followed by what some call ``Zuma's bombshell'' about the AZT
program. Morna Cornell of the AIDS Consortium, an alliance of 90
South African AIDS groups, said the atmosphere at a recent workshop
of 50 HIV-infected pregnant women was one of ``the most appalling
disbelief and loss of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To learn you're HIV-positive and then to learn that something
can be done to give you a 50 percent better chance you won't
transmit it to your child _ and then to be told by the government
that it is not affordable _ it is just sickening, quite frankly,''
Cornell said. ``And we've just committed ourselves to a $5.3
billion arms purchase. What does that say about the values of the
new South Africa?''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is HIV spreading more rapidly than in sub-Saharan
Africa, and more than half the region's new infections are
occurring in South Africa, according to a report issued Monday by
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, one pregnant South African woman in every seven is
already infected with HIV, according to a 1997 survey. In the
coastal province of Kwazulu-Natal, the proportion is close to one
in three.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's decision to cancel the AZT pilot project, at
least for now, represents a clash between ``soft'' public health
interventions that promise future payoffs for entire populations
and a ``hard'' technology that can rescue individual infants from
certain death in the here-and-now.
</P>
<P>
   Public health authorities around the globe are watching the
South African debate closely as a harbinger of how the most
AIDS-beleaguered nations may deal with the first medical
intervention shown to have potential impact in stemming a virus
that will infect six million people this year worldwide _ 11 every
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``My deep concern about South Africa concerns the balance
between prevention and care,'' said David E. Bloom of Harvard
University's Institute for International Development. ``They're
going completely in the direction of prevention and they're writing
off the millions who are already infected.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, said Monday in an
interview from Johannesburg that implementing AZT programs for
pregnant HIV-infected women, even on a limited pilot basis, is
proving more difficult than he imagined. Last spring, in announcing
the positive results from AZT studies in Thailand, Piot said wider
implementation of such programs was no longer a question of ``when
or if we should act, but simply how.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I deal with this, the more I see it as a very complex
issue,'' Piot said Monday. ``But it's my understanding that the
door is still open.''
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, South Africa is in a better position to test
the feasibility of prenatal AZT treatment than other, poorer
nations that are proceeding with plans to deliver the treatment to
30,000 pregnant women in 11 sites in Africa and Asia. More than
half of South Africa's population lives in urban areas, its per
capita income is more than $3,000, and its adult literacy rate is
82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Shepard of Brandeis University, who recently completed an
analysis of prenatal AZT treatment for the government of
neighboring Botswana, said that nation is considering a pilot
project like the one South Africa recently rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's analysis indicated that AZT treatment of HIV-infected
women would pay for itself by averting about 5,000 pediatric
hospitalizations for every 50,000 women screened for infection and
treatment. ``In the cost-effectiveness literature there are few
interventions that are such good deals,'' Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's reluctance appears to stem from its apartheid
history and the current government's determination to redress its
historical inequities in health care, in which 20 percent of the
population got world-class care and the other 80 percent got
virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of equity is very important in South Africa now,''
said Dr. Joseph Saba of UNAIDS, who has coordinated the agency's
activities on prenatal AZT treatment. ``This situation emphasizes
that we need to be as rational as possible, but the political
decision to move forward is more complex than the rational
parameters suggest.''

US TO STUDY HAZARDS OF GASOLINE ADDITIVE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid mounting concern that a new ingredient in gasoline is
contaminating water supplies across the country, US Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner created a panel
Monday to study the hazard posed by the additive and to look into
possible replacements.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, short for methyl tertiary butyl ether, has been added in
large quantities to ``reformulated gas'' sold in many parts of the
country since 1995, as part of a national campaign to reduce
smog-causing emissions from vehicle tailpipes.
</P>
<P>
   But while MTBE has cleaned the air, it has polluted water,
forcing the closure of wells from Maine to California, including
several in Massachusetts. The US Geological Survey has detected
MTBE, which the EPA considers a possible human carcinogen, in 20
percent of the wells it monitors where reformulated gas is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the governors of Maine and California have asked the
EPA for permission to stop using MTBE, known as an ``oxygenate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While MTBE and other oxygenates in gasoline have improved air
quality for millions of Americans, I am convening a blue-ribbon
panel of experts to better understand public health concerns that
have been raised by the discovery of MTBE in some water bodies,''
said Browner.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-member panel will be chaired by Daniel Greenbaum, former
commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection who now runs the Health Effects Institute, a Cambridge,
Mass. research firm. The panel also includes environmentalists and
fuel industry representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, who have chided the EPA for not taking strong
action on MTBE, see the panel as a positive step, but they said
studies of MTBE pollution done for Maine and California already
show the additive is too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``What needs to be done here is a no-brainer. MTBE is too big a
threat to water and it must be banned,'' said John Meinhold of the
Sierra Club in New Hampshire, which is pushing the state to stop
using MTBE in southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   However, Browner stressed that the panel's creation does not
mean MTBE is automatically on its way out. Over the next six
months, the panel will look at the environmental and financial
costs and benefits of MTBE as well as other oxygenates that could
be used as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's purpose, according to an EPA statement, is simply
``to gain a better understanding of the public health concerns
raised by the discovery of MTBE in some water supplies.''

DEFECTIVE RIVETS MAY HAVE CAUSED TITANIC TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i cooding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pieces of metal retrieved from the hulk of the Titanic on an
expedition last August have provided strong confirmation of a
recent theory about what really caused the ``unsinkable'' ship to
sink 86 years ago. In a word: rivets.
</P>
<P>
   The rivets used to hold together the massive steel plates of
Titanic's hull, it turns out, were made of improperly annealed
iron. As a result, defects in the metal itself made the rivets
weakest at just the place where their strength was most needed in
an impact: where the rounded heads connect to the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 rivets recovered from the wreck have now been
analyzed, and 14 of them ``have some kind of problem,'' according
to metallurgist Timothy Foecke of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. Foecke said that as
soon as the impact with the iceberg occurred, the heads simply
popped off many of the rivets, causing long, narrow seams to open
up in the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Microscopic analysis of rivets that were recovered and sliced
open show the reason starkly: Slag in the iron, a glassy material
that is strong but brittle, should account for 2 to 3 percent of
the material, but instead is 8 to 9 percent in the bad rivets.
Whereas the smaller amount actually adds strength, the larger
amount makes the iron too brittle and subject to breakage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of things,'' said Foecke, ``a little bit is a good
thing, but too much is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem rivets were not really anybody's fault,
explained William Garzke, a naval architect with Gibbs and Cox Inc.
of Virginia, who is in charge of analyzing the Titanic material.
The techniques used today to analyze the defects in the metal did
not exist back in 1910 when the ship was being built, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Titanic's hull was held together by 3 million rivets, Garzke
said. The failure of just a few dozen of them from the tremendous
force of the ship's impact with an iceberg may have caused
Titanic's sinking.
</P>
<P>
   With today's analytical methods, it is now clear that the larger
amount of slag in some rivets formed larger tubes or sheets inside
the iron, instead of the tiny filaments slag forms in smaller
quantities. These caused weak areas in the metal, and when the
rivets were flattened out to form the outside rivet head, the weak
areas ended up lined up with the hull plates, instead of running
along the length of the rivets. Like the grain in a piece of wood,
these defects make it easier for the metal to break in one
direction than another, and in this case it was the worst possible
direction, making it easy for the rivet heads to pop right off.
</P>
<P>
   Titanic's sister ship, the Olympic, was built in the same
shipyard at about the same time and was damaged by a collision in
1911. Photographs of its hull show many missing rivets and a gaping
opening between hull plates, adding further evidence to the
case &UR;  &LR; today that it was bad rivets that caused the large openings
in the hulls of both ships.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier theory that it was bad steel in the hull plates
themselves that caused the great ship's sinking does not stand up
under the new evidence, Foecke said. While some earlier tests had
suggested that the steel became as brittle as glass in the cold
water of the North Atlantic, more recent tests on a section of the
hull recovered from the wreck do not support that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found some values of the fracture resistance'' of steel
from Titanic's hull ``that are not terribly different from modern
steels,'' Foecke said. ``We feel this is enough to put to bed the
brittle steel theory.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rivets tell another story. The theory was first
suggested last year, based on an analysis of just two recovered
rivets, leaving open the possibility that these were simply an
anomaly. Now that 40 rivets have been analyzed, recovered from 11
different places on the ship, Foecke said, ``the rivet theory seems
to be holding up. There seems to be a fundamental problem with the
rivets.''
</P>
<P>
   Foecke presented his latest findings Monday at a meeting in
Boston of the Materials Research Society. The research on the
Titanic parts is continuing, Foecke and Garzke said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the surprising revelations to come from the recent
analysis of the wreck is that the amount of damage to the ship was
actually much less than people thought at the time. Contrary to a
longstanding claim that the ship had suffered a huge 300-foot-long
gash, it turns out that the total opening caused by the impact
amounted to only about 12.5 square feet, Garzke said. Most of this
was in the form of gaps less than an inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   If the Titanic's captain had known that, Garzke said, it is
quite possible that simple countermeasures, such as stuffing
clothing or mattresses into the narrow, leaking seams could have
slowed the inrushing water enough to keep the ship afloat until the
Carpathia arrived to rescue survivors, possibly saving all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Garzke said that during last August's expedition he was able to
see a section of this open seam firsthand for the first time. Most
of this crack is below the mud line, he said, but it is exposed in
at least one place.

 &HT;    Georgia begins enrollment for uninsured children
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patricia Lane of Roswell recently landed her dream
job, as a social worker at an Atlanta senior citizens center.
</P>
<P>
   That break came after Lane struggled for years with health and
financial problems. A single parent, Lane, 48, has raised her two
children without getting child support from her former husband.
</P>
<P>
   Her new job pays about $21,000 annually. That income is too high
for her family to qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state health
insurance program for the poor. And it's not high enough, she says,
to afford private coverage for her two teenage children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really losing sleep over this,'' Lane says.
</P>
<P>
   The worry evaporated after Lane heard about a new insurance
program for Georgia children. Now, she says, her children will be
able to join the PeachCare for Kids program, which targets
thousands of uninsured children in the state, up to age 19. ``It's
a life-saver,'' Lane says.
</P>
<P>
   After a pilot program this fall in the Macon area, PeachCare's
statewide enrollment begins today, with medical servicesavailable
in January. PeachCare is part of a $24 billion federal initiative
to help meet the coverage needs of an estimated 10 million U.S.
children without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, about 380,000 children, or 17 percent, lack health
insurance. About 168,000 of these children are eligible for
PeachCare, says Georgia State University economist Bill Custer.
</P>
<P>
   Another 155,000 are eligible for Medicaid but aren't enrolled,
he says. Officials with the Department of Medical Assistance, which
runs both PeachCare and Medicaid, hope to ride the visibility of
PeachCare to sign up these Medicaid children.
</P>
<P>
   The children's program can make a significant dent in the
seemingly intractable problem of the uninsured, Custer adds. More
than 43 million Americans lacked coverage last year, up from 41.7
million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Children with health insurance own a major medical edge over
those without coverage, notes Gregg Haifley of the Children's
Defense Fund. ``A child who has an ear infection is more likely to
see a physician and not have a recurrence if that child has
insurance,'' Haifley says.
</P>
<P>
   In crafting their children's program, some states opted for a
private insurance plan. Others, like Georgia, chose to run their
children's program through Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   PeachCare's biggest challenge is to get the word out, says Jana
Key, PeachCare coordinator for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 1,300 applications have been received. The one-page
forms, which can be mailed in, can be obtained through a toll-free
number, and will also be available at hospitals, doctors offices,
libraries, churches and possibly schools.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Chansky of Roswell says two of his children will join
PeachCare. ``This is a Godsend,'' says Chansky, 63, a retired
salesperson on a fixed income. His wife, who has health problems,
doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program led to the signup of about 127 children in
Macon and surrounding areas. Among those who've received services
is Chris Woodard, 12, of Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The family has been uninsured for years. But through PeachCare,
Chris, 12, received eyeglasses. Having PeachCare ``took a load off
our minds,'' says Cindy Woodard, his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Laurie Iscaro of Georgians for Children, an advocacy group,
says the pilot's enrollment numbers were lower than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a minimal effort in marketing, Iscaro cited the monthly
premium of $7.50 per person as a deterrent, especially for those at
the lower end of the PeachCare range. ``These people have marginal
disposable incomes,'' Iscaro says.
</P>
<P>
   The program has other potential pitfalls, Custer says. Some
employers, for example, may drop private coverage for workers'
dependents, believing the state plan could pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   But Custer also notes that more parents on Medicaid may be able
to move to higher-paying jobs, and not lose coverage for their
children. That income vs. benefits trade-off is a constant
frustration for the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Belcher, 19, of Byron says her husband's job didn't offer
a group plan and individual coverage ``is way too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just over the (Medicaid) limit,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   So the PeachCare pilot proved the perfect fit for daughter
Hannah, who will be 2 this month. Says Belcher: ``This is the best
thing Georgia's ever come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THE PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   _ Funding: $72 million the first year, of which about $20
million is from state funds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Benefits: Include preventive care, dental care, eyeglasses,
prescription drugs, emergency and hospital services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Premium: $7.50 per child per month. For two or more children,
it's $15 per month. For children under age 6, there's no premium.
</P>
<P>
   _ Co-payment for services: None.
</P>
<P>
   _ Income limit: Families earning up to 200 percent of the
federal poverty level. In 1998, that income limit equals $32,900
for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   _ Estimated eligible population: 103,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Information: 1-877-GAPEACH (427-3224).

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Monday offered to increase aid to
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fivefold next year, to $500
million, while European donors pledged billions more. The total of
more than $3 billion exceeds the goal set by the Clinton
administration for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the end of Monday's donor meeting, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright cautioned that the sum was not exact,
``but it appears that delegations pledged more than $3 billion
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The money, first promised by Clinton during negotiations in
October over the Wye Memorandum, is to improve education, modernize
the Palestinian legal system and build projects to create jobs on
the West Bank and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``No peace stands a chance of lasting if it does not deliver
real results to ordinary people,'' Clinton said at the opening of
the hastily-arranged, day-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton called on other countries to donate generously to the
Palestinians, Washington privately implored Arafat to tone down his
remarks about Israel, according to interest groups that follow the
Mideast. Specifically, they said, Clinton aides urged Arafat to
stop making declarations that he will create an independent state
next year.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's conference with 50 European and Asian donors and
international lending groups, Arafat charged that Israel had
intentionally hurt the Palestinian economy. He stopped short of
repeating comments he had made on Sunday about creating an
independent state. But in a message delivered at the United Nations
to the annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian
People, Arafat asked for support ``to make a reality of the
declaration of independence and to implement it on the blessed soil
of Palestine during the coming year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pledge to increase aid must be approved by Congress,
and the plan will face pointed opposition if Arafat continues to
call for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who supports
the peace process, said that members of Congress are likely to
support more aid to the Palestinians ``but it won't be
unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's comment about statehood ``hurt the Palestinians' cause
in Congress because it goes against the mood and the substance of
the Wye agreements, which prohibit either side from taking
unilateral steps,'' Lieberman said in an interview last night.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kyle, an Arizona Republican who serves on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, has already threatened to cut off aid for
Palestinians if Arafat angers Benjamin Netanyahu's government in
Israel or complains about a plan to relocate the US embassy in
Israel to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   With members of Congress still scrambling for committee
assignments, it is too early to know who will control foreign aid
appropriations next year. But at issue is role that hardliners on
Capitol Hill will play in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Chairman Arafat talks prematurely about statehood,
it erodes support in the Jewish communty for his cause,'' said
Jason Isaacson, Washington representative for the American Jewish
Committee, an influential Jewish group. ``While there is widespread
support for the peace process in the Jewish community, there is
little if any support for premature declarations of sovereignty
that would undercut the process.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the American-Israel Public Affairs
Committee, one of the most important Jewish groups in Washington,
added that it is likely to support the increased aid providing it
goes to private Palestinian groups, not the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer to increase aid from $100 million to $500
million came as the White House finished plans for a three-day,
mid-December visit to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza _ the first
trip to Palestinian-controlled areas by an American president.
Clinton will address the Palestinian National Council, which is
scheduled to amend its charter and drop controversial wording
calling for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's visit stirred controversy because of his remarks about
statehood and because of a London Times report that the Palestinian
Authority had used $20 million in housing aid from European
governments to construct luxury apartments for Arafat's
``acolytes'' instead of for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made no references to the allegations, saying simply that
Palestinians had suffered from ``momentous constraints'' during
five years of economic decline in the West Bank and Gaza. Monday
afternoon, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek said that
Israel's restrictions on people and goods leaving the West Bank and
Gaza since 1993 had caused a loss of more than $3 billion to the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's conference, the European Union pledged about
$480 million over the next five years and Japan promised $200
million as several countries responded at short notice to Clinton's
appeal to help keep the fragile peace process on track. US
officials said that Norway promised $170 million, Saudi Arabia $100
million, Kuwait $80 million and Canada $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges of financial support do not always materialize. Five
years ago, Washington promised the Palestinians $100 million a
year, but it has actually sent about $75 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Albright added that the increased aid to the Palestinians marks
``the beginning of a process which will turn words on paper into
contracts, construction sites and commerce in the West Bank and
Gaza and throughout the Middle East.. the dividents of peace will
become increasingly tangible and enduring in the lives of the
Palestinian people.''

A SCENARIO THAT'S NOT FULL OF BCS

   (BEGIN ITAL) We take you now to a parallel sports universe,
where people are logical and those wearing pastel, eye-numbing bowl
jackets are not in charge.(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Nov. 30 _ The first round of the first-ever NCAA
Division I college football playoffs has been set, and fans across
the country are already excited about the intriguing matchups.
</P>
<P>
   After playing superbly all season and being top seed in the
16-team tournament, No. 1 Tennessee is faced with a problematic
opponent, WAC champ Air Force. The Falcons won the WAC title and
received one of the last bids to the tourney, knocking out
16th-ranked Notre Dame, a 10-0 loser to USC in its season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``At another time in college football,'' said Air Force coach
Fisher DeBerry, ``it wouldn't have mattered if we won the WAC or
Notre Dame lost. They would have gotten the better bowl opportunity
simply because they're Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead, the Vols face a wishbone. ``We've faced some options
teams,'' said Vols coach Phil Fulmer, ``but it's been awhile since
we saw any wishbone, or whatever they call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, the No.2 seed, also drew a difficult first game,
against mercurial Big East champs, Syracuse. The Orangemen closed
the season with a 66-13 rout of Miami and easily are the best 8-3
team in the nation. K-State coach Bill Snyder declined to answer
questions about the draw.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse flip-flopped spots in the original draw with Air Force
since the Orangemen and Vols already met this season, Tennessee
winning by a point.
</P>
<P>
   The other big first-round game will pit fourth-seeded Florida
State against longtime nemesis Nebraska. ``Dang it,'' said Bobby
Bowden. ``You play all season hoping for an easy first-round game,
and then you wake up and have to play Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest culture clash will be the match between
eighth-seeded Wisconsin and Conference USA champ Tulane, which just
finished its first unbeaten regular season. Badger fans in Madison
plan to build a mock Bourbon Street outside Camp Randall Stadium in
honor of Tulane's first-ever game against a Big Ten team.
</P>
<P>
   Other first-round games include Virginia at Pac-10 champ UCLA;
Georgia Tech at No. 5 Ohio State; Arkansas at Arizona; and Texas
A&AMP;M at Florida. The top eight seeds in the tourney host first round
games on Dec. 11 and 12. The eight winners will then be reseeded
for quarterfinal games on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) `Results' from Week 1
</P>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Dec. 12 _ The first weekend of Division I-A playoffs
produced exactly what long-time advocates expected, a couple of
thrilling endings and two major upsets.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse beat No. 2 ranked Kansas State, 29-28, when Donovan
McNabb scrambled for a touchdown on a fourth-and-goal play with 18
seconds left in the game. And unheralded Tulane, playing in snow
flurries, upset Wisconsin, 33-31. Green Wave quarterback Shaun King
threw four touchdown passes. Wisconsin back Ron Dayne ran for 201
yards but also had two key fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State held off Georgia Tech, 31-25. The Engineers and
quarterback Joe Hamilton scored 15 points in the last 4:08 and had
the ball at the Buckeye 11 as time expired. And Florida State
needed a touchdown pass with 1:09 left to beat Nebraska, 30-23.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee outlasted a game Air Force, 29-20; UCLA held on to
beat Virginia, 40-27, after blowing part of a 33-7 lead; Arizona
had no trouble with Arkansas, 38-11; and Florida edged Texas A&AMP;M,
22-16.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterfinals are now set for New Year's Day. After the
reseeding to take advantage of traditional bowl tie-ins, No.1
Tennessee will face Tulane in the Sugar Bowl; UCLA will face Ohio
State in the Rose Bowl; Florida State and Syracuse will face off in
the Orange Bowl; and Arizona meets Florida in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sugar Bowl has been good to us,'' said Vols coach Phil
Fulmer, ``but then we've never had to face Tulane there.'' Wave
coach Tommy Bowden said it may turn out to be a home field
distraction. ``I'm sure we'll be a lot more nervous on our own
field than we were in Madison.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo welcomes the chance to play a traditional
Big Ten opponent, Ohio State. Buckeye players are ecstatic to get
to the Rose Bowl after a mid-season loss to Michigan State appeared
to derail those hopes. ``In the old system, one loss usually knocks
you out of the national title hunt,'' said Andy Katzenmoyer. ``Now,
we're still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State and Syracuse will meet in the Orange Bowl.
Arizona, fast becoming the sleeper choice as national champ, will
face Florida in Tempe, a two-hour drive from Tucson. ``Not only do
we have a shot at the title,`` said Dick Tomey, ``but this will
help our recruiting against Arizona State.''
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) More the merrier?
</P>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Dec. 30 A group of college coaches and athletic
directors, led by Penn State's Joe Paterno and Notre Dame's Bob
Davie, say they will ask the NCAA to expand the NCAA playoff field
to 32 in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno spoke after the Nittany Lions' 28-23 Outback Bowl win
over Georgia, and Davie after the Irish were crushed by Texas and
Heisman winner Ricky Williams in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've needed a playoff format for many years,'' said Paterno.
``It obviously has been a huge success. The response by bowl people
here and elsewhere is that they'd like to be a part of it. And the
way you do that is by extending the field.''
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) Fictitious Final Four
</P>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Jan. 2 The first Final Four in college football has
been set. On Jan. 16, the New Orleans Superdome will host a
day-night doubleheader, with Tennessee facing Arizona and UCLA
clashing against Florida State
</P>
<P>
   Those four teams advanced with wins on New Year's Day that
supported the argument for playing games on the field, not in polls
and computer rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee ended Tulane's cinderella run, 38-22, in the Sugar
Bowl, but not before the Green Wave won a few fans by taking a
14-13 halftime lead. Meanwhile, UCLA shot down Ohio State, 47-36,
in one of the most exciting Rose Bowls ever. Cade McNown and Joe
Germaine combined for 10 touchdowns passes, and McNown also ran one
in.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State ran past Syracuse in the Orange Bowl, 29-20, and
Arizona, in a battle of teams with rotating quarterbacks, toppled
Florida in the Fiesta Bowl, 26-21. All four games were sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   The title game is set for the Rose Bowl on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the old bowl system had its merits,'' said the
Bruins' McNown after beating the Buckeyes. ``But I think every
college player in America would like the chance to be where we are
right now. For some, the bowls and polls may be important. But all
the players want to do is play.''

BIG-LEAGUE LESSONS FOR YOUNG CENTER THORNTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He has bounced up and down in the Bruins' lineup for 22
games, playing on the second line some nights, the fourth line on
others. Some nights, he has been benched for a shift at a time;
other nights, he's been benched for an entire period.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the very public education of Boston center Joe Thornton.
At 19, he's learning all the lessons for free. Besides having to
earn his stripes, Thornton is finding out that in this league, if
you don't play well, you won't play at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What disappoints me is I have to stop playing him to win the
game,'' said coach Pat Burns, who has been reluctant to use
Thornton in tie games or with a one-goal lead. ``If I get to the
second period and nothing is happening on the second line, I've got
to pull him out and put somebody else there. He's got to figure
those things out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big deal, we'll have to see. When the game gets
tight or the game gets tough, I've got to go with the more
experienced guys. He's been around for a while so he knows what's
going on. Right now the focal point is the team, it's not Joe
Thornton.''
</P>
<P>
   As tough as some outings have been for Thornton, he is head and
shoulders above where he was a year ago. Burns said there is no
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's miles, miles better,'' said Burns. ``He still has a long
way to go, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the season, after a particularly tough game in which
Thornton played precious little, he said he didn't have a clue as
to the message the coach was trying to send him. Monday, however,
Thornton said he gets it much more now than he did then. Though he
didn't necessarily buy Burns's theory that he can't be trusted in a
tight game, Thornton knows he needs to be more consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to earn his trust, and when I do that, I'll be
playing a lot more,'' he said. ``I have to work harder, maybe. And
be a better defensive player, maybe. So in those close games, I'll
be able to play more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm improved since last year, big-time. Some games I
feel great and then others, I don't have it going. It's part of
learning consistency. If I can stay at a high level every game,
I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it a function of maturity or experience, but finding that
measure of consistency isn't nearly as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go on streaks,'' said Thornton, who has two goals and seven
assists. ``I play good for four games and then I'll have two off.
Then I'll go back. Hopefully I'll have more games up at the high
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play well, I feel like I can do anything. My (off)
days, I feel like crap. Some games I won't have a great first
period but then in my second, I've picked it up. I don't know what
it is, but I have to get better in the all-around game.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to great lengths during the offseason to beef up his
6-foot-4-inch frame. The key to his game is utilizing that extra
bulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just got a couple hits early, I'll be OK, but if the hits
aren't there, I don't play as well as I should,'' said Thornton.
``I think if I get involved early, I have more success during the
game. It's mental, I know that. I know if I want to play, I've got
to hit and I've got to make things happen. He told me I've got to
get more physical. I try to do that.''

AGE OF ELECTRONIC BOOK MAY FINALLY BE AT HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Mass., N.J., Ohio, Va., Texas)  (rl) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Virginia Commonwealth University, sociology students use a
textbook that exists only online. It sends them to related Web
sites, has recorded lectures they can rewind and offers discussion
areas that supplement and enliven their classroom discussions.
</P>
<P>
   At Kent State University in Ohio next spring, a few dozen
students will receive devices called electronic books, which look
like latter-day Etch-a-Sketches and will be loaded with course
texts.
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas, the state Board of Education is planning a pilot
program to distribute electronic books and laptop computers next
fall to thousands of high school students.
</P>
<P>
   With futurologists having mistakenly predicted the end of the
printed page for several decades now, no one is preparing a eulogy
for the traditional book. Television did not doom radio, video did
not kill film, and electronic publishing will not likely end print.
</P>
<P>
   But with two electronic book devices on the market and an
exponential increase in reference and scholarly material available
online, many experts say that the shift from page to screen, once a
Jetson-like fantasy, is now approaching reality.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those, like Jeff Rothenberg, a senior computer
scientist at the Rand Corp., who say they can see the day when
books printed on paper will be viewed ``more as objets d'art than
things we use all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Raymond, an editor at McGraw-Hill, said: ``I am a book
person and I never believed I would want to give up the books I
carry around with me. But I'm starting to think of myself more as a
content provider. I look at my 11-year-old son's school backpack,
which I worry is ruining his spine, and I can see advantages to
electronic books. We know we are standing on the edge of a
precipice.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that a shift is imminent comes because of several
parallel developments.
</P>
<P>
   First, electronic book technology is advancing rapidly, with
better screen resolution and longer battery life. The cost of such
devices is dropping; two kinds of electronic books are on the
market for $300 to $500 each, and another, for $1,000 to $1,500, is
due early next year. All of them allow downloading of whole books
from the Internet into their memories, permitting students to carry
many books in one lightweight device. The devices allow word
searches and have built-in dictionary functions.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the amount of material available for downloading is now
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   And third, a generation is coming of age for whom absorbing
digital information seems easy and natural. Even if not many young
people seem ready to curl up with a hand-held screen for reading a
novel, the idea of reading textbook or reference material from
screens is increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, anything electronic was exotic,'' said Paul
Saffo, a director at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park,
Calif. ``Today, computers are an integral part of higher education.
You can see where electronic books would fit into the shape of
academic life. I see this as a key time for this technology,
probably still one of interesting failures but ones we can really
learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   One important change in the last few years is the growing use of
the Internet for reference works. Texts for physicians, lawyers and
other professionals are being put on line, where they can be
updated with greater ease and at lower cost than printed texts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a growing number of textbooks have online
supplements for graphics, pictures and, increasingly, video and
audio supplements. Some think it will not be long before the entire
books are transferred into digital format.

FINGER INJURY UNDER CONTROL, BLEDSOE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The most famous finger in New England was
resting comfortably Monday, in a softer splint designed for
everyday living rather than the stronger one designed for the
violence of NFL life.
</P>
<P>
   The index finger on Drew Bledsoe's right hand came out of
Sunday's 25-21 ``Angels in the End Zone'' win over the Buffalo
Bills a little sore, still broken in two places, but battle-tested
and apparently ready for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little sore,'' said the Patriots quarterback, who will
use the splint for another 4-6 weeks, which means the rest of the
regular season and into the playoffs if they should make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little more sore than it was on Saturday before the
game, but I think it withstood quite a test and I'm pretty happy
with the way it came out of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is ``out of the woods'' concerning future starts,
Bledsoe said, ``I would say pretty much, unless something strange
happens. I'll keep it in the splint so that it heals up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was picked off once, but he managed to throw 43 passes
and absorb four sacks. The interception had nothing to do with his
finger, he said, but there were some passes that went slightly off
the mark that he would normally drill in much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of them where I wasn't as accurate as I
wanted to be, but for the most part they were going the right
way,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   There was much suspense all week about whether Bledsoe would
play, but he seemed to know by the end of the week that he would be
able to throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots took it easy on him in practice; he didn't really
participate until Saturday, when he took snaps and handed the ball
off with no problems. He didn't even have to alter the way he put
his hands under center, after talk of him flip-flopping his hands
to protect the finger.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question facing Bledsoe and the coaching staff is what
path to take in preparation for the Pittsburgh game.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he's ready to go in what will be one of the tougher
road games on the schedule, and a crucial one for AFC playoff
positioning, as the Patriots and Steelers are both 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers beat the Patriots, 7-6, in the playoffs last year,
a game Bledsoe called the toughest loss of his career and the one
that took him the longest to get over.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was attempting to drive the Patriots to a game-winning
score when he was sacked on a blind-side tackle by defensive end
Mike Vrabel and fumbled. Pittsburgh's Jason Gildon recovered on the
Patriots' 34 with 1:44 left to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the day that Bledsoe took heat for inviting his
agent, Leigh Steinberg, and quarterback client Ryan Leaf into the
locker room. Though devastated by the loss, Bledsoe shared a moment
of jocularity with the two; Bledsoe said it was just a lighter
moment when Steinberg tried to get him to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone wants to make up for the pain of that loss, it would
be Bledsoe. So he will heed the advice of his trainers and Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it today with the trainers on how we're going
to practice him, and I guess we'll just take it a day at a time,''
said Carroll. ``He can perform in the game and get the job done,
but the fact that you wear on it all week if he's throwing, we'd
have no idea of what it would be like on game day. We haven't quite
figured it all out, but it might make sense not to throw him all
week. I don't want to concede that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said Bledsoe's absence from the practice field never
altered the game plan, though it appeared the routes got shorter
after the first-quarter interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't alter the game plan we went in with,'' said
Carroll. ``That didn't have anything to do with it. You could see
right off the bat during warmups that he could throw the ball. So I
waited to see him take his first couple of snaps with Dave
Wohlabaugh, and Dave pounded the ball to him and he had no
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he savored Sunday's game because ``winning in the
NFL is so tough, and winning games like that are so few and far
between.'' But he and his teammates know that can't keep counting
on miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really up to us to correct what mistakes we are making
and start playing like we can on both sides of the ball,'' said
Bledsoe. ``We've been fortunate to have the chance to still be in
the running here. Now we have to take our game to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, and his famous finger, already have.

 UNDATED: digital format.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, which publishes texts for professionals in
technical fields, says that in the coming months two of its
standard reference works _ the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical
Technology, and the Wiley Encyclopedia of Electrical and
Electronics Engineering _ will be available online.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other reference works on the Internet, those books
will be accessible for a fee. That is also the case with an
Internet publishing site called Online Originals, which publishes
original works of fiction that can be bought online for $7 each.
</P>
<P>
   Some publishers are placing texts on the Web for free, relying
on contributions or advertising for revenue. The Gutenberg Project,
for example, has placed thousands of classics online.
</P>
<P>
   Emedicine.com offers, at no charge, a new encyclopedia for
emergency-room physicians that was written by 400 doctors. Members
of the military in far-flung places and a missionary in Haiti are
among those who have told the organizers, Dr. Scott Plantz, a
research director at the Chicago Medical School, and Dr. Jonathan
Adler of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, that they found
the site helpful. The site has been financed primarily by Plantz
and Adler, who hope that advertising by drug companies will
ultimately allow the site to pay for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have up to 400,000 hits a day,'' Plantz said. ``A big
advantage is that we will be able to update it constantly and embed
in it new pictures and even video clips. Our book is two-and-a-half
times bigger than any textbook in the field ever published. And a
typical textbook is $200.''
</P>
<P>
   The market for educational texts was more than $5.5 billion last
year, and the Internet has only expanded that market, which has
grown more than 8 percent so far in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And if textbooks really do move further, from the printed page
into the digital realm, the potential for profits is likely to be
greater still, because that change could reduce the need for
warehouses, trucks, returns and, even more significant, the
used-book market.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Nelson, a sociology professor at Virginia Commonwealth who
wrote an online textbook that he now uses, said he found much more
``active learning'' from his online book than from customary books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two classes right now, and they are both using the Web
intensively,'' Nelson said. ``One class has 300 students, and the
other has 40. In the large class, the students each write 12 essays
and pose questions to each other on the Web. They interact with
each other every week, and they can do it on their own time. The
level of their activity is inconceivable in a normal class. I see a
big difference from before this technology was introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kent State, Roger Fidler, director of the information design
laboratory, said he planned to test two kinds of electronic books
in classes next spring and fall. The hand-held devices, which weigh
3 to 5 pounds, can store 10 to 15 books downloaded from the
Internet. Fidler plans to give half of each class the new devices
and the other half the usual textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Fidler says, a company is developing a kind of ATM for
train stations, which will distribute digital magazines. A customer
could download the magazine onto a cassette and then install it on
a hand-held device for reading. That could become a model for
magazine and newspaper distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Fuchs, vice president for computing and information
technology at Princeton University, said the key for the future of
electronic books will be increased screen clarity and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they love bookstores, but they are buying from
Amazon.com,'' he said. ``Give them convenience, and the next thing
you know you will be telling your grandchild about this thing you
once had called a book.''

US MOVES TO PROTECT INTERNET COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, invoking a future in which
Internet commerce helps everyone from American holiday shoppers to
impoverished Third World farmers, unveiled new steps Monday to
encourage more people to buy and sell products on line.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting a report from his staff on Internet shopping, the
president called for stronger fraud and privacy protections to make
people more comfortable with electronic commerce, or e-commerce.
But those protections should come from industry, not from new laws,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who surf the Web still don't shop there,'' Clinton
said. ``They worry they won't get what they thought they were
paying for; they'll have nowhere to go if they get cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said these fears should be addressed ``not with burdensome
regulations that might stifle growth and innovation, but with
incentives for on-line companies to offer customers the protections
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address, to staff and business executives near the
White House, was part cheerleading session for the Internet and
part goodbye party for Ira Magaziner, a longtime Clinton friend and
adviser who supervised the Internet report.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner, a longtime businessman and political activist in
Rhode Island and Massachusetts, will return to New England this
month (December) after six years as a senior adviser to the
president. Magaziner was a key adviser on Clinton's 1994 health
plan, which died amid a massive fight in Congress. After that
bruising defeat, Clinton asked him to work in a different policy
area, and in 1995 Magaziner began helping to formulate
administration policy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, Magaziner's inter-agency group calls for the
government to create new incentives for companies to invest in
high-speed networks so that material can be downloaded from the
Internet more quickly. Clinton said Monday he had instructed
several agencies to work on that issue with the independent Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, FCC Chairman William Kennard said his agency
would try to create more competition among telephone, cable, and
other companies in offering high-speed Internet connections to
consumers. But he offered no specifics. ``This creates a new sense
of urgency for those of is in government,'' he said of the
Magaziner report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called on the FTC to continue its efforts to
enforce fraud and consumer protection laws on the Internet.
Magaziner said the federal government would urge other countries to
sign treaties that extend similar protections to consumers who
cross national borders when they buy goods over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should get what they pay for on line,'' Clinton said.
``It should be easy to get redress if they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also instructed the State Department to find ways to
spur e-commerce in developing countries. As a model, Vice President
Al Gore cited a Peruvian town that had quintupled its income by
using the Internet to sell its vegetables in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A central issue in e-commerce involves consumer privacy: what
information businesses should be able to collect from consumers,
and what they may do with that information. Magaziner said the
Clinton administration backed an industry self-policing plan in
which companies that adhere to standard practices can display a
special ``seal of approval'' on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Several private groups are offering these seals, including the
Council of Better Business Bureaus and an organization called
TRUSTe. In order to display a seal, companies must offer consumers
a clear statement of what information is being collected about
them, how it is being used, and what they can do to correct errors
and control the spread of the information.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner predicted that by March, companies responsible for 70
percent of e-commerce will adopt a privacy seal. He said trade
groups in Japan and Australia had agreed to adopt a similar system
so that the same seals can be used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The administration approach has drawn several critics. At the
Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit civil liberties
group, Deirdre Mulligan said the administration had failed to
follow through on an earlier promise to assess whether
self-regulation was truly protecting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear right now whether self-regulation is working...
and the administration should say what it will do if it doesn't
work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, Solveig
Singleton said the government may have already used too heavy a
hand in protecting privacy. She questioned whether companies had
adopted privacy seals in the best interest of consumers, or because
the government had threatened to pass its own burdensome rules if
they did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is all kinds of experimentation going on about when
consumers care about confidentiality and when they do not, and
about how you have a relationship on line,'' she said, adding that
government privacy rules could stifle that experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   The event Monday provided a rousing send-off for Magaziner. In
his speech, Clinton thanked him for his work and called him ``my
friend of 30 years now.'' In the audience were Magaziner's wife,
Suzanne, and their three children.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his White House service, Magaziner said: ``I feel
good about it, particularly the last couple of years. It's nice to
succeed at something, though I'm still proud of what we've done''
in health care policy.

ADVERTISING: STARWOOD'S BOUTIQUE HOTEL TO MAKE BROADWAY PREMIERE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The letter ``W'' is getting quite a workout these
days as a result of the growing popularity of the World Wide Web.
Not since Elmer Fudd began fulminating about that wascally wabbit
have so many W's been tossed about so, um, wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Now Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, the giant owner of
lodging brands like Sheraton, Westin and Caesars World, is staking
a claim to the 23d letter of the alphabet by using W as the name
for a planned chain of boutique business hotels. An unconventional
campaign carrying the theme ``Come to your senses'' is promoting
the initial venture, W New York, which formally opens Tuesday night
in midtown Manhattan with the type of party usually thrown for the
premiere of a Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   That similarity is no accident because the campaign is being
created by an agency that specializes in entertainment and
lifestyle marketing: Grey Entertainment in New York, a unit of Grey
Advertising, which lists among its clients Broadway and Off
Broadway plays and musicals, In Style magazine, Time Warner Cable
and the promotion company SFX Entertainment. The campaign for W New
York ranges widely from the party to print advertisements to
interactive marketing (CD-ROM's and a Web site).
</P>
<P>
   And there was a series of ``teaser'' mailings aimed at piquing
the curiosity of _ and generating buzz from _ influential New
Yorkers like restaurant owners and hair stylists. They were sent
such offbeat items as boxes of Stress Mints (``Relax in a New York
minute'') and scented soap embossed with the words ``pure'' and
``fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to market what we thought would be a unique property,
the goal was to find an agency that could interest a consumer in
the experience of the hotel as opposed to simply selling a
product,'' said Diane Briskin, director for sales and marketing at
W New York, which was created after an $80 million makeover of the
old Doral Inn at Lexington Avenue and 50th Street.
</P>
<P>
   So the campaign is meant to depart from traditional sales spiels
in the lodging field that focus on the proverbial room with a bed.
The goal is to convey an image for the W chain as a hip haven for
nontraditional customers who are patronizing the new wave of
stylish city hotels typified by the Ian Schrager properties like
the Royalton.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the campaign features some of the participants in W
New York: the architect David Rockwell, who designed the hotel; the
restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who is creating the hotel restaurant,
called Heartbeat, and the night life impresario Rande Gerber, who
is overseeing the Whisky Blue lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many companies are calling themselves `entertainment
experiences,''' said Gerry Logue, president at Grey Entertainment,
``whether it's Starbucks or Barnes &AMP; Noble or the sneaker
marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than a place to spend the night,'' he added, ``W New
York is meant to be more of an `experiential destination.' We want
to get across the idea that it's a warm place for you personally
but will also serve your business needs.''
</P>
<P>
   One ad, showing a man reading a newspaper in a chair situated
deep in a forest, carries the headline ``A place of magic, mystery
and meetings ...''; another ad, depicting a woman asleep in a bed
floating in the sky, declares, ``It's a whim, a wish come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of the campaign, which has a budget of $1 million,
seem somewhat precious or touchy-feely. W New York is billed as a
``sanctuary'' and ``a place where even sleep itself is inspired.''
Descriptions of the spa and fitness center assert: ``Your body is a
temple. This is your place to worship.'' (Though in the
mixed-message department, some ads suggest that ``if you're in the
mood for something hot, hit the lockers and escape into the sauna
or steam room.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the campaign is too ethereal, Logue replied: ``We
have never lost sight of the fact the hotel is there to deliver
service. We're putting out a message so the consumer will say,
`That is the place for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Briskin said that she was pleased with the tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really important we created some form of provocative
image that would catch your eye and get across the experience of
the hotel,'' Ms. Briskin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starwood is launching a brand of business class hotels with
extreme comfort for the traveler seeking an `urban oasis,''' she
added. ``We recognize we will not appeal to people who make a
standard choice.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the name W, which is also to appear on hotels in such
cities as Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle,
``it stands for `warm' and `welcoming,''' Ms. Briskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, under fire for
blocking a stadium bill that could have kept the New England
Patriots in Foxborough, said Monday there may still be ways to
prevent the team's departure if a deal with Connecticut falls
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, in a wide-ranging discussion with reporters in which
he also shot back at BankBoston Chairman Charles Gifford for
criticizing the Legislature's inaction, said a House bill offering
the Patriots $57 million in infrastructure improvements around a
new Foxborough stadium would stay on the table.
</P>
<P>
   That was a remarkable concession for the Mattapan Democrat who
as recently as this fall said the amount of public financing in the
bill would likely be reduced if it came up again for debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Finneran appeared to back off that harsh stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never said take it or leave it,'' he added. ``The door
is always open. It's never been closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would also soften his position on the Senate bill
which calls for Massachusetts to buy $20 million in land from team
owner Robert Kraft, who would lease it back to the state, Finneran
said it was possible, but for a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to be considered,'' Finneran said. ``Again, it
gets the Commonwealth into a position where we're then acting as a
partner with whoever comes forward. The question might be better
asked of the team. I think they've expressed and exhibited a
preference for having no partner in any of their business
endeavors. They like to go it alone. I understand that preference
because partners can be sometimes difficult. It can be a trying
circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said if the state agrees to purchase the land _ the
very reason why he rejected the Senate bill _ it might require
Massachusetts having a direct interest in the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shrugging off a lighthearted suggestion that he may want
to call the plays, Finneran said, ``Oh gosh no, although I would
have kept (former coach) Bill Parcells, however.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate on other ``creative'' measures that
could get a stadium deal done in Massachusetts if the Connecticut
legislature does not pass before the year's end the $350
million-plus plan for a new facility in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (creative ideas) have already been expressed in private
correspondence,'' he added. Finneran would not say when he talked
to Kraft about other possibilities or what they might be.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said privately Monday they have not heard from
Finneran since early last summer and pointed out they are
prohibited from negotiating with another state under the terms of a
memorandum of understanding Kraft signed Nov. 19 with Connecticut
Governor John Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran Monday also responded to BankBoston Chairman Charles
Gifford, who wrote an opinion article in Sunday's Globe in which he
lamented how tough it is in Boston to get things done. ``Rivalries
run deep and convictions are firmly held,'' Gifford wrote, without
mentioning Finneran by name. ``Some say our three favorite pastimes
are politics, sports, and revenge. The decision on a new stadium
for the Patriots provided all that and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, however, said Gifford's critique was off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly uninformed position,'' Finneran said. ``This is
not boosterville and it should never be boosterville if
boosterville means you go along with any proposal that comes
forward from anyone who describes himself as having a business
plan. It is not inappropriate on behalf of the taxpayers to
question, and to question very closely, the assertions that are
made with regard to tax revenue and the precedent that would be
established by going along with the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran also said ``there's hardly a businessman who's been
conscious over the past five years that could do anything but
applaud the performance of the Massachusetts House, with the way
we've transformed the reputation and the atmosphere and environment
of the state as a place to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited tax breaks for the banking and mutual fund industries,
along with the deregulation of utilities, for making the state more
attractive for companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when somebody says that the incident of the stadium is
indicative of a parochialism or some type of tribal clashes or
warfare that inhibits progress, I think on that issue they're sadly
misinformed.''

MAKING BIG PLAYS AGAIN, LEETCH IS SEEKING BIG MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rangers have had a few unpleasant experiences
with unrestricted free agency for elite veterans since the era
began with the collective bargaining agreement of 1995. Right wing
Pat Verbeek left for Dallas in 1996, a move that depleted the
team's attack. Center Mark Messier went to Vancouver in 1997, a
departure that hurt many feelings, created a leadership void and
led to a disastrous season. Goalie Mike Richter qualified in 1998
and returned to New York only after negotiations with several teams
resulted in allegations of bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   The next candidate for this market is Brian Leetch, the captain
and star defenseman, who could be free on July 1 because he will be
31 and might be without a contract. Should he reach that point,
Leetch could sell his services to any team. Now earning $3,372,500
in the final season of a seven-year deal, Leetch works cheaply for
an established veteran of his skills and status. ``It's worked out
good for the Rangers the last few years,'' Leetch said. In his next
pact, he may command between $6 million and $10 million a season on
a long-term deal and become one of hockey's highest-paid players.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations, which were postponed earlier this year, began in
earnest Monday at Madison Square Garden, involving Neil Smith,
president and general manager of the Rangers; Dave Checketts,
president of the Garden, and Jay Grossman, the business agent for
Leetch. Both sides have said they would not discuss developments.
</P>
<P>
   The timing seems good for Leetch, who twice has won the Norris
trophy as the NHL's best defenseman. Leetch scored a goal in each
of the last two games, a 2-2 tie in Pittsburgh on Friday and a 5-1
victory at home over Nashville, doubling his season total to four.
He and the Rangers will play again Tuesday night against Florida at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling last season while disillusioned over Messier's
departure, Leetch seems more settled. In 1997-98, his plus-minus
ratio of minus 36 was the worst on the team. This season, it is
zero, among the Rangers' best. His 14 assists give him 18 points,
among league leaders for defensemen and second on the team behind
Wayne Gretzky's 21. Although the Rangers remain three games below
.500, Leetch and his teammates exude cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch, more comfortable in his captain's role, and his fiancee
celebrated Thanksgiving by serving as hosts for dinner at a local
restaurant for six teammates who had nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very good,'' Leetch said of the event. ``All the trimmings.''
The restaurant is owned by the father of his fiancee, Mary Beth
O'Neal. They are to be married next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers know I want to be here,'' Leetch said. ``This is
the only organization I've known. I love it here. I'm happy here.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't seem so happy last season, when he inherited the
captain's ``C'' from Messier. When asked whether it was easier to
be captain this season, Leetch said this might be true because the
turnover on the roster means that fewer Rangers remember the
Messier era. As for those veterans who remain, Leetch was asked
whether they are over the hurt. ``Oh, yeah,'' Leetch said. ``We
talked about that.'' The loss of Messier ``was something that a lot
of us disagreed with,'' Leetch said, ``but it didn't affect the way
we went about our business on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   As for business off the ice, Leetch said he had some anxiety
after Richter's free-agency episode, but that it had since
dissipated. ``I know the situation,'' Leetch said. ``Each day that
passes, my position gets stronger _ the more pressure on the
Rangers to get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Leetch and Richter are members of the franchise's senior class.
Both were members of the United States Olympic teams of 1988 and
1998. Leetch first wore the blue shirt on Feb. 29, 1988, and has
played in 747 regular-season games, compiling 168 goals and 550
assists. He won the Norris trophy in 1992 and 1997. Leetch finished
last season with 50 points in 76 games, the worst production, on
average, of his career. But he said he did not feel a need to
redeem himself with a strong start this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here long enough, they know my game, and what I can
bring to a team,'' Leetch said. ``That should not be an issue at
all.'' This may not be a point of view that is shared throughout
the Garden administration, which is filled with executives who have
worked elsewhere for much of Leetch's career. But Leetch's solid
start, and the appearance of a happier mood, could prove
reassuring. Leetch lately has been using the word ``fun'' more
often, in various contexts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they are happy with the direction it is going,'' he
said of his employers, ``and they want me to be a part of it.''

COMMENTARY: THE STARR TRAP
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At 1 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 16, Monica Lewinsky arrived
at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pentagon City to meet Linda Tripp.
What happened then is well known. But its significance _ its
crucial significance _ is not generally understood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was confronted by FBI agents and Kenneth Starr's
assistant prosecutors. She immediately told them, as she testified
later, that ``I wasn't speaking to them without my attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney was Francis Carter. When she was subpoenaed by
Paula Jones' lawyers, she told him that she had not had ``sexual
relations'' with President Clinton; Carter prepared, and she
signed, an affidavit to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's agents did everything they could, short of physical
force, to keep Ms. Lewinsky from calling Frank Carter. They told
her that he was a civil rather than a criminal lawyer ``so he
really couldn't help me.'' (That was a lie; Carter is a highly
regarded criminal lawyer who for six years headed Washington's
public defender service.) They gave her the number of another
lawyer and suggested she call him.
</P>
<P>
   They told her she had signed a false affidavit and could go to
prison for 27 years. They offered to give her immunity if she would
``cooperate'' _ but said there would be no deal if Carter were
called in. (A federal regulation forbids immunity negotiations in
the absence of a suspect's lawyer.)
</P>
<P>
   Why were Starr's deputies so anxious that Ms. Lewinsky not
telephone Carter?
</P>
<P>
   On that Friday afternoon Carter had not yet filed Ms. Lewinsky's
affidavit. Until it was filed, it could be changed _ without legal
consequences. Federal law makes it a crime only to file a false
affidavit in a civil case. You can swear one, keep it, then change
it or tear it up without violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   Starr knew about the affidavit from Linda Tripp's last taped
conversation with Ms. Lewinsky, and knew from Paula Jones' lawyers
that it might not yet have been filed. That is why his deputies
worked so hard to keep Ms. Lewinsky from calling Frank Carter. If
he knew what was happening, they realized, he would not file it.
And they wanted a crime. They wanted perjury to be committed: by
Ms. Lewinsky so they would have leverage over her, and by the
president when he was deposed in the Jones case the next day.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Lewinsky had called that afternoon, Carter told me, the
affidavit ``would not have been sent.'' But there was no call. At
the end of the business day it was sent to the court in Little Rock
by Federal Express. Under the rules, that was a filing.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had shown the affidavit to the Jones lawyers and to
Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer. If he had not filed it, he said,
``I would have told them.'' So Bennett would have known of Starr's
interest in Monica Lewinsky. The president's deposition on Saturday
would have taken another course or been canceled. And the history
of the last 10 months would have been very different.
</P>
<P>
   (Did the president or Ms. Lewinsky in fact commit perjury when
they swore they had not had ``sexual relations''? Perjury, a
complicated legal concept, requires among other things proof of
deliberate falsehood. In a conversation with Linda Tripp unrelated
to any threat of prosecution, Ms. Lewinsky had said emphatically
that ``having sex'' meant ``having intercourse'' _ not oral sex.)
</P>
<P>
   The right to a lawyer is fundamental in our constitutional
system. A person accused of crime, the Supreme Court said in the
Scottsboro case in 1932, ``requires the guiding hand of counsel at
every step.'' Without it, the innocent person may be overborne by
what she does not understand.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers occasionally break the rules. It is another
matter when prosecutors, who are officers of the court, overbear a
young woman to keep her from calling her lawyer. The Starr deputies
who were there on Jan. 16 _ Michael Emmick, Jackie Bennett Jr. and
Bruce Udolf _ should surely face questions by the appropriate legal
authorities on their fitness to practice law. And Starr condoned
what they did.
</P>
<P>
   None of this excuses the president's moral folly. But it makes
powerfully clear that Kenneth Starr is a far more serious menace to
our constitutional order than Bill Clinton is.

 &HT;    Martin no Manning, but Vols on the verge of national
championship
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ If Tee Martin ever forgets whose inescapable
shadow he still lives in, he need only stop in the lobby of the
Neyland-Thompson Sports Center on his way to practice. There, in a
corner of the Tennessee Football Hall of Fame Exhibit that includes
national championship trophies and the original manuscript of
``Rocky Top,'' is the newest display. There, behind an orange
railing, is Peyton Mannequin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a life-sized, life-like replica of Peyton Manning, the most
beloved Vol of all. It looks like one of those audio-animatronic
figures at Disney World. No, Peyton's not walking on water; he's
standing casually, ankles crossed, hands stuck in his blue jeans
pockets, wearing an orange-and-white Tennessee letter jacket. He is
Tee Martin's predecessor. Has anyone ever had a tougher act to
follow? ``I don't know of one,'' Tennessee head coach Phillip
Fulmer said. ``It'd be like. . . .'' he paused. ``I can't even
think of an actor's name. 'Gone With The Wind,' maybe, and trying
to be Rhett Butler. But Tee's done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tee Martin never will approach the passing records Manning
established here. Even with the burgeoning support Martin's
garnered, no one's calling this place UTee. Not yet. But Taumaurice
Nigel Martin has accomplished what no UT quarterback had been able
to do. He has led the Vols to an 11-0 regular season. Now,
top-ranked Tennessee is one game away _ Saturday night's SEC
Championship Game in the Georgia Dome, against Mississippi State _
from playing for the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' Martin said. ``This is all we've been
working hard for since the offseason. We knew we had some big shoes
to fill and prove a lot of people wrong _ even our coaches, who had
some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question? Martin. In four seasons, Manning threw for
11,201 yards, was the Heisman Trophy runner-up and won the Sullivan
Award as the nation's top amateur athlete last year, was picked No.
1 in the NFL draft and inspired dozens, maybe hundreds, of couples
to christen their newborn sons ``Peyton.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Tee Martin, a junior and one-time Parade high school
All-American from Mobile, Ala., who had thrown all of 16 passes as
a collegian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peyton got us over the hump, brought a lot of recognition to
the program,'' Fulmer said. ``Peyton followed Heath (Shuler), but
this is an even harder act to follow. Peyton is Tennessee's most
decorated player of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   That the job was clearly Martin's entering spring practice
helped. So did the 6-foot-3, 215-pounder's attributes: a strong
arm, speed and durability. And the ability to shrug off the
inevitable comparisons with Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play any attention,'' said Martin, who spoke Monday
while wearing ice bags on his left knee and right ankle. ``The guys
accepted me. We didn't dwell on the past or look into the future.
We dealt with the present.''
</P>
<P>
   And Martin dealt deftly with life in Manning's shadow. ``It
wasn't really hard, because of myself,'' he said. ``I understood
people were going to accept me for who I am, not for trying to be
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer and his offensive coordinator, David Cutcliffe, still had
to adjust to a Tee formation quarterback. Early in the season,
Martin _ who's far more mobile than Manning _ was asked to do more
throwing on the run. That was out of character for a kid who worked
out of the shotgun in high school in a run-and-shoot offense.
Martin directed an end-of-the-game drive in the opener at Syracuse
that led to a last-second field goal and a 34-33 victory. In an
epic 20-17 overtime win over Florida, though, he was just 7-for-20
for 64 yards, with a touchdown and an interception. It was after a
17-9 win at Auburn, when tailback Jamal Lewis suffered a
season-ending knee injury, that Martin began to lift his game _ and
his team _ against Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you say, 'Who's your next best player? Who gives
you the best chance to win?' `` Fulmer said. ``He played OK (in the
first half at Georgia) but had a couple of bad decisions. Since
then, he's been phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin threw two third-quarter TD passes at Georgia to give UT a
22-3 win. After a tidy performance against Alabama, Martin was
indeed phenomenal at South Carolina. He established an NCAA record
by completing his first 23 passes before finishing 23-for-24 for
315 yards and four TDs. In the last six games, Martin has hit 66.9
percent of his passes, 87 of 130 for 1,291 yards, eight TDs and one
interception. He hasn't thrown an interception in 59 attempts and
has just one in the last 147.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the switch from Peyton Manning to Tee Martin has made
them tougher, because they've had to build up their offensive line
and running game,'' Vanderbilt coach Woody Widenhofer said Saturday
after the best ground game in the SEC rushed for 189 yards in a
41-0 rout of Vandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that this kid is 11-0,'' Fulmer said. ``He has
had a great year and has been a phenomenal leader for our football
team in a very quiet way. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Tee
Martin.''

 &HT;    Maxim knows value of happy returns
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All these holiday magazine stories about Christmas, the season,
the shopping, the gift guides ... the eye cruises the newsstand for
something fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Something, as it turns out, exceedingly fresh.
</P>
<P>
   There it is. The December issue of Maxim ($3.50). Page 72. The
title we can't repeat. But the subject ``bares'' summarizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the holiday season, we consciously toss logic onto the
fire with the yule log,'' author Nancy Miller reports in a story
that offers single men and women tips on how to usher in the New
Year with a fling that would make less sense in another season with
less spiked punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that what the holidays are about?'' Miller writes.
``Giving, receiving, checking out what you got, and if it's not
what you wanted, exchanging it for something else within 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   REALITY BITES: So you need a bummer to steady yourself after
that headlong advice for the holidays? The cover story of E, The
Environmental Magazine ($3.95) _ ``Baby Boom: Rampant Population
Growth Is Already Straining the Planet's Limited Resources'' _
should do it.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Stephen Sawicki argues that, in the United States,
political activists who link abortion to family planning are
undermining this country's attempt to control population and
therefore planting the seeds for a frightening scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts expect the world's (populace) to breach 6 billion by
mid-1999. One worst-case projection is that 27 billion people will
be vying for space _ and much more _ by 2150. If so, the lack of
resources will be unmatched by anything short of our scariest
disaster movies.''
</P>
<P>
   TITANS ALL: Time ($2.95) continues its series on 100 people
``who shaped the past 100 years'' with this week's cover story,
``Builders &AMP; Titans: The Most Influential Business Geniuses of the
Century.'' The piece reaches beyond the usual robber-baron suspects
_ no Rockefeller, no Carnegie _ to focus on a few titans you've
probably never heard of (Willis Carrier, for instance, who invented
air conditioning) and a few you wouldn't expect to be revered (mob
boss Lucky Luciano). Only one woman makes the list (cosmetics
magnate Estee Lauder), and no minority makes the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diversity of America's population and the entry of women
into the work force gives an important competitive advantage over
other countries,'' Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc.,
writes in an introductory essay.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that advantage will be squandered if our largest
corporations don't figure out how to use these resources more
fully.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta cable mogul Ted Turner gets a brief mention as one of
the ``other powers behind the screen'' in a piece on broadcast
pioneer David Sarnoff.
</P>
<P>
   A BIGGER ROLE: In Rolling Stone ($3), actor/musician Will Smith
talks about possible political aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my calling is, but my performing career is a
pit stop on the way to whatever the next level of greatness is.
And, again, I'm in the middle of this movie thing and loving it,
but Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali achieved a higher level of personal
greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also profiles ``the biggest new rock band in
America,'' Barenaked Ladies, including this quip from accordionist
Ed Robertson on what he and guitarist Steven Page were like as
kids: ``We were the geekiest of geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE GOOD THINGS: The woman who is as indefatigable as her
publicists, Martha Stewart, is featured on the cover of Newsweek
($2.95) attached to the title story, ``Christmas Goes on Line.''
America's ubiquitous homemaking know-it-all explains that since
launching her Web page last year (http://www.marthastewart.com),
she's seen the future and it's in cyberspace: ``This Christmas
e-commerce is exploding. Why am I betting the future on it?''
</P>
<P>
   VERY FUNNY: The double ``Cartoon Issue'' of The New Yorker
($3.95) includes an interview with actor Tom Hanks, who says he
regrets giving the Clinton legal defense fund $10,000 in light of
the president's admission that he had a relationship with White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, in the light of events since, it would be
awfully hard to say now, `Oh, here, let me help you out with this
problem,''' says Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   And comedian and actor Steve Martin picks up where Woody Allen
has waxed whimsically for decades in film and print, asking the
question: ``Does God Exist?''
</P>
<P>
   You'll laugh, but you won't get an answer.

 &HT;    Holidays an excuse for stuffing
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge and Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't blame the holidays for weight gain, says Georgia State
University psychologist John de Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Genetics has a much stronger influence in pulling us to the
table than social situations or weather, according to a study he
did on the eating habits of adult twins.
</P>
<P>
   His research shows that people tend to eat more as the weather
cools and that they spend more time feasting in larger groups. But
no single factor influenced people's eating patterns more than
genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identical twins, even if they live in completely different
environments, tend to eat about the same amount of food,'' de
Castro says.
</P>
<P>
   Queen for a year
</P>
<P>
   The third time was the charm for Project Open Hand homecoming
queen contestant Tipper Gore-May. After being upstaged two years in
a row, the blonde beehive-coiffed, mustachioed Gore-May (a.k.a.
local AIDS fund-raiser Joe Collie) finally took home the
skyscraper-sized tiara during a coronation Sunday night at Colony
Square Hotel in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Collie beat out eight other homecoming contestants by raising
$81,000 for Project Open Hand. He performed in drag shows and
hosted a charity Thanksgiving dinner to raise the money.
</P>
<P>
   The monthlong event for the city's AIDS agencies raised
$221,776.

 &HT;    Violent TV impedes viewer's memory
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Networks that show too much violent programming may wind up
shortchanging themselves. Researchers say violent TV impedes a
viewer's memory of the commercial messages that run during a
program.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brad Bushman, a psychologist at Iowa State University, found
in a study that most people can't remember ads they watched while
viewing violence in various programs. Two experiments involving 400
people found that those who watched violent shows couldn't remember
brand names of products that were advertised during the programs.
But others who watched nonviolent shows could remember the brand
names.
</P>
<P>
   In another experiment, 320 men reported their moods after
watching four videotapes to determine whether anger obstructed
their ability to remember the content of commercials. As it turned
out, anger did impair memory, says Bushman, in addition to brand
name memory recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that the negative effects of television violence on
memory for commercial messages can be partly due to the anger
induced by the violent content,'' Bushman says. ``This is not good
for advertisers because in the time they hope viewers are absorbing
their commercial messages, viewers may actually be trying to calm
their anger brought on by what they just watched.''
</P>
<P>
   His study didn't cover televangelists who preach fire and
brimstone or sporting events in which violence is the norm.

MUSEUM SEEKS ANSWERS ABOUT MONET'S HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE   AND WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Museum of Fine Arts moved Monday to confirm
revelations that a Monet waterlily displayed in a major Boston
exhibition of the Impressionist's work was probably confiscated by
the Nazis from a prominent French Jewish art collector.
</P>
<P>
   If verified by the Art Loss Register in London and the French
national museum system, which loaned the painting, ``Water Lilies
1904'' to the MFA, the artwork could soon be returned to the
descendants of Paul Rosenberg, the Paris collector who fled the
Nazis and whose heirs live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations were reported Saturday and Monday in the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The French national museum system has held the painting since
1950, only a few years after the artwork was repatriated from the
wartime collection of Adolph Hitler's foreign minister, Joachim von
Ribbentrop, who was hanged for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Monday, MFA Director Malcolm Rogers
maintained that the museum cannot be held responsible for not
discovering that the painting, which has been held at the Musee des
Beaux-Arts in Caen, may have been plundered from its owners by the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question that should be directed to the French,''
Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the MFA has said it examines the background of its
artwork, whether in permanent exhibit or on loan, Rogers said that
searching for the owner of paintings with ``troubled histories,''
such as the waterlilies work, is often akin to finding a needle in
a haystack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should people be blamed for responsible guardianship?'' he
said. ``That's absolute nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is scheduled to go next to the Royal Academy of
Arts in London. MFA officials said it is too early to tell whether
that exhibition will proceed as planned.
</P>
<P>
   However, art law specialists widely expect that once the Boston
exhibition is over, the painting will go back to France and the
Rosenbergs will make their claim.
</P>
<P>
   Once the revelations have been confirmed, Rogers said, the MFA
is prepared to add text beside the painting that will discuss the
Nazis' seizure of art during World War II. Now, a title card beside
the work simply states that ``Water Lilies 1904'' was ``recovered
after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting is one of 1,955 artworks now in French custody that
were recovered from Germany after the war. &UR;  &LR; Ownership of the works
has not been determined by the French, who nevertheless acknowledge
they made no serious effort to find the rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the waterlily painting between 1933 and 1950 had
been unknown, according to Paul Tucker, guest curator for the Monet
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it got into and out of the Rosenberg
collection,'' said Tucker, who teaches at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston. Tucker added that it is unknown how Von
Ribbentrop obtained the painting.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork has been displayed in eight major exhibitions in 10
cities around the world since 1980, Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the World Jewish Congress said it will demand at a
45-nation meeting on plundered possessions of Holocaust victims,
beginning Tuesday Washington, that France sell the 1,955 artworks
and donate the revenue to Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the MFA said it fulfilled its obligation, Jonathan
Petropoulos, the Nazi art-looting expert who helped the Globe pin
down the painting's ownership, expressed disappointment Monday that
museums like the MFA do not devote more resources to ensuring that
their art collections do not contain war loot.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the ease with which the Monet's ownership was identified
by the Art Loss Register _ and how quickly he himself matched it to
a photo of the looted work in his own book _ Petropoulos said the
MFA should have been able to do the same thing with its resources.
</P>
<P>
   Had any of the show's curators simply leafed through his book,
``Politics as Art in the Third Reich,'' they would have had
evidence that the painting was plundered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos said the principal failure lies with the French. But
all major museums, he said, ``have wonderful libraries and files
and expertise, and the ability to enlist the cooperation of other
museums and art dealers in search of verifying information. They
need to use those resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lefart, a spokesman for the French Embassy in
Washington, said his government is examining the issue. But he said
he expects that the appropriate course will be for the MFA ``to
repatriate the painting to Paris, and to have the claim analyzed
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, the MFA director, said the painting will remain on
display for the duration of the exhibition, ``Monet in the 20th
Century,'' which ends Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's American descendants, who have backgrounds in
dealing and collecting art, said they have no wish to disrupt the
MFA exhibition, and approve of the museum's decision to keep the
painting on exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Though the family is weighing its legal options, an official at
the US Information Agency said the USIA gave the MFA standard
protection from seizure for all of the loaned works from abroad,
including the Monet waterlily at issue. The protection is granted
to facilitate the international sharing of art.
</P>
<P>
   It was the New York Museum of Modern Art's failure to seek such
protection almost a year ago that opened the door for Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau to subpoena two Austrian
paintings on loan to MoMA after two Americans claimed the paintings
were looted from their family during World War II. Those paintings,
by Egon Schiele, remain mired in litigation in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA, in its application to the USIA, notified the agency
that the Monet waterlily from the Caen museum had an incomplete
history and had been recovered after the war. A USIA official said
the MFA's notice that the painting lacked an identifiable owner was
the appropriate step for the MFA to take.

VOLVO TO CUT INTERNATIONAL WORK FORCE BY 5,300 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ky.)  (rl) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Volvo AB, the Swedish maker of cars, buses, trucks and
construction equipment, said Monday that it would lay off more than
7 percent of its work force, or 5,300 workers, by the middle of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts will be divided between Europe, where Volvo is the last
of the small, high-volume independent automakers, and the rest of
the world, including 1,000 jobs in the United States. Volvo hopes
to save $367 million a year with the cuts, which are the latest in
the European automobile industry as it braces for slower sales in
emerging markets and reduced growth in Europe and the United
States. Volvo, which backed out of a merger with the French
carmaker Renault in 1994, faces tough conditions as it seeks to
expand its international reach, particularly by moving into
developing markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite aggressive,'' said John Lawson, an auto industry
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cuts were intended to insure growth in operating
profits as Volvo completes an overhaul of global operations it
began in 1997. About 1,900 job cuts are foreseen in Volvo's car
division, and 900 to 1,000 in each of the truck, bus and
construction-equipment divisions. The remaining jobs will be cut at
small units, like marine engines.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Lorentson, Volvo's spokesman, said management in the
United States would have to decide ``how, when and where'' to make
cuts here. Volvo operates several plants in the United States,
including a truck factory in New River Valley, Va., and one for
marine engines in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has had to act aggressively to resist growing pressures
from reshuffling in the global industry, exemplified by
Daimler-Benz's recent takeover of Chrysler, forming
DaimlerChrylser. Earlier, Germany's BMW swallowed Britain's Rover,
Volkswagen assembled a stable of brands, including Italy's
Lamborghini, and Fiat now controls the sports car brands Alfa
Romeo, Ferrari and Maserati.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has decided to close three bus factories in Western Europe
and concentrate production at a new plant in Poland. In October,
Volvo said it would close a car assembly plant in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, eliminating 195 jobs. The cuts announced Monday are in
addition to the job losses in Canada. Last month, Volvo paid $150
million to buy Mexico's second-largest bus maker, Mexicana de
Autobuses, and equip it to build buses and cars for the North
American market.
</P>
<P>
   With a 1.7 percent market share, Volvo is Europe's
seventh-largest producer, not including the European units of Ford
and General Motors, and is dwarfed by market leaders like
Volkswagen, the leader, which has an 18 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   This year, European car sales are expected to rise by 4.6
percent, to 14 million cars, then decline next year, to 13.7
million, as European economies slow, according to the latest car
industry forecast by Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. In November, BMW said
it would cut 2,500 jobs at a Rover factory in Britain, and Ford
announced it would cut 2,300 jobs in Belgium. Fiat has said it will
slow production for several weeks in the holiday season to reduce
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Volvo's recent efforts at reorganization, results have
been disappointing. In the first nine months of this year, net
profit dropped to $679.9 million from $1.1 billion in the period a
year earlier, despite a 15 percent increase in sales, to $18.3
billion. At the start of reorganization, Volvo set a goal of 5
percent operating margin, or operating profit as a percentage of
revenue. At the end of nine months, the margin had slipped to 4.2
percent from 4.4 percent in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still much work remaining in order for us to be able
to attain our profitability goal,'' said Leif Johansson, Volvo's
president and chief executive. He said Volvo would determine in
December how large a reserve to set aside for the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo attributes the weakness in profitability to the cost of
introducing models like the S80, a new flagship sedan that entered
the market this fall, and to the slowness of cost-cutting to offset
the drag of an aging product line.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the disappointing nine-month results, Johansson said
that sales this year had increased ``according to plan'' and that
turmoil in Asia, where Volvo sells 6 percent of its cars, was
offset by increased sales elsewhere. But he acknowledged that the
emerging-market turbulence of recent months had not figured into
Volvo's original strategy. If it continued, he said, Volvo would be
forced to take measures to adjust cost levels to smaller volume
growth.

 &HT;    Holyfield-Lewis bout set for March 13
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen years ago, a skinny 22-year-old from Atlanta
made his pro boxing debut in Madison Square Garden, winning a
six-round preliminary bout. In ensuing years, Evander Holyfield's
career would take turns and reach levels few would expect from
someone taken the distance by one Lionel Byarm.
</P>
<P>
   On March 13, Holyfield will return to the Garden for only the
third time in his career to meet Lennox Lewis in a
heavyweight-title unification that became official Monday amid
indoor pyrotechnics and the long-winded, pay-per-view verbal
pumpings of promoter Don King. But Holyfield, who for two years has
spoken of unifying the belts as his only tangible goal, made it
clear Monday that the Lewis fight probably will not be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``No _ it ain't time to retire, yet,'' said Holyfield, 36.
</P>
<P>
   He then softened that only slightly, adding, ``Every time
somebody says they're going to retire and that this is their last
hurrah _ you know, people don't do great on their last hurrah
because they feel sorry for themselves. When I figure it out, I'll
be laying in bed thinking, 'I don't want to fight any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas, said he expected the fighter
to continue his career. The winner of the the Holyfield-Lewis fight
is contractually obligated to fight Henry Akinwande or the
next-highest WBA contender. There also will be attempts by some to
put together a third fight against Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he probably would stick to his recent desire of
fighting until 2000, even though that projection was based in part
on the idea that the Lewis fight would not be put together until at
least late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield predicted a knockout over Lewis _ ``This will be an
easy fight'' _ and went so far as to say, ``I've already won. The
date and the belt just haven't arrived yet.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what tangible goal he would have left after fighting
Lewis, Holyfield said, ``It thrills me to know that I'm at a point
in my life I can win because I want to win. . . . I can retire when
I want to retire. I know sometimes people think I'm a gimmick _
like, 'You're just like every other fighter (who delays
retirement).' But I'm not like every other fighter. I have a
purpose. I'm trying to prove it's how a person thinks that
determines whether he wins, not how big he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Age, size and strength will be Lewis' edges in March. The WBC
champion is three years younger, five inches taller at 6 feet 7 and
20 to 25 pounds heavier at 243, pending the weigh-in. But Lewis has
opened as a slight underdog and has been criticized for the lack of
star quality among his previous opponents. The Brit has lost only
once in 35 fights but he has not fought any of the top boxers of
his era _ Holyfield, Tyson, Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer, George
Foreman, Larry Holmes. His stature also is reflected in his purse _
$10 million, minus promotional fees. That dwarfs Holyfield's $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' contention is that others have ducked him. He includes
Holyfield in that group, saying Monday that the WBA-IBF champion
``finally was pressured to fight me.'' When a deal fell apart last
year, Lewis' camp said Holyfield was too greedy in asking for $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe when Evander wanted to go another route, he went
another route,'' Lewis' manager, Frank Maloney, said. ``He was
running around in a room, and eventually there were no more corners
he could run to.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holyfield took exception to the remarks and pointed out that
Lewis declined to fight him in 1996 before Holyfield fought Bobby
Czyz, which preceded the shot at Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, when you cry for something enough, you finally
get it,'' Holyfield said about Lewis' public demands for the fight.
``The question is: What will you do when you get it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never figure out why nobody would fight him. He's a
lot easier than everybody else. I mean, he's a big guy. But you
don't judge a businessman by what his size is. Why would you judge
an athlete that way? It's the smart guy who prevails, and I believe
I'm the smartest guy in the bunch.''

 &HT;    Chandler status no better in a week
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves didn't appear any
more optimistic Monday than he did a week ago that starting
quarterback Chris Chandler will be able to play in the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at (Chandler's sprained ankle) before the game
(Sunday), he had not made any progress from when he (was helped)
off the field (Nov. 22),'' Reeves said. ''He's going to have to
make a lot of progress (to play Sunday against Indianapolis).''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves chose to start Tony Graziani at quarterback last Sunday
in St. Louis, but replaced him the the second half with Steve
DeBerg. The resulting 21-10 win clinched a playoff spot for the
Falcons (10-2).
</P>
<P>
   For a change, maybe Chandler's uncertain status isn't cause for
despair.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has won three of four games this season in which
Chandler has been missing or injured, beating the Rams (3-9), New
Orleans (5-7) and Chicago (3-9) _ the latter two when Chandler left
with the Falcons holding a lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts (2-10) are another of the NFL's downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chandler doesn't play, the Falcons can break out a
defense that has climbed to a No. 9 ranking in the NFL,
leapfrogging from No. 17 in one week by holding St. Louis to a
season-low 174 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't hurt to have running back Jamal Anderson, whose
career-best 188 yards rushing moved him to No. 2 in the NFL with
1,326 yards, trailing only Denver's Terrell Davis (1,566).
</P>
<P>
   ``To (win) the way we did makes it extra special,'' Reeves said.
``Winning when you don't have your starting quarterback shows that
it could be done, and also we won when we were negative (one) in
turnovers and gave up a kickoff for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things will usually get you beat. But our defense is
playing great ... and Jamal is running great. I had no idea he had
188 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons defense gave up 304 yards two weeks ago in a 31-19
win over San Francisco, but the Bears managed just 210 yards total
offense two games ago.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had just 40 rushing yards Sunday, the eighth-best
defensive effort in the Falcons' 33-year franchise history, and the
third top-nine effort in team history this season. Overall, they
are ranked No. 2 in the NFL against the run, allowing just 75.9
yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time you want to start peaking,'' said weakside
linebacker Cornelius Bennett. ``We're getting plays in quicker. And
when you're rushing the ball well (on offense), everything is
easier.''

NEWS CORP. MAKES $840 MILLION SALE TO ECHOSTAR
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still searching for a way out of the direct-broadcast satellite
business in the United States, the News Corp. said Monday it had
agreed to sell two satellites and their orbital license over the
United States to the Echostar Communications Corp. for about $840
million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom Inc., which as the MCI Communications Corp. was in
a partnership with the News Corp. to buy the license in 1996, would
receive about $209 million in Echostar stock. If the deal is
approved by regulators, MCI Worldcom and the News Corp.together
will own about 37 percent of Echostar.
</P>
<P>
   For Echostar, the No. 4 direct-broadcast satellite operation,
and the News Corp., Monday's announcement could be seen as a
triumph of pragmatism. The two companies have been locked in
litigation, with Echostar suing the News Corp. for $5 billion,
since their first major deal unraveled last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous agreement, the News Corp. was to acquire 50
percent of Echostar for $1 billion. But that deal fell apart amid
bickering over technical standards and harsh condemnation from the
cable television industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, the News Corp. turned to one of Echostar's
main rivals, Primestar Partners, a satellite broadcasting service
headed by the big cable television operators Time Warner Inc. and
Tele-Communications Inc. Under that pact, valued at $1.1 billion,
MCI and the News Corp. were to sell the satellites and license in
exchange for 31 percent of Primestar.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not happen either. In May, the Justice Department
sued to stop that deal, contending it would help the cable
television industry stifle a potential competitor. The pressure
forced the two companies to drop the agreement in October.
</P>
<P>
   That left the News Corp. back where it started: with
underutilized satellite assets and little motivation to go it alone
(even with MCI) in investing the billions needed to build a
direct-broadcast business. The two satellites it agreed to sell to
Echostar have not even been launched yet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Echostar was beginning to feel perhaps a bit nervous
about its larger satellite competitors, which in addition to
Primestar include DirecTV, a unit of the General Motors Corp. In a
conference call with reporters Monday, Echostar executives also
repeatedly mentioned the looming combination of
Tele-Communications, the No. 2 cable television operator, with the
AT&AMP;T Corp., the No. 1 telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   So the News Corp. and Echostar agreed to make peace. The
companies said they would drop their litigation upon completion of
their deal. The News Corp. also agreed to buy 500,000 set-top
converter boxes from Echostar and to allow Echostar to distribute
the Fox News television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Investors cheered the agreement Monday, sending Echostar's
shares to a 52-week high of $38.8125, up $3.8125, in Nasdaq
trading. The News Corp.'s American depository receipts closed at
$28, down 37.5 cents.

STOCKS FALL 2.3 PERCENT IN WAVE OF PROFIT-TAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks had their worst trading session in two months
on Monday, as waves of profit-taking swept through the market.
</P>
<P>
   The declines were broad-based, from computer and drug makers to
banks and financial-service companies and highly speculative
Internet-related stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And it occurred on a day when a sharp drop in commodity prices
sent bond prices soaring and interest rates sharply lower. By late
in the day, yields on the government's benchmark 30-year bond stood
at 5.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent, to 9,116.55. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index dropped 28.70 points, or 2.4 percent, to
1,163.63.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nasdaq Composite index, which is loaded with
computer-related shares, including a number of Internet companies,
fell 66.90 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,949.54. Twice as many
shares fell as rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been expecting a correction in the market averages,
which had risen almost without pause since early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a wonderful run and prices have risen a lot,'' said
Jack Shaughnessy, the chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. in
Boston. ``For people who have made a lot of money in the last few
weeks, it's time to take some profits. But in my judgment the bull
market still has very powerful legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at ISI Group, a New York research and consulting firm,
put the case for a continued run in stocks into historical
perspective Monday. In a weekly letter to clients, ISI noted that
the Dow's 23 percent gain since early October, to a record 9,374.27
on Nov. 23, has been matched just four times in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Following those four prior surges _ which occurred in 1975,
1982, 1986 and 1991 _ the Dow continued to rally over the next
three months by an average of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most striking is that the prior surges were all in
economic environments similar to today's,'' the analysts wrote.
``Namely, all were financial crisis environments with weakening
global activity, declining profits, Fed easings, accelerating money
growth and slowing inflation. Judging by the four prior rallies,
the current rally will continue until the Fed tightens'' monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But computer manufacturers, whose stocks have been among the
year's biggest gainers, were smacked lower. Dell Computer, which is
up more than 175 percent this year, fell 3, to 60 13/16. Apple
Computer, which has gained more than 150 percent since the start of
January, slumped 3 1/8, to 31 15/16. And IBM, which is up more than
50 percent, fell 4 7/8, to 165 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies, another group that has enjoyed good gains in the
last two months, also suffered. Merck fell 3}, to 155 1/8. Pfizer
dropped 2 1/16, to 111 15/16. And Bristol Myers Squibb lost 1 3/8
to 122.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, big gainers since early October, also lost
ground. J.P. Morgan, a Dow component, fell 4 9/16, to 106 7/8.
Chase Manhattan lost 2, to 63 7/16. And Merrill Lynch dropped 5, to
75.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial stocks, Bankers Trust, which is being acquired
by Deutsche Bank for $93 a share, was an exception, with its shares
rising 1 7/16, to 87, after boards from both companies approved the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the sharp drop in Internet-related stocks that was
perhaps the session's most eye-catching development.
</P>
<P>
   Among analysts and traders, these stocks have been a source of
wonder _ and fear _ in recent weeks, because their rapid ascent has
been based on little more than hope. According to many, a sharp
correction among these stocks has been long overdue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Profit-taking doubtless caused some selling of these stocks
Monday. But reports and rumors that a number of brokerage houses
and clearing agents were raising their margin requirements on some
of the hottest Internet stocks may also have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney told clients Monday that it had raised its
margin requirements on a number of Internet stocks, including Ebay,
Books-A-Million and Audio Book Club. And DLJ Direct, the online
stock brokerage owned by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, also
increased margin requirements on a number of Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of trading in these issues is done by retail investors.
Any change in margin requirements would make it more expensive for
individuals seeking to speculate in these issues from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising the margin requirements is a prudent thing to do,''
said one trader who specializes in Nasdaq stocks and asked not to
be identified. ``If you were running a casino, you would be doing
the same thing. And I think it was an aggravating factor in the Net
stocks. This was overdue, but it was anyone's guess when it would
happen or what the catalyst for it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Internet stocks, Egghead.com, which operates three
retail Web sites, and had more than doubled in the last three
trading sessions, fell 6 1/8, to 25 1/2. Amazon.com, the biggest
seller of books and music over the Internet, fell 24 5/8, to 192.
America Online dropped 7 5/16, to 87 9/16. Onsale Inc., a Web
auctioneer, fell 36 1/8, to 61 1/2. And Yahoo slumped 24 15/16, to
192.

   &UR; SO NICE TO SEE YOU &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If, upon making your acquaintance,  &UR; President Clinton &LR;  looks at
you and says, ``Nice tie,'' he's really saying, ``Screw you,''
writes  &UR; Jeannette Walls &LR;  of MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; George Stephanopoulos &LR;  decoded the statement for  &UR; David &LR; 
 &UR; Maraniss &LR; , who wrote the Clinton bio ``First in His Class, &LR; '' and
happened to mention to the former White House aide that the
president had given him that compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Many wearers of ``nice ties'' turn out to be journalists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A ROSY LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  agreed months ago to pose for the cover of
Vogue months ago &LR; , writes editor  &UR; Anna Wintour &LR;  in the December
issue, and be interviewed to promote her Save America's Treasures
project. Despite the eruption of presidential scandal, the posing
took place and the story went forward.
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; Annie Leibovitz &LR;  suggested that the first lady might be
pictured reading a newspaper, she was informed by a White House
aide: ``The first lady does not read newspapers.'' Instead, she
posed in evening clothes and ``at work on the Truman balcony'' in
 &UR; Ralph Lauren &LR;  shirt and carefully applied eyeshadow. The story
itself is gushingly reminiscent of  &UR; Tina Brown &LR; 's effusions after
attending a White House party. Some sample observations from  &UR; Ann &LR; 
 &UR; Douglas &LR; ' essay:
</P>
<P>
   _``When you talk to her, there is no rind, no crust of official
pretense barring the quick of the person from access. She's right

   &UR; SO NICE TO SEE YOU &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If, upon making your acquaintance,  &UR; President Clinton &LR;  looks at
you and says, ``Nice tie,'' he's really saying, ``Screw you,''
writes  &UR; Jeannette Walls &LR;  of MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; George Stephanopoulos &LR;  decoded the statement for  &UR; David &LR; 
 &UR; Maraniss &LR; , who wrote the Clinton bio ``First in His Class, &LR; '' and
happened to mention to the former White House aide that the
president had given him that compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Many wearers of ``nice ties'' turn out to be journalists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A ROSY LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  agreed months ago to pose for the cover of
Vogue months ago &LR; , writes editor  &UR; Anna Wintour &LR;  in the December
issue, and be interviewed to promote her Save America's Treasures
project. Despite the eruption of presidential scandal, the posing
took place and the story went forward.
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; Annie Leibovitz &LR;  suggested that the first lady might be
pictured reading a newspaper, she was informed by a White House
aide: ``The first lady does not read newspapers.'' Instead, she
posed in evening clothes and ``at work on the Truman balcony'' in
 &UR; Ralph Lauren &LR;  shirt and carefully applied eyeshadow. The story
itself is gushingly reminiscent of  &UR; Tina Brown &LR; 's effusions after
attending a White House party. Some sample observations from  &UR; Ann &LR; 
 &UR; Douglas &LR; ' essay:
</P>
<P>
   _``When you talk to her, there is no rind, no crust of official
pretense barring the quick of the person from access. She's right
there, alive from the start _ the first spadeful comes up gold.''
</P>
<P>
   _``I was struck by her height, the level quality of her
blue-eyed gaze, her erect, head-held-high carriage. ... She's in
that small select group of women who are far more beautiful at 50
than they were at 30.''
</P>

SUN IS DEADLY ENEMY FOR 10-YEAR-OLD ARIZONA BOY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `` '' GILBERT, Arizona _
</P>
<P>
   `Between the dark and the daylight,
</P>
<P>
   When the night is beginning to lower,
</P>
<P>
   Comes a pause in the day's occupations,
</P>
<P>
   That is known as the children's hour.'' &QL; 
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow &QL; 
When night falls, the Collin Cassinat hour begins.
</P>
<P>
   As other children take cover from the darkness, Collin's
playtime is just beginning. Under the moonlight, he races his bike,
catches frogs, hunts bugs and exhilarates in his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine is no friend to Collin. Exposures of just minutes would
cause his skin to redden, burn and blister. An overdose would kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Collin, 9, is a child of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Born with a genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum, in
which the cells of the body lack the ability to repair DNA damage
from ultraviolet rays, Collin's best chance for survival is to
avoid all sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Windows in his family's Gilbert home near Phoenix are tinted and
covered with blinds. The family van is outfitted with blackout
curtains. When Collin goes outside during the day, he is swaddled
head to toe in long sleeves, long pants and a cap with a flap in
the back that makes him look like the youngest soldier in the
French Foreign Legion. He huddles under a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Cindy and Tony Cassinat, estimate their son is
exposed to no more than five minutes of sunshine a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad'' is how Collin describes his sheltered life. Yet he's a
bright, chipper youngster with an impish personality and no lack of
friends. Two little girls have appointed themselves his escorts
between school buildings when he is wrapped so tightly against the
sun he can't see through his protective garb.
</P>
<P>
   At recess, classmates vie for the chance to stay indoors with
Collin and play field hockey in the halls.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there are advantages to having XP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get spoiled,'' he said with a grin, ``by my teacher, then my
mama, then my dad, then my principal.''
</P>
<P>
   Collin was once invited to a sleep-over at the Phoenix Zoo. Last
summer he went to Camp Sundown in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where young
campers with XP enjoyed indoor activities during the day and played
outside long into the night.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting alone in a darkened van parked where he can watch
his sister's soccer practice, his eyes get a bit teary as he counts
down the minutes until sunset when he can break out of the van and
run free.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:34 p.m., the Collin hour begins.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Cassinat first noticed something alarming about her third
son in February 1989. Six weeks old, Collin had been sitting
outside in his stroller, bundled against the chill. The next day he
appeared to have eczema on his cheeks _ crusty, scabby, oozing
patches.
</P>
<P>
   With a little research, Cindy learned that sunlight could help
dry up eczema, so she took Collin outside again. When the
``eczema'' spread to his arms, her pediatrician prescribed a
cortisone salve.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis: Fair Irish skin. Treatment: Keep that boy out of the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Collin spent his toddler years covered in sunscreen, playing
indoors or in the shade. He wore hats and long-sleeved shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``His skin was always dry and cracky a little bit,'' Tony
Cassinat said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cindy read a newspaper article about Julian Nieves
Armenta, a 4-year-old Mexican boy being treated for XP at Maricopa
Medical Center and introduced at a University of Arizona medical
symposium. Multiple skin cancers covered his head and dotted his
eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Julian's condition, minus the numerous malignancies, sounded
remarkably like Collin's, Cindy thought.
</P>
<P>
   A UA dermatologist confirmed her suspicions. In 20 years of
practice in pediatric dermatology, Dr. Ron Hansen had seen just two
cases of XP. Julian was one. Collin was the other. Most doctors
don't see any.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 130 cases exist in the country, with an estimated
1,000 worldwide. Collin's is the only known case in Arizona, the
Cassinats say.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme freckling and photophobia _ severe discomfort in the sun
_ are the earliest symptoms. Those signs should be detected by age
1 or 2; then protection can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking a nocturnal person,'' Hansen said. ``Even a
minute or two of sun is enough DNA damage to have skin cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreen is a puny weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a diagnosis, the Cassinats devoted themselves to
shielding Collin and instilled in him a sense of self-protection.
If someone opens a window or raises a shade, he'll cry out,
``You're killing me!'' Cindy said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, his cries are all too true.
</P>
<P>
   Undiagnosed and unprotected, children with XP usually die by the
age of 10. Protected, they can enjoy a life expectancy of about 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his parents, Collin should have nearly a normal life
span, Hansen said: ``Collin will do much better. They were very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   `NOT ONE TO MOPE'
</P>
<P>
   At Greenfield Elementary School, third-grader Collin blends in
with the other pupils. Only his UV-protective jacket gives him
away.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom windows are shaded, doors to the outside kept shut.
Collin spends his day inside, except for a weekly dash to the
building next door where art classes are held. That's when Diana
Hancock and Amanda Schreck guide their friend across campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help me so I don't run into stuff,'' Collin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he does run into stuff _ the school, a tree. Sometimes
he trips. But he picks himself up and forges on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not one to mope,'' said his teacher, Sue Villa. ``He
doesn't feel sorry for himself. . . . He's a great little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Villa takes Collin's special needs in stride. When the school
had its fall festival, she arranged indoor events. When the class
was mandated to clean up school grounds for a lesson in ecology,
she sent them to the cafeteria to pick up trash. She creates indoor
science projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always other ways to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Collin's future in school is uncertain. When he graduates to
Greenfield Junior High School in three years, his parents will have
to evaluate the facility for safety. Are windows tinted? Will all
classes be in one building?
</P>
<P>
   The Cassinats pray the next school will be as accessible as this
one. Cindy pulls her van as close as possible to the front door at
Greenfield Elementary, and Collin races in. Once, when the driveway
was blocked by a van collision, she commandeered the delivery
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can continue in a normal school,'' Tony said.
``That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   If the junior high proves unacceptable, the Cassinats won't
hesitate to ask for modifications to protect their son. If the
building can't meet their needs, they'll be forced to home school
him, further isolating a boy who already lives a life apart.
</P>
<P>
   A CALCULATED SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   The odds that Collin would be born with XP are phenomenal. To
produce the condition, both parents must be carriers of an aberrant
recessive gene. The chances of one partner being a carrier are one
in 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, fate determined that Cindy, who grew up in California,
and Tony, a native of Wyoming, should meet, marry and have four
children. And one of those children would inherit a pair of XP
genes.
</P>
<P>
   News of that genetic fluke came as a blow, Tony says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at you and say your son can not go outside any more.
The next day we told the kids. That was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tony insists Collin's needs don't control their lives,
they live on a calculated schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, Cindy knows exactly when the sun sets. Collin
heads outside 10 minutes later. In the summer, that can be as late
at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There have been just two family vacations _ to Lake Tahoe in
1996 and to Camp Sundown last year.
</P>
<P>
   While his two brothers, Chris, 16, and Craig, 12, and sister
Courtney, 8, are hooked on sports, Collin shines in the chess club.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a restaurant before sunset means wrapping Collin ``like
a soft taco,'' Cindy said, and ignoring the stares of patrons. The
explanation, when asked for, is that the boy is allergic to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Collin's diagnosis, the family moved from a
1,100-square foot house into a new 4,000-square-foot house,
quadrupling Collin's indoor world. With living room furniture kept
sparse, he was allowed to roller skate inside until the wheels
became too dirty. Tracks in the carpeting were a small price to pay
to let a boy burn off energy.
</P>
<P>
   But Collin still lives life upside down. When other children are
playing outside, he's peering at them from his front window. When
he's outside, his friends are already in for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sunshine world out there,'' Tony said. ``People open
their windows and let the sun shine in. This goes against what
society is brought up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Because XP is so rare, little scientific research is being done.
For the time being, treatment means vigilence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word is `no sun.' We make judgment calls on what is
worthwhile,'' Tony said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassinats are scrupulous about checking Collin's skin for
suspicious spots. So far, he's had more than 30 removed; 20 were
cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' Cindy said, ``but we wish they wouldn't
keep popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Collin is lucky. Some children with XP suffer blindness,
hearing loss, neurological impairment and mental retardation,
although the connection is unclear. Despite some minor learning
disabilities, Collin is smart and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For a boy whose enemy is the sun, Arizona would seem the evil
empire. In truth, the Valley of the Sun is Collin's best friend.
Phoenix has no more ultraviolet rays than cloudy Seattle. Clouds do
not block UV rays.
</P>
<P>
   And where else could a boy play outside after dark all year
round? Not Minnesota. Not North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORT GROUP OF 1
</P>
<P>
   Because Collin is the only child with XP in Arizona, there is no
one with whom to commiserate. He is a support group of one.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy said, ``You're looking at XP-AZ right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet (www.xps.org/) is the Cassinats' link to XP parents
across the country. At Camp Sundown, they learned families cope as
best they can with the rare illness, keeping abreast of the few
developments in the field.
</P>
<P>
   A UV monitor, which detects ultraviolet rays, can alert parents
to dangerous levels of sunlight. But it is an expensive tool the
Cassinats can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising innovation is a pint-size space suit developed
by NASA. When perfected, it will shield children from UV light
outdoors. Although several models have been constructed, however,
the XP Society has not yet endorsed any design, believing current
suits offer only a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   Collin tries to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants one,'' Cindy said. ``He asks for one all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing outside during daylight hours is still only a dream for
Collin.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can break a mother's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get down,'' Cindy said, ``but I can just start
thinking about him and start crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never ask, `Why us?' '' she said, with a smile she's been
practicing for a decade, sustained by the words of a friend who
told her, `` `He's here for a very important reason. He has this
disease for a very important reason.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After sunset, those reasons mean little to a boy at play. Collin
has captured a toad, and in his victory, the child of the night
comes alive. &QL;

ORIOLES STAND BETWEEN METS AND FREE-AGENT HELP
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Baltimore Orioles' sudden interest in Albert
Belle last week compelled the Yankees to sign Bernie Williams. Now
the Orioles' machinations are having a major impact on New York's
other team, the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff, the free-agent outfielder, will meet with Mets
officials Tuesday, but the sense of several baseball executives is
that the Orioles will lure Surhoff back into their lineup by week's
end. If Surhoff is the priority for the Mets, then Robin Ventura is
second in line _ and the Orioles are bidding heavily for Ventura,
as well. And the Boston Red Sox are also interested in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed the Orioles have increased their three-year,
$13.5 million offer to Surhoff to $14.5 million _ an annual salary
of $4.5 million for each of three years, plus an option for a
fourth year with a $1 million buyout. Surhoff, who also has a
three-year offer from the Mets, could qualify automatically for a
fourth year with the Orioles if he plays in a predetermined number
of games (perhaps 140) in the contract's third year. He also has a
four-year offer for about $17 million from the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Last year, the 34-year-old Surhoff hit .279 with career highs of 22
home runs and 92 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were hosts to Brian Jordan two weeks ago, eventually
made him an offer and seemed to accomplish little more than
increase his negotiating leverage before the outfielder signed with
Atlanta. Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said he felt
there were similarities in this meeting with Surhoff, ``but I also
see some differences, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If not Surhoff, the Mets could sign Ventura. But the Orioles are
believed to be offering Ventura a four-year, $32 million contract,
or $1 million a season more than the Mets. The Orioles, expected to
announce the signing of Belle Tuesday, could use Belle in left
field, Surhoff in right and Ventura at third base and move Cal
Ripken to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is preparing for the possibility that he will not sign
either Surhoff or Ventura. He expects to meet with left fielder
Rickey Henderson this week and has had constant talks with the
Milwaukee Brewers about second baseman Fernando Vina, who would
fill the need for a leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets sign Ventura, Edgardo Alfonzo will move from third
base to second. Phillips said that he had spoken with Alfonzo and
that he would readily agree to change positions. Alfonzo, Phillips
said, asked that the Mets tell him as quickly as possible what
position he will be playing.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the most ambitious attempt yet by a
European bank to compete on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank AG announced
plans on Monday for a $10.1 billion takeover of Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would be the largest foreign takeover of an
American bank and would vault Deutsche Bank over UBS AG of
Switzerland and the new Citigroup as the world's biggest bank in
terms of assets. The deal is the most vivid illustration to date of
how banking has become more global and it may lead to others making
cross-border deals.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Bank's increased global reach will come at a cost:
The bank announced plans to eliminate 5,500 jobs, mostly in New
York and London. The bank's chairman, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, said the
job cuts, which would come out of a combined work force of more
than 20,000 in the two cities, would not all be at Bankers Trust.
Still, the cuts would come at a time of retrenchment on Wall
Street, as Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and others have recently
announced job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the deal here Monday, there were no platitudes
about a ``merger of equals'' or about the need for deference to
cultural and institutional differences. Breuer made it clear he
would shape the new enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in autonomy as an instrument of management
and leadership,'' Breuer said at a news conference. ``As far as it
goes, we want a centralized management of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   With that approach, Deutsche Bank is trying to avoid repeating
past mistakes. Over the last decade, it has spent freely to build
up its investment banking business _ with largely disappointing
results. It acquired the British investment bank Morgan Grenfell in
1989, and paid billions to acquire star bankers and to expand
operations in London and New York, giving the bankers wide freedom.
When costs began to soar, Breuer re-asserted control, and top
American executives defected.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating power in Franfurt, Deutsche Bank created waves
in New York and London. But Monday, Breuer seemed to be trying for
a straddling position that would maintain central control while
also retaining key executives on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The company has committed some $400 million in bonus payments to
retain top Bankers Trust managers, including Frank Newman, chairman
and chief executive of Bankers Trust, who will be the only
executive receiving a seat on Deutsche Bank's management board.
Some Bankers Trust executives will receive $10 million or more each
to stay on. The boards of both companies approved the acquisition,
which had been expected for more than a week, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Bank fell 2.2 percent, to
104.65 marks ($61.77), as some analysts expressed skepticism about
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The goals Deutsche Bank has set for itself _ an increase in
earnings per share of 10 to 15 percent by 2001 _ are ``incredibly
ambitious,'' said Diane Glossman, a banking analyst at Lehman
Brothers Holdings. ``The greatest challenge will be consolidating
the cultures in a way that allows them to increase their earnings.
That's crucial, and it's an area where Deutsche Bank has dropped
the ball before.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Bankers Trust rose 1.7
percent, to $87, still shy of the $93 a share offered by Deutsche
Bank. The stock has risen 21 percent since speculation of a deal
emerged on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes amid a wave of big international mergers by
German companies. Daimler-Benz has just completed its merger with
Chrysler Corp. Bertelsmann AG, the publishing and media
conglomerate, is buying the publisher Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Deutsche Bank's agreement with Banker's Trust is only
one of three big deals this week. Hoechst AG, the chemicals giant,
has reached an agreement to merge its pharmaceutical and
agricultural businesses with those of Rhone-Poulenc of France. And
Viag AG, an industrial conglomerate in Munich, will merge with
Algroup of Switzerland in a deal worth $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the mergers reflect a new-found strength and
assertiveness in European corporations. But analysts say that many
deals are a sign of weakness, a need to shore up competitive lapses
that companies cannot resolve at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this is a corporate response to the difficulties at
growing earnings in a low-growth, low-inflation environment,'' said
George Hodgson, head of equity research at ABN Amro. Collectively,
he noted, the companies involved in this year's 10 largest European
mergers have underperformed the overall European stock market by
about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bankers Trust deal is expected to draw attention to several
lawsuits in the United States against the German bank over issues
of slave labor during World War II. Though Deutsche Bank did not
itself employ slave labor, it has been named along with industrial
giants like Siemens and Daimler-Benz. Lawsuits against Swiss banks
over wealth plundered by the Nazis led to a $1.25 billion
settlement last summer, largely because New York state regulators
insisted on an agreement before allowing the merged bank to operate
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi is considering filing a
lawsuit seeking to block the deal because of Holocaust issues,
people who have been briefed on the plans said Monday. Hevesi's
office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is subject to approval by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, but that is not expected to be a major obstacle. Deutsche
Bank does own a 12 percent stake in DaimlerChrysler, and while
common in Germany, ownership in industrial companies is prohibited
under U.S. banking laws. But Deutsche Bank, which said last week
that it was not planning to sell its stake, has an exemption to
this prohibition under legislation passed by Congress in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's desire for a big American institution has been
no secret. The bank's dominance at home has been eroded by
increasing competition, and big Wall Street investment banks like
Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs have been winning lucrative work
advising big European companies on mergers and acquisitions.
Deutsche Bank, which had been courting Bankers Trust since the
summer, is believed to have also actively looked at possible deals
with J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse Group, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust would give Deutsche Bank a middle-rank investment
banking firm. A subsidiary, BT Alex. Brown, continues to have a
strong franchise in bringing younger companies public, and Bankers
Trust itself has a sizable business in underwriting high-yield junk
bonds. Though junk bonds are still scarce in Europe, they are
attracting new interestas more companies undergo management
buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have a substantial business in trading
fixed-income securities, one of the few areas in investment banking
where Deutsche Bank has had real success. And both companies have a
big business in the obscure but lucrative area of custodial
services, the service of acting as a guardian for securities.
</P>
<P>
   But the takeover of Bankers Trust will not catapult Deutsche
Bank into the top ranks of American investment banks, a goal Breuer
has long had in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Breuer contended Monday that Bankers Trust was
Deutsche Bank's ideal partner. The combined company would become
the fourth-biggest money manager in the world, after UBS; Fidelity
Investments, the American mutual fund giant, and the Japanese
postal system's life insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many analysts Monday, Breuer insisted that he
had never wanted to take over a top Wall Street firm and disputed
widespread speculation that Deutsche Bank had settled on Bankers
Trust simply because it was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a response of the fox to sour grapes,'' Breuer
said, adding that his bank had ``never looked'' at so-called
``bulge-bracket'' investment banks at the top ranks of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulge-bracket banks are not universal banks like we are,''
he said. ``Deutsche bank would have in the end had to become a
completely different kind f bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will force Deutsche Bank to raise new capital to
shore up its balance sheet. That is because the $10.1 billion
purchase price for Bankers Trust is far higher than its tangible
value, which is about $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer said the bank would organize a new stock offering of 4
billion marks ($2.35 billion). Without elaborating, he said the
bank would raise additional money by issuing ``hybrid'' securities,
like convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now look forward to this next truly major step,'' said
Newman, who engineered much of Bankers Trust's expansion by
orchestrating the acquisition of Alex. Brown and other firms. ``I
don't speak German, at least not yet,'' Newman told a news
conference here Monday morning. ``I will take lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the organizational lineup leaves little doubt that Deutsche
Bank executives will be in charge. Breuer placed himself in charge
of the five-person ``transition team,'' and Newman is the only
person from Bankers Trust included.
</P>
<P>
   Though Breuer said he had no interest in additional American
acquisitions, he is still on the prowl in Europe. The bank has long
wanted to build a position in France, but the French government
remains hostile to foreign banks' acquiring French institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expansion in Europe is sti,l in the offing,'' Breuer said.
Despite the $10 billion being paid for Bankers Trust, he added,
money would not be a problem. ``Our shareholders, if the story is
right, will be more than ready to furnish more money.''

MUSEUM SEEKS ANSWERS ABOUT MONET'S HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE   AND WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Museum of Fine Arts moved Monday to confirm
revelations that a Monet waterlily displayed in a major Boston
exhibition of the Impressionist's work was probably confiscated by
the Nazis from a prominent French Jewish art collector.
</P>
<P>
   If verified by the Art Loss Register in London and the French
national museum system, which loaned the painting, ``Water Lilies
1904'' to the MFA, the artwork could soon be returned to the
descendants of Paul Rosenberg, the Paris collector who fled the
Nazis and whose heirs live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations were reported Saturday and Monday in the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The French national museum system has held the painting since
1950, only a few years after the artwork was repatriated from the
wartime collection of Adolph Hitler's foreign minister, Joachim von
Ribbentrop, who was hanged for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Monday, MFA Director Malcolm Rogers
maintained that the museum cannot be held responsible for not
discovering that the painting, which has been held at the Musee des
Beaux-Arts in Caen, may have been plundered from its owners by the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question that should be directed to the French,''
Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the MFA has said it examines the background of its
artwork, whether in permanent exhibit or on loan, Rogers said that
searching for the owner of paintings with ``troubled histories,''
such as the waterlilies work, is often akin to finding a needle in
a haystack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should people be blamed for responsible guardianship?'' he
said. ``That's absolute nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is scheduled to go next to the Royal Academy of
Arts in London. MFA officials said it is too early to tell whether
that exhibition will proceed as planned.
</P>
<P>
   However, art law specialists widely expect that once the Boston
exhibition is over, the painting will go back to France and the
Rosenbergs will make their claim.
</P>
<P>
   Once the revelations have been confirmed, Rogers said, the MFA
is prepared to add text beside the painting that will discuss the
Nazis' seizure of art during World War II. Now, a title card beside
the work simply states that ``Water Lilies 1904'' was ``recovered
after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting is one of 1,955 artworks now in French custody that
were recovered from Germany after the war. &UR;  &LR; Ownership of the works
has not been determined by the French, who nevertheless acknowledge
they made no serious effort to find the rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the waterlily painting between 1933 and 1950 had
been unknown, according to Paul Tucker, guest curator for the Monet
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it got into and out of the Rosenberg
collection,'' said Tucker, who teaches at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston. Tucker added that it is unknown how Von
Ribbentrop obtained the painting.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork has been displayed in eight major exhibitions in 10
cities around the world since 1980, Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the World Jewish Congress said it will demand at a
45-nation meeting on plundered possessions of Holocaust victims,
beginning Tuesday Washington, that France sell the 1,955 artworks
and donate the revenue to Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the MFA said it fulfilled its obligation, Jonathan
Petropoulos, the Nazi art-looting expert who helped the Globe pin
down the painting's ownership, expressed disappointment Monday that
museums like the MFA do not devote more resources to ensuring that
their art collections do not contain war loot.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the ease with which the Monet's ownership was identified
by the Art Loss Register _ and how quickly he himself matched it to
a photo of the looted work in his own book _ Petropoulos said the
MFA should have been able to do the same thing with its resources.
</P>
<P>
   Had any of the show's curators simply leafed through his book,
``Politics as Art in the Third Reich,'' they would have had
evidence that the painting was plundered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Petropoulos said the principal failure lies with the French. But
all major museums, he said, ``have wonderful libraries and files
and expertise, and the ability to enlist the cooperation of other
museums and art dealers in search of verifying information. They
need to use those resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lefart, a spokesman for the French Embassy in
Washington, said his government is examining the issue. But he said
he expects that the appropriate course will be for the MFA ``to
repatriate the painting to Paris, and to have the claim analyzed
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, the MFA director, said the painting will remain on
display for the duration of the exhibition, ``Monet in the 20th
Century,'' which ends Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's American descendants, who have backgrounds in
dealing and collecting art, said they have no wish to disrupt the
MFA exhibition, and approve of the museum's decision to keep the
painting on exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Though the family is weighing its legal options, an official at
the US Information Agency said the USIA gave the MFA standard
protection from seizure for all of the loaned works from abroad,
including the Monet waterlily at issue. The protection is granted
to facilitate the international sharing of art.
</P>
<P>
   It was the New York Museum of Modern Art's failure to seek such
protection almost a year ago that opened the door for Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau to subpoena two Austrian
paintings on loan to MoMA after two Americans claimed the paintings
were looted from their family during World War II. Those paintings,
by Egon Schiele, remain mired in litigation in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA, in its application to the USIA, notified the agency
that the Monet waterlily from the Caen museum had an incomplete
history and had been recovered after the war. A USIA official said
the MFA's notice that the painting lacked an identifiable owner was
the appropriate step for the MFA to take.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON FALLS BACK ON OLD STRATEGY IN DEALINGS WITH
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH, RENO-ICKES) 
(sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``No accused,'' President Clinton's lawyers wrote
in September in response to perjury accusations leveled by Kenneth
Starr, ``has an obligation to help his accuser.''
</P>
<P>
   That creed has guided Clinton this troublesome year as he has
dodged questions from Paula Jones' lawyers, from Starr's
prosecutors, and, now, from the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Monday said that Clinton will decline the
Judiciary Committee's invitation to appear before it to answer
additional questions and to defend his actions. The president is
under no obligation to help those who are trying to do him in, said
Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has answered the questions of the committee, he
sat and answered the questions from the independent counsel. So I
don't expect that you'll see the president any time in the near
future talking to members of the committee,'' Lockhart said,
explaining Clinton's refusal to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's written replies to the committee's 81 questions,
delivered late Friday, were of a piece with the approach he has
taken all year to the allegations in the Monica Lewinsky matter _
concede nothing, recall little, attack the accusers, play for time
and use contrition as both a shield and a spear.
</P>
<P>
   All these tactics were on display in the president's 24-page
response to the Judiciary Committee's questions and in White House
comments on it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers say that the panel was not looking for facts
in the detailed questionnaire. Rather, they say, the Republican
majority on the committee had handed Clinton a loaded gun and asked
him to put it to his own head.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his lawyers said no dice.
</P>
<P>
   Except for matters of incontrovertible fact _ the dates of
meetings, the times of telephone calls _ Clinton contested every
allegation and disputed every witness against him.
</P>
<P>
   He would not even give a simple answer to the question of
whether he was the nation's chief law enforcement officer, the
committee's very first query.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President is frequently referred to as the chief
law-enforcement officer, although nothing in the Constitution
specifically designates the President as such,'' Clinton replied.
``Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution states
that `[t)he executive power shall be vested in a President of the
United States of America,' and the law-enforcement function is a
component of the executive power.''
</P>
<P>
   The answers to the remaining questions were similar in tone.
There was no perjury, no witness tampering, no obstruction of
justice, no abuse of power, Clinton repeatedly asserted. If the
committee wanted to impeach him, he said, it should expect no help
from him. And if Starr or his successors as independent counsel
should chose to indict Clinton after he leaves office, they, too,
can expect no cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally true statements cannot be the basis for a perjury
prosecution, even if a witness intends to mislead the questioner,''
Clinton's lawyers wrote in response to Starr's allegations of
perjury in his impeachment referral to Congress in September.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House aide said that Clinton was responding in
the same spirit as the questions that were put to him all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you subject a president to a legal process,'' the aide
said, ``no one should be surprised that you get legalistic
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and the president's lawyers said that
Clinton was not being obstructionist. They say they firmly believe
that whatever else Clinton may be guilty of _ and they readily
concede caddish behavior and misleading statements _ he is not
guilty of impeachable or indictable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   They are far too sophisticated to fall into the Judiciary
Committee's perjury trap, after having faced the same sorts of
questions from Ms. Jones' lawyers in January and Starr's
interrogators in August. So rather than devising new answers to old
questions, they fell back on the old answers.
</P>
<P>
   The document submitted to the Judiciary Committee repeatedly
refers back to responses given by the president in his August grand
jury testimony and in his January deposition in the Jones lawsuit.
And the president repeats, mantra-like, ``That testimony was not
false or misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   To concede otherwise would be to plead guilty to crimes with
which the president has yet to be formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton refrains from imputing partisan motives to his
questioners on the committee, his aides do not shy from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were determined to use this against us, no matter what
the answers were,'' said one member of the president's legal team.
``Their game plan is to avoid the larger reality, which is they are
lacking public support and lacking the proper standards for
impeachment. Exercises such as this are part of their partisan
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The president gave his Democratic defenders on the committee at
least a little ammunition with which to defend him. He says
repeatedly in his responses that he misled his aides and the nation
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and that he has publicly
apologized for it.
</P>
<P>
   But his contrition is a weapon as well, designed to remind the
public of the private nature of his offenses and to bring shame
upon his accusers for dragging him _ and the country _ through the
muck.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this long ago ceased to be primarily a legal or
political issue, and became instead a painful personal one,'' the
president wrote in an introduction to his replies to the committee.
``I hope these answers will contribute to a speedy and fair
resolution of this matter.''

EVEN ON THE BAD DAYS, BRONCOS ARE INVINCIBLE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ This is how confident the Denver Broncos are.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darrien Gordon was San Diego's No. 1 draft pick in
1993 and spent four years with the Chargers before signing with the
Broncos as a free agent. He came home on Sunday, and in one of the
best single-game performances by a defensive back this season, he
had three tackles, two interceptions, three passes knocked down and
one fumble recovery. Most players would take the shy role after the
game, playing down their performance, not wanting to attract
attention to themselves. Gordon did the opposite, maybe because,
deep down, he knows this team is unstoppable and it really does not
matter what he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my house,'' Gordon said, pointing to the Chargers'
Qualcomm Stadium. ``I built this house.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Shanahan usually scripts Denver's opening 12 to 15
offensive plays. On the Broncos' first possession in their 31-16
bashing of the Chargers, quarterback John Elway fumbled the snap.
The turnover was converted into a San Diego field goal. The
Chargers had momentum. The record crowd of 66,523 was on its feet.
The stomach of most coaches might tighten up in a knot and those
scripted plays would be tossed into the garbage. But Shanahan kept
his cool. He stuck to the script. Next possession, Ed McCaffrey had
a 15-yard touchdown catch. The possession after that, McCaffrey had
a 37-yard touchdown catch. Denver took back control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike never loses his head,'' Broncos defensive end Neil Smith
said. ``That's the biggest reason why we're 12-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve victories, no losses and, with four regular-season games
to play, history is knocking at the door.
</P>
<P>
   But if Denver goes on to win all its remaining games, will the
Chargers game, one of the ugliest of the year, hurt the Broncos'
chances for being considered the greatest team ever? One view is
that the Broncos are so good, they were able to overcome a first
half in which Elway threw three interceptions and the Chargers
outgained the Broncos in total offense, 194 yards to 152.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see every game the Dolphins played?'' Pat Bowlen, the
Broncos owner, asked, referring to the 1972 Miami team that went
undefeated. ``If at the end of the year we're 19-0, there's no
reason you wouldn't consider this team one of the better teams in
history, if not the greatest. You can't take a game like we played
tonight and hold that up as evidence that they're not. All great
teams have bad games, but they find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Chargers Coach June Jones said: ``I believe they are a very good
football team. Maybe as good as I've looked at offensively in the
20 years I've been around the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The other view is that professional football has become so
diluted, with 31 teams, that any potential Denver claim to being
the best will be weakened. The Chargers, who missed at least six
starters because of injuries, are composed of some players who only
months ago were playing football in Europe. They started a
quarterback in Craig Whelihan who was 0-7 as a starter last season,
and they still outgained Denver, 367 yards to 322, and limited
running back Terrell Davis to 74 yards on 24 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beatable,'' said Whelihan, whose five interceptions
were the most by a Chargers quarterback since Dan Fouts threw five
in 1986 against the Giants. ``They're definitely beatable. I wish
we played them again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers may have had the best chance to knock off Denver
because the Broncos were not at their best. ``This was the night to
beat them,'' Chargers General Manager Bobby Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has games at home against Kansas City, at the Giants, at
Miami and at home against Seattle. The only team with a winning
record remaining on the Broncos' schedule are the 8-4 Dolphins.
None of those teams have the offensive firepower to keep up with
the Broncos, who have outscored opponents in the first quarter,
131-23, and have a variety of weapons. If Elway is having a bad
day, he can hand the ball off to Davis. If Davis is slowed, Elway
can look for tight end Shannon Sharpe. If Sharpe is covered, there
are wide receivers McCaffrey and Rod Smith, two Pro Bowl players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Broncos were very good,'' Chargers defensive back Charles
Dimry said. ``I think they'll go 16-0 to close out the regular
season.'' &QL;

NFL OFFICIALS EMBARRASS THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Got a whistle? Swell. You're hired
</P>
<P>
   Well those silly, old geezers of American sports, the NFL
officials, are front and center again.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, they are being accused of deciding more games than
the runs of Terrell Davis, or the passes of Brett Favre, or the
receptions of Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL mandarins got rid of the instant replay a few years ago
ostensibly because of its excessive cost and its disruption of
games, but the real reason they got rid of it is because it too
often exposed the continual ineptitude of NFL officials.
</P>
<P>
   They should bring it back.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Faster than Jerry Markbreit can blow a call. Faster than Jerry
Seeman can come up with excuses. Faster than Paul Tagliabue can
dissemble.
</P>
<P>
   I never thought I'd live to see some pedagogic official actually
call pass interference on a Hail Mary pass into the end zone as I
did in the waning seconds of Sunday's Buffalo-New England match.
</P>
<P>
   Not in high school. Not in college. And certainly not in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But I should have known better in the latter, having watched NFL
officials up close for the past three decades tarnish so many
games.
</P>
<P>
   I should have known they are capable of incompetence beyond
comprehension. These dullards can't even get the overtime coin flip
right, as was the case in the Thanksgiving Day game between
Pittsburgh and Detroit. Why would I think they would prudently be
able to refrain from their natural law-and-order, I'm-in-charge
instincts to drop a flag on a Hail Mary play in which players from
both sides are furiously jostling for position? Why would I think
they could keep their intrusive, meddlesome selves from deciding
the outcome of another game?
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen a call made like that in such a circumstance,
but it never should have had to be made in the first place because
on the game's previous play the officials gave New England, on a
fourth-down pass, a first down even though its receiver clearly
caught the ball out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   And the NFL hierarchy becomes enraged when sports talk show
zealots keep intimating that gambling hanky-panky no pun intended
might have something to do with the spate of bad calls?
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that is the case, but it's indisputable millions of
dollars shifted hands when New England, a point and a half
favorite, emerged victorious by four over the Bills only because
the NFL officials once again embarrassed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I've been saying for an eternity that these insufferably
nit-picking, let-me-decide-the-outcome-of-a-game-
</P>
<P>
   rather-than-the-players, drop-a-flag-every-chance-
I-get-to-get-my-mug-on-TV-group of myopic bumblers just might be
the worst arbiters on the planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the NFL find these yokels who have become such an
annoying nuisance in almost every game I've watched this fall? Did
they raid the jurisprudence system of Third World countries? Did
they decide to hire all those misfits who failed auditions to
appear on the Howard Stern Show? Did they pluck off the street all
those unemployed Kofi Annan UN inspectors rejected by Saddam
Hussein? Or do they randomly pull out of the stands before each NFL
game six volunteers who all solemnly admit (a) they have poor
eyesight (b) they are in poor shape, (c) they have poor judgment
and (d) they have a poor understanding of the game of football.
</P>
<P>
   Watching NFL games long has been excruciating enough as it is
without a Los Angeles affiliate to stir my passions and with all
those cornball self-congratulatory antics among the performers, but
now I've found the exercise almost unbearable because of the
wayward deportment of the officials that has reached dizzying new
depths.
</P>
<P>
   I dream of that blessed day when I can watch an NFL game without
almost every kickoff or punt return being called back because of a
perceived illegal block, or without phantom holding calls, or
without marginal pass interference calls, or, indeed, without the
officials playing a determining factor in the final score.
</P>
<P>
   I've always felt the NFL officials easily have been the most
incompetent working major league sports, but this year they've
surpassed even past ignominy, rendering enough blown calls week
after cloying week to make one wonder why their boss back at 280
Park Avenue in New York, Jerry Seeman, doesn't cashier the whole
lousy bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Mr. Seeman was once one himself a notorious TV ham who was
inclined to drop his hanky at the sight of an imagined misdemeanor
and this awful collection he's put together has been a dark
commentary on his misguided leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It's become quite obvious that the NFL officials are trying to
live up to Seeman's lowly standards. Unfortunately, Seeman was a
guy who savored his TV time and habitually called ticky-tack
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Seeman has all sorts of worthy successors in guys like
Markbreit, Johnny Grier, Tom White, Bob McElwee and the notorious
Dick Hantak, whose flag-obsessed crew you swear was recruited from
those misfits on the Mariel Boatlift and is Castro's revenge on
America.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has made some inane decisions across the years not
having a team in L.A. is one but miking the referees has to rank as
the worst. They now act like they're doing a take for Steven
Spielberg when they're announcing an infraction.
</P>
<P>
   I hear Jerry Markbreit finally is retiring this year. Good
riddance! The guy has had a longer TV life than Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the accountability for all these inane calls?
</P>
<P>
   The same awful officials seem to pollute the NFL scene every
season.
</P>
<P>
   Players get put on waivers, or fined for illegal hits.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't officials face the same punishment for miscalculations
that can cost a coach his job?
</P>
<P>
   As I've long said, the NFL should hire full-time officials, as
there are in the NHL, NBA and major league baseball. These weekend
warriors they're employing now should stick to teaching school, or
quoting stock prices, or practicing law, or doing whatever they do
when they're not on football fields around the countries on Sunday
afternoons doing nothing more meaningful than inciting outrage.

INS TO TEMPORARILY RELEASE 3,000 CENTRAL AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JO ANN ZUNIGA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ About 400 Honduran and other Central American
immigrants locally, and up to 3,000 nationally, will be temporarily
released by the Immigration and Naturalization Service starting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials said the Central American governments cannot
receive any deportations at this time because of the ravaged
conditions in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Only those immigrants with nonviolent backgrounds will be
released to supervision of next of kin or nonprofit agencies until
the United States can deport them to their country of origin, said
local INS spokeswoman Luisa Aquino.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not include temporary protected status or work
authorization,'' she said. ``But we do want to make sure they are
linked with family or an organization that can provide shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   A main reason for the release was to give the immigrants a
better chance of learning whether their families in their countries
survived the storm.
</P>
<P>
   But practically, Aquino said, space would have become a problem
if INS would have simply continued storing the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not a threat to society, it is unfair to keep them
behind bars until they can be sent home,'' Aquino said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 Central Americans, mostly Hondurans, held a brief
hunger strike in November in the Bayview Detention Center in South
Texas. They wanted to be deported to their damaged homelands so
they could find out about their families.
</P>
<P>
   Aquino said those protesters will also be considered for
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The detainees will be released on a case-by-case basis,'' she
said. ``They will remain under the authorization of the INS and
under proceedings for removal.''
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said in Washington that the
agency has been working with non-governmental organizations active
in the immigrant community to seek their assistance in this
program.
</P>
<P>
   INS earlier extended the temporary suspension of deportations of
illegal immigrants from the Mitch-devastated countries of El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua through Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But some immigrant advocates want the government to allow the
immigrants temporary protected status.
</P>
<P>
   This status, which can be granted up to 18 months and would
allow the immigrants to work, could be given to them because it
applies to citizens of countries affected by ``environmental
disaster resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of
living conditions,'' advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   Benito Juarez, spokesman for the Houston Immigration and Refugee
Coalition, said, ``We believe the releases will help a little bit,
especially for those detained to find out about their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they need to be able to work to help those families.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant advocates are encouraging congressional
representatives and Attorney General Janet Reno to support
temporary protected status, Juarez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be reviewed again once the Jan. 7 extension
is ending,'' he said. &QL;

&HT;       LOCAL STEEL WORKERS PRESS LAWMAKERS TO STOP ILLEGAL TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 -- When Darren Morgan checked his weekly
work schedule at the Fairless Works Steel Mill the day before
Thanksgiving, all it said was, ``report to personnel.'' He knew
what it meant. He had been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks County steel worker didn't testify at a hearing of the
U.S. Senate Steel Caucus focusing on a surge of foreign steel
imports that domestic officials believe has caused the layoffs. But
industry officials who did, blamed foreign steel companies for
selling their product so cheap, that domestic companies can't
compete and are having to cut back production.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign steel industry officials say they are not to blame.
Instead they blame an over-supply of domestic steel caused by last
year's General Motors strike, and other economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign steel producers sent 3.9 million net tons to the U.S. in
September -- approximately a 49 percent increase in imports from
the same month last year, according to the American Iron and Steel
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pennsylvania's Republican Senators Arlen Specter and
Rick Santorum are crafting legislation to stem the tide, they
called on President Clinton to enforce trade laws, possibly through
sanctions, to offer more immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a consensus here that U.S. trade laws are
being violated,'' Specter said. ``Dumping is unfair, illegal and it
has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Specter, said when Congress reconvenes, the
senator would immediately propose a bill that would allow a steel
company to get a temporary restraining order from a federal court
to stop ``unfair trade practices'' if they can prove they might be
damaged by them. He proposed similar legislation in 1993. ``That
way a steel worker can get immediate help if he feels his job is in
danger,'' said Specter spokesman John Ullyot. ``It is a fast legal
recourse while we wait for other legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to issue a preliminary
decision in mid-February on whether Japan, Russia and Brazil are
engaged in steel ``dumping'' -- selling their product for below
production cost, or below what it sells for in its home market.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials told the panel they are working to
speed consideration of the steel industry's case against those
countries. They said the White House is also calling for other
countries to trade fairly.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington can't help steel workers soon enough, Morgan, the
laid-off from Fairless Works, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if something isn't done soon, more people will lose
their jobs.'' said Morgan, who traveled to Washington to watch the
hearing. ``It is a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Steel announced recently it would cut production by 70
percent at its Fairless Works site, in Bucks County, outside
Philadelphia. About half of the plant's 850 workers could lose
their jobs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem Steel mills in Steelton, where there are 600
employees, are operating on reduced schedules because of lower
order entry and shipments, said Curtis Barnette, Chairman and CEO
of Bethlehem Steel.

A SCANDAL KEPT IN MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gen. Charles Krulak, the commandant of the Marine
Corps, had just finished a long speech on ``moral courage'' at the
Naval War College in Newport, R.I., when the inevitable question
arose.
</P>
<P>
   What are the nation's military officers supposed to think, a
young officer in the audience asked, when the commander in chief
has acknowledged behavior _ an ``inappropriate relationship'' with
a subordinate _ that would in all likelihood ruin their careers?
</P>
<P>
   Krulak's answer boiled down to this: The same Uniform Code of
Military Justice that prohibits adultery, fraternization and lying
about either also prohibits officers from using ``contemptuous
words'' against the president. And every man and woman in uniform
swears an oath to that effect, even if it means giving up the right
to speak freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either obey your oath,'' he said, ``or you have the
courage to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Republicans leading the House's impeachment inquiry
plan to call two retired officers to testify about what they say is
the corrosive effect on military discipline of having a commander
in chief who has admitted misleading the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in his remarks in Newport and in an interview, Krulak
suggested that the scandal had far less impact on the armed forces
than Clinton's critics would have it. Marines, he said, have
focused on their jobs, as they should, and not on any political
process in Washington. Only a few Marines have spoken out on the
presidential scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not to say we in the corps are naive enough to think
people aren't talking about this,'' he said. ``Let me tell you,
they talk about everything. I mean it's no different than any other
place. The question is, Do they act on what they talk about? The
question is, Does it undermine good order and discipline?'' To
that, he emphatically answered no. ``I don't see that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some in the Pentagon who think that if any officer was
going to resign over Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, it
would have been Krulak, a decorated 34-year veteran who has served
as commandant since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He is an outspoken defender of the military's values in general
and the Marine Corps' values in particular, a conservative
Christian who said he would quit if the Pentagon ever eased its
unequivocal prohibition on adultery as some officials proposed
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everything he says has a moral dimension,'' said
one of his Marine colleagues, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, the commander
of all American forces in Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   But Krulak has neither spoken out on the scandal nor criticized
the president, even as he preaches about the necessity of moral
leadership in the armed services and warns against efforts by the
civilian world to impose its values on the military.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he draws a distinction between Clinton and the office
he holds. It is the sort of ambivalence that officers in the Marine
Corps and the other services often express when asked to comment on
Clinton's personal lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we raise our hand,'' he said, ``we swear allegiance to
the Constitution, not to a person, not to an institution, but to
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In Krulak's view, those officers who openly denounce the
president demonstrate ``a remarkable weakness'' by violating
Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which prohibits
officers from publicly criticizing the president and other civilian
leaders of the military. He said officers could no more decide
which articles to abide by than soldiers in combat could decide
which orders to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sit there and try to have it both ways is a lack of moral
courage,'' he said. ``If you have such strong feelings that you
cannot obey your oath, then it is incumbent on you to get out of
the military. Then you can say all you want. As long as you're in
the military, you need to stick by your oath, because that is part
of the Constitution and your willingness to pay allegiance to the
Constitution is in fact the foundation of our military.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no mass resignations, but in the last month a
small wave of public criticism of Clinton, mostly in articles and
letters in magazines and newspapers, threatened to turn into a
tidal wave. Krulak's deputy, Gen. Terrence Dake, took the
extraordinary step of sending a memorandum to all of the Marine
Corps' generals ordering them to remind their officers of the rule
against ``contemptuous words.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, one officer, Maj. Shane Sellers, received
the military equivalent of a stern lecture _ though nothing more
severe _ for writing a column in The Navy Times in which he
referred to the president as an ``adulterous liar.'' Krulak said it
was not clear to him that the column necessarily met the definition
of ``contemptuous words.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the armed services have had their share of
embarrassing sex scandals, including the Navy's case last week
against an admiral who was charged with steering $150,000 worth of
contracts to a woman with whom he was having an adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   But some in Washington have darkly warned that the accusations
against the president have somehow underscored a growing and
dangerous gap between the unbending values of the military and the
more tolerant views of society in general.
</P>
<P>
   Krulak said that gap had always existed, necessarily and
beneficially. Whatever happens in the House's impeachment process,
he warned that it would invite disaster to do anything to impose
the civilian world's values on the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that, `look, society is changing and since
you represent society, there's a great danger if you don't change
with it,''' he said. ``I will only say that my sense of society is
that society seeks institutions with standards. And the last thing
society wants is the institution of the military to go down a
slippery slope.''

SCIENTOLOGY CHURCH PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN WOMAN'S DEATH

<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ The Church of Scientology pleaded not guilty
Monday to criminal charges in connection with the 1995 death of a
member whose family claimed she was held against her will by the
church for 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   A church lawyer delivered the written plea to the clerk's office
for Pinellas County Circuit Court. A hearing is expected within 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   The church's Flag Service Organization, its chief operating arm
here, was charged recently with abuse or neglect of a disabled
adult and with practicing medicine without a license, both
felonies. No individuals were charged.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, the maximum penalty is a $5,000 fine for
conviction on each charge, but courts may impose additional
penalties, including forfeiture of property.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filed by the state attorney for Pasco and
Pinellas counties, Bernie McCabe, in the death of Lisa McPherson,
36, on Dec. 5, 1995. She had spent the 17 days before her death
under 24-hour watch in a church-owned hotel in downtown Clearwater,
the spiritual headquarters of Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found that Ms. McPherson had died of a pulmonary
embolism, or blood vessel blockage, caused by bed rest and severe
dehydration. Dr. Joan Wood, the county medical examiner, said Ms.
McPherson had gone without fluids for at least five to 10 days
before her death. Ms. McPherson also appeared to have lost more
than 40 pounds, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials have maintained that the lengthy investigation
and charges in the case are the result of a 15-year vendetta by
Clearwater police and other local officials. The church says that
Ms. McPherson was well cared for during her stay, but that she
became violent and incoherent and stopped eating.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials and lawyers said Ms. McPherson was taken to a
hospital after her condition worsened suddenly. They said their
medical experts would testify that Ms. McPherson's death was
unrelated to her stay at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McPherson had been involved in a minor traffic accident in
downtown Clearwater. She appeared to be uninjured, but took off her
clothes and walked down the street naked. She was taken to Morton
Plant Hospital, where a physician wanted to admit her for
psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Scientology adamantly opposes psychiatric care and
Ms. McPherson refused the treatment. Instead, she signed herself
out of the hospital and accompanied a group of Scientologists to
the church's Fort Harrison Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Church records show that she hallucinated, became violent and
refused to eat at the hotel. She had to be restrained several
times, according to accounts provided to police by her caretakers
at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McPherson's family has filed a lawsuit against the church
that is scheduled to go to trial next summer. The family is seeking
unspecified damages.

MEDTRONIC TO BUY MAKER OF HEART ARTERY TUBES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind., Mass., Minn.)  (rl) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expanding into a lucrative corner of the cardiovascular device
market, Medtronic Inc., the big pacemaker manufacturer, announced
Monday that it would buy Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc., for
$54 a share, or $3.7 billion, in Medtronic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was a windfall for Arterial Vascular
shareholders, including dozens of company employees, pumping the
share price to a 52-week high of $50 before it slipped to $48.875
in Nasdaq trading, up $16.50 for the day. Medtronic shares fell
$2.375, to $67.625.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second big expansion in less than a month for
Medtronic, which announced a $3.6 billion purchase, also financed
with Medtronic stock, of the Sofamor Danek Group on Nov. 2. Sofamor
Danek makes rods and screws used in back surgery and imaging
devices for brain surgery. Arterial Vascular makes tiny flexible
tubes called stents that are inserted to prop open clogged
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   William George, chief executive of Minneapolis-based Medtronic,
said that by acquiring Arterial Vascular, Medtronic would have the
``best-in-class products'' in several important types of
cardiological devices. Teams of Medtronic and Arterial Vascular
sales people would jointly promote the products to specialized
physicians at big hospitals, who are eager to try the newest and
presumably most effective devices.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arterial Vascular employees will become instant
multimillionaires if, as expected, the deal is completed early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic is well acquainted with the Arterial Vascular
management, headed by Scott Solano, a former Medtronic vice
president who resigned in 1995 and joined Arterial Vascular as
chief executive two years ago. Solano will stay on as head of the
stent business, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., and will report to Art
Collins, president of Medtronic.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a downside lurked in the possibility that
important executives and researchers might be overcompensated and
thus undermotivated to stay on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk in any acquisition like this is, does the R and D
talent stay?'' said Vivian Wohl, a senior research analyst at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Vascular Engineering, an 8-year-old technology company,
helped blast Johnson &AMP; Johnson out of market leadership for stents
last year by improving the design.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Kruger, a health technology analyst at Nations Banc
Montgomery, said the U.S. stent market is dominated by Advanced
Vascular, the Guidant Corp., based in Indianapolis, and Boston
Scientific Corp., based in Natick, Mass. He said Advanced
Vascular's research pipeline contains ``a proliferation of new
products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Research and development are absolutely everything in a
marketplace where every three to six months you have brand-new
generation stents,'' Ms. Wohl said. But she said that Guidant and
Boston Scientific had a potential advantage based on
cross-licensing of patents for a guide-wire device that is easier
to use for delivering the stent through an artery to the proper
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific, however, is distracted by accounting problems
on two fronts. Its shares plummeted from above $81 in August to
$40.25 by early November following revelations that its sales in
Japan had been overstated by tens of millions of dollars. The
company is also struggling to comply with an SEC ruling affecting
companies that take big one-time writeoffs in mergers. Boston
Scientific had planned to do just that in its $2.1 billion purchase
last June of a medical device unit from Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advanced Cardiovascular is a really good company,'' said Gene
Gargiulo, an independent analyst who specializes in medical device
stocks. But he sees last month's big Medtronic merger as primarily
driven by financial goals that could be compromised. ``Can they
digest all this all at once?'' he asked.

JIM TURNER, 95, THE OLDEST FORMER YANKEE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Turner, the pitching coach for nine Yankee pennant-winning
teams in the Casey Stengel era and a pitcher for the Braves, Reds
and Yankees in a baseball career spanning 51 consecutive seasons,
died Sunday in his hometown of Nashville. He was 95 and the oldest
former Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, a familiar cast was on hand in pinstripes every
March at spring training and most Octobers at Yankee Stadium:
Manager Stengel in the dugout, Turner running the pitching staff,
Bill Dickey coaching at first base and Frank Crosetti on the lines
at third.
</P>
<P>
   Turner guided staffs led by Allie Reynolds, Vic Raschi, Eddie
Lopat and Whitey Ford, noting his pitchers' every move in his
little black book. ``He knew if one of them changed a blade in
their razors,'' Phil Rizzuto once said.
</P>
<P>
   In his first tenure as a Yankee coach _ 1949 to 1959, through
all but the final season of the Stengel years _ Turner took home
seven World Series-winning paychecks. After being replaced by
Lopat, he managed in the minor leagues for one year, then served as
a pitching coach for Cincinnati's 1961 pennant winner. He remained
with the Reds for four more seasons, then returned to the Yankees
as pitching coach from 1966 to 1973 under Manager Ralph Houk.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Antioch, Tenn., who was known as Milkman Jim for
having worked in his family's dairy business during the off
seasons, Turner spent 14 years in the minors before making his
major league debut with the 1937 Boston Braves at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   He was 20-11 for a fifth-place team, leading the National League
in earned run average at 2.38 and complete games with 24 and tying
for the lead in shutouts with five. He went 14-11 and made the
All-Star team in 1938, when Stengel became the Braves' manager, and
had a 14-7 record for the pennant-winning 1940 Reds. A
right-hander, Turner pitched for the Yankees in relief from 1942 to
1945 and led the American League in saves with 10 in his final
season. He had a 69-60 record over nine years in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   He became the Yankees' pitching coach in October 1948, one day
after Stengel was hired as manager.
</P>
<P>
   While managing at Portland in the Pacific Coast League while
Stengel managed Oakland, Turner had shown Raschi how to throw a
slow curve to go with his fastball, and by the time Turner arrived
with the Yanks, Raschi was becoming a star with them.
</P>
<P>
   When Ford was a rookie in 1950, Turner discovered why he was
tipping off his pitches. ``Turner had me throwing in the bullpen
and we found out I was twisting my elbow whenever I cranked up for
a curveball,'' Ford remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Turner wanted to make sure that Ford measured up to
the Yankees' standards of decorum, Reynolds recalled. ``Turner
asked me to room with Whitey, who had just come up from the
minors,'' Reynolds said. ```Give him some class,' Turner said.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the 1950s, Turner helped Don Larsen and Bob Turley gain
control of their pitches through no-windup deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Sain, who pitched for the Yankees under Turner, regarded
him so highly that he emulated Turner's meticulous record-keeping
when he became the Yankees' pitching coach in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is survived by two daughters, Jacquelyn Turner and Dr.
Dorothy Turner, and two sisters, Alice Turner Smith and Marguerite
Turner King, all of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Turner looked back with gratitude, designing bronze
plaques as gifts for Reynolds, Raschi and Lopat. ``I got a letter
from Jim,'' Lopat recalled. ``He said we had made him rich, did so
much for him, made him famous, changed his life.''
</P>
<P>
   An old-school type who once remarked how ``baseball is not a tea
party,'' Turner sought to regulate his pitchers' activities off the
field, too. He did not want them to do any swimming during the
afternoon if they were to pitch at night. When Bobby Shantz, a
Yankee left-hander of the 1950s, did some diving at a country club,
he asked, ``Am I getting sunburned?'' He feared that Turner would
notice he had defied his edict.
</P>
<P>
   But there were times when Turner was not so controlling. Stengel
once sent him out to talk with Raschi when the pitcher was about to
face the strapping Red Sox first baseman Walt Dropo. Raschi
scowled, and Turner quickly returned to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him how he was going to pitch to Dropo,'' Turner told
Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what did he answer?'' Stengel inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard,'' said Turner.

MARKET PLACE: EXECUTIVES GAIN MOST IN METLIFE'S CONVERSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. reorganizes so
that it can issue stock, the big winners are likely to be the
company's executives.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 million policyholders _ who are formally the owners of
the mutual company _ are to share a one-time payout of $14 billion
in accumulated profits when Met Life, as the company is called,
converts. But the executives will be perpetually in line for stock
options, bonuses and generally higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the income of executives in companies converting
from mutual to stock ownership has increased substantially,'' said
James Corcoran, a former New York insurance commissioner who is now
a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Winston &AMP; Strawn.
</P>
<P>
   That may prove to be a powerful understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, an executive compensation specialist in San
Diego, said that judging from the rewards of senior executives at
other major U.S. corporations, the top people at Met Life might
well take home ``tens of millions of dollars'' in stock options in
the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for the chief executive,'' he said, ``it might easily be
more than $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 279 of the top 500 companies, for example, Crystal
found that chief executives last year received stock options with
an average current value of $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Metropolitan is much bigger than the average company in
the survey,'' Crystal said, ``I would expect the CEO there to get
6, 7, 8 million dollars in options.''
</P>
<P>
   As a mutual company owned by policyholders, Met Life had, by
definition, no publicly traded stock with which to reward
executives. So executives' pay tended to trail that of their
counterparts at stock companies. That, many analysts said, sharply
reduced the pool of executives from which mutual companies could
recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a player if you're a company without stock
options,'' said Crystal.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Foley, a spokesman for Met Life, said that the company's
decision to move toward reorganization, which was announced on
Sunday, was not motivated by the prospect of increased compensation
for Robert Benmosche, the chief executive, and others in the
executive suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given no thought to this issue,'' he said. ``It just
isn't part of our planning at this time. Our first priority is to
make sure that policyholders get 100 percent of the value of the
company. And there are no plans to reward management until that
takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the potential for significant increases in
compensation, Foley said the reward for management would not be
automatic. ``The results have to dictate the reward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benmosche, who became chief executive of Met Life in July, is
expected to be paid $2.5 million this year, Foley said, $500,000 in
salary and the rest in bonuses. His pay is likely to be higher next
year, reflecting his first full year as the top executive, but
Foley said he had no idea what Benmosche's income would be once Met
Life became a stock company.
</P>
<P>
   Benmosche said on Sunday that Met Life wanted to issue stock to
be able to raise capital for expansion and to have shares that
could also be used as currency to buy other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that has been the driving force behind
reorganizations planned at Prudential Life Insurance Co. of
America, John Hancock Life Insurance Co. and others. A natural
byproduct of the change, they say, is much higher compensation for
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are going to make out like bandits,'' said Wayne
Roberts, a longtime agent and a founding member of the Life
Insurance Committee for Social Responsibility. ``But that is the
nature of big business. My primary concern was to see that the
policyholders got a fair shake, and I think that's been achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Grannis, the Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the
state Assembly's Insurance Committee, defeated an attempt by Met
Life and others earlier this year to create a hybrid form of stock
company that would have permitted reorganization without sharing
accumulated profits with policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Grannis said Monday he believed the company was now on a course
that would protect policyholders' interests. He added, ``I don't
think this is a grab for riches by the management.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization will be governed by a 1988 law that does not
describe how shares might be allocated to management or detail how
a stock-option plan is to be set up. But Corcoran, who was
insurance commissioner when the law was enacted, said that such
details must be explained in a public plan for reorganization and
must be approved by policyholders and the insurance commissioner.
``The issue here is full disclosure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry specialists said that executives moving into the
turbulent world of publicly traded companies should expect to
receive sharp increases in pay as they give up job security, face
previously nonexistent pressures from shareholders and work against
performance measures that are much more defined than in mutual
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you want to reward executives of a company that goes
forward and does better,'' Corcoran said. ``There's nothing wrong
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the hybrid structure that Met Life had lobbied for, with
the support of Gov. George Pataki, company executives could have
received as much as 18 percent of the shares of a reorganized
mutual company, Corcoran said. While there is some room for
interpretation, Corcoran said that current law suggests that
management will be limited to owning no more than 5 percent of the
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' said Grannis, ``is that if the officers and
directors get greedy, it may have an impact on their stock value.
They've got to sell their stock to willing buyers looking at
overhead and profitability and making judgments on whether it's a
good buy. The combination of Met's traditional conservative
management history, the oversight from the Insurance Department and
the discipline of the marketplace would seem to temper any effort
to reward executives out of proportion to their contributions.''

LEADERS REAFFIRM COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Seeking to counter recent reports that an ambitious
economic reform plan is losing steam, Chinese officials Monday
strongly reiterated their intention to overhaul debt-ridden
state-owned industries by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced in September 1997, calls for major changes
in the ownership and operation of the state industries:
streamlining larger companies and generally allowing smaller ones
to be sold to private owners or to go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Sheng Huaren, minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, acknowledged at a news conference that the task had
proved more difficult than anticipated, in part because of the
Asian financial crisis. But he said the country has made
significant progress toward the goal of establishing a more
``modern corporate system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of lifting the great majority of state-owned
enterprises out of difficulty in three years is absolutely
achievable,'' Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear, though, whether the plan remains realistic.
Many Chinese are already suffering economically from the severe
floods of last summer, from the huge slump in the rest of Asia and
from China's growing unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheng's highly publicized news conference at least sent a
clear signal that the government remains firmly committed to try
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's bitter-pill brand of economic overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Sheng also insisted that a previously announced policy of
``de-linking'' the Communist Party, government ministries, the army
and the police from their business interests would be effectively
accomplished by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Business experts have long maintained that China's government
organizations should shed their businesses to curb corruption. But
it is highly unlikely that these agencies can truly divest
themselves of the thousands of hotels, stores and restaurants they
own in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Sheng's remarks came just three days after Zhu
re-emerged from a few months in the shadows, taking center stage
with a public tour of Liaoning Province, a center of large
inefficient state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's relative silence on economic matters this fall had been
taken by many foreign experts as a sign that the central leadership
had put on hold his ``get tough'' economic reforms, which have
resulted in substantial unemployment and labor unrest, even as they
have improved business efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the voluble Zhu again came on strong, praising
state-owned enterprises in Liaoning that had turned a profit for
the first time, generally through greater efficiency and by firing
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Liaoning, one of the major industrial bases in China, can
realize the objective of reform of state-owned enterprises, the
rest of the country can surely achieve this goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the central government would allocate close to $1
billion this year to help laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
   The strong statements by both Zhu and Sheng were surprising,
since economists both in and outside of China recently observed
that the government had slowed the restructuring of state
industries, instead pumping money into them to stimulate economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheng said the government plans to stay its course, since
there are signs the economy is improving and some of the most
bloated state industries have been effectively pruned down.
</P>
<P>
   He said the textile industry had already laid off 450,000
workers, reducing industrywide losses by close to $200 million.
After mergers and reorganizations, the status of some steel and
petrochemical companies has also greatly improved, Sheng added.

   PHOENIX _ I know how you are. You heard about the $53 million,
four-year contract the Arizona Diamondbacks gave baseball pitcher
Randy Johnson and you want to do the math. How much does that
figure per game? Per win? Per strikeout?
</P>
<P>
   You know it's not good for you. You know that fiddling with the
numbers will only make you frustrated, angry and even more
convinced our priorities are completely out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Please, don't give in to the temptation. Don't submit to the
abuse. Don't torture yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Let me do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's average yearly salary will be $13.25 million, the
second-highest in baseball behind Mo Vaughn's $13.33 million. The
difference between a first baseman and a pitcher, however, is that
an infielder could appear in most of the season's 162 games while a
pitcher will start, at most, 40.
</P>
<P>
   So, every time he takes the mound Johnson will earn $331,250.
</P>
<P>
   More or less.
</P>
<P>
   He won 19 games last year. If he gets 20 victories during the
1999 season, they'll be worth $662,500 per win.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on.
</P>
<P>
   He had 329 strikeouts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If he matches that number next season, each strikeout would earn
him $40,273.55.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't earn a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   An individual with a two-strikeout income is living very well. &QL; 
Enough for tickets? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three strikeouts for a salary and you might be able to afford
tickets to a Diamondbacks game _ provided you don't want a beer and
a hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau says the average middle-income, married family
takes home about $55,000 a year. And that's with two paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Even those people, I'd guess, try occasionally to get to a
ballgame. You might be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you were at Bank One Ballpark during ``Fan Appreciation
Weekend'' last season, when the team announced a 12.1 percent
ticket price increase.
</P>
<P>
   You might know the Diamondbacks already signed pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre to a $32 million, four-year contract, and that the team
will pay third baseman Matt Williams $8 million next season, and
shortstop-second baseman Jay Bell $6 million, and pitcher Andy
Benes $6 million, and outfielder Bernard Gilkey $5 million. And so
on.
</P>
<P>
   You may even know that season ticket holders are being required
to pay regular season prices for two ``exhibition'' baseball games
next year.
</P>
<P>
   You don't like it, but you feel powerless to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   So, when a player like Randy Johnson is signed to a fat
contract, you do the math and complain about our priorities,
accepting it as ``the way things are.'' &QL; 
Some alternatives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As if that's the way things must be.
</P>
<P>
   There's an organization in California called Alternative Gifts
International (www.altgifts.org), which, like many other charitable
organizations, puts price tags on human behavior other than tossing
a 90 mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the cost of keeping one homeless person in a
shelter for one night is $11.
</P>
<P>
   Caring for a Romanian child with AIDS, for a week, is $6.
</P>
<P>
   Donating a couple of chickens to a starving Laotian family is $3
_ a buck less than the cost of a hot dog at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   These things aren't unconnected. They're joined by money.
</P>
<P>
   That's why every time a marquee player is signed to an
unheard-of contract, you want to do the math.
</P>
<P>
   You know that fiddling with the numbers will only make you
frustrated and angry.
</P>
<P>
   You might even believe it's unfair to compare professional
baseball salaries with the price of running a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as unfair _ but not quite _ as the fact that one Randy
Johnson strikeout earns enough to provide a night's sleep in a warm
bed, under a roof, for about 3,500 people.

LOOKING FOR JUSTICE, 50 YEARS AFTER THE HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Md., N.Y., Fla., Calif.) (jw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration declared Monday that its
investigations into Swiss banks and Nazi gold are essentially
closed, as it opened a 44-nation conference here to examine a host
of related issues, from repatriating stolen art, land and buildings
to resolving billions of dollars in insurance claims on Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the three-day conference at the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum here Monday night, which began with a silent
procession of death-camp survivors, is intended to put an end to
the diplomatic and legal strife with Switzerland and find ways to
solve the problems surrounding the investigations. This year the
Swiss banks reached a $1.25 billion settlement with Holocaust
survivors and Jewish groups. But new suits were filed, against
Italian and German insurance companies, Ford Motor Co. and the
German banking giant Deutsche Bank, which Monday formally announced
its $9.7 billion takeover of Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Deutsche Bank will be under pressure to
settle the suit as the merger wends its way through the regulatory
process.
</P>
<P>
   The historical disputes that periodically resurface surrounding
Ford and the Opel division of General Motors Corp. _ the use of
slave labor by corporate subsidiaries that were nationalized by
Nazi Germany _ are not on the agenda of the conference. However,
European officials say the new German government is quietly
negotiating with German industry over some kind of compensation
plan similar to the one negotiated with Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have a framework for settling all these issues
by Dec. 31, 1999,'' Stuart Eizenstat, the undersecretary of state
for business affairs and the leader of the American investigations
into World War II assets, said in an interview Monday. ``We want to
accomplish the maximum economic restitution possible after the
passage of 50 years, but equally important the moral accountability
that will help us enter the new millennium and learn the lessons of
the greatest travesty of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators reported, however, that they had run into a blind
alley in their major effort to determine how much gold the Nazis
deposited in the ``Melmer Account,'' the code name for the German
Reichsbank account that held gold looted from the homes, pockets
and dental work of Holocaust victims. Much of that gold, the United
States argues, was later smelted into ``monetary gold'' that had
been stolen from central banks around Europe. The United States and
Switzerland still differ on the amount of ``victim gold'' that
ultimately flowed through Swiss accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of our biggest disappointments,'' Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was never determined how much personal gold was
mingled with monetary gold, Britain and the United States persuaded
more than a dozen other nations to give up their claims on six tons
of monetary gold still sitting in the basement of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. Now the proceeds from the sale of the
gold will be used to support Holocaust-related programs, from
education for schoolchildren to the care of destitute World War II
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   With the settlement with the Swiss banks completed in August,
the scholars, art dealers, insurance executives, government
officials, Jewish leaders and others at this week's conference are
turning their attention to other Nazi-looted assets, especially
insurance, real estate and art.
</P>
<P>
   An international commission is looking into the complex
insurance question and will most likely take years to determine
what the insurers owe. Meanwhile, California, Florida and New York
have threatened sanctions against insurance companies, mostly
European, that do not fully cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, community centers and other real estate properties
confiscated from Jews, many in Eastern Europe, are now being used
on an everyday basis, and governments are reluctant to turn them
over to their original owners. Investigators point to difficult
cases such as the building in a small Polish town that was seized
from a Jewish family and is now used as a school for disabled
children.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent cases, however, involve art. Although many
confiscated works were returned after the war, some were sold and
others were incorporated into various European museums, including
the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many works are involved, or their value.
Jonathan Petropolis, a historian at Loyola University in Baltimore,
estimates in paper to be delivered at the conference that 10,000 to
100,000 objects are still missing, even though a far larger number
were returned shortly after the war, mainly by the Allied armies.
``One of the things we hope to do with the conference is begin to
crystallize that,'' Eizenstat said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, conference organizers expect to reach a consensus
to return works to their owners or their survivors. However, an
early draft of proposed guidelines for governments, art
institutions, auction houses and art dealers appears vague.

QUENTIN CREWE, 72, A BON VIVANT UNFAZED BY DISABILITY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quentin Crewe, who fell down so much as a child and bounced back
with such good cheer that he grew up to challenge prevailing
stereotypes as an iconoclastic journalist, an innovative restaurant
critic, a high-spirited social lion, a high-minded gossip
columnist, a globe-trotting adventurer, a prolific author and an
even more prolific lover, died in his home in Oxfordshire, England,
on Nov. 14. It was the 72nd birthday of a man who had not so much
suffered from, as gloried in, a lifelong affliction with muscular
dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a career diplomat and the grandson of a titled
government official, Crewe stumbled resolutely through his first
six years. Then he was examined by a doctor who told his mother
that he had muscular dystrophy and would be dead by age 16.
</P>
<P>
   She, in turn, told young Quentin that he would be fine at 16,
which might explain why Crewe continued to stumble on with such
heightened optimism. By the time he turned 16 and realized that his
condition would only worsen, picking himself up had become so
ingrained that he masked his disappointment by reveling in
challenges for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted, for instance, with a body so weakened that he could
lift one hand only with the help of the other, his response was to
peck out 11 books, several of them accounts of world travels
undertaken specifically to demonstrate that his disability was not
disabling.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a coincidence that the most strenuous of his
travels, including a grueling trek through the uncharted wastes of
the so-called empty quarter of Saudi Arabia in 1966 and an even
more grueling two-year trek through the Sahara in the early 1980s,
came after he was forced, at age 29, to start using a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   If he could not have accomplished his feats without assistance,
Crewe, a man of captivating charm, never lacked for volunteers
eager to push his wheelchair and to share his high-living company.
During the heady 1960s, for instance, when friends like Dudley
Moore, Peter Sellers and Kenneth Tynan helped make his Belgravia
apartment party central for Britain's smartest smart set, Princess
Margaret once flew out by helicopter to help strip wallpaper in his
country house and her husband, Lord Snowdon, made modifications to
his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   An incurable romantic who claimed that he could fall in love
over the course of a weekend and was forever doing just that, Crewe
was married and divorced three times, always maintaining cordial
relations with his former wives. He fathered six children, five of
whom survive.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme of his life was established at Eton when he copied
a fire door key and escaped for a rollicking day in London, an
escapade that led to his expulsion. With the help of tutors he made
it into Cambridge, but spent so much time partying that he was
expelled for indolence, qualifying him for the life of a
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of menial jobs, he broke into journalism in 1952
by writing reviews for The Times Literary Supplement, then won a
free-lance assignment from The Evening Standard of London to
investigate rumors that Aristotle Onassis was taking over Monaco.
Typically, Crewe turned the assignment on its head, discounting the
rumors but filing a humorous article that won him a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   During a later journalistic stint, when he was sent to South
Africa to report how conditions for blacks were improving, he wrote
a series of articles on how they were actually getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crewe was proudest of his South Africa reports, his
most significant contribution to journalism came while he was
working for the magazine Queen in the 1960s. When the young woman
assigned to compile the magazine's regular list of restaurants with
one-line descriptions got sick, Crewe, who was on his way to lunch
at a posh restaurant called Wilton's, volunteered to fill the
space.
</P>
<P>
   His resulting review, suggesting that nursery food was served to
aristocrats by waitresses dressed as nannies, created such a
sensation that it has been credited with inventing modern British
restaurant criticism. Later, as a gossip columnist for The Daily
Mail, Crewe shunned items dealing with divorce, adultery, family
disputes and the like, but failed to set a trend.
</P>
<P>
   His sense of decorum was reflected in his 1991 autobiography,
``Well, I Forget the Rest,'' which noted that friends, marveling at
his romantic conquests, were forever pestering him to give details
of how a man in a wheelchair managed to perform.
</P>
<P>
   In a passage that can only seem mercifully reticent in an era of
salacious excess, he wrote: ``I had no intention of enlightening
them, then or now.''

ARIZONA'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM ACTUALLY AMONG AMONG BEST, FIRM
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona's much maligned juvenile justice system
actually is ``one of the best in the country,'' a consulting firm
hired to audit the system said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte Consulting said that although the various state
agencies that deal with juvenile offenders need to better
coordinate their efforts and encourage more family involvement, the
system overall is more effective than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is not the best, it is one of the best in the country,''
Bobbie Wilbur, a Deloitte partner, told members of the Joint
Legislative Committee on Juvenile Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be better? Yes,'' Wilbur said. ``But you have a very
sound system.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is paying Deloitte $750,000 to conduct the audit with
an eye toward improving the juvenile justice system, which has come
under heavy criticism in recent years. A draft of the audit was
released to the committee Monday, with the final version due in the
next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the committee members and officials of the juvenile
justice system praised the audit. Some of the Legislature's
harshest critics of the state's juvenile corrections program said
they hadn't read the report Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But one committee member, Sen. Tom Patterson, R-east Phoenix,
said he was concerned that the audit focused on the Legislature's
role in managing the system, not on the actual programs provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is precious little in (the audit) about what works,''
Patterson said. &QL; 
Much of the criticism of the juvenile justice system has been aimed
at the state Department of Juvenile Corrections, which has had
three different directors since it was formed in 1990 and currently
is being run by an interim director.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was forced to operate under a federal court order
from 1993-97 over allegations of civil rights violations. The
department spent nearly $35 million to ease overcrowding and
improve conditions at the state's juvenile facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last December, Eugene Moore was forced out as director of
juvenile corrections after a Maricopa County grand jury report
accused the agency of putting the public at risk by releasing
violent offenders before their sentences were completed.
</P>
<P>
   David Gaspar, who was the department's assistant director, has
been acting director since Moore left. Gov. Jane Hull has been
criticized for not naming a permanent director.
</P>
<P>
   But the audit notes that the Department of Juvenile Corrections
is only one piece of the state's juvenile justice system. Also
playing important roles are county juvenile justice programs,
juvenile courts, and the state departments of Economic Security,
Behavioral Health Services and Education, which provide a number of
prevention and intervention programs.
</P>
<P>
   All those programs are operating successfully, keeping costs
down and the recidivism rate low, the audit said. But the lack of
coordination, collaboration and communication between those
agencies is one of the main problems facing the system, the audit
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended that a systemwide computer information
system be created to provide accurate and consistent data to all of
the agencies involved.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur also emphasized the need for more involvement by the
families of juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to solve this problem until you get families
involved throughout the juvenile justice system,'' she said,
acknowledging that ``that's a tough parent group to go after.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take substantial work to bring them in,'' Wilbur
said. ``But I think it is imminently critical if you are going to
keep kids out of the system. The focus has to be more on youth and
family, not just youth.'' &QL;

PARCELLS TELLS JETS TO FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH DECEMBER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The moment was right Monday for a crunch-time
speech to the troops by Coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are tied for first place in the American Football
Conference East with the Miami Dolphins at 8-4. Their first
division title since 1969 is within their grasp. December is Bill
Parcells' month. Still, a day after a 48-21 trouncing of the
Carolina Panthers it was time to talk about paying attention to
detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you understand what makes you lose, you'll never
understand how to win,'' Parcells is fond of saying.
</P>
<P>
   In his lexicon, not losing is winning.
</P>
<P>
   In the stretch run of four games in December (although he and
every Jet know how miserable that month has been for all of the
1990s; the Jets have the National Football League's worst record
this decade) Parcells said that he did talk about attention to
detail and how the little things get magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I was talking to them about this morning was
certain little things,'' Parcells said. ``As you see, some of these
things that can become season-deciding events for teams, you see
what seem like inconsequential plays affecting teams' seasons. You
make the wrong mistake as an individual player at the wrong time,
you send your team home, and that is when it is not all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right'' referred to a player being patted on the back
after a mistake and being told, ``It's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers, he pointed out, were guilty of a roughing-the-passer
penalty on the Seahawks' final drive Sunday. It allowed Seattle to
kick the game-winning field goal. Those Seahawks (6-6) visit the
Jets on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we've got 19 weeks of work in here, and it is
coming down to the last 27 days,'' Parcells said. ``For you, if you
do the wrong thing at the wrong time, if you make a dumb play, you
cost your team. It is not like Denver, or Minnesota _ they can
afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Jets were also 8-4, but wound up with a 9-7
record and missed the playoffs. That included a 1-2 record in
December. Or it will be remembered that before Parcells took over
in 1997, the Jets had lost 15 consecutive December games going back
to 1993 under three different coaches _ Bruce Coslet, Pete Carroll,
Rich Kotite.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those teams had the offensive firepower that can cut
through the most miserable weather, or bail out an ineffective
defense.
</P>
<P>
   And the offense is getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line came as close to a perfect game as any I've
been in as long as I've ever played. I can say that by how I feel
today. I never got touched, not even this much,'' said quarterback
Vinny Testaverde, jabbing a finger lightly in a listener's biceps.
``The only thing that hit me all game was an elbow from Curtis
Martin on a handoff. It got me as he turned for the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one of Martin's 21 carries that gained 110 yards on a
day when everyone was blocking: the offensive line, the receivers,
the running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde understands New York, however, and he knows the
history of the Jets. He lived it as a child and as a fan. So
Decembers past are fresh, but not necessarily significant any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that at each stage of the season there's some past
problem to look at, and yet we've overcome them,'' he said,
reflecting on historical Jet difficulties. ``Last year there was
our division record.'' It was 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we've got a good division record,'' Testaverde said.
It is 4-1. ``It's unfolding as well as anyone could have imagined
it. The record doesn't stop here. It gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the record of Parcells' teams in December is no
fluke. In fact, his past teams' record in December is better than
it is in September, October or November. Since Parcells became a
head coach in 1983, his Giants, Patriots and Jets teams are .615 in
December. Over that same span, the Jets are .235.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jets go into December facing a final four, each
presenting an element of danger _ the Seahawks at Giants Stadium,
at Miami and at Buffalo and then the regular-season finale at home
against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players are looking forward to this,'' Parcells
said. ``We've got a tough road. This isn't cruising here. If we get
through these games, and win these games, we will have earned
it.'' &QL;

SHAREHOLDERS OF BANKERS TRUST WILL GAIN BY MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BANKERS-TRUST-DEUTSCHE, BANKERS-INDUSTRY,
BANKERS-NEWMAN) 
(lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will Deutsche Bank's $10.1 billion acquisition of
Bankers Trust be the big banking merger that actually melds vastly
different cultures, titanic egos and far-flung businesses?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Bankers Trust shareholders, they need not wait
around to find out. Because the deal is for cash rather than shares
of Deutsche Bank, Bankers Trust shareholders can take the money and
run.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a tidy sum. According to the terms of the deal
announced Monday, shareholders in Bankers Trust will receive $93 a
share in cash for a stock that was trading at about $62 a share two
weeks ago. When the market swooned in early October, the shares had
fallen to $49.1875 from the April high of $136.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's price for Bankers Trust is equivalent to 2.3
times the book value of Bankers Trust and 15.8 times consensus
earnings estimates for 1999 of $5.90 a share. The premium to book
value is in line with the average price to book value _ 2.4 times _
that investors are now paying for shares of five big U.S.
investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   In early summer, however, when all was still well with most of
the world, such a deal would have been considered a bargain. As of
June 15, the average price to acquire an investment bank, according
to the Friedman, Billings, Ramsey brokerage firm, was 3.5 times
book value.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not right with the world, and the price Deutsche Bank
is willing to pay for Bankers Trust is nobody's idea of cheap. When
compared with Bankers Trust's third-quarter loss of $4.98 a share,
it gets expensive indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the volatility of the markets, it's a full price,'' said
Carla D'Arista, managing director at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
``But given the potential upside, it's an attractive price.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the potential for what will be the world's largest
financial company? Even as they announced their big purchase,
Deutsche Bank executives were uncharacteristically cautious Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Often when announcing mergers, managements contend that the deal
will produce an almost immediate benefit to the combined companies'
net income. Not in this deal. Analysts were told that the
acquisition would not increase earnings at the merged companies
until 2001. Then, if the forecasts are correct, the deal will push
earnings up by just 10 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The executives did state that cutting costs _ reducing the work
force by 5.7 percent, for starters _ would produce savings of $1
billion. The deal is expected to close in April followed by the
issuance of American depository receipt shares next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts assume that Deutsche Bank is buying Bankers Trust
to penetrate the lucrative U.S. market for managing assets and
advising on mergers and acquisitions. But one analyst said the
deal's silver lining might be that it allowed the German bank to
position itself for the wave of corporate consolidation across
Europe that is expected after the euro, the single currency, is
established, starting Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the U.S.'s major banks have been talking about
reallocating resources to Continental Europe,'' said Charles
Peabody, a bank analyst at Mitchell Securities in New York.
``They're expecting merger mania and leveraged buyouts to balloon
as Western Europe consolidates. Deutsche Bank is buying Bankers
Trust's expertise in leveraged lending and M &AMP; A advisory so they
can import it into the frenzy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another benefit to the combination may come in the area of money
management. Tom Burnett, managing director at Merger Insight in New
York, said: ``As more German companies go public, a lot of those
corporate executives are going to be moving to new wealth levels.
They'll be candidates for investment management.'' Even those
companies that remain private will be open to Bankers Trust-style
asset management, Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the timing and size of the deal left some analysts
breathless. Diane Glossman, a bank analyst at Lehman Brothers,
said: ``Bankers Trust shareholders are lucky to have seen this kind
of price so quickly after the losses of the third quarter. Over
time it's possible that management would have worked to resurrect
profitability and price improvement, but you wouldn't have seen it
this fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is also a big bet by Deutsche Bank that there
will not be a global recession next year. Never mind that economic
growth in Europe is slowing. Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist
at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, said, ``I really am
surprised from an economic perspective that the eagerness to take
risk is there at this point in the cycle.''

JUSTICES HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER CENSUS METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is a statistical sample as good as a head count? Is
estimating population legal? Is the argument over methods a
political tussle or a legitimate legal conundrum?
</P>
<P>
   With time running out before the counting is to begin, the U.S.
Supreme Court on Monday started to sort out the controversies
surrounding the taking of the 2000 census, particularly whether a
statistical sampling method can be used to determine population.
</P>
<P>
   The justices heard arguments from two groups opposing
statistical sampling, a group of citizens in six states whose
congressional delegations are likely to change with new census
figures and the GOP-controlled House of Representatives, which
compromised with the president in a census funding impasse by
letting the Supreme Court decide the issue.
</P>
<P>
   That approach wouldn't get any further if it were up to Justice
Antonin Scalia. He indicated he'd let the Clinton administration's
Census Bureau and the Congress battle it out on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like injecting us into a battle between two political
branches,'' the conservative justice said from the bench during
Monday's argument. ``I think they will survive, but I'm not sure we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, though, he and Chief Justice William Rehnquist zeroed
in on the crux of the case: the Constitution's call for an ``actual
enumeration'' of the population every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wondered whether that meant finding ``a true number.''
And if a true number could be found using modern scientific
methods, as Solicitor General Seth Waxman said, ``Why do I need a
census, then?''
</P>
<P>
   Actual enumeration, argued Maureen Mahoney for the House, was
what the framers of the Constitution `'intended from the outset.''
Even in 1790, when the Census Act was passed, estimating practices
were common, though not as sophisticated as the one the Census
Bureau would employ in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney was so insistent on a nose-by-nose count, that when
asked by Justice John Paul Stevens what census-takers should do
when faced with an apartment filled with uncooperative people of
ill-repute whose neighbors refused to discuss them, she said they
should not be counted at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your honor, they (census-takers) can't guess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carvin, arguing on behalf of the citizens, told the
court that the accuracy of the statistical method, while certainly
in dispute, really doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of its relative accuracy, it's illegal and
unconstitutional,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will try to decide the issue by March, but said in
court Monday they will be lucky to rule by June. That could have a
significant effect on the Census Bureau, which is well into
planning and implementation of the census and is counting on using
sampling. Actual counting would not begin until after April 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation
and one of the citizen plaintiffs, said after the argument that the
integrity of the census must be ensured and statistical sampling
will not do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will create 27 million mythical people and they will
decide what those 27 million mythical people look like and they
will decide where those 27 million mythical people live,'' Glavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, chairman of the House oversight subcommittee on
the census, said everyone wants an accurate count, but because the
level of trust in the Clinton administration has been eroded by
various scandals, it is even more imperative to use tried-and-true
counting methods to determine population and restore trust in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census missed about 1.6 percent of the population or
about 4 million people, most of them minorities, according to the
Census Bureau. In Arizona, the net undercount was 89,438. Of those,
32,223 were Hispanic and 40,374 were children.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is not mere legal and political hairsplitting. At
stake are money _ the federal government gives states more than
$180 billion each year based on population _ and political power,
both in Congress and in shifting political boundaries within
states.

RENO DELAYS DECISION ON SPECIAL PROSECUTOR FOR CLINTON AIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of deliberations, Attorney General
Janet Reno on Monday put off a decision on whether to ask an
independent counsel to investigate the statements of Harold Ickes,
a former top presidential aide, about his efforts on behalf of the
Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   Wavering on the final day of an inquiry limited by statute to 90
days, Reno invoked a provision of the independent prosecutor law
that allows her a one-time 60-day extension that could delay a
decision until late January.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Ickes, a former White House deputy chief of
staff, lied on Sept. 22, 1997 in a deposition to the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee complained in its
final report earlier this year that Ickes had misled its
investigators about his actions on behalf of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Reno had seemed to be edging closer toward seeking
an independent prosecutor. The delay brought expressions of quiet
relief from White House aides, who reasoned that any decision not
explicitly adverse to Ickes was favorable. Ickes' lawyer, Robert
Bennett, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have attacked Reno over her repeated refusal to
seek independent counsels in campaign finance cases kept up their
criticism on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not take her half a year to figure out the
obvious,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who as chairman of the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee is one of the
president's fiercest critics. ``It has been clear for over two
years to everyone across the political spectrum that an independent
counsel is needed for the entire campaign finance investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the options open to Reno, an extension had seemed the least
likely. In a legal brief filed with the panel of appellate court
judges that supervises independent counsel matters, Reno explained
why she wanted more time. But the panel placed that filing under
seal.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision followed a meeting on Monday with senior advisers
who expressed discordant views on the issue, said law enforcement
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said Reno
concluded that no decision could be reached without further
investigation, although it was unclear what specific factual issues
remained open.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials within the Justice Department expressed dismay
over Reno's indecision. They said that the Justice Department has
had evidence relating to the case for nearly two years. And, they
noted, Reno has had four months to weigh the issue, beginning with
a one-month initial review period, then followed by the three-month
preliminary investigation that was to have ended on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, the legal issues were familiar. Reno has
decided similar issues in two of the seven cases she has referred
to independent counsels. Those investigations center on whether
Henry Cisneros, the former housing secretary, lied to the FBI about
the extent of his payments to his former mistress and whether Bruce
Babbitt, the interior secretary, lied about a departmental decision
to deny an Indian casino permit.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Reno found insufficient evidence for seeking an
independent counsel to investigate whether Vice President Al Gore
had lied to investigators about his 1996 fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   With a decision on Ickes postponed for up to two months, Reno
has one other independent counsel issue to decide before year's
end. That case concerns whether Clinton and his aides violated
federal election law by directing a massive advertising campaign
financed with Democratic Party funds intended for generic party
activities. Election auditors have questioned whether the
advertisements should have been financed directly by the
Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision about Ickes hinges on his answer to a single
question asked during three days in which he was questioned under
oath. Ickes was asked, ``What did the administration do regarding
the Diamond Walnut strike?'' Ickes replied: ``Nothing that I know
of.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement appeared to be contradicted by witnesses and
documents. The Teamsters union had been frustrated in efforts to
end the labor dispute at a Diamond Walnut processing plant in
Stockton, Calif., and had discussed the issue with Ickes. White
House documents indicated that Ickes had sought help from Mickey
Kantor, then the U.S. trade representative, whom he wanted to
intervene with the company. At Ickes' request, Kantor phoned
Diamond Walnut's president.
</P>
<P>
   Kantor testified to a congressional panel earlier this year that
he phoned Diamond Walnut, but knowing almost nothing of the facts,
simply asked for a ``benign'' status report on the likelihood of a
settlement. Kantor said he did not pressure the company. Diamond
Walnut's president said at the same of the hearing that he had had
not felt threatened, but that he did regard the call as part of a
Teamster effort ``to bring us to our knees.''

KING PUMPS UP THE VOLUME ON HOLYFIELD-LEWIS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don King was selling the Evander Holyfield-Lennox
Lewis heavyweight unification fight on March 13, selling Madison
Square Garden as the ``temple in the mecca of boxing,'' but mostly
selling himself as a bejeweled Job set upon by evil forces who had
kicked him around but didn't finish him off.
</P>
<P>
   This is King's post-Mike Tyson period, so he must sell the
Holyfield-Lewis fight with ferocity. He is not guaranteed a profit
from the promotion, so he must cajole pay-per-view purchases above
reasonable expectations to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you going to sell two million buys? I predict for you
two million buys,'' he bellowed Monday from a dais on the Garden's
arena floor. ``You say: `What is this crazy guy saying? Is he out
of his mind?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, no fight has ever rung up 2 million pay-per-view
purchases _ the closest was 1.89 million for the second
Holyfield-Tyson bout _ and Holyfield's pay-per-view appeal has
faltered when he has not faced Tyson, Riddick Bowe or George
Foreman. Lewis' pay-per-view appeal is unproven, at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say this man can't sell, you say that man can't sell,''
King said, noting criticism that Holyfield and Lewis need foes who
are more charismatic to set pay-per-view records. ``Don't take my
right to have my own opinion away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   But King, well, he can sell. It's no surprise that his slogan
for the fight is ``Kings' Crowning Glory.'' He doesn't mind making
you think he's one of the kings, but the threesome is actually
Holyfield and Lewis, the heavyweight title holders, and Budweiser,
which calls itself the king of beers and is the fight's major
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic assessment of the Holyfield-Lewis pay-per-view
comes from Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports and
HBO Sports, which will carry the fight on its TVKO unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One million,'' he said, up from his 700,000 estimate a year
ago. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``A dearth of big fights, no interim fights for Lennox and
Evander, and Don is engaged because his profit comes from working
the pay-per-view,'' he said. ``Over 850,000, he's in profit.''
</P>
<P>
   For King and Abraham, the fight is detente after eight years of
war. King nixed a multifight extension of a Tyson deal at HBO in
1990 and fled for Showtime, because of Tyson's animosity toward
Larry Merchant, an HBO/TVKO analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, King and Abraham have existed at boxing's equivalent
of Defcon 1, the highest state of readiness for nuclear war.
Renewing their relationship was, Abraham said, ``like dating your
ex-wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Said King: ``We've never argued, never had cross words. We
fought over a broadcaster, not business. This is a great reunion
with Seth.''
</P>
<P>
   One executive of the King-Abraham talks, said: ``It wasn't a
lovefest. There were moments of genuine anger and frustration. Don
had to temper his autocracy. He's ruled the roost at Showtime. He
knows he can't do that at HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said that during a dinner over shrimp in garlic sauce
and tangerine beef in October at his apartment with King and Jim
Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer, Abraham became convinced that the final
pieces of the fight puzzle were fitting in. Late that night, Milt
Chwasky, Lewis' lawyer, joined them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all business, no theatrics,'' said Abraham, who
admitted that he was a mite rusty in his King-handling skills. ``My
Kingology degree had lapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chwasky recalled an incident several weeks ago when he worried
that the deal would fold. ``Don wanted to pay Lennox the last $2
million in a check, not with a letter of credit,'' Chwasky said.
``I'd have the L.C. two weeks before the fight, but the check
after. I didn't want to chase Don down for the money.`
</P>
<P>
   Another key part of making the fight was King's deal with the
Garden, which is paying a site fee of $8.3 million, part of a pot
that includes $20 million from Time Warner and $1 million from
Budweiser. Holyfield will get $20 million, Lewis about $9.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   King and Charles F. Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, which
owns the Garden, hail from Cleveland. But as young go-getters, they
hardly inhabited complementary worlds. ``I was in the numbers
business and Chuck wasn't putting his numbers in,'' King said with
a cackle.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Dolan said, ``I've enjoyed many hours with Don across
the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   King made his friendship with Dolan sound like a relationship
between courtly lords of the manor. ``Chuck's word is his bond,''
King said. ``He once gave me $3 million on a handshake. He knows
me. He respects me as a man of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least as a man who can bring Holyfield to the Garden for
what Dolan hopes will be an arena-jamming event with seats priced
from $100 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of months ago, I told Chuck we were interested in the
fight and Chuck said, `I have Don in my office,''' said Dave
Checketts, the Garden's president. ``I went in, Chuck left and we
got the deal done in 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts said his goal was to make King forget Las Vegas or any
other site willing to pay a fee of more than $10 million. Time
Warner lobbied for the Garden because of the media attention
emanating from New York that can spur pay-per-view sales.
Cablevision can push the fight at Garden events, on the MSG Network
and Fox Sports New York and in its Nobody Beats the Wiz stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be the mecca of boxing if you're not in the game for
something like this,'' Checketts said. ``Chuck knows that.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Former USC coach to testify on perjury conviction resulting from
affair By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Atlanta resident Pam Parsons is scheduled to
testify today before the House Judiciary Committee about her 1984
conviction for perjury in a high-profile civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, a former coach of the University of South Carolina's
women's basketball team, spent four months in jail for lying under
oath in a suit arising from her sexual affair with a member of the
team, Tina Buck, a graduate of the former Briarcliff High in DeKalb
County.
</P>
<P>
   Buck also was sentenced to four months for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   As a witness called by the Republican side of the bitterly
partisan committee, Parsons will be queried in detail about why she
made a false statement in a $75 million libel lawsuit she filed
against Time Inc. for an article Sports Illustrated published about
her lesbian relationship with a team player.
</P>
<P>
   But her testimony may elicit a few questions from Republicans
themselves, particularly when they find out that she thinks Clinton
is ``one of the greatest presidents we've ever had'' and that she
had trouble recollecting the details of her own lawsuit during an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   So why did they call her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' said Parsons, who now lives in Atlanta.
``Maybe they liked my red hair. ``
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Republicans called her to counter assertions from
Clinton supporters that those convicted of perjury in civil suits
are seldom prosecuted and even less frequently jailed. Clinton is
accused of lying under oath in the civil suit brought by Paula
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a bit like she had found a new religion in the truth,
Parsons said that she would share her personal odyssey with the
committee's members. Remaining mum about what she would say in
particular, she said her only goal was to share truth (and) love
with everyone that I come in contact with for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, who would say nothing about her life in Atlanta, said
she came into contact with truth through a long process of
self-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shined the light where the darkness was and I brought it
together within me so I could be who I really wanted to be in this
lifetime _ A woman who is full of peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the truth has set Parsons free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who I am now is a person who has recovered from everything
that I could not face,'' Parsons said. As a person who has
recovered from a damaging past, she said she had words of strength
to deliver the message to others.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the particulars of her case against the parent
company of Sports Illustrated magazine, Parsons said she could not
remember them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not relate to things from good or bad, right or wrong.
What is, is,'' she said. When asked what is, is, she said, ``I'll
talk about it tomorrow.''

MICROSOFT UNABLE TO SHAKE TESTIMONY ON MONOPOLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a day of prickly, detailed cross-examination at
Microsoft's antitrust trial, Frederick Warren-Boulton, an
economist, summed up the government's case of how the software
giant wields its market power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft cannot point a gun to people's heads,''
Warren-Boulton said in response to a question from Microsoft's
lawyer, ``but they can make them an offer they can't refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this broad portrayal of Microsoft as a bullying
monopolist that is the main target of Microsoft's defense as it
tries to attack every fact, theory and assumption underlying the
government's case.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination of Warren-Boulton, the government's
seventh witness, has illuminated the company's defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the slow but steady process of cleaning off the
mud that has been thrown at Microsoft,'' said Mark Murray, a
Microsoft spokesman. ``The facts do not fit the government's
generalizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton spent his fourth day on the stand Monday,
undergoing cross-examination on his long written testimony. As an
economist, he has offered arguments on many issues in the case,
unlike industry witnesses whose testimony focused more narrowly on
their areas of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the questioning centered on Microsoft's contracts with
personal computer makers, Internet service suppliers and companies
that create programming on the World Wide Web. The government
contends that Microsoft illegally used its market power to persuade
these companies to enter exclusionary deals to curb competition in
the market for Web browser software.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer, tried to get
Warren-Boulton to concede that Microsoft's deals with Internet
service suppliers, from America Online to small local companies,
did not prevent them from distributing other browsers, including
the Netscape Communications' Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton acknowledged the narrow point but noted that most
of the contracts called for the Internet access companies to
guarantee that 75 percent or more of their customers use
Microsoft's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara countered by asking whether such exclusive,
cross-promotional deals were standard in many industries. ``Absent
monopoly power,'' Warren-Boulton replied in a pointed return to his
theme that the antitrust rules are different for monopolies,
``exclusive-dealing arrangements can be assumed to be benign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara offered evidence that several large computer
manufacturers, including Hewlett-Packard, now ship their personal
computers with their own hybrid Web browser installed. Was that not
an indication, Lacovara asked, that Microsoft was not restricting
manufacturers nearly as much as the government have contended?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, Warren-Boulton responded. The Hewlett-Packard
browser, like others, is really just a ``shell'' _ a custom-made
user interface behind which lies the code for Microsoft's browser,
Internet Explorer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This works for Microsoft,'' Warren-Boulton said, ``because it
increases the installed base for Internet Explorer'' and prompts
developers to write complementary software.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years of enforcing contracts that limited the
freedom of computer makers to offer Internet software from rivals,
Microsoft loosened the contracts this year, mostly with the
introduction in June of Windows 98, an upgrade of its operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Microsoft relaxed some contract restrictions on
Internet service suppliers early this year. By then, Warren-Boulton
said, ``the game was over'' because key channels of software
distribution had already been tipped in Microsoft's favor. The
easing of contract restrictions also came after the Justice
Department's high-profile investigation of Microsoft was well under
way and the company faced Senate hearings and a government
challenge in a separate case.
</P>
<P>
   While scoring a few points against Warren-Boulton, Microsoft has
been unable to counter a powerful part of his testimony, which
attempts to demonstrate that Microsoft does have monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   One definition of a monopolist, Warren-Boulton noted, is that he
can raise prices for his product with no fear that the price
increase will give power to his competitors and cost him market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton said the price Microsoft charges computer makers
for Windows has more than doubled in the last seven years, while
the overall price of a personal computer has dropped precipitously.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's share of the operating system market has
steadily increased; Windows is now installed on 95 percent of
computers sold.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that over the years it has vastly improved
Windows so that when adjusted for performance the price of Windows
remains low.

SUN IS DEADLY ENEMY FOR 10-YEAR-OLD ARIZONA BOY  
</HEADLINE>

   &UR; ALSO MOVED IN `A' CATEGORY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `` '' GILBERT, Arizona _
</P>
<P>
   `Between the dark and the daylight,
</P>
<P>
   When the night is beginning to lower,
</P>
<P>
   Comes a pause in the day's occupations,
</P>
<P>
   That is known as the children's hour.'' &QL; 
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow &QL; 
When night falls, the Collin Cassinat hour begins.
</P>
<P>
   As other children take cover from the darkness, Collin's
playtime is just beginning. Under the moonlight, he races his bike,
catches frogs, hunts bugs and exhilarates in his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine is no friend to Collin. Exposures of just minutes would
cause his skin to redden, burn and blister. An overdose would kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Collin, 9, is a child of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Born with a genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum, in
which the cells of the body lack the ability to repair DNA damage
from ultraviolet rays, Collin's best chance for survival is to
avoid all sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Windows in his family's Gilbert home near Phoenix are tinted and
covered with blinds. The family van is outfitted with blackout
curtains. When Collin goes outside during the day, he is swaddled
head to toe in long sleeves, long pants and a cap with a flap in
the back that makes him look like the youngest soldier in the
French Foreign Legion. He huddles under a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Cindy and Tony Cassinat, estimate their son is
exposed to no more than five minutes of sunshine a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad'' is how Collin describes his sheltered life. Yet he's a
bright, chipper youngster with an impish personality and no lack of
friends. Two little girls have appointed themselves his escorts
between school buildings when he is wrapped so tightly against the
sun he can't see through his protective garb.
</P>
<P>
   At recess, classmates vie for the chance to stay indoors with
Collin and play field hockey in the halls.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there are advantages to having XP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get spoiled,'' he said with a grin, ``by my teacher, then my
mama, then my dad, then my principal.''
</P>
<P>
   Collin was once invited to a sleep-over at the Phoenix Zoo. Last
summer he went to Camp Sundown in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where young
campers with XP enjoyed indoor activities during the day and played
outside long into the night.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting alone in a darkened van parked where he can watch
his sister's soccer practice, his eyes get a bit teary as he counts
down the minutes until sunset when he can break out of the van and
run free.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:34 p.m., the Collin hour begins.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Cassinat first noticed something alarming about her third
son in February 1989. Six weeks old, Collin had been sitting
outside in his stroller, bundled against the chill. The next day he
appeared to have eczema on his cheeks _ crusty, scabby, oozing
patches.
</P>
<P>
   With a little research, Cindy learned that sunlight could help
dry up eczema, so she took Collin outside again. When the
``eczema'' spread to his arms, her pediatrician prescribed a
cortisone salve.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis: Fair Irish skin. Treatment: Keep that boy out of the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Collin spent his toddler years covered in sunscreen, playing
indoors or in the shade. He wore hats and long-sleeved shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``His skin was always dry and cracky a little bit,'' Tony
Cassinat said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cindy read a newspaper article about Julian Nieves
Armenta, a 4-year-old Mexican boy being treated for XP at Maricopa
Medical Center and introduced at a University of Arizona medical
symposium. Multiple skin cancers covered his head and dotted his
eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Julian's condition, minus the numerous malignancies, sounded
remarkably like Collin's, Cindy thought.
</P>
<P>
   A UA dermatologist confirmed her suspicions. In 20 years of
practice in pediatric dermatology, Dr. Ron Hansen had seen just two
cases of XP. Julian was one. Collin was the other. Most doctors
don't see any.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 130 cases exist in the country, with an estimated
1,000 worldwide. Collin's is the only known case in Arizona, the
Cassinats say.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme freckling and photophobia _ severe discomfort in the sun
_ are the earliest symptoms. Those signs should be detected by age
1 or 2; then protection can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking a nocturnal person,'' Hansen said. ``Even a
minute or two of sun is enough DNA damage to have skin cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreen is a puny weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a diagnosis, the Cassinats devoted themselves to
shielding Collin and instilled in him a sense of self-protection.
If someone opens a window or raises a shade, he'll cry out,
``You're killing me!'' Cindy said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, his cries are all too true.
</P>
<P>
   Undiagnosed and unprotected, children with XP usually die by the
age of 10. Protected, they can enjoy a life expectancy of about 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his parents, Collin should have nearly a normal life
span, Hansen said: ``Collin will do much better. They were very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   `NOT ONE TO MOPE'
</P>
<P>
   At Greenfield Elementary School, third-grader Collin blends in
with the other pupils. Only his UV-protective jacket gives him
away.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom windows are shaded, doors to the outside kept shut.
Collin spends his day inside, except for a weekly dash to the
building next door where art classes are held. That's when Diana
Hancock and Amanda Schreck guide their friend across campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help me so I don't run into stuff,'' Collin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he does run into stuff _ the school, a tree. Sometimes
he trips. But he picks himself up and forges on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not one to mope,'' said his teacher, Sue Villa. ``He
doesn't feel sorry for himself. . . . He's a great little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Villa takes Collin's special needs in stride. When the school
had its fall festival, she arranged indoor events. When the class
was mandated to clean up school grounds for a lesson in ecology,
she sent them to the cafeteria to pick up trash. She creates indoor
science projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always other ways to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Collin's future in school is uncertain. When he graduates to
Greenfield Junior High School in three years, his parents will have
to evaluate the facility for safety. Are windows tinted? Will all
classes be in one building?
</P>
<P>
   The Cassinats pray the next school will be as accessible as this
one. Cindy pulls her van as close as possible to the front door at
Greenfield Elementary, and Collin races in. Once, when the driveway
was blocked by a van collision, she commandeered the delivery
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can continue in a normal school,'' Tony said.
``That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   If the junior high proves unacceptable, the Cassinats won't
hesitate to ask for modifications to protect their son. If the
building can't meet their needs, they'll be forced to home school
him, further isolating a boy who already lives a life apart.
</P>
<P>
   A CALCULATED SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   The odds that Collin would be born with XP are phenomenal. To
produce the condition, both parents must be carriers of an aberrant
recessive gene. The chances of one partner being a carrier are one
in 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, fate determined that Cindy, who grew up in California,
and Tony, a native of Wyoming, should meet, marry and have four
children. And one of those children would inherit a pair of XP
genes.
</P>
<P>
   News of that genetic fluke came as a blow, Tony says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at you and say your son can not go outside any more.
The next day we told the kids. That was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tony insists Collin's needs don't control their lives,
they live on a calculated schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, Cindy knows exactly when the sun sets. Collin
heads outside 10 minutes later. In the summer, that can be as late
at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There have been just two family vacations _ to Lake Tahoe in
1996 and to Camp Sundown last year.
</P>
<P>
   While his two brothers, Chris, 16, and Craig, 12, and sister
Courtney, 8, are hooked on sports, Collin shines in the chess club.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a restaurant before sunset means wrapping Collin ``like
a soft taco,'' Cindy said, and ignoring the stares of patrons. The
explanation, when asked for, is that the boy is allergic to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Collin's diagnosis, the family moved from a
1,100-square foot house into a new 4,000-square-foot house,
quadrupling Collin's indoor world. With living room furniture kept
sparse, he was allowed to roller skate inside until the wheels
became too dirty. Tracks in the carpeting were a small price to pay
to let a boy burn off energy.
</P>
<P>
   But Collin still lives life upside down. When other children are
playing outside, he's peering at them from his front window. When
he's outside, his friends are already in for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sunshine world out there,'' Tony said. ``People open
their windows and let the sun shine in. This goes against what
society is brought up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Because XP is so rare, little scientific research is being done.
For the time being, treatment means vigilence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word is `no sun.' We make judgment calls on what is
worthwhile,'' Tony said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassinats are scrupulous about checking Collin's skin for
suspicious spots. So far, he's had more than 30 removed; 20 were
cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' Cindy said, ``but we wish they wouldn't
keep popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Collin is lucky. Some children with XP suffer blindness,
hearing loss, neurological impairment and mental retardation,
although the connection is unclear. Despite some minor learning
disabilities, Collin is smart and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For a boy whose enemy is the sun, Arizona would seem the evil
empire. In truth, the Valley of the Sun is Collin's best friend.
Phoenix has no more ultraviolet rays than cloudy Seattle. Clouds do
not block UV rays.
</P>
<P>
   And where else could a boy play outside after dark all year
round? Not Minnesota. Not North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORT GROUP OF 1
</P>
<P>
   Because Collin is the only child with XP in Arizona, there is no
one with whom to commiserate. He is a support group of one.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy said, ``You're looking at XP-AZ right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet (www.xps.org/) is the Cassinats' link to XP parents
across the country. At Camp Sundown, they learned families cope as
best they can with the rare illness, keeping abreast of the few
developments in the field.
</P>
<P>
   A UV monitor, which detects ultraviolet rays, can alert parents
to dangerous levels of sunlight. But it is an expensive tool the
Cassinats can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising innovation is a pint-size space suit developed
by NASA. When perfected, it will shield children from UV light
outdoors. Although several models have been constructed, however,
the XP Society has not yet endorsed any design, believing current
suits offer only a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   Collin tries to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants one,'' Cindy said. ``He asks for one all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing outside during daylight hours is still only a dream for
Collin.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can break a mother's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get down,'' Cindy said, ``but I can just start
thinking about him and start crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never ask, `Why us?' '' she said, with a smile she's been
practicing for a decade, sustained by the words of a friend who
told her, `` `He's here for a very important reason. He has this
disease for a very important reason.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After sunset, those reasons mean little to a boy at play. Collin
has captured a toad, and in his victory, the child of the night
comes alive. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee took
renewed interest on Monday in President Clinton's 1996 campaign
finances and planned to subpoena the director of the FBI and the
Justice Department's former senior prosecutor for campaign finance
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment inquiry into Clinton moving into its final,
critical stages, Republican aides said the committee would vote on
the subpoenas on Tuesday after a full-day hearing intended to
underscore the seriousness of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, moving beyond the Lewinsky matter in yet another
effort to broaden the impeachment inquiry, could take depositions
as early as the end of this week from the FBI director, Louis
Freeh, and the senior prosecutor, Charles La Bella, both of whom
had urged Attorney General Janet Reno to seek an independent
counsel to scrutinize the president's campaign finance practices in
the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   The committee Republicans also plan to issue subpoenas demanding
that Clinton and Reno provide the full, unedited memos that Freeh
and La Bella wrote to Reno to support their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   And looking for any new evidence of obstruction of justice by
the president, another issue in the impeachment inquiry, the
Republicans said they would also seek Justice Department documents
concerning an array of figures under scrutiny in the inquiry into
Democratic fund raising: John Huang, Johnny Chung, Charlie Trie and
Mark Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   The committee signaled its interest in campaign finance
questions as Republicans in the full House appeared divided over
how to proceed against Clinton. Some Republicans were starting to
call for their leadership to take a stronger hand in developing a
strategy for how the issue will be dealt with on the floor in
December and whether any impeachment vote would be followed by a
vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the most important vote any member of Congress
will ever take and yet there appears to be no strategy,'' said Rep.
Peter King, R-N.Y., who is opposed to impeachment. ``We have
seven-year plans for a balanced budget and five-year plans for a
balanced budget, but there doesn't seem to be a three-week plan for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to approve on a party-line
vote at least one article of impeachment against Clinton and
possibly as many as three by the end of next week. Republicans were
said to be drafting three articles, one on perjury, one on
obstruction of justice and witness tampering, and one on abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Committee aides said the examination of campaign finance
questions would not alter the plans of the committee chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, to send the committee's recommendations on impeachment
to the full House in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the committee wanted to see if the past
investigations into campaign finance had uncovered allegations of
wrongdoing by the President and whether there was information that
could contribute to a case of obstruction of justice. ``We want to
make sure that we've covered the area,'' the official said. ``It
would be dereliction of duty not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats denounced the new move and were expected to vote
against the subpoenas. ``So we're going to dive into campaign
finance now?'' asked Rep. Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat on the
committee. ``The process gets stranger and stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had previously sought the memorandums of Freeh
and La Bella, but a federal court told the Justice Department that
it had not shown sufficient reason to hand over the full documents,
which contain grand jury information, Republican and Democratic
aides said. The Republicans are hoping that the court will consider
a subpoena from Congress to be more serious.

SPECULATION RISES ON COMPANIES RIPE FOR MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BANKERS-TRUST-DEUTSCHE, BANKERS-DEAL, BANKERS-NEWMAN) 
(lb) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The question on almost every trader's mind after
Deutsche Bank AG announced its $10.1 billion acquisition of Bankers
Trust Corp. on Monday was ``Who's next?''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market was already rife with rumors last week about
which companies were candidates. On Friday, shares in Dresdner Bank
AG of Germany climbed 7.2 percent to a 12-week high, fueled by
speculation that it was in talks with Credit Suisse Group about a
possible combination. Executives from Credit Suisse declined to
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were speculating, too, that something was up at ABN-Amro
of the Netherlands, which analysts said has been shopping for a
partner in the United States. And on Friday, Martin Taylor, chief
executive of Barclays PLC of Britain, resigned, which some analysts
said left the banking concern vulnerable to a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to any successful merger going forward, analysts
agree, is banks combining asset management, commercial banking and
corporate advising under one roof. The Deutsche Bank acquisition of
Bankers Trust, in particular, said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch, ``forces a whole range of strategic rethinking in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, commercial banks have been slow to move into asset
management and investment banking, unlike their U.S. counterparts,
and analysts expect more European banks to search for partners in
those areas.
</P>
<P>
   But cultural conflicts and varying tax and accounting rules make
any intra-Europe mergers challenging at best. Besides, many
European concerns are looking to the lucrative U.S. market to
expand their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to have size, scale and a wide range of products,''
said Michael Mayo, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
That is so they can better serve their clients, which themselves
are going global. Over the long term, the trend is to be a global
adviser ``so you can better serve multinational corporations,''
Mayo said.
</P>
<P>
   Several U.S. banks and brokerage houses have long been
considered acquisition targets. J.P. Morgan, for one, is thought to
have rebuffed Deutsche Bank. ``But it is not immune,'' Kraushaar
said. ``J.P. Morgan is stuck between smaller companies'' and larger
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the company embarked on a cost-containment
effort to save money. And J.P. Morgan has been an active adviser to
merger candidates themselves, most recently to Exxon Corp., which
has been in talks to acquire Mobil Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies' names were rumored to be interesting
candidates, including Lehman Brothers and the brokerage firms
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Paine Webber Inc. And Chase
Manhattan Corp., which approached Merrill Lynch at one point, is
thought to still be looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is hype, but it's not completely wacky,'' said an
investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``You
wander around the marketplace and you look at all the options. Now
people are playing the matching-the-name game.''

 &HT;    Atlanta first city to host to All-Stars, Super Bowl in same year
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves have won one in extra innings. The
club will entertain the 2000 All-Star game after being informed
three years ago the game was headed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about the future venue of the Florida Marlins prompted
Major League Baseball to withdraw the 2000 game from south Florida
and redesignate it to Turner Field. An official announcement will
be made today in a press conference at the Ted.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will also have Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000, the first time
a city will be host to both an NFL championship and baseball's
All-Star game in the same year. In addition, Atlanta has been
awarded NCAA basketball's Final Four championships in both 2002 and
2007.
</P>
<P>
   ''Atlanta is an outstanding choice for Major League Baseball's
first All-Star game of the new millennium,'' baseball Commissioner
Bud Selig said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins were awarded the game at midseason in 1995, the
club's third season under owner Wayne Huizenga. But Huizenga has
had the franchise for sale for the past 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   While a $150 million purchase by south Florida bonds broker John
Henry has been in negotiation since mid-summer, league management
has become concerned about Henry's pledge to build a new stadium
and whether the facility would be completed in time to host the
mid-summer classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had been hopeful of getting the 2002 game, though
that year's game could revert to Florida or the Milwaukee Brewers,
who will move into a new Miller Stadium in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has been the site of just one All-Star game since the
Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966. That game was July 25, 1972, a 4-3
victory by the National League that included a two-run homer by the
Braves' Hank Aaron.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States on Monday pledged an extra $400
million in aid to the Palestinians, which is expected to nearly
double the amount of their economic assistance from the United
States over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by President Clinton at the start of a
one-day international donor conference sponsored by the State
Department, which brought an estimated total of more than $3
billion in new pledges of aid for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to open the conference here, Clinton said the United
States had decided to increase aid in hopes of convincing the
Palestinians to stick to the peace accord with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must convince those who have invested so much in this
process that it was a sound investment,'' he said. ``For too long,
too many young people have turned to terrorism and old hatreds
partly because they had nothing better to do. We must give them a
different future to believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Appealing for generous contributions from other wealthy nations,
he said that the peace efforts had so far brought ``too little
tangible improvement in the life of the Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the last major international donors conference in October
1993, shortly after completion of the Oslo peace agreement between
the Palestinians and Israel, the United States made a five-year
pledge to the Palestinians of $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that before the
announcement on Monday, the United States had expected to continue
to provide about $100 million a year in aid to the Palestinians.
But with Clinton's addition of $400 million, the total package of
American economic assistance should total about $900 million over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The additional aid reflects a promise made by Clinton to pay for
steps needed to carry out the latest land-for-peace deal between
the Palestinians and the Israelis, which was hammered out in a
summit meeting in October in Wye, Md., with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that despite large aid grants in the past, the
Palestinian economy had continued to falter. ``Per capita income is
down, unemployment is too high, living conditions are extremely
difficult,'' he said. ``An honest assessment would lead us to the
conclusion that we have not realized all our intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is particularly eager to see improvement in
the Palestinian economy to help Arafat blunt the influence of the
militant Islamic group Hamas, which has sought public support
through sponsorship of medical clinics, schools and sports clubs in
the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Clinton in the White House, Arafat appeared
at the conference to make a plea for pledges, warning that ``the
Palestinian economy has witnessed a continuous decline.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Israel of undermining the Palestinian economy through
its repeated closing of the border between Israel and the
Palestinian territories in response to what Israel has described as
terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli closure policy is the primary and direct cause for
the dangerous decline in the performance of the Palestinian economy
over the past five years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference to announce the results of the donors'
conference, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said: ``We do not
have exact pledges, but it appears that delegations pledged more
than $3 billion today, well above the $2.3 billion pledged at the
1993 donor conference, and that by itself is a substantial
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the pledges ``are evidence of the international
community's firm commitment to help the Palestinian people build
lives that are better, freer and safer, and to do our part in
laying the foundations for a secure and prosperous Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that other large donations of aid had
been pledged by the European Union, $480 million; Japan, $200
million; Norway, which organized the secret talks that led to the
1993 Oslo peace accords, $175 million; Saudi Arabia, $100 million;
Kuwait, $80 million, and Canada, $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   American officials and Arafat brushed aside questions on Monday
about news reports last weekend suggesting that millions of dollars
in British aid earmarked for housing projects in the West Bank and
Gaza had been diverted to build luxury apartments for key deputies
to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an issue for the British,'' said a senior American
official, noting that the U.S. aid to the Palestinians goes
directly to contractors and private groups involved in development
projects, not to Arafat's Palestinian Authority. ``This is not an
issue for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright said at her news conference that in the
distribution of American aid to the Palestinians, ``every dollar is
accounted for and it's completely transparent.''

CONTROVERSIES HAVE NFL QUESTIONING ITS OFFICIATING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past five days, game officials in the National Football
League have come under attack as much as any time in recent
history. Anyone wearing stripes had better duck for cover.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny is a result of disputed calls by officials in two
games, and the furor has got so hot that two owners interviewed
Monday said the league should address the situation at the owners'
meetings next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the
officiating system is good but needs to be great, and they
suggested the NFL should seriously consider hiring full-time game
officials. Currently, officials hold other jobs too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, and I truly believe this, the best officials in
sports,'' one of the owners said, ``but these blown calls are bad
for the league's image. It's killing us. All I'm saying is maybe we
can improve things. If we can't, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another owner: ``What's happened in the last few days has
been an embarrassment to the league. This needs to be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   The league office moved Monday to address one of the issues, the
disputed coin toss in last Thursday's Detroit-Pittsburgh game. As a
result of the Steelers' claim that the coin toss was a critical
factor in their loss to the Lions, the league revised its coin-toss
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, the captain of the visiting team will be asked to
call heads or tails before the coin is tossed, instead of during
the toss. And two additional game officials, the back judge and the
field judge, will be present for the toss along with the referee.
</P>
<P>
   The league did not address the other game that drew unwanted
attention to the referees, Buffalo's last-second loss to New
England on Sunday. But George Young, the league vice president who
oversees officials, stood solidly behind the officials, saying they
are the best in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sport would you say has better officials than we do?''
Young asked. ``I would say none. We have the most diligent
officials in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the recent spate of controversial rulings has
again raised the issue of instant replay and has some teams fuming.
</P>
<P>
   The incident in Detroit came at the beginning of overtime.
Replays clearly showed Steelers running back Jerome Bettis calling
``tails'' for the coin toss in overtime. But Referee Phil Luckett
said he first heard ``heads'' and awarded the ball to Detroit. The
Lions then drove for the game-winning 42-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the procedural change Monday, Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue said the conflicting accounts of the incident ``do not
resolve the matter'' and added that ``our new procedure should make
certain that the Thanksgiving Day incident is not repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   The farce led to joking during opening coin tosses over the
weekend. In St. Louis, Atlanta linebacker Jessie Tuggle showed up
with a placard that said ``heads'' so that Referee Ron Winter would
not be confused. In Oakland, Referee Ron Blum asked Washington's
Darrell Green to call the toss. Green said ``heads,'' and Blum
asked, ``Are you sure?''
</P>
<P>
   But what happened in Buffalo was no laughing matter,
particularly to the Bills. Their game against New England was
crucial because if they had won, they could have kept pace in the
American Football Conference East and pushed the Patriots further
behind in the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo led, 21-17, late in the game, and two crucial calls
helped the Patriots eventually win, 25-21. First, officials ruled
that wide receiver Shawn Jefferson was in bounds on a 10-yard
fourth-down catch, which gave the Patriots a first down at the
Buffalo 26 with six seconds left. The Bills say Jefferson was
clearly out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Bills were furious about an end zone pass-interference
call against safety Henry Jones on wide receiver Terry Glenn, which
gave New England the ball at the 1-yard line with no time on the
clock. Tight end Ben Coates scored on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't playing the ball, but he did make contact with the
receiver,'' Referee Walt Coleman said. ``That's pass
interference.''
</P>
<P>
   As a form of protest, the Bills walked off the field as the
Patriots lined up for the extra point. They refused to return, and
the Patriots' place-kicker, Adam Vinatieri, ran for a 2-point
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they gave them the game,'' Buffalo Coach Wade Phillips
said, referring to the officials, ``they might as well give them
the extra point.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jones: ``We were robbed. Terry Glenn jumped for the ball,
but no one even grabbed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The league had no comment on the two calls.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Wilson, the normally stoic Bills owner, did. He
blasted the officiating, calling it the worst he has ever seen and
adding that he did not care if he was fined by the league for his
comments _ which he might be.
</P>
<P>
   Some team officials say that only instant replay can improve the
system. But Young, who has long been an opponent of it, said
instant replay might not have applied to either call in the Bills
game, especially the play in which Jefferson was ruled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty tight call,'' Young said. ``Suppose we had
instant replay _would it change that call? I don't know. I don't
know if the replay was that clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Young think the league will go to full-time officials, like
professional baseball, basketball and hockey?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system works well the way it is,'' Young said. ``We have a
great system.''

JOHNSON SETTLES ON DIAMONDBACKS FOR $52.4 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the winner is ... the only nonwinner in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers have won two division championships in the
past three seasons, the Anaheim Angels just missed finishing first
this year and have since added Mo Vaughn, and the Los Angeles
Dodgers are looking to turn Rupert Murdoch's money into a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Johnson, who could have signed with any of those
teams, opted Monday to join the Arizona Diamondbacks, the only team
among the four with a losing record this year. Johnson, the most
dominant left-handed pitcher in baseball, agreed to a four-year
contract, with an option for a fifth year, for $52.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1998 losing team, the Baltimore Orioles, planned to
announce the signing of another free agent, Albert Belle, Tuesday.
Belle, who leaves the Chicago White Sox after two years of a
five-year, $55 million contract, will receive about $65 million for
five years from the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' losing status was not surprising considering
this was their first year, but Johnson is gambling that Jerry
Colangelo, the team's managing partner, will quickly create a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who in two months in Houston this past season showed
what a dominant pitcher can do in a pennant race, wasn't available
for comment, but one of his agents, Barry Meister, said, ``We
became convinced of Arizona's determination to make the team a
winner and the fact that they have the resources to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   All four teams were close in their offers, Meister said, but
Johnson, with significant input from his wife, Lisa, accepted his
hometown team's deal that calls for him to receive $12.35 million a
year and a guaranteed buyout of $3 million for the option year,
which would have a salary of $12 million to $15 million depending
on where he finishes in the Cy Young Award voting the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which makes Johnson the second-highest-paid player
at $13.1 million a year behind Vaughn's $13,333,333, also includes
$600,000 worth of perks, including use of a skybox at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson recently built a palatial home in the Phoenix suburb of
Paradise Valley, and he had always said that what his family wanted
was important. He and his wife have three children under the age of
4. But Johnson also wanted to play for a contender, even if it was
a contender-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona had started out with the most difficult row to hoe in
terms of their ability to compete,'' Meister said. ``But Arizona
made some impressive moves, and we felt the competitive issue was
starting to resolve itself. It's a city he's comfortable with,
they've got a world-class manager in Buck Showalter and Jerry
Colangelo is a guy who's convinced he's going to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves Meister referred to were the signing of four free
agents, pitchers Todd Stottlemyre, Armando Reynoso and Greg
Swindell and first baseman Greg Colbrunn. How impressive those
moves are remains to be seen, but for the most part, they seem to
be signings that could help improve a team that had a 65-97 record
its rookie season, if not catapult it into first-place or even
wild-card status.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Dodgers signed Johnson, on the other hand, they would
very likely have been the favorites in the Diamondbacks' division,
the National League West. The same would have been true in the
American League West for the Rangers and the Angels, who had been
viewed as the Diamondbacks' primary competition.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the Diamondbacks will not take future steps
on the level of a Johnson signing to gain contending status. They
were interested in Bernie Williams, but not at the price the Boston
Red Sox offered and the Yankees matched. A year ago the expansion
team signed shortstop Jay Bell for five years and $34 million, then
traded for Matt Williams and gave him a five-year extension for
$42.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The first step the Diamondbacks want to take is to trade a
starting pitcher, either Brian Anderson or Omar Daal, for a good
outfielder. Among the available outfielders are Jim Edmonds or
Garret Anderson of Anaheim, Albert Martin of Pittsburgh, Reggie
Sanders of Cincinnati and Willie Greene of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said the Diamondbacks received three trade offers
within a few hours after they announced Johnson's signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we had a legitimate chance because no one qualified as
having a home-field advantage like we did,'' Colangelo said by
telephone from Phoenix. ``We met 29 days ago. One of his big
concerns was how quickly we could become competitive. Competing now
was important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he told Johnson to watch what the team would be
doing in the next few weeks, and in the space of two weeks, they
signed the four free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt with the moves we made we had improved ourselves
considerably,'' the owner said. ``With the addition of Randy
himself, we felt we could compete much sooner than later. The
quickest way to compete is to concentrate on pitching so we'd have
a shot every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, joins a rotation of Stottlemyre, Andy Benes,
Reynoso and Anderson or Daal. He assumes the No. 1 role after a
season in which he led the major leagues in strikeouts with 329 in
2441/3 innings, or a ratio of 12.1 every 9 innings.
</P>
<P>
   His season was played in two parts. From the start of the season
through the end of July, he was a disgruntled pitcher for the
Seattle Mariners, who had decided last winter they weren't going to
sign him to a new contract but didn't accede to his wish for a
trade. Johnson had a 9-10 record and a 4.33 earned run average for
the Mariners in 23 starts.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Mariners traded him to the Astros on July 31, he
ecstatically went about his business, winning 10 of 11 starts and
compiling a 1.28 e.r.a. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No one denies Mayor Willie Brown Jr.'s ability
to stir an audience. The other day he spoke at the 20th-anniversary
commemoration of the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and City
Supervisor Harvey Milk, and his simple words on this ``tragedy of
tragedies'' brought louder applause than the star attraction, Joan
Baez.
</P>
<P>
   Brown knows how to make people laugh, too. Always impeccably
dressed in one of his classic $3,000 Brioni suits, he wisecracks,
makes goofy faces and generally hams it up at every festival,
groundbreaking and public announcement, instilling in spectators
the disarming effect of watching the coolest kid in class become
the class clown. In fact, voters in a recent poll said his charisma
was his greatest asset.
</P>
<P>
   But after three years, those voters seem tired of a mayor most
notable for talking a crowd into his vest pocket. For all his
charm, Brown, a Democrat who is one of only two or three mayors in
the country with widespread name recognition, is in trouble. The
man whose political clout and social savvy single-handedly put San
Francisco back on the national political map is getting his worst
approval ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of every 10 voters surveyed in a recent poll by The
San Francisco Chronicle said they were inclined to back him for a
second term. That amounts to a radical decline for a mayor who
breezed into office with the support of two-thirds of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   And for a master politician with 34 years in public office _ 15
of them as Assembly speaker, holder of the second-most-important
elective office in the nation's most populous state _ the low
approval ratings are especially perplexing now. This, after all, is
an ideal time to be a mayor, when mayors all over the country are
riding high, taking and getting credit for national trends like
falling crime rates, low unemployment and sound fiscal health. And
Brown's San Francisco fits all those patterns: Crime and
unemployment are down, and the city's budget, which showed a $65
million deficit when he took office, now has a projected surplus of
$145 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, San Franciscans are obviously upset. They are upset, the
poll found, with Brown's seeming inability to make the buses and
trains run on time or to get the homeless off the streets. And they
are upset at downtown traffic jams, a lack of public parking,
litter, mediocre schools and the mayor's ``arrogance.'' In short,
they are upset at a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown, who left the Assembly (where he nicknamed himself the
Ayatollah) only after term limits had forced him out, the nearly
unthinkable is happening: the looming possibility of life as a
civilian. Politicians presumed dead, like Brown's predecessor,
Frank Jordan, are resurrecting themselves, talking of a possible
challenge in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   After a first year in which he all but walked on water, there
was really nowhere for Brown to go but down. But just why he is so
far down depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's press secretary, Kandace Bender, says the latest
poll was worded so that the responses specifically regarding him
would be negative. ``I think the important figure to remember is
that 56 percent of the voters approve of the direction the city is
going,'' she said. ``Three years ago that figure was 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are inclined to say that the very qualities that
enthralled voters in the first place, Brown's glamour and glitz,
have begun to grate on a city where homelessness is so prevalent
and two-thirds of the residents are renters who may never be able
to afford to buy in San Francisco's exorbitant housing market.
(Some people are still smarting over the lavish parties, closed to
the public, that the mayor gave when the city was host to the U.S.
Conference of Mayors last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who are disenchanted with the machine-style
politics Brown brought with him from the Assembly, where back-room
wheeling and dealing was the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've realized since Brown is that the supervisors
are irrelevant,'' said Ted Gullicksen, manager of the San Francisco
Tenants Union, which won a ballot measure in the election on Nov. 3
that helped protect tenants from evictions. Brown had endorsed the
ballot measure and asked the Board of Supervisors to resurrect 1996
legislation that would further strengthen tenants' protections, but
Gullicksen said the mayor had simply been trying to bolster his
position for his coming election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown made his reputation as someone who plays hardball
politics,'' Gullicksen said. ``His No. 1 goal is keeping himself in
office, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies. If there
was another progressive candidate on the horizon, we would endorse
them over Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is never easy being mayor of San Francisco. Each
of Brown's immediate two predecessors survived only one term. The
people of this city are so politically active that the free
weeklies run listings of coming protests. It is probably safe to
say that if Brown had declared war on the kind of quality-of-life
irritations to which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani devoted so much energy
in New York, the squeegee men, the strip clubs and the panhandlers
would not have gone quietly. Indeed, not long after he had
announced aggressive moves to clear encampments put up by the
homeless, protesters bombarded Brown with three pies in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most politically active city in the
country,'' said Phillip Matier, a political columnist for The San
Francisco Chronicle. ``It's a very expensive place to live, and
people want to believe they're getting their money's worth. You
also have all these competing interests all the time. It's not an
accident that so many of the state's high offices are occupied by
San Franciscans: This city is very tough on politicians, and only
the strongest survive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If so, then the mayor should manage to weather the political
doldrums. Willie Lewis Brown Jr., born dirt-poor in segregated
Mineola, Texas, in 1934, was Slick Willie long before anyone had
even heard of Bill Clinton. He has, for example, managed to duck
many accusations over the years that he rewards political friends
with important contracts and development deals.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges of patronage and cronyism have followed him back
to San Francisco: Just recently a mayoral committee looking over
proposals for the redevelopment of a former naval base marina
called Treasure Island recommended that the deal go to a group of
investors with close political ties to the mayor, in an arrangement
that critics say would net the city far less money than other
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor shrugs off the accusations of cronyism, saying that
after 34 years in government, there are few people he does not
know.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating criticism over the homeless and the city's bus and
rail system, called MUNI, Brown devoted over half of his
state-of-the-city speech last month to those two issues, explaining
what he had tried to do and what he would do in the coming year.
Ms. Bender, his press secretary, said the voters' view of how he
handles MUNI would change when they became aware of what he was
doing to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've ordered about 280 new buses, 250 new electric trolleys
and 136 light rail vehicles,'' she said. ``We've slotted $23
million over last year's base-line budget for MUNI. We've cleared
all of the backlog of customer complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the mayor has reduced crime in the
system, ordered that tracks on the rail line be replaced and
shortened commuting time by assigning traffic officers to make sure
buses can pass through intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all that,'' she said, ``if you ask voters, `Do you
approve or disapprove of what the mayor has done with MUNI,' what
do you think the answer will be?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bender said the mayor was also working on homelessness,
although the city strongly disputes figures, from advocates for the
homeless, showing 16,000 people on the streets. ``Our figures are
between 4,000 and 6,000,'' Ms. Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the mayor denies that he is worried about his poll
numbers. His position, political observers say, is strengthened by
the fact that no one on the progressive end of the city's political
spectrum _ which runs from the moderately liberal Democratic to the
very liberal _ has stepped forward to run against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for someone to be very threatened, they have to face
challenges from the left and right,'' said Matier, the Chronicle
columnist. ``That hasn't happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   By Brown's account, the reason is that he is one of a kind.
``There's never been a mayor who opens up City Hall on Saturdays
and gives everyone 10 minutes,'' he said at a recent press
briefing, adding that his phone number was still listed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for anybody who suddenly decides he's
going to take Willie Brown out,'' he said. ``I really work at this
job. Every day of my life I work at this job. No one is going to be
as prepared as I am.''

SHELL AND TEXACO CALL OFF JOINT-VENTURE TALKS

<P>
   Royal Dutch/Shell Group announced Monday that it had broken off
talks with Texaco about combining their refining and marketing
businesses in Europe, because a joint venture would not produce the
savings they had sought.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown in that negotiation came as a source close to the
merger talks between Exxon and Mobil said Monday that the two
companies were still working to complete a deal that could be voted
on by both boards and announced as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weakening oil prices, one of the forces driving many petroleum
companies to combine operations, fell further Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a barrel of oil for January delivery reached a
12-year low, falling 65 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $11.22.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in crude-oil prices had been expected after the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week took no
action to extend the current level of cuts through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, warmer than normal weather in the United States has
cut the demand for heating oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The step by Royal Dutch/Shell could slow the quick pace of
realignment that has been reshaping the refining part of the oil
business. It was quickened two years ago when British Petroleum and
Mobil began to combine their refining and fuel sales in Europe,
which they have said has led to savings of about $500 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Skinner, the president of Shell's European oil-products
business, said that the company would continue to restructure its
own refining in Europe. Shell is the largest refiner and seller of
fuel in Europe, with close to 20 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco, which has about 3,800 gas stations in Europe, mostly in
Britain, has about 5 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said the merging of Shell, Texaco and Saudi Aramco's
refining and marketing in the West and Midwest of the United
States, would continue.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that crude-oil prices will remain low for a long
time has put pressure on major oil companies such as Mobil and
Exxon to find a fast way to cut costs and to cooperate on
exploration, which has become very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies confirmed on Friday that they were engaged in
merger talks, and although they cautioned that this might not lead
to an agreement, sources close to the talks have said they were
optimistic that a deal could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   If a merger is agreed on, it is expected to set off a scramble
among other major oil companies to find partners.

HOUSE JUDICIARY REPUBLICANS ACCUSE CLINTON OF EVADING QUESTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee
prepared to broaden their impeachment inquiry to include President
Clinton's 1996 campaign fund-raising as the panel chairman Monday
accused the president of evading questions about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Committee sources said Republicans, who hold a 21-16 majority on
the panel, will vote Tuesday to subpoena Clinton, Attorney General
Janet Reno and independent counsel Kenneth Starr to produce
documents related to campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Republicans want to question FBI Director Louis
Freeh and Justice Department prosecutor Charles LaBella, both of
whom have recommended independent investigations of fund-raising
irregularities by the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP move to expand the committee's inquiry beyond the
Lewinsky affair comes as panel Chairman Henry Hyde is pushing to
complete work in time for a vote on articles of impeachment as
early as next week. Hyde had hoped to have the issue resolved by
the full House before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hyde said the committee was not getting the
president's full cooperation and accused him of sticking to
``bizarre technical definitions and legalistic defenses'' of his
efforts to hide his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's criticism was aimed at Clinton's responses to 81
questions drafted by committee investigators after pouring through
Starr's report alleging that Clinton lied under oath, tampered with
witnesses, obstructed justice and abused his presidential
authority.
</P>
<P>
   In his responses, submitted to the committee on Friday, Clinton
broke no new ground. He denied the central impeachment allegations
of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power in the
Lewinsky affair, but he acknowledged misleading the public and top
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, an Illinois Republican, again invited Clinton to testify
before the committee, then warned that ``if the president leaves
undisputed the record of where he has given evasive responses, we
will be forced to assume that the corroborated evidence is
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart brushed off Hyde's invitation
to appear before the panel whose hearings so far have been marked
by partisan rancor. ``I don't think it's very likely you'll see the
president appear before that committee,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the process to date, there has been very little
comfort for those who were looking for something fair and
nonpartisan,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, committee sources said the subpoenas Republicans
want to serve on Clinton and Reno are not for testimony, but to
secure a memo produced by LaBella when he was head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force. The House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee earlier this year tried
unsuccessfully to secure the memo from Reno, who fought the GOP-led
efforts even in the face of contempt charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee is in receipt of information that indicates the
LaBella memo may contain evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the
president,'' said a Republican staff member assigned to the
committee. ``Given this information, we are duty bound to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton subpoena will direct him to order Reno to turn over
the LaBella memo, said the staffer, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also want Starr _ whose 453-page report on the
Lewinsky affair triggered the House impeachment inquiry _ to turn
over evidence obtained from John Huang, a key Democratic
fund-raiser who has cooperated with Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP move to broaden the inquiry beyond the alleged cover-up
of the president's acknowledged sexual misbehavior drew sharp
criticism from Democrats, who characterized the GOP plan as
``weirdness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said before, and this is confirmation, that this is an
impeachment in search of a crime,'' said Jim Jordan, a Democratic
committee spokesman. ``This says quite a bit, I suspect, about the
confidence Republicans have in the strength of the case they've
assembled at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' bid to broaden the investigation was leaked to
reporters shortly after Maryland developer and Democratic
fund-raiser Nathan Landow invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination during a closed-door interview with committee
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   During the hourlong session, investigators and committee members
asked about Landow's discussions with Kathleen Willey and whether
he was aware of any effort to cover-up her White House encounter
with Clinton in 1993. Willey has accused Clinton of fondling her
during a private meeting near the Oval Office. Clinton has
acknowledge meeting with Willey but denied any improper behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Committee sources said the investigators hope later this week
for a closed-door interview with Bruce Lindsey, a longtime Clinton
confidant who currently works as deputy White House counsel. At the
same time, Republicans on the panel have decided against
questioning one of Clinton's private attorneys, Robert S. Bennett,
who represented the president in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled Tuesday to hear testimony from 11
witnesses about perjury, one of the offenses Clinton allegedly
committed in his effort to keep his affair with Lewinsky secret.
</P>
<P>
   Among the witnesses are two women convicted of perjury for
making false statements about sex in civil cases. They are:
</P>
<P>
   Pam Parsons, a former women's basketball coach at the University
of South Carolina. Parsons spent four months in jail after she was
convicted of lying about an affair with one of her players in a
libel lawsuit she filed against Sports Illustrated, which published
an article that mentioned the sexual relationship. In her
pleadings, Parsons denied the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Battalino, a former Veterans Affairs psychiatrist who is
serving a six-month sentence of home detention. Battalino also lost
her medical license and was fined $3,500 after she was convicted of
lying in a civil lawsuit filed by a former patient who said she
performed oral sex on him. Those charges were brought by Justice
Department officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During his daily White House briefing, Lockhart derided the
Judiciary Committee's plan to call convicted perjurers to testify
on Tuesday as a ``stunt'' and said its work had been partisan and
unfair from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has been about is trying to score political
points,'' Lockhart said. &QL;

SEPARATISTS RETAIN HOLD ON QUEBEC ASSEMBLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By ANTHONY DEPALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC _ Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti
Quebecois have retained control of Canada's largest province,
according to early projections by Canadian television.
</P>
<P>
   The victory sets the stage for a bitter confrontation with the
rest of the country, and possibly another referendum on
independence, even though most Quebecers say that at this time they
do not want to separate from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard appears to have easily defeated the leader of the
provincial Liberal Party, Jean Charest, on whom many people in
English Canada had pinned their hopes for an end to the
French-speaking province's 30 years of threats to separate.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Canada, the French language service of the Canadian
Broadcasting Service, called the election at 8:35 p.m., little more
than half an hour after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   With strong support among Francophone voters, Bouchard had the
chance to increase the Parti Quebecois majority in the provincial
assembly, as well as to expand the party's share of the popular
vote. This could provide the conditions he says he needs to win a
third referendum on creating an independent nation in Quebec, a
province of roughly 7 million people on the northern border of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate, however, that only 43 percent of
Quebecers support separation, a drop of four percentage points
during the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What appears to be taking place, analysts say, is that Quebecers
see this election as a vote on government, not on independence, so
separatist emotions are in check. But voters want Bouchard to keep
alive the possibility of another referendum on separation as a way
of increasing the province's leverage with Ottawa in upcoming
discussions about changes in the shape of Canadian federalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a referendum, Bouchard's re-election will increase
tensions and uncertainty in Canada. During the campaign he said he
would demand substantial changes in the Canadian federation,
forcing Ottawa to give back more powers over social programs not
just to Quebec but to all ten provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In one stroke that silenced the critics in his own party who
suspected his commitment to changing relations with the central
government and undercut the position of Charest, who equated a vote
for the Parti Quebecois with a vote for separation.
</P>
<P>
   When Charest announced last spring that he would challenge
Bouchard in the election, analysts gave the Parti Quebecois little
chance of retaining power. Many in English Canada believed that if
Charest, a popular federal politician, could win and impose a
moratorium on referendum for the next four to five years, he could
end or severely limit the separatist movement because immigration
and demographics are diluting separatist strength in the province.
</P>
<P>
   But Charest's campaign never caught on. It is expected that
there will now be calls for his resignation, and the resignation of
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who opposes changes to the Canadian
federation.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Charest to win support in his home province was
just one surprise among many in this election that seemed to settle
very little except Bouchard's reputation as one of Quebec's most
popular and adept political leaders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's been the strangest election I have ever seen in my
life,'' said Pierre Roy, 61, a retired businessman from Lac
Beauport, near Quebec City. ``Bouchard's posters said `Have
confidence,' but people are afraid about what's going to happen.''
Roy voted just after polls opened at 10 a.m. on a gray day with
freezing rain and snow falling in many parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
   While Quebec's future is still uncertain, the outcome of the
election was predicted by public opinion polls weeks ago. Unlike
past developments on Quebec separation, which sent financial
markets into a slump, the results of Monday's election appeared to
have been discounted already.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar actually strengthened slightly, closing at a
value of 65 United States cents. The Toronto Stock Exchange
declined just under 2 percent on a day when most markets around the
world were also down for reasons that had nothing to do with the
election here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Cooper, chief economist with Nesbitt Burns, a Toronto
financial services company, said that the impact of the Quebec
election could be greater on Tuesday, after all the votes are
counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger the numbers _ in terms of seats in the assembly and
the percentage of the popular vote _ the bigger the impact will be
on Canadian currency and the market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that if Bouchard wins more than 50 percent
of the popular vote, he will call another referendum on separation
within a few months. If his party wins many more seats than the 77
it now holds in the provincial assembly, Bouchard is also likely to
interpret that as a mandate for a speedy resumption of the fight
for independence.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33-day campaign _ the shortest in Quebec history _
speeches and rallies proceeded at a frantic pace. The one debate on
Nov. 17 was seen by many viewers as a virtual tie between Bouchard
and Charest. A third candidate, Mario Dumont, of the Democratic
Action Party, also appeared in the debate, and his strong
performance was believed to have hurt Charest.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the campaign generated little real emotion, despite
expectations that it would be a clash of titans. However, the
results indicate that Quebec voters drew a sharp distinction
between Bouchard's ability to govern and his party's commitment to
holding a third referendum on separation.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that most Quebecers do not want to be put through
another referendum, but that they believe the threat of separation
is useful to bringing about changes in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no people yelling slogans in the street or things
like that,'' said Gilles Paquet, director of the Center on
Governance at the University of Ottawa. ``Instead, what you saw
today is the rational vote by a group that feels it can do better
in the Canadian federation by electing a separatist government.''
</P>
<P>
   What appears certain is that the results of the election Monday
will set all of Canada on another painful round of introspection
about the identity and nature of the country.
</P>
<P>
   This period could be different, however, because Bouchard _ an
experienced negotiator _ has introduced a new element that
substantially changes the picture. In one of his many major shifts
in position during the campaign, he hinted that before calling a
referendum on independence, he would push Ottawa for a freer hand
in spending on social issues, especially health.
</P>
<P>
   Under Canada's national medical system, delivering health care
is the responsibility of each of the 10 provinces. But the federal
government provides about 70 percent of the money that the
provinces spend on health care and imposes many standards and
restrictions on how the money can be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard and the premiers of the other nine provinces signed an
agreement at a meeting last summer to explore a new arrangement
that would give the provinces more flexibility, including the
chance to get money from Ottawa without participating in the
federal system.
</P>
<P>
   For Bouchard, it appears to be a strategy that cannot lose. If
Ottawa gives in to the demands, Bouchard can tell the people of
Quebec that he wrested an important concession from Prime Minister
Jean Chretien, who has strongly opposed giving any more powers to
the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   If Ottawa refuses, Bouchard can say that he had tried to
negotiate in good faith but was rejected. That could represent one
of the ``winning conditions'' that he said must be apparent before
he calls for another referendum on separation.
</P>
<P>
   What is uncertain, analysts say, is how much resentment would be
generated by Ottawa's rebuff of the new federalism, and how that
resentment would affect a vote on separation. Since Bouchard signed
the agreement with the other premiers last summer, little attention
has been paid to the issue in Quebec. But polls indicate that a
majority of Quebecers want Bouchard to negotiate a new federal
union.
</P>
<P>
   For Bouchard, this was the first election in which he could take
his ideas to the entire province. In 1995, he was named by the
party to finish out the term of the former premier, Jacques
Parizeau, who resigned after the separatists' narrow defeat in the
October 1995 referendum.
</P>
<P>
   During this campaign, Parizeau _ a separatist hard-liner _ drew
the ire of English-speaking Canada when he told a group of students
that the Parti Quebecois strategy was really to use the threat of
separation to milk the rest of Canada for all the concessions it
could get, and then to go ahead with separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're in Canada we'll go get our booty,'' he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, who once served in the federal Cabinet of former Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney and was Canada's ambassador to France,
takes a much less strident position on separation. By imposing the
requirement of ``winning conditions'' on another referendum, and by
raising the question of negotiating changes in Canadian federalism
with Ottawa, Bouchard has left himself so many options that there
is no way to know exactly what his plans are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although many people in the rest of Canada saw what Bouchard
was doing as being like holding a knife at the throat of Canada,
it's not like that here in Quebec,'' said Alain Dubuc, chief
editorial writer of La Presse, a leading French-language Montreal
newspaper that is against separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people here like about Bouchard is not his use of scare
tactics but his energy and strength. He has restraint, but he is
also strong enough to resist the dictates of Ottawa.''

IINTERNET ISSUES TAKE A DIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Led by a nose dive in Internet and technology shares, the US
stock market fell sharply Monday, a week after hitting record
highs. nasdaq down 66.90, 1949.54, 3.32 percent
</P>
<P>
   The 216.53-point drop, or 2.32 percent, in the Dow Jones
industrial average came on a wave of profit-taking that wiped out
last week's 173-point gain and dampened some of the first hefty
gains in stock prices since July.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic drops occurred in stocks of companies that
sell products and services on line. Such electronic commerce shares
had soared last week on anticipation of robust holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed at 9116.55 _ more than 250 points below its
record close of 9374.27 set last Monday and 216 points lower than
Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Investors last week went on a buying spree sparked by a wave of
megamerger announcements and anticipation of brisk holiday sales
that would boost Net-related stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But profit-takers had second thoughts. ``It's just a mixed bag
with no reasons you can point to at this point,'' said Joseph
Barthel, chief investment officer at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 2-to-1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where IBM Corp. was the Dow's biggest
decliner. It closed at 165 1/8, down 4 7/8 while United
Technologies fell 4 9/16 to 107 3/16. Despite the fall, the Dow was
still more than 15 percent higher than at the start of 1998 and
some 1700 points above the Aug. 31 low of 7400.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's rout was most pronounced in the technology-heavy Nasdaq
market, where major Internet-related stocks were swept up in record
trading volumes. The Nasdaq lost 66.90 points, down to 1949.54, or
3.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; cl10.5 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Decliners led 3-to-2 with Yahoo Inc. plunging 24 15/16 to 192,
while Microsoft Corp. shares dropped 6 1/16 to 122. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off sharply affected some electronic commerce retailers
like Amazon.com, the big bookseller, and Open Market Inc., the
Burlington developer of electronic commerce software, whose stock
price dropped 3 1/2 points to close at 17 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations that shoppers would skip crowded malls for the
comfort of buying holiday gifts on-line from home had fueled last
week's runup in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn, said Wall Street analysts, came after some
investors began to question their infatuation with companies doing
business on line. Although electronic commerce revenue could double
to $2.3 billion this year, according to some industry estimates,
that's still only 1 percent of total holiday retail sales.
Moreover, many on-line companies that increase their fourth-quarter
business are still unlikely to generate significant profits,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a &UR;  &LR; lot of small investors selling their shares _
people looking to close out the year, some of whom invested early
on and made some money,'' said Matthew J. Luckett, a software
research analyst at SoundView Technology Group.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most stunning drops came in shares of &UR;  &LR; on-line
auction companies whose stocks had soared last week even
though &UR;  &LR; many won't have profits for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   Onsale Inc., a Internet auctioneer based in Menlo Park Calif.
saw its stock price plunge more than 36 to close at 61 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The yo-yo effect also took its toll on newcomers to electronic
commerce. Books-A-Million Inc., a Southeastern chain with 172
bookstores that recently began selling books over the Internet, saw
its stock skyrocket 26 points Friday to close at 38 15/16. Monday
the stock fell 9 7/16 to close at 29 1/2 on volume of 22.8 million
shares.Seattle-based Amazon.com stock fell 24 5/8 to 192.

 &HT;    Death row inmate on the loose
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Martin Gurule is still out there someplace,
outside the concrete walls and the razor wire and the ticking clock
of his death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   His extraordinary escape Friday _ he is the first to break out
of Texas' death row since 1934 and the first to escape from the
Ellis Unit since it opened in 1965 _ has set off one of the biggest
manhunts the Texas prison system has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials hit the alarm button shortly after midnight
Friday, just after Gurule, condemned for the 1992 murder of Corpus
Christi restaurant owner, clambered up the double outer fences,
wriggled through the coiled razor wire, and vanished into the
night. Six other would-be death row escapees with Gurule
surrendered in the prison compound when guards opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, correctional officers _ many who live in houses
next to the prison _ were racing to pre-arranged positions,
following a plan they routinely practice in escape drills.
Telephones quickly rang in houses near the prison, notifying
residents that a prisoner was loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an extensive and comprehensive battle plan that
swings into effect immediately'' after an escape, said Glen
Castlebury, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   In the minutes and hours after the first shots rang out hundreds
of corrections officers were deployed in a containment plan that
they hope has trapped Gurule within a 17,000-acre expanse of woods,
bogs, and farmland bordered by three roads and an arching bend of
the Trinity River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't search like you would for a lost child, where you
lock arms in arm and search every square inch,'' Castlebury said.
Instead, they have created a spider's web of trails throughout
their search zone, and they are waiting for their missing killer to
cross one of its strands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose becomes containment. As long as he's on that land
and stays there, we will outwait him. We have more patience, we
have more food.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle plan has been battle-tested, Castlebury said. The
prison system has a perfect record in capturing escaped prisoners,
he said, and the inside joke at the prisons is that escapees are
always caught within three hours or three miles.
</P>
<P>
   But Gurule, on death row for shooting Minas ``Mike'' Piperis
while robbing Piperis' U&AMP;I Restaurant in Corpus Christi, has been
missing for four days, and nobody knows how far he has gone. Maybe
he raced to the nearest road and jumped into a car before the swarm
of correctional officers could seal off the area.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say they are exploring that possibility, but
they believe he's laying low nearby, playing the needle in the
17,000-acre haystack surrounding the Ellis Unit, 12 miles north of
Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs pulling long hours
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Ellis Unit, at the command center set up to lead the
search effort, prison officials coordinate the roughly 500 officers
and 70 dogs who form the bulk of their force.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 500 officers involved in the hunt at any one time
are kept out of the search area, so that their scent will not
confuse those doing the actual hunting: the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven ``tracks,'' or trails have been set up within the
perimeter, along with others skirting the riverbanks, Castlebury
said. Dog teams _ 10 tracking hounds loping ahead of two officers _
have been tracing those tracks up to four times a day. Four teams
at a time are out in the search area around the clock, Castlebury
said, waiting for the dogs to sniff out evidence that the inmate
has moved across one of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dogs are not scent-specific, meaning you don't have them
smell the inmate's pillow case,'' Castlebury said. ``They will
follow any scent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Tommy Freeman, who manages the dog teams at the prison,
said his dogs tracked Gurule's scent to a highway about a
quarter-mile east of the prison, where it abruptly stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a lot of people think, there are a lot of situations
where we can have a problem (tracking),'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said it was possible the
inmate had stepped into a pile of cow manure, which would throw off
the dogs' ability to track his scent.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said they can't be sure it was Gurule's trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of 'Who knows?' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officers are positioned every 25 yards on five or six
miles of farm roads and state highway on the southern and western
sides of the perimeter, keeping an eye on the roads and checking
every passing vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, two helicopters _ one from the Texas Department of
Public Safety and one from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service _ have flown intermittently over the area, hoping Gurule's
body heat will trip their infrared sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Those sensors won't work if Gurule is dead, however. Prison
authorities found blood near the razor-wire-topped fence that
Gurule scaled, but they have said they don't think he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Until they find evidence that the 29-year-old convict somehow
slipped out of the area before they could establish their perimeter
_ or until enough time has passed to convince them he's gone _
prison officials will stick to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Todd, another prison spokesman, called it a ``combination
of scent and tracks and good old country boy hunches.''
</P>
<P>
   Hacksaw blade discovered
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have launched an investigation into how the
inmates, who all had greater freedom of movement because they
worked as orderlies on the cellblock, were able to slip into the
exercise yard, cut through the fence around it, and remained
undetected on a rooftop for hours.
</P>
<P>
   After Gurule's escape, guards quickly discovered they'd been
had: the sleeping forms in the inmates bunks were really rolled-up
bedding. On Monday, prison officials announced they found a hacksaw
blade on the roof where the inmates hid before the escape attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not brought in from the outside as far as we can
determine,'' Fitzgerald said. ``It's the kind we have at our
industries. We have a bus barn here, a furniture shop. The fact we
have a saw blade is not unusual. We are concerned, obviously, how
this occurred, but first we have to find him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the search involves detective work. When a
Huntsville resident reported the theft of a blue GMC pickup truck
from the parking lot of a local business, the police passed on the
information to the command center.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are checking ``every contact, every family member,
every friend'' for leads, Castlebury said. The investigation has
also included poring over Gurule's visitor list and correspondence
list, looking for evidence that he had help from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, they don't have any leads there,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   So they keep running the dogs, checking motorists' trunks, and
waiting for Gurule _ if he's in there _ to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' Gary Johnson, director of the prison
system, said late Monday afternoon after another full day of
searching. ``But we can't quit just because we're frustrated. We
just have to be patient and press on.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson repeated his belief that Gurule remained within the
searchers' perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew he was not here, we would pull out,'' he said. ``But
we have no plans now of pulling out. As long as there's a chance
he's here, we'll be here. We're committed for the long haul.''

 &HT;    Guiltless Gourmet's plight for space on grocery store shelves
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Five years ago, healthy chip maker Guiltless
Gourmet was fat and happy.
</P>
<P>
   The company had pioneered the baked tortilla chip and had
outlasted competitors like Fit Foods and Smart Temptations. It went
from peddling chips in a few retailers in Austin to selling them in
stores in all 50 states. It opened a sleek headquarters with office
suites, and its workforce ballooned to more than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1994, Plano-based Frito-Lay Co., the Microsoft Corp. of
the chip industry (tortilla chips, that is) decided it wanted a
piece of the burgeoning low-fat chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Frito-Lay owned the rest of the snack chip business,
with products like Doritos and Tostitos sold around the globe. When
it introduced Baked Tostitos and Baked Lays, it used its formidable
brand-name appeal and burgeoning budget to gobble up market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life as we knew it changed,'' said Robert Greenberg, the
company's vice president of advertising and marketing. Guiltless
Gourmet nearly crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, it regrouped, reformulated and redesigned. Gone
were plans to start selling other low-fat products, like potato
chips, replaced by plans to make its core product better. It also
cut its workforce, tweaked its manufacturing and distribution
systems, and did whatever it could to remain a contender.
</P>
<P>
   It has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without these changes, we would have shrunk to a point where
our business could have disappeared,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the chip company has $8 million in revenues _ not
including sales to natural foods stores _ and is among the Top 10
tortilla chip brands nationally, according to the Snack Food
Association, an Alexandria, Va.-based tradegroup. It is second
among low-fat tortilla chip makers _ albeit a distant second _
behind Baked Tostitos, according to the tradegroup.
</P>
<P>
   But Guiltless Gourmet's story goes deeper than its nine types of
chips and seven dips.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale any small company with a big idea can relate to,
one of a modern-day David which _ at least for now _ is holding its
own in a battle against Goliath by making some quick and decisive
moves. ``There's definitely a niche for them,'' said Ann Wilkes,
spokeswoman for the Snack Food Association.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Foreman, a former restaurateur, started Guiltless Gourmet
out of his Austin home with an investment of $200 and a desire to
lose weight. His personal trainer told him he needed to cut down on
his fat intake, but he was unable to give up one vice _ chips and
salsa.
</P>
<P>
   So he began to experiment with low-fat options. By August 1989,
he had developed a low-fat, no-oil, baked tortilla chip as an
alternative to fried chips. Encouraged by the result, he had labels
made and brought two bags to Whole Foods Markets Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1990, Foreman sold his restaurant so he spend all his
time on Guiltless Gourmet. Sales grew from $35,000 in 1989 to
$200,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Foreman solicited investors to help fund
expansion. John Oudt and John Koerner, the former owners of Barq's
Rootbeer Inc. of New Orleans, invested an estimated $350,000 for 35
percent of Guiltless Gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   With the infusion of capital, Guiltless Gourmet in 1991 was able
to move into a new $1 million automated 20,000-square-foot plant in
Southeast Austin. In 1992, it bought an additional $1 million in
production equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The company rapidly grew, tapping into a growing appetite for
low-fat foods. Sales hit $20 million in 1993, a year before Foreman
sold the company to Oudt and Koerner.
</P>
<P>
   Guiltless Gourmet's success did not go unnoticed. It captured
the attention of Frito-Lay _ which unsuccessfully attempted to buy
the Austin-based company. Instead, Frito-Lay entered the low-fat
market on its own.
</P>
<P>
   With a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside its Doritos, Fritos and Cheetos, Frito-Lay added its
Baked Tostitos and Baked Lay's low-fat and non-fat snack foods.
Although Guiltless Gourmet had a four-year head start, the company
watched as it went from the market leader to a minor player. Sales
plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from having a dominant share of a small category to
having a small share of a large category,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Guiltless Gourmet President and Chief Executive Mike Schall, who
joined the company the same week Baked Tostitos went national, who
in a magazine interview once likened competing with Frito-Lay to
``dancing between the elephants toes.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1995, with its sales declining at a precipitous
rate, the executives at Guiltless Gourmet decided to launch an
aggressive campaign to fight back _ an effort that cost the company
more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   It meant cutting out fat, so to speak, in the company. Gone were
the office suites. The 7,500-square-foot corporate headquarters was
reduced to 1,100 cramped square feet in the company's warehouse.
The company's workforce, once as high as 120 employees, was trimmed
to 55.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, a veteran of the food industry, was brought in to
boost the company's sales and marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had only one real shot to make the change,'' Greenberg
said. ``If we didn't make the most of it, it was all for not.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Guiltless Gourmet embarked on extensive consumer testing
_ a first for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to make it taste better,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, 1997, the company decided to add a little canola
oil to the chips to improve the flavor. That change _ which gave
each serving a modest 2 grams of fat _ was met with rising sales.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly the same time, the company unveiled new packaging to
reflect the change in the product.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful bags, which use a special film designed to improve
shelf life, focus on the product's improved taste rather than its
low number of fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in more than two years, we saw sales start
to grow again,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Guiltless Gourmet sought to improve quality
control. That meant buying higher-quality corn and retooling the
manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the toasted smell of baked corn fills the company's plant
in Southeast Austin, which processes more than 1,500 pounds of corn
an hour. Within 12 hours, red, white, yellow and blue corn kernels
are cooked, steeped, ground, cut into triangles, baked, seasoned
and packaged. The 7-ounce bags of chips are packed into cases,
which are stacked into pallets, which are shipped to stores around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But changing the look and taste of the products won't do
anything if the customers can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   During 1993 and 1994, Guiltless Gourmet chips were distributed
nationally by companies who focused on specialty, gourmet and
natural food items, from salad dressings to energy bars. Often
Guiltless Gourmet products were relegated to the ``healthy living''
section, far from the other snack foods, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   This worked for a while because of the double-digit growth of
low-fat snack foods. But with Frito-Lay chomping away at market
share Guiltless Gourmet had to find a better way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers had dozens of other opportunities to buy chips
before they ever saw our chips, if they ever saw our chips,''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   So Guiltless Gourmet decided to sell to snack-food distributors.
The distributors are responsible for maintaining the mix of
products and fighting for more shelf space. The result of this
increased exposure has been a significant sales increase, Greenberg
said. At Austin's Central Market this week, a large display of
Guiltless Gourmet products are showcased in the middle of the snack
food aisle. ``You have to work for the product and fight for shelf
position,'' he said. ``These are the type of things that Frito-Lay
does in its sleep.''

 By BENJAMIN WEISER and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In mid-1984, a former Egyptian Army officer with an engaging
manner and a gift for languages approached the CIA in Egypt with
what seemed an intriguing offer: He volunteered to be a spy.
</P>
<P>
   The agency tried him out, but the Egyptian flunked. He had made
contact in Germany with a branch of Hezbollah, the Middle Eastern
terrorist group, and told its members that he was working with the
CIA, a betrayal the agency quickly discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, CIA officials branded him untrustworthy and cut off
further dealings with him, suspecting that he wanted to help the
terrorists spy on Americans, United States officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency discovered the next year that the former officer, Ali
A. Mohamed, was trying to enter the United States, and officials
put his name on a State Department ``watch list'' intended to
prevent terrorists and other security threats from getting visas,
an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   When Mohamed evaded this precaution and persuaded an American
Embassy official to give him a visa, the CIA issued a second
warning to other federal agencies that a suspect person might be
traveling to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings were not heeded. Mohamed emigrated to the United
States and in the next decade cultivated a range of useful
relationships with the American government. He enlisted in the army
and served with one of its most elite units. Then, in the early
1990's, he became an informant for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is imprisoned in a high-security cell in New York City
on charges of having conspired with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
exile suspected of masterminding the August bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa. Prosecutors filed the charges against him
in secret, and law enforcement officials have declined to discuss
the case even after its existence was made public last month.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to learn whether he has contested the
charges or pleaded guilty, and his lawyer, James Roth, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Mohamed's dealings with the United States, based on
interviews with associates, government officials and former army
officers, suggests that he was inexorably drawn to intrigue and the
shadowy gambits of espionage. Along the way, several officials
said, the American authorities missed opportunities to grasp the
depth of his allegiance to Islamic extremism.
</P>
<P>
   United States officials said Mohamed forged ties with bin Laden
as early as 1991. He was adept at obtaining false documents for bin
Laden's organization, the officials said, and assisted with
logistical tasks, like bin Laden's 1991 move from Afghanistan to
the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department granted Mohamed's visa to enter the United
States in 1985, only a year after the CIA severed ties with him.
State Department officials, reached late in the day Monday, were
unable to confirm or deny accounts of the circumstances surrounding
Mohamed's entry to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While serving in the army as a supply sergeant assigned to
Special Forces, his aggressive support for Islamic causes and open
curiosity about intelligence matters raised eyebrows among
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In the most notable of those incidents, Mohamed took a few
weeks' leave from the army base at Fort Bragg, N.C., and told
friends that he planned to join the mujahedeen rebel forces in
Afghanistan and ``kill Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning, he boasted of his combat exploits to colleagues
at the army's Special Warfare School, prompting two of his
supervisors to file reports with Army officials at Fort Bragg and
with Army intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   An Army official, citing inaccessibility of the records, said
Monday night that he could not address how the service had
investigated the reports or whether it had taken any action against
Mohamed. The official added that because the matter had entered the
court system, comment would be inappropriate. American officials
now believe that Mohamed did fight with the Afghan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, shortly before he was honorably discharged from
the army, Mohamed began traveling to the New York City area and
training a circle of Islamic militants in basic military
techniques. Members of the group, which was centered in Brooklyn,
were later convicted of plotting a series of terrorist attacks in
New York, including the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Mohamed was fully enmeshed in a dual life.
He was simultaneously collaborating with bin Laden's organization
and talking regularly with federal agents about bin Laden and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   His story, American officials say, is a modern espionage parable
in which Mohamed was trying to manipulate American investigators
even as they were using him to gain a window into the activities of
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed's arrest surprised some, but not all those who have
known him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me on several occasions that he would never betray the
United States, as far as breaking United States law or trying to
undermine the government,'' said Lt. Col. Steven Neely, former
director of Middle East studies at the special warfare school. ``He
was in many, many ways as loyal a soldier as you'd find coming off
the farm in the Carolinas or out of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Another United States official familiar with his career
disagreed, saying his identity as an American was always less
important than his devotion to Islamic fundamentalism. ``You could
sit and have lunch with him, and he'd be as nice as pie. But if the
call came in to blow you up, there is no question in my mind that
Ali would blow you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed was born in Egypt in 1952. After graduating from high
school in 1971, he enrolled in a Cairo military academy and then
joined Egypt's army.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, he made his first visit to the United States
when he was sent to Fort Bragg to be trained by American soldiers.
U.S. intelligence officers often use such programs to spot possible
recruits, but administration officials say the CIA did not approach
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say his duties with the Egyptian army
included recruiting informants for his country's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   His later years in the military coincided with a time of great
turmoil in his native land.

<P>
   The assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981 by Islamic
radicals in the Egyptian military was followed by brutal crackdowns
on local extremists and their followers. Among the targets were
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind cleric who eventually emigrated
to Brooklyn, where he was convicted of conspiring to blow up the
United Nations and other New York landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed later confided to friends in the U.S. Army that he was
deeply upset by the Egyptian government's hard line, and that he
felt aligned with the Islamic radicals who carried out the
assassination of Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   One of his supervisors, Lt. Col. Robert Anderson, recalled a
disagreement he had with Mohamed about the legacy of Sadat, an ally
of the United States who had signed a historic peace agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Anwar Sadat was a true patriot, and he gave
his life,''' Anderson recalled. ``And he said, `Anwar Sadat was a
traitor and had to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian army, Mohamed would later tell his American
friends, was hostile to devout Muslims. In March of 1984, having
attained the rank of major, he left the military, according to his
American military records.
</P>
<P>
   According to government officials, it was roughly about this
time that Mohamed made his first overture to the CIA in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was tentatively accepted by the agency, which was
gearing up for a global fight against terrorism. The bombings of
the American Embassy and Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 put
pressure on the agency to recruit more agents in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Those demands were stepped up in March 1984, when terrorists
linked to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah kidnapped William Buckley,
the CIA station chief in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   After the CIA agreed that he could work with the agency, Mohamed
made contact with a group of Hezbollah adherents in Germany,
according to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the agency learned that Mohamed had taken that
opportunity to reveal to the terrorists that he was working for the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether Mohamed set out to be a double agent on
his own, or whether he was at this point acting under the influence
or instructions of an Islamic group. The CIA, however, decided to
have nothing more to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   United States officials now say Mohamed knew he had been cut off
by the agency, which never gave him a reason. After he came to the
United States, he told friends that he had worked with the CIA in
Germany and hoped to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Egyptian army, Mohamed went to work briefly
for EgyptAir as a security adviser. Then, for reasons that remain
somewhat unclear, he decided to emigrate to the United States.
Explaining the decision later at Fort Bragg, he told other soldiers
that he had come to this country for religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the CIA learned that he was trying to obtain a visa,
and it put his name on the State Department list of people who
should be kept out of the country. American officials overseas have
extensive authority to reject visa applications, particularly if
security concerns are raised.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed got his visa, and when the CIA found out, it sent a
second warning to federal agencies about the possible security
threat, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed arrived in New York on Sept. 6, 1985, and eventually
settled in California.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to
the Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, where the Army trains
its Special Forces. The base is also home to the elite
anti-terrorist commando unit known as the Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-born people are permitted to join the American military,
provided they have attained permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mohamed was not a member of the Special Forces, he
worked as a company supply sergeant, trained as a paratrooper, and
received high marks for his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have separated yourself from your peers, and I have taken
notice,'' Capt. Brian Layer wrote in a December 1987 commendation
letter praising Mohamed's performance on a physical readiness test.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow soldiers recall the powerfully built Mohamed as a
rigorous and dedicated soldier who seemed eager to learn and who
joked about having gone from being a major in the Egyptian Army to
a ``lowly sergeant'' at Fort Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in Hebrew, French and English, as well as Arabic, he
would assist other soldiers in translations, friends there said. He
went for long runs and listened to the Koran on his Walkman. He
enjoyed cooking, and had his meat butchered in accordance with
Islamic practice, one friend said.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that Mohamed was no ordinary immigrant soldier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he told his colleagues of his plans to take several
weeks of leave and fight in Afghanistan against the Soviet forces.
It was an audacious proposal for an active-duty soldier.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies were in the midst of a
multibillion-dollar program to aid the Afghan rebels, and the CIA
had taken considerable pains to conceal the American role. The
capture or death of an American serviceman in Afghanistan would
have been a major international embarrassment to the United States.

<HEADLINE>
WORKERS AT BEAUMONT, TEXAS, MOBIL REFINERY AWAIT ANNOUNCEMENT OF
EXXON MERGER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ When workers file through the front gate of
the sprawling Mobil refinery in a part of Beaumont, Texas, once
known as the ``Lower Woods,'' they march under the familiar red
winged horse, Pegasus, that has been a symbol at the refinery since
1931.
</P>
<P>
   But Beaumont's refinery was already mature by then. The refinery
at the end of Burt Street has been at work since 1903 when Col.
George Burt built his Security Oil Co. and sold it to investors who
were also stockholders in Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Since then generations of Beaumont residents have spent their
working lives at the refinery. Many hope that tradition will
continue now that it appears Mobil Oil and Exxon will combine to
reform a big part of what was once Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a big uncertainty,'' said Richard Hidalgo, who has
worked at the plant for 26 years. His grandfather, Felix Hidalgo,
worked at the refinery, as did his uncle and cousins. His son, also
called Richard Hidalgo, is part of the fourth generation of the
family to work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what to expect,'' he said. Rumors of mergers with
other companies have gone around the refinery in years past, as
have rumors of massive layoffs or even of the refinery being shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   But through good economic conditions and bad, the old refinery
has kept on, going through periodic expansions and modernizations.
Today, it is the country's fourth-largest refinery and Mobil's
largest.
</P>
<P>
   It has a workforce of 1,250 and can process more than 13.6
million gallons of crude oil a day into a long list of products.
</P>
<P>
   Its birth came hard on the heels of the big Spindletop oil boom
just south of Beaumont in 1901. That strike was followed by other
oil discoveries all along the Texas coast. Refineries in Port
Arthur became flagships of Texaco and Gulf. Today they are Motiva
and Clark Refining.
</P>
<P>
   Texas anti-trust laws didn't allow Standard Oil to build a
refinery in Texas, said Beaumont historian Judy Linsley, but it was
common knowledge that the owners of the Security refinery were the
same as the owners of Standard Oil. ``It was like the rhinoceros in
the living room,'' she said. ``Nobody talked about it.'' Most
locals called the plant the Burt Refinery although Col. Burt sold
it before it started operation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1909 the state forced Standard Oil to sell the refinery and
it was sold to a group of Texas investors headed by Galveston
financier, John Sealy. The refinery operated under the name of John
Sealy, Refiner of Oil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1911 it was reorganized under the Magnolia name and many
oldtime Beaumont residents still refer to the plant as the Magnolia
Refinery. Socony _ a big part of the old Standard Oil trust that
had been dissolved earlier _ bought a large part of Magnolia in
1918 and took complete control in 1925. That was the same year a
second round of oil discoveries were being made at Spindletop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931 Socony and Vacuum combined, Linsley said, bringing the
familiar flying red horse symbol to Beaumont. In 1959 it became
Mobil. The refinery gave birth to two Mobil chemical plants and
several other petrochemical plants using products from the
refinery.
</P>
<P>
   By 1920 the refinery was the biggest single employer in Beaumont
and is still the biggest industrial employer. ``It kept us afloat
during the Depression,'' she said, ``because it kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier part of the century, Linsley said, the old
refinery gave the city much of its identity.
</P>
<P>
   A Magnolia band might entertain city folks from a park bandstand
on Sunday afternoons. Company baseball and basketball teams had
loyal fans. A company newsletter called ``Magpetco'' was regular
reading in many homes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924 the refinery started Beaumont's first radio station with
the call letters KFDM standing for ``Kall For Dependable
Magnolene,'' referring to a popular lube oil made in Beaumont.
Today the station is KLVI and it's still in Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Today's workers say they no longer have that feeling of family
that workers once had, but they say their refinery is as modern as
any in the country. ``It's a competitive refinery,'' said Jimmy
Herrington, an employee since 1971 and president of Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers Union Local 4-243.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, he said the refinery workforce has been cut
by at least 250 as many maintenance and repair jobs that were once
done by Mobil employees are now performed by contract workers
employed by outside companies. The contract workers never earn the
job security and benefits accrued by employees of the refinery, he
said. It's a trend that bothers many union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not trained as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers also fear that a merger of Mobil and Exxon may give the
combined company far too much refining capacity. ``Exxon has a big
refinery in Baytown and another one in Baton Rouge,'' he said. ``We
worry about what's going to happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Refinery managers haven't told workers what to expect from a
merger, Herrington and other union leaders say. ``Probably because
they don't know anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Dawson, who has worked at the refinery 18 years and is the
union local's secretary-treasurer, said she is upbeat about the
possibilities. ``We've already made this a good operation. We know
they're making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many workers are joking about what the combined company might be
called, she said. Several years ago, when a Mobil-Chevron merger
was being talked about, the joke was it would be called ``Moron.''
Now names like Exxil, Ex-Mobil'' and ``Moxxon,'' are being bandied
about.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil workers also are worried about what will happen to their
benefits, such as retirement packages, after a buyout, Hidalgo
said. After Chevron bought the big Gulf refinery in Port Arthur in
the 1980's, Gulf retirees ended up taking Chevron to court over
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, 52, said he hopes the old refinery will continue to
provide employment for his son and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, he's not too worried.
</P>
<P>
   He's retiring Tuesday, and taking his retirement benefit in a
lump-sum payment. &QL;

   Anderson, Mohamed's supervisor, said he told him not to make the
trip. But Mohamed replied that he planned to circumvent the Army's
restrictions by flying to Paris on his American passport and then
using other documents to travel from the Middle East to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he and another officer had written a detailed
intelligence report to their military superiors, but heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   About a month later, Mohamed returned, bringing with him what he
said was war booty. Anderson said he had shown him two belts
purportedly taken from Soviet special forces soldiers he had killed
in an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Although American officials are convinced that Mohamed fought
with the rebels, there is no specific evidence that he killed
Russian soldiers. Such belts were widely available in local
bazaars.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and his colleague were deeply troubled by his
statements, and they wrote another intelligence report that
provided further details about what Mohamed had told them about his
time in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The other officer said he had no doubt Mohamed had fought with
the rebels. ``He had probably lost 20, 25 pounds,'' the officer
said, ``which indicated to me that he had done something fairly
strenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on
the condition of anonymity, citing the allegations of terrorism in
the case and other security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed made no secret of his trip, and even boasted of his
dealings with Afghan rebel leaders. He thanked another officer,
Capt. Michael Asimos, for providing him with some unclassified maps
of Afghanistan before he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Ali coming back at some point in 1988,'' Captain
Asimos recalled, ``and telling me how much Ahmad Shah Massoud was
pleased that I took him some maps.'' Massoud led one of the
mujahedeen groups fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether Mohamed had a relationship with any
terrorist organization while he was in the army. In retrospect,
some of his colleagues say, he had an unusual interest in
classified matters.
</P>
<P>
   Asimos ran a classified war game at Fort Bragg in 1988 that
involved military and intelligence officers from all over the
country. He said he had told participants to be careful of what
they said in front of Mohamed, who did not hold a security
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can specifically remember Ali coming down and saying I want
to be involved in this, I want to help, I have a great deal of
knowledge here,'' Asimos recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his service in the Army, Mohamed asked to be
introduced to the CIA's representative at Fort Bragg, a former army
officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, unaware that Mohamed already had a history with the
agency, recalls telling the CIA official that Mohamed ``has this
burning desire to be utilized as an intelligence operative, and
you're the logical guy to look at him.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting lasted about an hour, the Army officer recalled.
Afterward, he said, the CIA official joked that Mohamed might
already be a ``spook,'' using the slang term for a foreign
espionage agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of laughed,'' the officer said. ``How ridiculous
that this guy could possibly be a spook matriculating in this sort
of bastion of special operations activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, officers at Fort Bragg cast Mohamed as the star of a
series of training videotapes intended to give soldiers a taste of
how Islamic radicals view the world.
</P>
<P>
   On one tape, he says of Israel, ``From the Islamic perspective,
nobody can recognize Israel has the right to live, because Israel
stole an Islamic territory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not accept no peace,'' he adds. ``No international
conference. Nothing. No compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Mohamed apparently began working more closely
with Islamic extremists in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He disappeared from Fort Bragg on weekends, traveled to the New
York area and offered military training to several militants
associated with a refugee center in Brooklyn. He often stayed with
El Sayyid A. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted of killing
Rabbi Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League, in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors now assert that the refugee center was the principal
base in the United States for bin Laden's group, Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed met the local Muslims at an apartment in Jersey City,
and taught them survival techniques, map reading and how to
recognize tanks and other Soviet weapons, according to testimony by
one of his students at Nosair's 1995 federal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed left the army in November 1989, obtained his U.S.
citizenship, and spent the next few years shuttling between New
York, California, Afghanistan and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known when he first met bin Laden. According to
American officials, however, at some point in 1991 the Saudi exile
asked him to help with a crucial task: moving his base of
operations from Afghanistan to the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said this was a complex operation, involving
the transfer through several countries of bin Laden and at least
two dozen associates. At the same time, Mohamed frequented mosques
in the United States, and American officials now suspect that he
was recruiting operatives for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1992, Mohamed returned to fight in Afghanistan,
training rebel commanders in military tactics, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the officials said, a series of bizarre
incidents brought him to the attention of the FBI. In 1992, Mohamed
was detained by the authorities at the Rome airport when suspicions
were piqued by his luggage, which had false compartments.
</P>
<P>
   He assured interrogators that he was on their side in the war on
terrorism, and claimed he was involved in security for the Summer
Olympics in Barcelona, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he was stopped by the border authorities in
Canada while traveling in the company of a suspected associate of
bin Laden's who was trying to enter the United States using false
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Mohamed was questioned by the FBI, which had learned
of his ties to bin Laden. Apparently in an attempt to fend off the
investigators, Mohamed offered information about a ring in
California that was selling counterfeit documents to smugglers of
illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, U.S. officials say, Mohamed provided some
information about his movements and about bin Laden, who was
becoming a focus of a New York-based inquiry touched off by the
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and other plots.
</P>
<P>
   The government tracked his movements and phone calls, officials
said, as they assembled evidence that suggested that bin Laden was
a far more important figure in international terrorism than had
previously been understood.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after bombs exploded outside the American Embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, last August, killing
more than 200 people and wounding more than 1,000, Federal
prosecutors in Manhattan subpoenaed Mohamed to testify before a
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   He flew to New York in September, made his appearance, and was
arrested. Officials believe he was on his way to the Middle East.

 &HT;    Supreme Court asked to intervene in census controversy
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opponents of the Clinton administration's plan to
use estimates in the 2000 census on Monday asked the Supreme Court
to prohibit estimations even if they prove more accurate than a
traditional head count.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is proposing to employ scientific sampling to
get a better count of minorities and other hard-to-reach
populations, which could boost the population totals for urban
areas, including Dayton, that may have been shortchanged in the
1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   The once-a-decade census helps determine each state's
representation in Congress, the drawing of electoral boundaries and
the distribution of more than $175 billion in federal funds. And
with so much at stake, the debate has become divisively partisan
with Democrats supporting the use of estimates, and Republicans
opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, arguing on behalf of the
administration, told the justices that every census since 1790 has
been an estimate of the population since no census has physically
reached every person in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling, the use of a randomly selected cross-section of the
population to estimate the entire population, would be a ``quality
check'' on the accuracy of the Census Bureau's more traditional
methods of trying to count every American household through mail
and follow-up visits, Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the Census Bureau to use sampling ``will best achieve
the Constitution's goal of determining the number of persons in
each state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the House of Representatives and a group of
individuals that includes Matthew Glavin, president of the
Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation and Rep. Bob Barr, a
Georgia Republican leading the fight against sampling, agreed that
no census is likely to count everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But, they argued, the Court should uphold two lower court
rulings that blocked the sampling plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of accuracy, it is both illegal and
unconstitutional,'' said Michael Carvin, who represents Glavin and
Barr in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 100 percent head count is the only permissible means of
apportioning the population,'' Carvin said.
</P>
<P>
   In town for the case was Ohio's Secretary of State-elect Kenneth
Blackwell, who also is co-chairman of the U.S. Census Monitoring
Board. Blackwell, a Cincinnati Republican, opposes the use of
sampling techniques and held a press conference on the steps of the
Supreme Court after arguments concluded. The Monitoring Board,
which oversees both the planning and execution of the census, has
taken no position on the sampling issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Blackwell wants the Census Bureau to use federal documents
such as Medicaid records to double-check the accuracy of
preliminary census counts rather than estimations to arrive at the
final total. That, Blackwell argued, will meet the Constitutional
requirement of counting existing people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a traditional head count census,
supplemented with administrative records,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has no plans to use such documents for the
2000 census, but is looking at adding them to the process for the
2010 count. Meanwhile, Blackwell said he's worried that all the
legal jousting could jeopardize the government's ability to conduct
the 2000 census because Census Bureau planners still don't know if
they'll be permitted to use the sampling technique they had
expected to have at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great chance that if this saga plays out too much
longer,'' Blackwell warned, ``we'll place the census at risk.

BRUINS' BCS STATUS IMPROVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA strengthened its hold on second place and
closed to within .04 points of No. 1 Tennessee in the latest Bowl
Championship Series rankings. However, the Bruins' postseason fate
remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   A victory at Miami on Saturday doesn't guarantee them a spot in
the Fiesta Bowl if Tennessee and No. 3 Kansas State also win, but
it comes pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all three teams win out, they won't know which bowl they're
playing in until Sunday _ it's that close,'' said Charles Bloom,
co-creator of the BCS poll and assistant commissioner of the
Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA leads Kansas State by 1.28 points _ a .04 increase over
last week _ but the Wildcats are expected to gain ground in the
BCS' schedule-strength component because they play No. 8 Texas A&AMP;M
in the Big 12 Championship game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas State is going to get a pretty good bump by playing
A&AMP;M,'' Bloom said. ``The question will be, is it big enough. The
other question is if the (Top 25) polls and computer rankings
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS formula combines Top 25-poll average, computer-poll
average and a strength-of-schedule quotient. The teams with the
fewest overall points meet in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4. The final
BCS poll will be announced Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins actually trail Kansas State by 1.5 points in the Top
25 average but lead by .58 in the computer average and 2.2 in the
schedule-strength quotient.
</P>
<P>
   Their schedule is ranked seventh in the nation; Kansas State's
is 62nd. Each spot in the schedule rankings represents .04 BCS
points.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what it all means: If the polls and computer rankings
stay the same, then Kansas State needs a net change of 32 places in
the schedule rankings to catch the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikely. The Wildcats jumped 11 spots in the
schedule rankings after they beat Nebraska, and they gained six
spots after defeating Missouri. What bounce would Texas A&AMP;M bring?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be in the ballpark of an 11-15 (spot jump),''
Bloom said. ``That won't be enough, unless the polls or computer
rankings change.''
</P>
<P>
   If all three teams win, the polls probably won't change. Kansas
State is already No. 1 in the coaches' poll, so it has no room for
growth. And even if the Wildcats defeat Texas A&AMP;M soundly, a
Tennessee victory should keep the Vols on top in the Associated
Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the computers. If the Bruins fall from No. 1 in the
Seattle Times poll, which emphasizes strength of schedule, and if
Kansas State jumps a spot or two the New York Times poll, which
emphasizes victory margin, those changes could jeopardize UCLA's
hold on second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many variables,'' Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   What about victory margin? What if the Bruins win by three
points and Kansas State wins by 23?
</P>
<P>
   ``Margin of victory will be a factor but not an overriding
factor,'' Bloom said. ``It won't be the deciding factor.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Tennessee and Kansas State playing 12 games to
UCLA's 11? The Bruins fear they'll get punished for not having a
Pac-10 championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only an advantage if the 12th game is against a quality
opponent, and in that case it helps strength of schedule,'' Bloom
said. ``But if you're playing a 12th game, there's an extra chance
for a loss, so there's a risk involved.''

SPORTS COLUMN: OFFICIATING ERRORS ARE PART OF THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The defensive back, naturally, could not
believe the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back and get all the Hail Marys on tape, and I'll bet
you my next paycheck that you would be hard pressed to find two
with no shoving on it,'' said the Jets' nickel back Corwin Brown.
``There's shoving on every one of them. Give me a break, man.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback, not surprisingly, argued that a pass into the
end zone from the 26-yard line is no Hail Mary, and it was about
time the man on offense got a last-second break.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's pass interference, it's pass interference,'' Vinny
Testaverde said. ``There's always a lot of bumping, and I always
thought the refs ought to make that call.''
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture? It is always a tossup as to which side of the
official's judgment we are going to wind up on. Heads, we win.
Tails, we whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me into that one,'' Bill Parcells said, with no one
around to call the Jets' coach for delay of opinion. ``I have never
filed an official's report since 1983, and that's all I'm going to
say about it. When I'm retired from the league, I'll have something
to say about the officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country was not about to wait, after a long,
contentious holiday weekend that produced several episodes of
referee rage, and Monday's historic rule change that will now
require the umpire to raise the existential question _ heads or
tails? _ and receive an answer before he tosses his coin.
</P>
<P>
   The comically botched pre-overtime toss in Detroit last Thursday
was the prelude to stunning end-game calls missed and made Sunday
in New England, which helped keep the soon-to-be Foxboro ex-Pats in
their divisional chase. While no one yet knows if this was good for
the Jets, Keith Byars, the veteran fullback, said he couldn't
remember a last-second call that bad. ``I would hope,'' he said,
``for instant replay.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the replay, the Patriots' Shawn Jefferson was out
of bounds for the 10-yard pass he caught at the Bills' 26 from Drew
Bledsoe on fourth-and-9, with six seconds left and the Patriots
trailing by 4 points. Bledsoe then somehow hit Terry Glenn in the
chest, in the end zone, in a crowd. Glenn dropped the ball, but an
official dropped a flag. The interference call against the Bills'
Henry Jones set up Bledsoe's 1-yard touchdown pass to Ben Coates,
and produced renewed calls for impeachment hearings against those
enterprising souls who depart the conventional work force each
weekend to become the National Football League's adjunct officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys do a good job, mainly, but they're not involved,
they're not there every day,'' Byars said. ``I said a few years ago
I would like for us to have full-time officials. We're the only
sport that doesn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   An excellent point, except for this: Did we not just finish a
major league baseball season in which the unionized, full-salaried
umpires were vilified as the worst plague on the pastime since the
Black Sox scandal? And please tell me when anyone stood up recently
and applauded the work of those abused arbiters of basketball,
hockey, tennis, figure skating and any other sport whose winners
and losers are often determined by educated guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal, gut-wrenching calls have always been part of sports,
which have become more difficult than ever to officiate, with X-Ray
Cam waiting to freeze-frame every painful miscall. Granted, some of
these grandfatherly gents hanging on as NFL officials can't dodge
their own flipped coin, much less a snorting nose tackle. But then,
a reasonable man in his prime can see that half the job is making
the calls; the other half is avoiding one's death.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of performance enhancement, these players are
increasingly pumped up by weights and dietary supplements and who
knows what else? They hit harder, move faster and, as Parcells
said, an entire season could come down to inches, split seconds,
millions of dollars potentially risked on a single play. The
intolerance for those who officiate is going beyond the point of
being unfair. It is beginning to sound absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't the Bills could have stopped the Patriots from the
1-yard line Sunday? Couldn't Pittsburgh could have kicked off to
Detroit and held its ground? The NFL can go ahead and bring back
instant replay, stretch out a game already too long. There will
still be human error, which the best teams will continue to find
ways to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone sees one thing and someone sees another,'' a shrugging
Keyshawn Johnson said. ``There's good plays and bad, good calls and
bad. Everyone's human.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

ARIZONA TRAGEDY UNDERSCORES DANGERS OF UNREGULATED CHILD CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The cops knew Nancy Musser was operating a child-care
center in Phoenix even though she had been suspected of fracturing
the skull of a newborn baby four years earlier. So did state Child
Protective Services.
</P>
<P>
   But Inez Heath and Kim Gray had no way of knowing about Musser's
background when they left their newborn twins in her care.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the twins is dead. And the surviving twin, 2-year-old
Emily, points to pictures of her dead brother and asks for her
``bubba.''
</P>
<P>
   Their story is an example of what can happen in states like
Arizona where anyone can get paid for watching as many as four
children in their own homes with no government regulation or
interference.
</P>
<P>
   And because there is no central agency or registry where parents
can file complaints or check out potential caretakers for previous
offenses, someone like Musser can hurt a child and still stay in
business.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 87,000 Arizona children are cared for by as many as
6,000 unlicensed, unregulated child-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   But a bill being proposed for the 1999 legislative session by
child advocates would require criminal background checks as well as
clearance by CPS for such providers. It also would create a central
registry where parents could file complaints. &UR; The proposal would
not apply to all small providers but to anyone who cares for two or
more children from more than one family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to extend this protection to your next-door
neighbor who watches your children or relatives,'' Bruce Liggett of
Children's Action Alliance, a non-profit advocacy group, says.
``We're trying to identify people who are in the business of child
care.''
</P>
<P>
   People like Nancy Musser.
</P>
<P>
   She is now at the Arizona State Prison Complex-Perryville,
serving a 10-year term for child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after Musser was arrested for shaking their
son, Matthew, did Heath and Gray learn that she been investigated
by police and CPS over allegations she fractured the skull of a
3-month-old baby in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The child was in Musser's care when the mother arrived to find
the baby limp and listless. At the hospital, doctors discovered a
skull fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Musser was never prosecuted, though, because of a lack of
evidence. But had the proposed legislation been in effect, a
criminal background check and CPS clearance would have turned up
the 1992 incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had known, the children never would have been there,''
Heath, 43, the twin's birth mother, says. She and Gray are a
lesbian couple. &QL; 
RESISTANCE TO BILL LIKELY
</P>
<P>
   Although the women say the proposed legislation could have saved
their son's life, it is sure to come up against resistance in the
state Legislature where lawmakers have turned down similar bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I want kids protected,'' says House Majority Leader
Lori Daniels, R-Chandler. ``But parents also have the
responsibility to protect their children and check out the places
where they leave them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers worry that the cost of background checks and the
like would put too big of a financial burden on small providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you'll do is drive a lot of these people out
of business,'' says Rep. Bob Burns, R-Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   And that could make child care harder to find and more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, logically speaking, if it is minimum health and safety
that we are trying to guarantee through rules and regulation, then
it makes sense that those rules and regulations ought to follow the
child,'' Burns says.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett, a former child-care project manager for the state
Department of Economic Security, wrote the proposal after hearing
the horror stories of parents like Gray and Heath.
</P>
<P>
   FILE OF COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   He has a file of names of parents whose kids have been neglected
or abused by the people paid to care for them. They are cases,
Liggett says, that may have been prevented by the proposed
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day in 1997, Tania Brindley left her youngest
daughter, 18-month-old Kasia, with her neighbor, a woman who had
been baby sitting Kasia and her sister, Monique, 4, for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   That night, when Brindley came to pick up Kasia, she found her
on the living room floor, covered with bruises. She was having a
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The baby sitter said she got caught under a trundle bed. But at
the hospital, doctors said Kasia had a subdural hematoma the size
of the surgeon's fist in her brain. Her little skull was
fractured. &UR; The baby sitter was charged with child abuse and
sentenced in December 1997 to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now 3, Kasia walks with a limp and has a speech impediment. She
is epileptic and goes to speech, occupational and physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Monique was hit, too, Brindley found later, and once made to eat
her own vomit. She goes to counseling.
</P>
<P>
   `YOU COULD BE A MURDERER'
</P>
<P>
   Without the proposed legislation, the baby sitter can easily set
up shop again when she gets out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be a murderer, fresh out of prison, and you could
care for four or fewer children in your home for pay,'' Liggett
says. ``There would be no one looking over your shoulder. No one
would have to know.''
</P>
<P>
   State law allows child-care providers to operate free of
regulation as long as they care for four or fewer children _ like
the women who cared for Kasia and Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   DES offers certification for such providers but it is voluntary,
not mandated. There are no background checks; it is simply a
registry. That can be revoked, but the provider can care for kids
without it.
</P>
<P>
   Only providers who want to care for children whose care is
subsidized by DES _ an estimated 1,300 _ must be certified by DES,
and that certification mandates inspections and health and staffing
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Only child-care providers who watch more than four children must
be certified by the state Department of Health and subject to its
regulations, including inspections and health standards, says
Lourdes Ochoa, program manager with DHS' Office of Child Care and
Licensure. She estimates DHS has about 250 licensed child-care
homes. &QL; 
6,000 NOT COVERED
</P>
<P>
   That leaves as many as 6,000 child-care homes not covered by
either agency's certification.
</P>
<P>
   DES funds the Child Care Resource and Referral, a free registry
for child-care providers and parents looking for child care. It,
too, is a voluntary listing for providers, and the agency offers
parents no guarantees about quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   At first, anyone caring for four or fewer children could list
themselves with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But starting three years ago, the agency required providers sign
a notarized statement saying they had never been investigated for
child abuse or neglect, denied a license for child care in any
state or convicted of a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sign it, 900 providers dropped from the agency's
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let parents know that when you are using an unregulated
provider, there is nobody who is going into that home and
regulating what is going on there,'' executive director Susan
Wilkins says. ``No one is monitoring. No one is doing background
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, her agency gives parents a place to file complaints, and
parents can read those files before choosing a provider. The agency
takes complaints only on its own providers.
</P>
<P>
   RANGE OF COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Complaints range from providers watching more than four children
and not changing diapers often enough to not feeding children and
upping fees with no notice.
</P>
<P>
   Some complaints are more harrowing. Had they happened in
child-care homes not listed with the agency, no one ever would
know.
</P>
<P>
   In January of 1996, a child was molested by an 11-year-old boy
while in the provider's care. In October 1993, a parent complained
that an infant was covered in bruises and bite marks. And in
January of 1993, a parent reported seeing a provider beating her
own 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggest that parents check out the provider themselves _
see if the children seem to be happy, if they will let you in at
any hour of operation, that the house is clean,'' Wilkins says.
``And then continue to monitor what goes on inside the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath and Gray did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Musser was recommended by another woman who had cared for their
older son, Joey, now 4. They talked to the other parents who left
their kids in Musser's care.
</P>
<P>
   Musser watched Joey for 18 months before the women left the
10-week-old twins in her care. She was an ideal caregiver, the
women say, keeping meticulous notes about what each child ate,
number of diaper changes and how long they slept.
</P>
<P>
   Musser was even a Sunday school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trusted her,'' Gray, 41, says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Sept. 27, 1996, Gray picked up the children. Both she
and Heath are nurses, so Gray knew something was wrong with Matthew
as soon as she saw him. His skin was yellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a dishrag,'' Gray says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Musser told Gray that Matthew had spit up and choked. But
doctors said Matthew had been shaken. He suffered brain damage and
internal bleeding. His ribs were broken.
</P>
<P>
   When Matthew got out of the hospital a month later, Heath and
Gray worked opposite shifts, so one would always be home with him.
A shunt drained fluid from his brain. He was fed through a tube.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs show Matthew smiling. He could say ``Hi.''
</P>
<P>
   He could move his hands and legs but not control his head. He
liked music and he could see things that were bright, like the
children's television show character Barney.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his apparent recovery, the injuries had been too
much for him. He died on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we lost Matthew twice,'' Gray says, her eyes filling
with tears. &QL;

NIXON-ERA AG SAYS HOUSE SHOULD CENSURE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted as House-Impeach)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A generation after he clashed with President Nixon
in the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' of Watergate, the US attorney
general of that era, Elliot L. Richardson, said Monday that the
House should censure President Clinton and reject the effort to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a Republican who served as attorney general and
lieutenant governor of Massachusetts in the 1960s, before he went
to Washington, made the recommendation in a telephone interview as
he prepared to testify Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee
in a hearing on ``the consequences of perjury and related crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole case rests on the coverup and the lies about an
affair with a young woman,'' said Richardson, 78, who also served
as defense secretary under Nixon and commerce secretary under
President Gerald R. Ford. ``The matter is absent the elements of
abuse of power that were contingent to the Nixon case.''
</P>
<P>
   In calling for Clinton's censure, Richardson, a Washington
lawyer, has joined several other prominent GOP figures, including
Ford, who have proposed sanctioning Clinton short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is scheduled to appear before the Judiciary Committee
with two federal judges, two military officers, several legal
scholars, and two women who were convicted of perjury for lying
about their sexual relationships. The witness list also includes
Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson resigned as US attorney general in 1973 when Nixon
ordered him to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor for
Watergate. The episode became known as the ``Saturday Night
Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the House would forfeit any chance of censuring
Clinton if it sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, where
``the only remedy is the president's removal of office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want something short of removing the president from
office, you cannot support the charge of impeachment,'' Richardson
said.

WASHINGTON: more serious.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republicans' move came on the same day that the White House
rebuffed a committee invitation for Clinton to appear before the
panel, saying it would serve no purpose. The White House left open
the possibility that Clinton's lawyers would appear.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, positions appeared to be hardening in the
House in the wake of Clinton's legalistic answers to 81 question
from the committee, making any compromise short of impeachment ever
harder to work out.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the situation, House members say, is the
fact that they are scattered across the country and that the House
Republican leadership is still in disarray as the incoming speaker,
Robert Livingston, tries to assemble a staff and establish a
Republican agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to manage the process of coming to rational
decisions when you have chaos around you,'' said one Republican
House member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``He's
moving offices and setting up staff and developing scheduling and
bombarded with a host of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde on Monday sharply denounced Clinton's responses to the 81
questions about the scandal surrounding his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. ``Instead of shedding new light on the key facts,
the president chose to evade them,'' Hyde said in a two-page
statement. ``He has made it very clear he is going to stick with
his reliance on bizarre technical definitions and legalistic
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the president ``did not challenge the truthfulness of
the evidence. Rather, his reponses revealed a selective ability to
recall information.'' He warned that Clinton would soon have his
last chance to contest any aspect of the impeachment case built by
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House left the door open Monday to an appearance
by Clinton's lawyers before the Judiciary Committee, it ruled out
an appearance by the president. ``It won't add any new information
and can be put in the category of a stunt,'' Joe Lockhart, the
White House press secretary said, Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's irritation appeared widely shared among Republicans, even
among some moderates who might be expected to be skittish about
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president did a disservice to his case by the
deceptive nature of his responses,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.,
who has said he would not say how he would vote until the House
Judiciary Committee completed its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the public has made clear that it opposes the
impeachment of Clinton, House Republicans now seem to be split. The
Republicans on the Judiciary Committtee, one of the most
ideologically polarized committees in the House, are pushing
steadily ahead for an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, too, favor an impeachment vote, most vocal among
them Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority whip. Republicans
in this faction argue that their party will suffer few political
consequences whether they narrowly fail to impeach the president on
a perjury count, or narrowly succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If they fail, said one House Republican strategist, they will be
able to tell core conservative voters that they made their best
effort against the president. If they succeed, he said, they do so
knowing that the Senate will never muster the votes to remove
Clinton from office. ``Ninety-six percent of the American public
believes he lied under oath to a grand jury,'' the strategist said.
``That provides political cover for an article of impeachment on
perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans fear that their party will suffer a
backlash from the voters if they push through a near-party-line
impeachment vote and that their ability to work with Democrats on
issues of concern to voters will be impaired. Some of them would
like to see their leaders join with the Democrats and work out an
agreement to censure Clinton as a possible alternative to
impeachment, or as an option for a second vote should an
impeachment vote fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you either give him the death penalty or set him
free is kind of ridiculous,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for
Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have a strategy and we go ahead with an
impeachment vote and lose and Congress censures the president,''
said King, ``that will be looked at as a Democratic initiative and
a Democratic victory. We should be on the forefront on censure.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far neither Livingston nor Gingrich, who remains Speaker
until the 106th Congress convenes in January, have taken an active
role in planning strategy, Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has said he will consider impeachment a vote of
conscience and will not be counting votes or putting pressure on
members. He has also said he believes the Senate, not the House,
would be the proper forum for any censure agreement. At the same
time he has left the door open for a censure option to come to the
House floor through the Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Livingston said Monday that until
the House Judiciary Committee takes its final action ``the question
of who's in charge is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday a prominent Democratic fund-raiser, Nathan
Landow, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination when the Judiciary Committee staff sought to
depose him. Landow had invoked the same right when called before
the federal grand jury by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans wanted to question Landow about whether he tried to
influence the testimony of Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer who has said President Clinton groped her outside the
Oval Office. Last week, Ms. Willey's lawyer, Daniel Gecker, gave
committee lawyers a sworn statement, but aides said Gecker's
answers did not break any new ground. Republican committee aides
said Monday that they are likely to cancel a deposition scheduled
for Thursday with Robert Bennett, Clinton's personal lawyer in the
Paula Jones sexual-misconduct case.

A CHIEF EXECUTIVE COMES UP SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BANKERS-TRUST-DEUTSCHE, BANKERS-DEAL, BANKERS-INDUSTRY) 
(lb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wasn't supposed to end this way.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Newman took over Bankers Trust Corp. three years ago
he vowed to rein in the New York bank's vaunted trading operation _
widely viewed as populated by free-wheeling hot shots more
interested in making big bets on the direction of financial markets
than in the well-being of their clients _ and he regularly
proclaimed his determination to maintain Bankers Trust's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, undone by huge trading losses and nasty internal strife at
the eighth-largest bank in the United States, Newman, 56, has been
forced into an act he firmly opposed as recently as five months
ago: the sale of Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in a move that has been widely anticipated for more
than a week, Deutsche Bank, the German banking giant, formally
announced plans for a $10.1 billion acquisition of Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank will go down in history as the person who sold Bankers
Trust,'' said Raphael Soifer, an analyst with Brown Brothers
Harriman. ``Frank is partially the victim of circumstance, but as
the bank evolved under him, with an emphasis on emerging markets,
trading in Eastern Europe and Asia, junk bonds, and initial public
offerings, he left Bankers Trust particularly vulnerable to the
global financial turmoil of the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who declined repeated requests for an interview, is
certainly not the only victim of the upheaval that has ripped
through international banks in an unusually tumultuous year. Some
chief executives, like Mathis Cabiallavetta of UBS in Switzerland,
and Martin Taylor, the chief executive of Barclays, Britain's
biggest bank, lost their jobs after huge trading losses
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, as in the ousters of James Dimon, Citigroup's
president, and David Coulter, the president of BankAmerica, trading
losses provided a convenient excuse for departures that were the
result of more deep-seated corporate frictions.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his counterparts in the banking world, Newman was
blind-sided this summer by trading losses that snowballed after
Russia devalued its currency and declared a debt moratorium in
mid-August. Unlike them, he has not lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   But while Newman will join the board of Deutsche Bank and have a
senior position in the investment banking unit created by
Deutsche's purchase of Bankers Trust, he is not expected to wield
significant managerial control in the new entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the third quarter hadn't happened, I would have
characterized Newman's legacy as having led a significant
turnaround in the company's fortunes,'' said Diane Glossman, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers Holdings. ``He did a remarkable amount
of work in a short period of time, but then his time ran out.''
</P>
<P>
   The clock started ticking for Newman in July.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Newman's position was relatively strong. Wanting to
keep the bank intact, he had recently spurned overtures from Bank
of New York, Mellon Bank and State Street Corp. to sell Bankers
Trust's valuable business as a securities custodian.
</P>
<P>
   And in a June interview, around the same time that Deutsche Bank
first privately floated the idea of a merger, Newman firmly
asserted that Bankers Trust would remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proponents of the idea that bigger is not necessarily
better,'' he said at the time. ``We're trying to find markets where
we can add value.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Newman accepted an invitation in July from a senior
Deutsche Bank investment banker and board member, Ronaldo Schmitz,
to dine at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan. They revisited the
possibility of a merger, according to executives later involved in
the transaction, though people close to Newman said he was
noncommittal at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Newman had every reason to believe then that he did not have to
rush into a marriage with Deutsche Bank, a plodding financial
behemoth that had been badly bruised by previous, ill-considered
forays into investment banking _ an arena where Bankers Trust was
making inroads. Newman still enjoyed strong support from his board
and he had managed to steer Bankers Trust away from an overreliance
on trading.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks long ago branched away from the traditional business
of making loans to corporations and began trading stocks, bonds,
currencies and more exotic financial products known as derivatives.
Bankers Trust, founded in 1903 to handle the trust business of
other large banks, had transformed itself in the late 1980s and
1990s into one of the most aggressive and innovative trading shops
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of derivatives scandals a few years ago wreaked
financial havoc on the bank and led to the departure of Charles
Sanford as its chairman and the ascent of Newman to that position.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's credentials _ he had been the chief financial officer
of Wells Fargo and BankAmerica before serving as a top official in
the Treasury Department from 1993 to 1995 _ were seen as the balm
needed to restore credibility to Bankers Trust's damaged
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Newman, who had no experience as a trader or an investment
banker, never entirely fit in at Bankers Trust. He is respected for
his analytical abilities and methodical planning, but he was widely
criticized within Bankers Trust for being aloof and awkward in
social settings.
</P>
<P>
   Newman also relied on a small group of advisers from the West
Coast, especially the chief financial officer, Richard Daniel, a
move that alienated some senior executives. And as befalls any
executive seeking to reshape a company, Newman also made enemies
among traders who resented his cutbacks in their business.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these tensions, Newman succeeded in making important
changes at Bankers Trust despite the financial mess he inherited.
``He came into a company that was very beaten down and so focused
on derivatives products that it had lost its competitive edge,''
observed Judah Kraushaar, a Merrill Lynch analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, 72 percent of Bankers Trust's profits came from
trading. Last year, only 16 percent did. And as Newman guided
Bankers Trust more deeply into overseas markets and allowed the
firm's junk-bond business to expand, he also bolstered the
company's presence in investment banking last year by buying Alex.
Brown &AMP; Sons, a small but well-regarded regional brokerage firm
with an important role in underwriting technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an uneven performance earlier this year, Newman was
still well positioned to keep Deutsche Bank at a distance until the
torrent of ill will unleashed by the Alex. Brown acquisition and
substantial trading losses in July and August combined to weaken
his standing. At that point, insiders say, he began to lose the
ability to determine his own fate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many Alex. Brown employees grumbled that the sale of their firm
left them in a financial nether world. They were no longer an
independent regional brokerage, yet they were trapped inside a bank
that still lacked the heft to compete with the most powerful Wall
Street investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior executives left Alex. Brown, and many of those
who stayed were unhappy, bankers said, particularly Mayo Shattuck,
a long-time Alex. Brown employee who became co-head of Bankers
Trust's investment banking unit.
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck, who is scheduled to play a senior role in Deutsche
Bank's new investment banking operation created by the Bankers
Trust acquisition, is said by colleagues to have been among the
most vocal critics of Newman. Shattuck did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in newspapers and magazines, reports began to surface
this summer of Newman's fondness for glittering parties and
expensive corporate perks. Newman's supporters attributed them to
disgruntled employees trying to smear his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it was clear that several members of the bank's
board were not pleased with the publicity surrounding Newman's
spending and fondness for a phalanx of private security guards. One
person close to the board, and a supporter of Newman, said some
board members were ``poisoned'' against Newman by the turmoil at
Alex. Brown and by unwanted public interest in his spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   All this unrest might have been smoothed over had it not been
for hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses that,
beginning in July, hit Bankers Trust, including an embarrassing
disclosure of a big hedge-fund loss related to Russia. Ultimately,
the bank posted a third-quarter loss of $488 million and, despite
Newman's reputation for risk aversion, disclosed that its
sophisticated models to manage risk-taking had failed to perform
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank made the promise to reduce the risk profile of Bankers
Trust but look what happened in the third quarter,'' said Soifer,
the analyst at Brown Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   As Bankers Trust's stock price fell, the bank was roiled by
internal accusations that Newman had allowed its risky junk-bond
portfolio to balloon, senior employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, which had dubbed its takeover campaign ``Osprey''
after the black-and-white bird of prey, stopped considering a
purchase of the San Francisco brokerage firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and
began circling Bankers Trust more closely.
</P>
<P>
   With Bankers Trust's financial position severely weakened,
Newman was forced to take the takeover proposal much more
seriously. He held talks with Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf
Breuer, at an International Monetary Fund conference in Washington
in September and followed up with a meeting at Breuer's home in
Frankfurt, Germany, in October.
</P>
<P>
   When Bankers Trust reported its big loss for the quarter on Oct.
22, Deutsche Bank made its move. It quickly offered $93 a share for
the beleaguered bank. Details of the transaction were worked out by
investment bankers from Goldman, Sachs, which was advising Deutsche
Bank, and by Jeffery Goldstein, an investment banker with Bankers
Trust. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was also hired as an outside
adviser to Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's future is hazy. In a news conference Monday, Breuer
said that Newman's duties would involve overseeing the integration
of the two companies, helping to negotiate regulatory hurdles in
the United States and dealing with claims stemming from Deutsche
Bank's involvement with the Nazis during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that Frank will just be a transitional figure,''
Soifer said, ``and he'll be there for only a few years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If only daughters wore what their mothers wore, designers' lives
would be easier. But that is not the case, and so Tommy Hilfiger
has set himself a daunting challenge in his bid to dress not only
the hip young teen-ager with whom he has been so successful, but
now, the older, more serious career-minded customer.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger is introducing two new women's collections that are so
mature and career-minded as to be unrecognizable beside the
fun-loving, logo-emblazoned sportswear that he's known for.
</P>
<P>
   Can Hilfiger, whose mass-market success has been one of the most
remarkable of the past decade, sell clothes without the tip-off of
his blaring flag iconography and large-wrought signature, which are
almost universally recognized?
</P>
<P>
   He certainly hopes so. He wants to sell a teen-ager a pair of
jeans and her mother a tailored gray and pink wool suit, or a
$2,000-plus crocodile handbag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more sophisticated, but it still has a youthful look,''
Hilfiger said of the two new lines. ``I don't want to abandon that.
If I have to fail to sell clothes to a 50-year-old woman because of
that, then that's the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The pricier of the two collections is already in his Beverly
Hills store. A bridge collection, slightly less expensive, arrives
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that there are difficulties expanding upward into
more expensive and complex fashion. In the 1980s and early '90s,
Guess, which had been wildly successful selling jeans and other
fashions to teen-agers, failed in its efforts to establish a
higher-priced brand.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Liz Claiborne, a label that thought it had
across-the-board cachet, found itself ousted from Saks Fifth Avenue
when its broad distribution made it a liability to the store's
rarefied image. Claiborne went on to make a mark in the bridge area
with the formidable Dana Buchman brand, which has no association
with the Claiborne name and operates as a separate division.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hilfiger may defy all these precedents. His Midaslike touch
has already extended beyond his original market of polo shirts and
jeans for men to include boys' wear, men's tailored sportswear,
jeans wear, clothes for teen-age girls, fragrance and home
furnishings. In a rare feat, he has remained hot with hip-hoppers
and Wall Streeters alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy has been an amazing phenomenon in so many ways,'' said
Faye I. Landes, a retail analyst and a managing director at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``The brand has been able to transcend what it
started out as. For a long time we heard that Tommy was just the
inner city _ oh, Tommy is just men's and boys. He's done a very
nice job with the women's.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Landes has taken a look at the top-of-the-line collection in
the Hilfiger Beverly Hills store, priced from about $250 for a
jacket to more than $3,000 for a silk jersey gown. She said that
even though the overall market for career clothes and bridge lines
is doing poorly, she is optimistic about the new Hilfiger lines.
``They repeatedly show they can do more with the brand than people
thought they might originally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While most fashion stocks, including that of Ralph Lauren, whom
Hilfiger is so often accused of imitating, have been hurt this
year, Hilfiger has surged 32 percent. Sales of the label's products
reached $661.7 million for the fiscal year ended in March, and are
expected to exceed that in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger, perhaps better than anyone, understands the gamble,
and is proceeding cautiously. ``I think it's a risky business,'' he
said. ``Designers with expensive collections have failed miserably
from a business point of view. Look what happened to the bridge
business. Look what happened to the designer business in department
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Department stores, most notably the Federated chain, which
includes Macy's, have pulled backed markedly in designer-priced
clothes. And in the last 12 months, sales of bridge clothes, a rung
below designer, have slowed strikingly, retailers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger expects first-year sales of the collection to be no
more than $5 million and wavers about any sales projections over
$20 million for the line, even at its maturity.
</P>
<P>
   The two collections will be introduced exclusively in the
Hilfiger flagship stores in Beverly Hills, London and Mexico City,
and in two more to open next year in London and Sao Paolo. They are
not being offered to some of Hilfiger's best customers, like
Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   He has his sights on top specialty stores like Bergdorf Goodman,
Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom, which will have a chance to buy
the line for fall 1999, he said.
</P>

 &UR; BC-HILFIGER-FASHION-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: he said. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offering the new, expensive collection only in places
where people understand it,'' he said. ``We're not going to sell it
to Dillard or in the heartland. I expect my Beverly Hills customer
to understand it. I've been so successful in everything I've done,
I'm afraid to put it out there in department stores and have it not
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The collections' style is a clean, sophisticated exuberance, an
interpretation of the Hilfiger signature. Now it turns up in
sweater sets or nylon handbags suitable for the office. But the
collections go further with slinky silk jersey evening columns
sprinkled with beads, perforated suede dresses, gray and white
ankle-length windowpane skirts and navy two-button jackets.
Handbags and shoes bear logos that don't suggest traditional
Hilfiger flags. Some are logo-free.
</P>
<P>
   As career-oriented as the clothes are, when designing this line
Hilfiger took celebrities as his muse. His real secret may be, as
Ms. Landes said, the recognition that everyone can dress like a
celebrity, an idea first put forth by the entertainers who populate
hip-hop culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking young, I'm thinking about a lot of the musicians
_ from Lauryn Hill to Sheryl Crow to Gwen Stefani from No Doubt _
who inspire me,'' Hilfiger said.
</P>
<P>
   One potential roadblock to Hilfiger's dream of seeing his new
lines sold widely is the tendency of high-end retailers to guard
their prestige jealously. A fast-selling populist label may quickly
fill coffers, but can also jeopardize a store's image. But in
Hilfiger's favor is his strong association with celebrity and
youth, which almost any fashion store finds attractive. Saks said
it will definitely consider the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen other designers inspired by the street, so for him,
who started in that, why shouldn't he address his creativity to
this market?'' said Nicole Fischelis, a vice president and fashion
director for Saks. ``Ultimately, it's the product and how it's
marketed. It's more about the product than the image.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hilfiger, of course, it is his image _ fun, youthful, sexy,
informal _ that has helped propel his success. And it is this image
that Estee Lauder is banking on; its Aramis division will introduce
a Hilfiger cosmetics line and a fragrance next fall, both primarily
for an older customer _ anyone over 19, in Hilfiger's world _ for
whom subtlety in design has its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetics will include basic colors and trendy shades, for the
core Hilfiger customer as well as the new one being courted, said
Pamela Baxter, senior vice president and general manager for
Aramis. ``We have to address both,'' she said. ``It will work as
long as Tommy stays tied to the world he's tied into _ music and
movieland.''
</P>
<P>
   With no color cosmetics brands on the market from any other
American designers (no less than Ralph Lauren, Diane Von
Furstenburg and Calvin Klein have all tried and failed), Hilfiger,
whose cosmetics will cost $10 to $15, is trying yet another
high-wire act. ``Right now we don't see a competitor,'' Ms. Baxter
said. The new fragrance _ unnamed so far _ will also be skewed
toward women 18 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hilfiger's attempt to redefine his image upward is a
big challenge, he is entering the new market modestly. ``A $5
million business doesn't even register on my radar screen,'' he
said flippantly.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a thought to give Hilfiger pause: if the young people
who now find his brand so hip turn away once they notice that
adults, too, are wearing it, his core business _ the goose that has
laid golden eggs _ may begin to suffer.

RED SOX SEEK ALTERNATIVE TO WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There may be gloom on Yawkey Way because Bernie
Williams refused to surrender his pinstripes, but paralysis has not
set in. The phone lines are still working, and Monday Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette and his lieutenants were making the
rounds of agents and teams, exploring how they might stitch
together an alternative course of action.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have not entirely abandoned the notion that Rafael
Palmeiro would be an acceptable substitute for Mo Vaughn at first
base. Monday, the Sox called Palmeiro's agent, Jim Bronner, though
no new offers were forthcoming. Palmeiro's incumbent team, the
Orioles, already has offered him a five-year, $45 million deal, and
the Texas Rangers, having failed to achieve their top priority of
signing pitcher Randy Johnson, are expected to turn their
attentions to Palmeiro, who last season hit more home runs (43 to
40) and drove in more runs (121 to 115) than Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox talked more about potential scenarios than the
specifics of an offer, Bronner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly not trying to overwhelm us,'' said the
agent. ``I think they're trying to do some other things, but
they're not willing to let us go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also have had conversations with Robin Ventura, recently
the recipient of a four-year, $32 million offer from the Orioles
after receiving a lesser bid from the Mets. Ventura gives Baltimore
an option in case Palmeiro heads elsewhere and could be reuniting
with Albert Belle, his White Sox teammate who may be signing with
the Orioles as soon as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate wake of the Yankees' unexpected decision to
yield to Williams's demand for a seven-year, $87.5 million
contract, Duquette said he intended to turn his attentions to
upgrading the club's pitching staff, which supposedly was the No. 1
offseason priority all along. The best pitcher still available in
free agency is righthander Kevin Brown, who has expressed a
preference to remain in the National League, though his agent,
Scott Boras, said he would not rule out the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   To sign Brown, the Red Sox would have to pay him more than the
six-year, $75 million deal they gave Pedro Martinez last winter,
which is a remote option.
</P>
<P>
   They have talked about Tim Belcher, who was 14-14 with a 4.27
ERA for a lousy Kansas City team last summer, and Monday, they
spoke with Pete Schourek's agent (Bronner) about a two-year deal
that would bring the lefthander back to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, remember, distinguished himself with a gallant
six-inning stint in Game 4 of the Division Series against the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 days, baseball's winter meetings begin in Nashville, and
Duquette is expected to be active on the trade front at that time.
The Sox almost certainly will renew their pitch for Montreal
outfielder Rondell White, who hit .300 with 17 home runs and 58
RBIs in an injury-disrupted season. The Sox already have spoken to
Montreal about White, but their initial proposals, which included
young prospects such as outfielder Dernell Stenson and pitcher
Robert Ramsay, were rebuffed. The Expos turned down a much richer
package of prospects from the Yankees for White.

PANEL TO PROBE CLINTON FUND-RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled House Judiciary
Committee, in a sudden shift, is poised to widen the impeachment
case against President Clinton by examining White House
fund-raising practices in the 1996 elections, congressional sources
said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans decided Monday to subpoena FBI Director
Louis J. Freeh and a former top Justice Department prosecutor,
Charles LaBella, to privately question why they recommended that
Attorney General Janet Reno seek an independent counsel to
investigate Clinton's fund-raising activities, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's GOP majority, in a closed-door meeting tonight, also
plans to send subpoenas for documents to Clinton and Reno, ordering
them to turn over the confidential memos in which Freeh and LaBella
called for an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno rebuffed the recommendation, although a Justice Department
investigation of the 1996 campaign finance activities continues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Judiciary Committee plans to approve a subpoena
for independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr to turn over evidence he
has involving John Huang, a former Democratic fund-raiser and
central figure in the fund-raising investigation. Starr
investigated whether Huang made payments to Clinton's friend,
Webster L. Hubbell, in exchange for Hubbell's secrecy in the
Whitewater inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Additional subpoenas are expected to be sent to the Justice
Department for information on three other former Democratic
fund-raisers who have been linked to fund-raising abuses: Johnny
Chung, Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, and Mark Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Monday night that Paul McNulty, a
spokesman for Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, said, ``The
committee has received information which suggests that the campaign
finance abuse memos may contain allegations of criminal wrongdoing
by the president. The committee is duty-bound to investigate that
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said committee Republicans also plan to make public
portions of the president's videotaped civil deposition in the
recently settled sexual harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin Jones
filed against him. The panel's chief GOP investigative counsel,
David P. Schippers, wants to show the videotape when he makes a
final presentation to the committee, as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic moves came as Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J.
Hyde followed many committee Republicans in blasting Clinton for
his responses last week to 81 questions from the GOP majority about
allegations stemming from the president's sexual affair with Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of shedding new light on the key facts, the president
chose to evade them,'' Hyde said. ``He has made it very clear he is
going to stick with his reliance on bizarre technical definitions
and legalistic defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and FBI had no immediate response to the
GOP plans. However, Reno, Freeh and LaBella previously have refused
to turn over the confidential documents to other congressional
committees. LaBella is the former head of Reno's campaign-finance
task force investigating the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats lashed out at the new GOP initiative,
describing it as a frantic attempt to revive a moribund inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just left shaking our heads at the weirdness of it
all,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for the committee Democrats.
``We've said before, and this is confirmation, that this is an
impeachment in search of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans outnumbering Democrats on the committee, 21-16,
the GOP subpoena plans are expected to be readily approved.
</P>
<P>
   The move to expand the inquiry comes as Reno faces a deadline of
next Monday to decide whether to seek an independent counsel to
investigate Clinton's fund-raising activities. She decided last
week against seeking an independent counsel to examine Vice
President Al Gore's campaign finance activities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impeachment inquiry's new direction, sources said
Hyde tentatively set a schedule Monday to complete House action on
the impeachment issue before Christmas week. Under the preliminary
plan, Clinton's lawyer, David E. Kendall, would present the
president's defense before the full committee next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chief investigative counsels _ Schippers for the
Republicans and Abbe Lowell for the Democrats _ would make
presentations on Dec. 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   Then the 37-member panel would debate and vote on proposed
articles of impeachment against Clinton on Dec. 10, 11, and
possibly Saturday, Dec. 12. The commitee also will consider
Democratic motions for alternative sanctions, such as resolutions
of censure, rebuke or disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hyde's plan, any measure that passes the committee would
be considered by the full House as soon as Dec. 14 and no later
than Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the president's failure to respond in a helpful
manner, we will move forward based on the established record of
corroborated evidence,'' Hyde said, referring to Starr's 445-report
on the Lewinsky matter. ``If the president leaves undisputed the
record or where he has given evasive responses, we will be forced
to assume that the corroborated evidence is accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy took issue with Hyde's
characterization of Clinton's responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made a good faith effort to respond to
politically motivated questions,'' Kennedy said. ``The chairman
should recognize that the country's interest in a fair and
constitutional process comes ahead of partisan games like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as the Judiciary Committee prepared to
convene a hearing Tuesday on ``the consequences of perjury and
related crimes.'' The public hearing will be only the third _ and
possibly the last _ before the panel hears the final presentations
next week.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called the session ``a
stunt.'' He also questioned the fairness of the
Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee, and said he did not
expect Clinton to accept an invitation to defend himself before the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very likely that you'll see the president
appear before that committee,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Democratic fund-raiser Nathan Landow refused to
testify in a closed-door deposition with the committee, citing his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Landow has
acknowledged talking with former White House volunteer Kathleen
Willey about her allegation that Clinton groped her and tried to
kiss her near the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans want to know if Clinton played any role in
trying to influence Willey's testimony in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Willey inquiry, the committee also has subpoenaed
Robert S. Bennett, the president's lawyer in the Jones case, and
Bruce R. Lindsey, a White House deputy counsel and one of Clinton's
most trusted advisers. But sources said the committee may withdraw
Bennett's subpoena and focus on questioning Lindsey in a deposition
on Friday.

HOTELS AT JFK BUFF THEIR IMAGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everyone who flies has spent at least part of a night at
an airport hotel. Predawn departures, missed connections, canceled
flights, oversold seats: all sorts of things can lead to a
sleepless stay, watching car headlights flicker across the ceiling
and hearing planes taking off and landing.
</P>
<P>
   We stalled travelers are known in airport-hotel jargon as
``distress'' customers. The phrase is usually apt: already pained
by the forces that brought us there, we are still more distressed
by the place we have been deposited. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But hotels at airports are changing. Figures from Smith Travel
Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., show that airport hotels
nationally had a 70.5 percent occupancy rate last year, which
outstripped other sorts of hotels from luxury to budget.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, until September, the figure was 71.3 percent. An
analysis by the magazine Hotel and Motel Management cited as causes
both an improvement in facilities _ business centers, fitness
centers and tennis courts _ and an overflow of guests from downtown
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   These trends are visible in New York around Kennedy
International Airport, where three of the five hotels within about
five minutes' driving time have just completed major overhauls. Two
are shiny new hotels in old shells, one empty for years and the
other a former welfare hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A third completed renovations this year while continuing to
operate. All attract business and vacation guests, in addition to
the usual flow of airline crews and stranded passengers. Unlike
some airports, including Bradley at Hartford and Bangor, Maine,
Kennedy does not have a hotel attached to the main terminal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's five hotels, in a quiet residential part of Jamaica,
Queens, bear familiar names: Ramada Plaza, JFK Airport Hilton, Four
Points by Sheraton, Radisson and Holiday Inn. The Hilton was
renovated at the end of 1996, according to its director of sales,
and the Ramada was converted from a Marriott two and a half years
ago, and is doing some work now, one floor at a time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three most recent renovations, the Four Points, Radisson and
Holiday Inn, are full-service hotels that provide features for
business travelers, data ports and extra telephone lines, for
example, as well as meeting rooms, some quite large.
</P>
<P>
   They have restaurants and health facilities as well, and the
Holiday Inn has a glassed-in indoor pool, a hot tub and a sauna.
These hotels, nicely landscaped and surrounded by low-rise houses
and highways with grassy banks, seemed bucolic and welcoming after
the unplanned night I recently spent in a budget motel in the midst
of nothingness eight miles from the new Denver International
Airport. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Radisson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``newest'' of the New York three is the Radisson, a 12-story
cream-colored building with light green trim. This hotel, once the
JFK Plaza, built in the 50s, had been shut for six years before
being taken over by the new owner, French Quarter III. Between
January and September it was gutted and redecorated, and in
mid-November, when I looked it over, the job was ending, with rooms
on the second floor getting finishing touches. A contractor's
``punch list'' of remaining small tasks was taped to a shelf in
each room; mattresses were still wrapped in plastic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the hotel was active. A meeting room on the main
floor was filled with students taking notes on how to become
notaries, and the 24-hour restaurant, called Charles, had laid out
a buffet and was well occupied.
</P>
<P>
   The buffet lunch was set up _ Charles normally has waiter-served
meals at lunch _ for 75 South African Airways passengers. Their
flight was canceled the evening before and they were given dinner,
a hotel night, breakfast and lunch while waiting for the next day's
flight. The hotel has 215 employees, a number affected by the
provision of 24-hour van and food services.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lobby had a semiformal look _ a lot of glass, marble floors,
dark upholstery and patterned rugs. There were vases of real
flowers, and orchids planted in moss, some in need of pruning.
</P>
<P>
   The cocktail lounge leading to the restaurant was dim at 12:30
p.m. and two people were there reading papers. A couple in the
lobby were eating a deli lunch off a coffee table. Another couple,
knee-deep in shopping bags, were waiting to be picked up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has 386 rooms, half of them nonsmoking, 18 equipped
for wheelchairs. All have fire sprinklers. In the west wing, the
rooms all have king-sized beds. The larger rooms in the east wing
have two queen-sized beds. All the rooms have two telephone lines.
The bases of the lamps on the desk-tables have both power plugs and
telephone outlets for modems. A shelf pulls out to hold a
keyboard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The business center is a modest room on the second floor with
two fax machines and a computer with Internet access. There is no
staff here, and the guest uses the service by inserting a credit
card into a device that puts a designated credit on an electronic
card called the Office, which in turn can be used to activate the
machines and pay the fees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fitness center is spacious and windowed, with five
treadmills, three step machines, two stationary bicycles and free
weights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has a contract with American Airlines and American
Eagle to accommodate crew members, usually from red-eye flights,
said Richard Sarno, head of sales. They are housed on a hall where
quiet is maintained in the daytime: the vacuuming is done at other
times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The introductory rate, in effect now, is $149 a night, which
works out to $170.74 with New York City's hotel tax of 13.25
percent plus $2 a night. The corporate rate is $169, or $193 with
taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Radisson Hotel JFK Airport, 135-30 140th Street, Jamaica, N.Y.
11434; (718) 322-2300, or (800) 333-3333. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four Points by Sheraton  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This hotel has a spiffy European feel, with the bombe chests and
huge Baccarat vases in the lobby. The ``H.R.'' emblem in the glass
doors in the lobby stands for Hampshire Hotels and Resorts, the New
York company that owns the Four Points.
</P>
<P>
   The emblem of the brand, the four points of a compass, is inlaid
in the marble floor of the lobby. A white baby grand backs up to
the glass wall overlooking a garden and gazebo in the back; in the
early afternoon, the player piano was providing soothing music. The
flowers were fresh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This hotel, as the Kennedy Inn, housed welfare clients from 1991
to '96, and then underwent a 20-month overhaul. It opened in the
fall with praise from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who hailed it as the
first new hotel to open near the airport in 20 years and called it
luxurious. All 184 rooms on four floors are now in use. Smoking is
permitted in half of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its manager, Barry M. Shatoff, said that the hotel was popular
among business travelers from overseas and people closing
international real estate deals: the participants all fly in to
Kennedy, do their work near the airport and fly home without having
to cope with ground travel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 185 guest rooms and 15 suites have three telephones on two
lines, plus data ports. The desks are big and the rooms are light.
The fitness center is tiny, with two treadmills and two step
machines.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has a sleek-looking restaurant, Birchwoods, offering
what its menu describes as American food and wine. Sunday brunch
with cappuccino (all of it you can drink) is $15.50. Thanksgiving
dinner, buffet style, was $15.50.
</P>
<P>
   In good weather there is service in the garden, and musicians
play in the gazebo, according to Elie Pariente, the assistant
manager. When I was there, a party of 20 people was being served
lunch. The bar, Fitzgerald's Lounge, would not be out of place in
Manhattan: paneled-looking and well outfitted with glasses and
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel provides room service until 1 a.m., and the kitchen is
closed from 1 to 6 a.m. Snacks can be provided at all hours,
Pariente said. The airport shuttle operates 24 hours.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rate for a room with a double, king or queen bed, or two
double beds, is $179 a night, or $205 with taxes. A suite with a
living room is $275, or $313 with taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four Points Hotel by Sheraton, 151-20 Baisley Boulevard,
Jamaica, N.Y. 11434; (718) 489-1000. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Inn  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A monthly calendar of events that includes an ad for weddings
and rehearsal dinners defines the Holiday Inn: it is a place
focused on social activities. Victor Vongs, the general manager,
said that one big goal of the $4 million rehabilitation, which took
15 months and was completed in March, was to have the place ``not
feel like an airport hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Bistro lounge has been designed to let people mingle and help
themselves to the $9.95 lunch buffet. The motel's meeting and
function rooms are large, and the place can accommodate up to 650
people in a reception; 500 sitting theater style. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside the glass walls of the restaurant is a Japanese garden.
The flowers in vases inside are silk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vongs pointed to a big alcove off the lobby that he said was
formerly a car-rental counter. It is being converted to a business
center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn sells stay-and-fly packages, allowing guests who
are taking trips to park their cars in the 360-place motel lot and
retrieve them a week or two later. The fitness club, with swimming
pool, sauna and hot tub as well as a large exercise room, attracts
many reunions and family groups, Vongs said. The motel also sells
memberships to nonguests.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guest rooms have been redecorated, this time with brass
bedsteads. Smoking is permitted in 40 percent of the rooms. The
busy season is July to October, and prices are somewhat lower the
rest of the year. There are also family bed-and-breakfast packages
in the winter. A room with a king-sized bed is $139 to $179 a
night, or $159 to $205 with taxes. A junior suite starts at $210,
or $240 with taxes. &QL;
</P>

   OIL AND NATURAL GAS LEAD DROP IN COMMODITY PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Commodity prices, led by a plunge in oil and natural gas,
dropped sharply, pushing one key index to the lowest since 1972.
The Goldman, Sachs index of 22 commodities fell 3.97 points, to
133.55, its lowest in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent weakness of commodity prices continues to hobble
many emerging-market countries _ from Russia and Indonesia to
Mexico and Chile _ that depend on such exports for economic growth
and government financing.
</P>
<P>
   SHELL AND TEXACO END VENTURE TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch/Shell announced that it had broken off talks with
Texaco about combining their refining and marketing businesses in
Europe, because a joint venture would not produce the savings they
had sought. The breakdown in that negotiation came as a person
close to the merger talks between Exxon and Mobil said that the two
companies were still working to complete a deal, which could be
announced as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO TO LAY OFF 5,300 WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, the Swedish maker of cars, buses, trucks and construction
equipment, said that it would lay off more than 7 percent of its
work force, or 5,300 workers, by the middle of next year as part of
plans to increase productivity and profits. The cuts will include
1,000 jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   MORE SPARRING IN MICROSOFT TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   In a day of detailed cross-examination at Microsoft's antitrust
trial, Frederick Warren-Boulton, an economist, summed up the
government's case of how the company wields its market power. And
Microsoft attacked its portrayal as a monopolistic bully.
</P>
<P>
   EISNER FRIEND COMES TO LIVENT'S AID
</P>
<P>
   An investment firm run by a friend of Michael Eisner, the
chairman of Walt Disney, agreed to lend more than $23 million to
Livent, the Broadway theater company headed by Michael Ovitz. Ovitz
was forced out by his boss and former friend, Eisner, as president
of Disney in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   MET LIFE EXECUTIVES FACE WINDFALL
</P>
<P>
   As Metropolitan Life Insurance reorganizes so that it can issue
stock, the big winners are likely to be the company's executives.
The 12 million policyholders are to share a one-time payout of $14
billion. But the executives will be perpetually in line for stock
options, bonuses and higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   CHAIRMAN OF UNIVERSAL IS OUSTED
</P>
<P>
   Casey Silver, the chairman of troubled Universal Pictures, was
ousted after the dismal box-office results of the studio's most
recent big-budget films, ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the
City.'' Silver, a low-key and popular figure at the studio, will be
replaced by his boss, Ron Meyer, who is president and chief
operating officer of Universal.
</P>
<P>
   TWO SATELLITES ARE SOLD
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. said it had agreed to sell two satellites and their
orbital license to Echostar Communications for $840 million in
stock as it seeks to leave the U.S. direct-broadcast satellite
business.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERGY TO SELL BRITISH UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Entergy, the fourth-largest electric-power generator in the
United States, said it would sell its British electricity
distributor to the French national power company for $3.18 billion.

<P>
   Q. We plan to be in the Mobile, Ala., area during January or
February in the areas of Dauphin Island and Gulf Shores. Can you
tell me about the weather, interesting places to see, special
gardens and the Mobile Mardi Gras? _ Elizabeth Barsky, Uniondale,
N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To capture several highlights of the area in a single day,
you might make Bellingrath Gardens your first stop. Sixty-five
acres of the gardens _ which are in Theodore, about 20 miles south
of downtown Mobile _ are cultivated. In January, camellias,
snapdragons and pansies are out and by mid-February you may be able
to see as many as 50,000 tulips, daffodils and hyacinths in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $7.50, $5.25 for children. For $13.95 ($9.95 for
children), one can also see the 15-room house completed in the
1930s for Walter Bellingrath, the first bottler of Coca-Cola in
Mobile, and his wife, Bessie.
</P>
<P>
   On display are collections of porcelain (including Meissen and
Sevres) and furniture. The gardens open at 8 a.m. daily and close
at dusk; the house opens at 9 a.m. Information: (800) 247-8420 or
(334) 973-2217. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can lunch at the gardens or en route to Dauphin Island, 15
miles away. Worth a stop on the island, which is on Mobile Bay, are
the Dauphin Island Sea Lab and Fort Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Lab, at 101 Bienville Boulevard, is the home of the
Estuarium, where exhibits capture life in the main ecosystems of
the Mobile estuary system, from the swamps of the delta to the
reefs of the Gulf of Mexico. Open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Monday through Saturday and 1 to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Summer hours are
longer. Admission: $6, $3 for children. Information: (334)
861-2141.
</P>
<P>
   During the Civil War, Fort Gaines, now a neighbor of the
Estuarium, and Fort Morgan played an important role in defending
Mobile Bay. Undeterred by the forts and by mines, known as
torpedoes, Adm. David Farragut of the Union forces declared in
1864: ``Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!'' The forts fell
shortly thereafter. Today the forts are a 45-minute ferry ride
apart; the fare is $1 and $15 for a car, including passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Gaines is open 9 to 5 daily. Information: (334) 861-6992.
Fort Morgan, in Gulf Shores, is more extensive and one should allow
two hours to see it. Hours: 8 to 5 for the fort, 9 to 5 for the
museum. Information: (334) 540-7125. At both forts, admission is
$3, $1 for children.
</P>

   Q. I would like to go to Italy next spring to learn pottery
painting. How can I find schools that offer weeklong courses in
English? _ Vivian Wachsberger, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The pickings are slim. In the area you mention, only the
Centro Internazionale Jacopone gives a course in what is known as
decoration pottery. Depending on student preference, classes are
held in Deruta, the celebrated center of pottery making, or in
Todi, a 15- to 20-minute drive away. Instruction is in Italian, but
an interpreter is provided free.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which includes classes Monday to Friday and full
board in a three-star hotel, costs $115 a day in January, February,
March, November and December and $124 a day in April, May, June,
July, September and October. (The cost is calculated at 1,691 lire
to the dollar.) A minimum stay of seven days is required.
</P>
<P>
   If participants prefer Deruta, sessions run four hours after
which they are driven back to Todi. (Transportation by private car
is $24 a day.) If the choice is Todi, classes run six hours. On
Saturday, there is an educational excursion. Among the
possibilities are a cultural and historical look at Todi; Todi and
its castles; along the ancient Flaminian Way; and the wine country,
which includes Orvieto, Montefalcone, Deruta and Torigiano.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations must be made at least a month in advance, at which
time a 50 percent payment is required. Transfers from and to the
Rome airport for non-Italian students are also covered. The center
is at 46 Vocabolo Castello, 06050 Collevalenza, Todi, Italy;
telephone and fax (39-75) 887445.
</P>
<P>
   For a broader sense of the courses given in Italy, there are
hundreds of brochures available at the Istituto Italiano di
Cultura, 686 Park Avenue (between 68th and 69th Streets), New York,
N.Y. 10021; (212) 879-4242. It is open Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. The institute's Web site, www.italcultny.org, is also a
useful resource. &QL;

<P>
   Q. Would you help me find foreign airlines that are partners
with domestic airlines for frequent flier mileage? I am deaf and
must go through the Virginia Relay (which links deaf and hearing
people) and try to explain what I want, which can be quite a
hassle. _ Dorothy W. Blackburn, Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those unfamiliar with how deaf people communicate by
telephone with people who can hear may not be aware that the
process can be quite cumbersome. It is somewhat like a conversation
between two people who do not have a language in common. In this
case, a relay operator, who is sort of a translator, transcribes
what an airline representative says. Those remarks then appear at
the deaf person's end either in typewritten form or on a computer
screen. Thus, a conversation can end up taking much longer than it
otherwise would.
</P>

   In any case, what you're looking for is available from Inside
Flyer magazine electronically and in print. On the Web, where
access is free, the address is www.webflyer.com. Or for $14.99 plus
$3 for shipping and handling, you can get a copy of the new
Official Frequent Flyer Guidebook, which is to be shipped next
month, from Inside Flyer, 4715-C Town Center Drive, Colorado

 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Deutsche Bank AG formally announced Monday
its plan for a $10.1 billion takeover of Bankers Trust Corp. and
said the acquisition would result in the elimination of 5,500 jobs,
mostly in New York and London.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, said the job cuts,
which would come from a combined work force of more than 20,000 in
the two cities, would not all be at Bankers Trust. Still, the cuts
would come at a time of Wall Street retrenchment, as Merrill Lynch,
J.P. Morgan and others have recently announced layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Bankers Trust would be the largest foreign
takeover of an American bank and would vault Deutsche Bank over UBS
AG of Switzerland and the new Citigroup as the world's biggest bank
in assets. The deal is the most vivid illustration yet of how
banking has become more global, and it may be a precursor for
cross-border deals by others.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the deal here Monday, there were no platitudes
about a ``merger of equals'' or about the need for deference to
cultural and institutional differences. Breuer made it clear he
would shape the new enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in autonomy as an instrument of management
and leadership,'' Breuer said at a news conference. ``As far as it
goes, we want a centralized management of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   With that approach, Deutsche Bank is trying to avoid repeating
past mistakes. Over the last decade, it has spent freely to build
up its investment banking business _ with largely disappointing
results. It acquired the British investment bank Morgan Grenfell in
1989, and paid billions to acquire star bankers and to expand
operations in London and New York, giving the bankers wide freedom.
When costs began to soar, Breuer re-asserted control, and top
American executives defected.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating power in Franfurt, Deutsche Bank created waves
in New York and London. But Monday, Breuer seemed to be trying for
a straddling position that would maintain central control while
also retaining key executives on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The company has committed some $400 million in bonus payments to
retain top Bankers Trust managers, including Frank Newman, chairman
and chief executive of Bankers Trust, who will be the only
executive receiving a seat on Deutsche Bank's management board.
Some Bankers Trust executives will receive $10 million or more each
to stay on. The boards of both companies approved the acquisition,
which had been expected for more than a week, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Bank fell 2.2 percent, to
104.65 marks ($61.77), as some analysts expressed skepticism about
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The goals Deutsche Bank has set for itself _ an increase in
earnings per share of 10 to 15 percent by 2001 _ are ``incredibly
ambitious,'' said Diane Glossman, a banking analyst at Lehman
Brothers Holdings. ``The greatest challenge will be consolidating
the cultures in a way that allows them to increase their earnings.
That's crucial, and it's an area where Deutsche Bank has dropped
the ball before.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Bankers Trust rose 1.7
percent, to $87, still shy of the $93 a share offered by Deutsche
Bank. The stock has risen 21 percent since speculation of a deal
emerged on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes amid a wave of big international mergers by
German companies. Daimler-Benz has just completed its merger with
Chrysler Corp. Bertelsmann AG, the publishing and media
conglomerate, is buying the publisher Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Deutsche Bank's agreement with Banker's Trust is only
one of three big deals this week. Hoechst AG, the chemicals giant,
has reached an agreement to merge its pharmaceutical and
agricultural businesses with those of Rhone-Poulenc of France. And
Viag AG, an industrial conglomerate in Munich, will merge with
Algroup of Switzerland in a deal worth $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the mergers reflect a new-found strength and
assertiveness in European corporations. But analysts say that many
deals are a sign of weakness, a need to shore up competitive lapses
that companies cannot resolve at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this is a corporate response to the difficulties at
growing earnings in a low-growth, low-inflation environment,'' said
George Hodgson, head of equity research at ABN Amro. Collectively,
he noted, the companies involved in this year's 10 largest European
mergers have underperformed the overall European stock market by
about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bankers Trust deal is expected to draw attention to several
lawsuits in the United States against the German bank over issues
of slave labor during World War II. Though Deutsche Bank did not
itself employ slave labor, it has been named along with industrial
giants like Siemens and Daimler-Benz. Lawsuits against Swiss banks
over wealth plundered by the Nazis led to a $1.25 billion
settlement last summer, largely because New York state regulators
insisted on an agreement before allowing the merged bank to operate
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi is considering filing a
lawsuit seeking to block the deal because of Holocaust issues,
people who have been briefed on the plans said Monday. Hevesi's
office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is subject to approval by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, but that is not expected to be a major obstacle. Deutsche
Bank does own a 12 percent stake in DaimlerChrysler, and while
common in Germany, ownership in industrial companies is prohibited
under U.S. banking laws. But Deutsche Bank, which said last week
that it was not planning to sell its stake, has an exemption to
this prohibition under legislation passed by Congress in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's desire for a big American institution has been
no secret. The bank's dominance at home has been eroded by
increasing competition, and big Wall Street investment banks like
Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs have been winning lucrative work
advising big European companies on mergers and acquisitions.
Deutsche Bank, which had been courting Bankers Trust since the
summer, is believed to have also actively looked at possible deals
with J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse Group, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust would give Deutsche Bank a middle-rank investment
banking firm. A subsidiary, BT Alex. Brown, continues to have a
strong franchise in bringing younger companies public, and Bankers
Trust itself has a sizable business in underwriting high-yield junk
bonds. Though junk bonds are still scarce in Europe, they are
attracting new interest as more companies undergo management
buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have a substantial business in trading
fixed-income securities, one of the few areas in investment banking
where Deutsche Bank has had real success. And both companies have a
big business in the obscure but lucrative area of custodial
services, the service of acting as a guardian for securities.
</P>
<P>
   But the takeover of Bankers Trust will not catapult Deutsche
Bank into the top ranks of American investment banks, a goal Breuer
has long had in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Breuer contended Monday that Bankers Trust was
Deutsche Bank's ideal partner. The combined company would become
the fourth-biggest money manager in the world, after UBS; Fidelity
Investments, the American mutual fund giant, and the Japanese
postal system's life insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many analysts Monday, Breuer insisted that he
had never wanted to take over a top Wall Street firm and disputed
widespread speculation that Deutsche Bank had settled on Bankers
Trust simply because it was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a response of the fox to sour grapes,'' Breuer
said, adding that his bank had ``never looked'' at so-called
``bulge-bracket'' investment banks at the top ranks of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulge-bracket banks are not universal banks like we are,''
he said. ``Deutsche bank would have in the end had to become a
completely different kind of bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will force Deutsche Bank to raise new capital to
shore up its balance sheet. That is because the $10.1 billion
purchase price for Bankers Trust is far higher than its tangible
value, which is about $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer said the bank would organize a new stock offering of 4
billion marks ($2.35 billion). Without elaborating, he said the
bank would raise additional money by issuing ``hybrid'' securities,
like convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now look forward to this next truly major step,'' said
Newman, who engineered much of Bankers Trust's expansion by
orchestrating the acquisition of Alex. Brown and other firms. ``I
don't speak German, at least not yet,'' Newman told a news
conference here Monday morning. ``I will take lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the organizational lineup leaves little doubt that Deutsche
Bank executives will be in charge. Breuer placed himself in charge
of the five-person ``transition team,'' and Newman is the only
person from Bankers Trust included.
</P>
<P>
   Though Breuer said he had no interest in additional American
acquisitions, he is still on the prowl in Europe. The bank has long
wanted to build a position in France, but the French government
remains hostile to foreign banks' acquiring French institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expansion in Europe is still in the offing,'' Breuer said.
Despite the $10 billion being paid for Bankers Trust, he added,
money would not be a problem. ``Our shareholders, if the story is
right, will be more than ready to furnish more money.''

CLOSING ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN CASE OF FORMER CABINET SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mike Espy, a former congressman and agriculture
secretary once thought to be a rising political star, spent his
45th birthday Monday in a federal courthouse hearing himself
denounced by prosecutors as a corrupt official and praised by
defense lawyers as a dedicated public servant.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments before the case went to the jury, Donald
Smaltz, an independent counsel, sought to portray Espy as
thoroughly insensitive to ethics laws and regulations, someone who
eagerly accepted gifts from companies and lobbyists who had
business before the Department of Agriculture. Espy led the
department in President Clinton's first term until he was forced to
resign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing two months of testimony, Smaltz told the jury that
Espy was especially fond of major sporting events and thought
nothing of seeking hard-to-get tickets for professional football
and basketball games and tennis matches from companies that had
vital business with the department.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Wells, Espy's attorney, told the jury that Espy had
committed no crimes and that the items he received were gifts from
friends. Such gifts are explicitly allowed under federal law. Wells
said the prosecution did not and could not present any evidence
that Espy made any decisions based on gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to work in the morning and he treated everyone
fairly,'' Wells said. ``And he made his decisions on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells sought to portray Smaltz and the staff of the independent
counsel as a gang of bullies who sought to concoct a case out of
small matters. In fact, much of the trial has dealt with the wisdom
and effectiveness of the law that allows for the appointment of
independent counsels to investigate accusations of wrongdoing by
senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz's four-year $17 million investigation of Espy's conduct
has been hotly debated by opponents and supporters of the law,
which expires in June but can be renewed. The Espy investigation
has received a level of scrutiny second only to that given the
investigation of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who has
reported to Congress that the president may have committed
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Espy is charged with taking about $35,000 in illegal gifts,
lying about it and trying to get a friend to cover for him. Last
week a federal judge dismissed eight of the 39 counts against him
and part of a ninth. If convicted on the most serious charges,
violating the federal meat inspection law, Espy faces a minimum of
three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz's summation was halting and uneven; he jumped around
among many of the 30 remaining counts in the indictment. The
complexity of the case made it difficult to follow which contractor
had offered Espy tickets to which sporting event and which law
might have been broken.
</P>
<P>
   As Smaltz spoke, Espy glanced at a Bible in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of race has been near the surface from the beginning
of the trial. Espy's lawyers sought to press the idea that he
attached little importance to such secondary matters as game
tickets because he was preoccupied with running the Agriculture
Department. The job was made especially difficult, the lawyers
argued, because his staff resisted new ideas presented by the first
African-American agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the jury of 10 blacks and two whites, Smaltz, who is
white, implored them to decide the case ``on facts, not politics or
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who practices in New Jersey, offered a passionate
oration, adopting a down-home flavor by sprinkling his argument
with ``y'all'' and dropping his `g's' at the ends of words.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been a bunch of garbage,'' said Wells, who is
black. ``Just garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells disputed each of the charges, saying, for example, that
when a lobbyist gave Espy $4,400 worth of tickets to the U.S. Open
Tennis Tournament, Espy was told the tickets were free.
</P>
<P>
   When another lobbyist paid $3,200 to Espy's girlfriend so she
could accompany him to Greece, Wells said, the money represented
the winnings of a bet between the girlfriend and the lobbyist.
Espy, he said, had no knowledge of the money paid to the
girlfriend. And when a lobbyist gave Espy a set of new luggage,
Wells said, it was because Espy had come to an event with a
broken-down duffel bag. In none of those instances, Wells said, did
Espy know that the lobbyists had billed the expenses to their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators have said that the conduct Espy is accused of
demonstrates that when he became a Cabinet officer in 1993 after
serving six years in the House, he brought with him a notion of
ethical behavior more typical of Congress: that it is customary if
not acceptable to trade a few favors.
</P>
<P>
   That view was reinforced during the trial when Carol Browner,
the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified about a
conversation she had with Espy early in the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner said Espy told her he thought the stringent ethics
code of the executive branch was ``a bunch of junk'' and that he
would continue to behave as he had done in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Espy did not take the stand. In fact, the defense put on no
witnesses. The prosecution presented 70 witnesses over two months.

NEWS FROM LANA MARKS  
 THE PRINCESS PLAID  
 `THOMAS CROWN COUP' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Colo., Nev., Texas, Ill., Mass., Calif.)  (af) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lana Marks is building a small empire based on her
sumptuous handbags cast in glossy reptile skins or bright, smooth
leathers.
</P>
<P>
   This week she will introduce ready-to-wear and shoe collections
in her two stores, one at 645 Madison Ave. (60th Street) in New
York and the other in Palm Beach, Fla., where she has her offices.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, six new Lana Marks stores will be opened. A
boutique at 211 South Galena Street in Aspen, Colo., is scheduled
to open in mid-December; in January, Ms. Marks plans to open a
store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, and later in the year, two
stores in Las Vegas, one in Houston and one in Bal Harbour, Fla.
All will carry the ready-to-wear collection except one of the Las
Vegas stores.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marks' handbags are sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue,
but for fall and spring the clothing and shoes will be sold only in
her stores. She will offer them at wholesale beginning with the
fall 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department stores can give us only 100 or 200 square
feet,'' Ms. Marks said. ``In our own store we can do 2,000 square
feet and present the entire line.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoes and handbags are enjoying a run of popularity in fashion,
and price seems to be of little concern. Ms. Marks' bags are priced
from about $800 to $12,000. ``People want style and fashion,'' she
said, ``but they want beautifully made handbags.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shoe collection, a simple sandal will cost around $400,
but most high-heel pumps and moccasins will be priced at $1,000 to
$2,000. Like her handbags, the shoes will emphasize exotic skins
like ostrich.
</P>
<P>
   In the ready-to-wear collection, ``I'm keeping the prices below
$2,000,'' Ms. Marks said without a trace of irony. Asked if that
was an attractive price for most customers, she said, ``For what
I'm doing, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, her fur-trimmed suits and cocktail dresses will not
be for everyone but for the kind of woman who still wears a suit on
an airplane. Ms. Marks has done well selling exclusivity. ``They're
to wear to lunches, to wear traveling,'' she said. &QL;
</P>

<P>
   Burberrys is selling a special tartan created to memorialize
Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The tartan may seem a little less cynical than some of the many
Diana promotions, since the royal family, including the Princess,
Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth have all worn the traditional
Burberry plaid on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Diana tartan, a blend of pale blue with navy, black and red
stripes, will be in Burberrys stores starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern, created by LochCarron, a tartan manufacturer based
in Scotland, will be sold in the United States only through
Burberrys.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $95 for a mohair stole to $195 for a muffler
to $325 for a cashmere throw. They will be available at Burberrys
stores in New York, Chicago, Boston, Washington, San Francisco and
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sales will go to the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund, a spokeswoman for Burberrys said, though she would
not specify how great a portion.
</P>

   Turnbull &AMP; Asser, the venerable men's clothier, will supply
Pierce Brosnan's shirts and ties in the remake of ``The Thomas
Crown Affair.'' And Michael Kors is dressing Rene Russo in Celine
and his own collection.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a coup for them both. The original movie, starring
Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, is one of the most stylish films of
all time, highly rated by designers and stylists.
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett did two collections recently, one under his own
name and one for Byblos, which he said were inspired by the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbull &AMP; Asser will have a difficult job ahead of it to
compete with McQueen's suave but tough turtlenecks, and smartly
tailored suits and sports jackets, not to mention Ms. Dunaway's
over-the-moon high-fashion insurance investigator.

AIDS IS REVERSING HEALTH GAINS IN POOR NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The explosion in the world's poorest countries
of AIDS, or of infection with the virus that causes it, is turning
back half a century of progress in making life healthier for
children, the director of the U.N. children's fund says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications are quite extraordinary,'' said Carol
Bellamy, executive director of the agency, UNICEF. ``In 23
countries, largely in sub-Saharan Africa, we already see HIV-AIDS
virtually reversing the gains that have been made in child
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``More children are dying and they're dying sooner, even though
your immunization programs might be more successful,'' she said.
``The fact is that improvements that were being made are being
reversed. Not just stalled. Reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   What U.N. experts now call an AIDS pandemic, coupled with the
increasing vulnerability of millions of families to the disruption
and violence of civil wars, is forcing agencies dealing with
children to rethink priorities and to introduce new programs,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pandemic is hitting most harshly, at this point, in
southern Africa and eastern Africa,'' Ms. Bellamy said last week
before leaving for a news conference in London, in advance of U.N.
AIDS Day on Tuesday. In London, new AIDS figures were made public
by the World Health Organization and the joint program called
U.N.AIDS, in which UNICEF takes part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Botswana, for example, is losing 20 years in life expectancy
in just abut a five-year period of time,'' Ms. Bellamy said. ``It's
not a country in conflict, or a country at war. It's stable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, AIDS experts announced that the number
of cases worldwide of people living with the human immunodeficiency
virus, which causes AIDS, had grown by 10 percent in a year, to
33.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   For UNICEF, the AIDS crisis poses a range of problems. The
number of orphans is soaring, Ms. Bellamy said. ``It is expected to
grow _ and these are guestimates _ to 40 million by the year
2020.''
</P>
<P>
   In eight sub-Saharan countries, more than 25 percent of children
under 15 have already lost at least one parent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   These children are more likely than others to drop out of school
and are less likely to be brought to clinics for vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the least developed countries, much of the work of
development organizations is premised on there being a primary care
giver,'' Ms. Bellamy said. ``The immunization system assumes that a
mother _ as sick as she may be and no matter how many other kids
she has _ will take the child to be immunized.''
</P>
<P>
   Because AIDS strikes hardest at the 10-to-24 age group, UNICEF,
which is identified mostly with programs for early childhood, will
have to concentrate more on adolescent sex education, she said,
something that is not always a popular cause among donors. ``In
contrast to five years ago, we find ourselves in parts of the world
more involved with adolescents than we have been in the past,'' Ms.
Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of transmission of the AIDS virus from mother to child
is also forcing UNICEF to modify, to some extent, its strong
preference for breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not reopening the discussion about breast-feeding being
the best thing you can do for your child _ except, yes, you
specifically open it around the subject of mother-to-child
transmission,'' Ms. Bellamy said. ``In fact, we are very actively
engaged with U.N.AIDS and with others in programs for women,
negotiating with the baby food companies for contributions of
generic materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bellamy said that because half of the 7,000 new cases daily
are among young people, the best hope of stopping the rapid spread
of the disease lies in creating intensive education programs and in
encouraging peer-group projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one ray of hope,'' she said. ``The future does lie in
adolescents' hands and if there could be more effort, really very
concentrated advocacy, information and services programs focused on
adolescents, there is some potential for getting control of this
pandemic.''

 Medtronic Buys Arterial for $3.7 Billion  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Arterial Vascular Engineering of Santa Rosa said yesterday it has
agreed to be acquired by medical technology giant Medtronic Inc. in
a stock swap valued at $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would give Medtronic of Minneapolis, already a leader
in the pacemaker market, AVE's technology for using angioplasty and
stents to treat heart disease without open heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Angioplasty is the process of reaming out the plaque that can
restrict blood flow to the heart. Stents are wire-mesh tubes that
are inserted into arteries after angioplasty to keep the blood
vessels from collapsing, as they often do if doctors perform
angioplasty alone.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Kurt Kruger follows the $2 billion worldwide stent
market for NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. He said yesterday's
merger _ Medtronic's fifth acquisition since July _ gives it a
stent product line to rival its two top competitors, Guidant Corp.
of Indianapolis and Boston Scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medtronic had a strong business in the electrical side of
heart treatments with its pacemakers,'' Kruger said. ``But without
AVE, it had a very weak offering in the stent market.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanjiv Arora, who follows the medical devices market for Dain
Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis, said the deal also made sense for
AVE, which has a 36 percent share of the stent market.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this leading position, Arora said AVE would have had a
harder time as a stand-alone company in the future, competing with
Guidant and Boston Scientific, which have 29 and 22 percent
respectively, of the stent market.
</P>
<P>
   AVE specializes in stents, while its main competitors had
broader product lines. ``The market is starting to move to bundling
of a wide range of products to hospitals,'' Arora said. ``Medtronic
needed stents as part of its mix, and AVE needed the devices
Medtronic sells.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, said the deal's $54 per share price tag represented a
``substantial premium'' for AVE, which had been trading in the
mid-30s before the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Assuming the merger receives shareholder and regulatory
approval, it will end a bold solo run by AVE, which was founded in
1991 by medical engineer Brad Jendersee and accountant John Miller.
AVE introduced its first stent in 1994, challenging market pioneer
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   AVE went public in 1996 at $21 a share and became a hit in
hospitals as well as on Wall Street. In fiscal 1998, it earned
$115.1 million on sales of $387.6 million. It employs about 4,000
people worldwide. About 2,000 work at a new campus in Santa Rosa,
making AVE one of the city's largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic chief executive William George said yesterday he
expects only minimal layoffs as a result of merging the two
companies' sales forces. Overall, he expects to add employees in
Santa Rosa as the stent business expands. AVE chief executive Scott
Solano, who used to be a vice president at Medtronic, will run the
stent businesses of the combined companies.
</P>
<P>
   AVE's shares skyrocketed $16.50 yesterday to close at $48.88.
Medtronic lost $2.28 to end the day at $67.63.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, AVE shareholders will get $54 worth
of Medtronic stock for every AVE share they own _ provided
Medtronic stays between $61.20 and $74.80. If Medtronic stock falls
below this range, AVE shareholders would get .88 shares of
Medtronic for every AVE share.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if Medtronic rises above this range, AVE
shareholders will get .722 shares of Medtronic for each of their
AVE shares.

 Will Chevron Join the Other Oil Giants in the Mating Dance?  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Will Chevron be a buyer or a seller?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it will be one or the other. Because if the second-tier
energy titan were to attempt to go it alone, it would probably take
itself out of the game. The current slide in crude oil prices has
been so relentless that it is forcing the oil industry to slash
costs by combining operations, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   New and more efficient energy exploration technologies and the
flawed policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries have caused a massive glut, sending oil prices into a
downward spiral. And while some eternal optimists were hoping that
crude might actually rise to hit $18 a barrel this year (no, I
don't know what they were smoking), the price has plummeted to its
current trough of $11.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, supply is exceeding demand, and the competitive landscape
of big oil is undergoing rapid change. However, so far, San
Francisco's Chevron appears unwilling to attend the industrywide
mating dance while its biggest competitors have already agreed to
go home with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by Exxon's plans to marry Mobil _ the second proposed
merger of this sector behind British Petroleum's acquisition of
Amoco _ Chevron shares soared about $5 on Friday to close at
$85.625. Yesterday, Chevron shares slipped $2 on a dour day for the
Dow, closing at $83.625.
</P>
<P>
   For stockpickers, Chevron's fate is tough to call. Yet for those
investors who are willing to bet that the Northern California oil
giant is ripe for a takeover, the spoils could be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the good fortune of Mobil shareholders, who have seen
their holdings rise 39 percent from the company's low in August.
Meantime, Amoco shares have risen as much as 52 percent from their
52-week low in July.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, being acquired might just provide Chevron with its
best chance of succeeding in the new world order of ``super-major''
oil corporations. The reason: If it acquires smaller companies, it
would still be too small to compete with the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, senior analyst Fadel Gheit of Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in
New York thinks that the behemoths which have already announced
deals aren't done with their holiday shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the dust settles with these two mergers (led by BP and
Exxon), we'll see yet another one,'' Gheit says.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the energy patch has just begun, he says, and
don't be surprised if British Petroleum and Exxon go out and buy
more companies _ providing, of course, that Uncle Sam gives its
blessings to pending deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon isn't done. They do not see (their proposed merger with
Mobil) as the end game,'' Gheit says.
</P>
<P>
   So, who's left?
</P>
<P>
   Texaco and Arco are the next largest U.S. oil companies behind
Chevron that are likely to get devoured by the new breed of
super-majors, Gheit says. (Talks to combine certain European
operations between Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco broke down
yesterday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Arco, probably, in a few months will be the next to go,'' he
says. And Chevron?
</P>
<P>
   ``Likely, we are going to see Chevron go to the British
Petroleum (Amoco) camp,'' Gheit suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chevron could join forces with Texaco or Arco, but a
merger with either second-tier company would not give Chevron
enough bulk to keep pace with BP-Amoco or Exxon-Mobil, Gheit says.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Chevron-Texaco combination would make a nice fit, he
acknowledges, because the two companies are already joint-venture
partners in an exploration company.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the worst course of action for Chevron would be to
take no action at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Arco, Chevron and Texaco prefer to remain independent,
that's fine,'' Gheit says.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) their stocks will get hammered.''

 Clinton Outlines Internet Growth Strategy  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
President Clinton yesterday announced steps to accelerate growth of
the Internet and electronic commerce as vital cogs of the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must give consumers the same protection in our virtual mall
they now get at the shopping mall,'' Clinton said at a White House
press conference touting an administration report on Net issues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The long-awaited paper supports staunch consumer protection,
faster Net connections and privacy rights _ but through
self-policing by industries rather than government-mandated laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-regulation in the digital age will require the private
sector to engage in much greater collective action to set and
enforce rules than was characteristic of the Industrial Age,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore will direct
the Commerce Department to work with the Federal Communications
Commission to design incentives for private companies to build
high-speed &UR;  &LR; Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also will direct the Small Business
Administration to help U.S. companies connect to the Web and press
the World Bank and private companies to fund Internet projects in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton called for a crackdown on Internet fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about privacy and fraud have kept millions of customers
from shopping online, and the United States must do more ``to
develop new approaches to protect privacy in cyberspace,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Despite some consumer reticence, the number of online users
worldwide has more than doubled to 140 million in the last 18
months, and technology companies account for a third of the
nation's annual economic growth, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers estimate that Internet-related sales could
surge to $1.5 trillion in 2003 from $10 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep this momentum going,'' Clinton told a group of
lawmakers and industry executives, including officials from eBay
and Cisco Systems. ``I think the Internet has an enormous role to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Faster Internet connections are considered key to the success of
e-commerce. About 40 percent of U.S. homes with computers will use
the Internet to do part or all of their holiday shopping, up from
10 percent last year, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``for many consumers and businesses, the World Wide Web has
become the World Wide Wait,'' said a White House statement. ``The
information superhighway becomes a dirt path before it reaches
America's homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour White House event amounted to a ``going away''
party for presidential Internet adviser Ira Magaziner, said one
attendee. Magaziner _ who crafted the Internet white paper as well
as the administration's ill-fated health-care reform plan _ is
scheduled to leave his position in January.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a champion of the administration's high-tech measures,
will oversee future White House Internet programs.
</P>
<P>
   The &UR;  &LR; government document is sketchy on details, prompting the
White House to ask various agencies to develop specific plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electronic commerce initiative is a work in progress,''
said Jerry Berman, executive director for the Center for Democracy
and Technology in Washington, D.C. ``Ira did a terrific job putting
it together, and judging by the turnout, he has done a good job of
publicizing its importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups, meanwhile, contend that industry
self-regulation does not work and laws are necessary to safeguard
consumer interests and personal data in the fast-paced Internet
market. Without legislation, they warn, the United States will open
itself to a trade war with Europe, where self-regulation has been
declared incompatible with laws guaranteeing strong privacy
protections for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Others accused the government of ``punting'' on the
controversial topic of encryption, which imposes strict export
controls on data-scrambling technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``By ignoring it, the administration leaves future e-commerce in
limbo,'' said Stanton McCandlish, program director at the
Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco. ``You can't
advance technology into the 21st century with Cold War policies
still in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner's report comes on the heels of a raft of
Internet-friendly legislation in the United States over the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress passed and Clinton signed into law a
three-year ban on new Internet taxes and extended copyright
protections to cyberspace. Internationally, the administration
persuaded the World Trade Organization to adopt a one-year ban on
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Magaziner brokered an agreement with a new
nonprofit organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers, that will oversee the handling of Web addresses such
as .com, .net and .gov. Previously, the government contracted with
Network Solutions, a private Herndon, Va., company, to dispense
domain names.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE MECCA, THE TEMPLE AND KINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In front of the lowered scoreboard with ``Holyfield''
and ``Lewis'' in lights, the Madison Square Garden boxing ring was
set up about where the Eighth Avenue basket would be if the Knicks
had a game. One by one, Evander Holyfield, in a black suit, and
Lennox Lewis, in a tan suit, appeared in a spray of fireworks,
leaned through the burgundy velvet ropes and now stood side by side
in the ring, their arms crossed defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   When the gladiators were introduced to maybe 300 assembled
notebooks, microphones, cameras and various celebrities of
cafeteria society who had stopped by for the free lunch of
sandwiches and salads, a larger spray of fireworks suddenly lighted
the darkened arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare moment Monday, one of the few when the cackling
voice of Don King, who modestly describes himself as ``the world's
greatest promoter,'' belonged surely to the world's loudest
promoter. He was in full cry to announce that Holyfield and Lewis
would return to the Garden ring on March 13 to unify the three
world heavyweight titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Garden is the mecca and we are sitting in the temple of
the mecca,'' King intoned. ``And in the temple, we must be
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he was honest, describing himself as ``coming off the
mat from the Seventh District of New York,'' a reference to his
acquittal in Federal court last summer on charges of insurance
fraud. But he left himself open to be indicted for marquee fraud.
``This is going to be a fight,'' King screeched, ``of the ilk of
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly, but it is the Garden's biggest fight since Frazier
flattened Ali in earning a unanimous 15-round decision on March 8,
1971. Ringside tickets that night were an unprecedented $150, with
each fighter collecting a flat $2.5 million. This time the top
Garden ticket will be $1,500, the cheapest $100. Holyfield is
assured $20 million, Lewis $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the Garden, which has put up more than $8 million, a sellout
of 20,000 would add up to ``north of $10 million,'' said Dave
Checketts, the Garden president.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no assurance of a Garden sellout, not with that
ticket scale and not with TVKO pay-per-view available. So Monday's
soiree turned into more of a big sell than a big debate over who
would win: Holyfield, who holds the World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation belts, or Lewis, the World Boxing
Council champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight will be called `Kings' Crowning Glory,''' King
blared.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, he meant ``Kings''' as in the two heavyweight kings.
But if anybody wants to spell it ``King's,'' he won't ask for a
correction.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Lewis' English heritage, King even invoked Paul
Revere. ``Up in arms! Up in arms! The British are coming!'' he
shouted. ``Get your tickets now because this is going to be an
American experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more King talked Monday, the more it sounded like a
business experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will sell the Garden out,'' King barked. ``We will do two
million pay-per-view buys.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``we,'' King meant Don King Promotions, Panix Promotions,
Home Box Office (which owns TVKO) and Cablevision (which owns the
Garden). Among those on the dais was Charles F. Dolan, the
Cablevision impresario who, in his brief remarks, mentioned that
King is from Cleveland. So, of course, is a certain Yankee
principal owner whose deal with Dolan is snagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have noticed,'' Dolan said, ``that negotiations with sports
promoters from Cleveland can require a lot of endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Just listening to King introduce everybody but the hot-dog
vendors outside the Garden can require even more endurance. And
after he hogged the microphone for about 90 minutes, the gladiators
got to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be stepping out of the ring,'' the 33-year-old Lewis
said, his dreadlocks dangling, ``with all three belts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you now,'' the 36-year-old Holyfield said, his bald
head glistening, ``I will be the undisputed champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Not merely undisputed, as King said, ``but also unmitigated and
undeniable.'' But not necessarily unmotivated. For more than a year
Holyfield has been saying that if he unified the title, he would
retire from boxing. But when he was asked about that Monday, he
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to retire yet,'' he said. Yes, in the temple, we
must be honest. &QL;

 IRS Likely Won't Treat Day Trading As Business  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Can I get any deductions or write-offs to offset my
capital-gains tax from stock trades? If I have a $1,000 gain on a
stock and paid a total of $100 in commissions to buy and sell it,
can the $100 be deducted from the gain? Also, are day traders
allowed to deduct the costs of home-office space, computers and
telephones from their income?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The good news is that yes, you can reduce your taxable
capital gains by the amount you pay in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that you probably can't persuade the Internal
Revenue Service to let you deduct office space and the rest. You
might want to try something easier, like playing hoops one-on-one
against Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   To claim an office deduction, you must surmount two major
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   First, you must prove that stock trading is your business.
</P>
<P>
   Second, you must demonstrate that your office space, telephone
and computer are used exclusively for that business. If your kid
and his friends occasionally wander into the room to play Riven on
your PC, that could blow it for you.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry too much about your kid and his friends, because
you probably won't get past the first hurdle. Hardly anyone does.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that there is no law or regulation establishing
the parameters. It is up to the IRS to decide whether trading is
your business. Even if you trade all day, every day and generate
enormous volume, the IRS may rule that you are an addicted
hobbyist, not a businessman, and therefore don't qualify for
special tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
   IRS spokesman Jesse Weller says it might help if you can
demonstrate that trading is your only occupation, that you have
received professional training to operate a trading business and
that your trading has been profitable in at least three of the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Day Care Dilemma
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to decide between putting money in a day care
reimbursement program offered by my employer or using the federal
child care tax credit. I have two children, and if I choose my
employer's program I would set aside $4,000 per year in tax-exempt
dollars to be spent on day care. Which program makes more sense?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: The child care tax credit is ``mainly intended for
low-income wage earners,'' notes Ali Farhat, an accountant with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in San Francisco. It has little if any value
for people in the middle and upper income brackets.
</P>
<P>
   The credit is subtracted directly from your federal taxes, but
not your state taxes. Depending on your income, you can claim a
credit ranging from 20 percent to 30 percent of your child care
expenses _ up to an expense limit of $2,400 for one child and
$4,800 for two or more children.
</P>
<P>
   If your adjusted gross income is less than $10,000, you can
deduct 30 percent. The deduction phases down by one percentage
point for every additional $2,000 of income. If your income is
greater than $28,000, you can claim only a 20 percent credit.
</P>
<P>
   With the day care reimbursement program, federal regulations let
you put up to $5,000 per year into an escrow account and withdraw
the money as you need it to pay for the care. The money you place
in the account is exempt from federal and state taxes. However, any
money you set aside and don't use will be forfeited, so take care
in estimating your day care needs.
</P>
<P>
   Some simple math will help you decide whether the child care tax
credit or the day care reimbursement program works best for you.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that you and your spouse file a joint tax return and
that your taxable income totals $45,000. Your maximum child care
tax credit for the two kids would be $960 _ 20 percent of $4,800.
Your federal taxes would be reduced by that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Next, calculate the federal and state tax savings you will get
by setting aside $4,000 tax-exempt dollars in a day care
reimbursement program.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in your bracket would be effectively taxed at a combined
32.3 percent federal/ state rate _ allowing for the fact that state
taxes are deductible from federal income. Multiply $4,000 by 0.323
and you get $1,292 _ your tax saving from the day care
reimbursement program. That beats the child care tax credit by a
cool $332.
</P>
<P>
   People in lower tax brackets might find that the child care
credit is better. Everyone should do the math before choosing.
</P>
<P>
   A cautionary note: Before this year, taxpayers could lose all or
part of their child care credit if they were subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Just before adjournment, Congress
eliminated that rule for the 1998 tax year only. In the next
session, it will consider eliminating it permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Name Change
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I add my wife's name to my brokerage account as a joint
owner, does this create a tax event for either of us?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: No. Merely adding a name to an account does not produce a
tax liability. You won't have to pay a gift tax, and she won't have
to pay income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   However, if your wife withdraws more than $10,000 from the
account in a single year, you will have to file a federal gift-tax
report. Even so, you won't have to actually pay the tax if she is a
U.S. citizen. Any gifts you give a citizen spouse, no matter how
large, are tax-exempt. The tax filing is a bureaucratic formality.
</P>
<P>
   If your wife is not a U.S. citizen, you might have to pay a gift
tax, says IRS spokesman Larry Wright. If your noncitizen wife
withdraws more than $100,000 in a single year, the excess is
subtracted from a $625,000 lifetime exclusion. Once that $625,000
exclusion is used up, you will have to pay gift tax on any further
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you put her name on your account today and she withdraws
$900,000 before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The first $100,000 doesn't create a tax liability, but the
remaining $800,000 does. You have to pay gift tax for the year on
$175,000 ($800,000 minus $625,000). Any further withdrawals in
later years will be fully taxable.

 New BofA Confronts Critics at State Hearing  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The new BankAmerica Corp. faced a parade of critics at a San
Francisco public hearing yesterday who warned the bank to keep its
promises to California communities.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Louis Papan described the meeting of his California
Assembly Banking and Finance Committee as an ``informational''
investigation to determine whether North Carolina's NationsBank
Corp. is following through on its commitments to be a good
corporate citizen two months after buying San Francisco's
BankAmerica and taking its name.
</P>
<P>
   But, with San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and more than a dozen
other witnesses attacking the new BofA's brief record in the state,
the hearing seemed more an exercise to serve notice on the bank:
Increase your investments in California communities or face the
wrath of activists and political leaders in your biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned this group of strangers would do violence''
to the community programs of the old BofA, Brown said. Now ''we are
more than concerned _ we are becoming alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses were pointed about what could happen if the new
BofA cuts the flow of funds to California communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we get answers,'' it might be ``time for communities to
be rethinking their investments in BofA,'' said San Francisco
Supervisor Michael Yaki.
</P>
<P>
   Papan described the deposit and contract business of state and
local governments as ``the biggest ax we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown was skeptical of such moves. ``I don't know of
anything the city can or should do except have its voice heard,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their statements, BofA officials were quick to take up the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In community development lending, no institution even comes
close to the new Bank of America,'' declared Eugene Taylor, the
NationsBank executive tapped to run the western region of the
combined bank.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor noted that the bank promised to earmark $350 million
nationwide for purposes such as affordable housing and economic
development. And he said the bank would raise its charitable giving
in California from about $11 million this year to $18 million next
year, if its income grows according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing took place against a backdrop of bad blood between
the new bank and the California activist groups that pressure
financial institutions to put money into low-income and minority
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The old BofA was widely regarded as a leader in community
investment. In 1997, following extensive talks with activists, it
set aside $140 billion for local development initiatives over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   After NationsBank agreed to buy BofA, community groups were
angered when the North Carolina bank refused to commit to specific
California lending goals or negotiate community investment plans
like those signed by Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of a specific commitment to California is a very
negative sign,'' said Alan Fisher, executive director of the
California Reinvestment Committee, a coalition of 190 nonprofit
groups and public agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Relations deteriorated further after the new bank booted out
former BofA Chairman and chief executive David Coulter and top
community development officials of the old BofA, putting its own
people in key jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Coulter's recent departure has lead to concerns that the
new BankAmerica will not honor its other commitments,'' Papan said
in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Heated exchanges at the hearing reflected those tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about Mr. Taylor's role,'' said Robert Gnaizda, an
official of San Francisco's Greenlining Institute, about BofA's
senior representative at the meeting. ``He was there at the time
they decimated Barnett Bank,'' he said about Taylor's role
absorbing the Florida bank.
</P>
<P>
   Shot Taylor in response to other Gnaizda barbs: ``I can't argue
with a man who has his facts wrong.''

 Get the 411 on 10-10 Calls  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The pitches sound so seductive _ win $1 million by dialing
10-10-345, save 50 percent over your regular long-distance carrier
with 10-10-321, call anywhere in the state for 5 cents a minute
using 10-10-811.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the talking dogs and celebrity hucksters peddling
those great deals is a lot of fine print.
</P>
<P>
   Read it and you'll see that the 10-10 phone numbers hawked by
Tony Danza, John Lithgow and Sugar Ray Leonard can actually make
your phone bills go up, not down.
</P>
<P>
   That's because many of these so-called dial-around services have
hidden surcharges, monthly fees and minimum talk times. And many of
the 10-10 numbers compare their rates to the highest rates around,
which most people don't pay.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who use dial-around numbers wind up paying higher
rates than if they had used a discount plan offered by their
regular long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The concealed costs have surprised many consumers, who expected
to see huge savings on their long-distance bills. Federal and state
regulators say the number of people filing complaints about 10-10
numbers is on the rise and caution consumers not to choose a
long-distance phone company based on glitzy ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some customers out there who dialed 10-10 and got
more than they bargained for,'' said Linda Woods, manager of the
California Public Utilities Commission's consumer affairs branch.
Woods said the CPUC has gotten complaints, mostly from people who
didn't read the fine print before placing a call.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be misled by the ads, Woods said, because they make
long-distance calls sound so cheap.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cable &AMP; Wireless says consumers can save big by
paying only 9 cents a minute with 10-10-566. What the company
doesn't tout is the $4.95 monthly fee consumers pay for using the
service _ even if they only make one call.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Ray Leonard says the DimeLine is a knockout at 10 cents
per minute. But the dial-around has a three-minute minimum, so even
a one-minute call costs 30 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade
Commission are both conducting informal investigations into whether
the ads are false or misleading, according to the FCC and a New
York state legislator involved in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   If the regulators find the ads are misleading, they could fine
the companies or order them to change the wording.
</P>
<P>
   There are some cases where 10-10 numbers are a better deal, but
it's not easy to say when.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some dial-arounds out there that offer very
competitive rates, and some don't have hidden fees and talking
minimums,'' said Becky Sachs, a spokeswoman for the
Telecommunications Research and Action Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said Excel's 10-10-297 is one of the better ones because
it has no minimum talk time. Excel charges between 9 cents and 15
cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the controversy surrounding dial-arounds, they have
proven extremely popular among the telephoning public. There are
almost a dozen 10-10 numbers out there, and industry watchers say
the dial-around market will be worth $3 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of Services
</P>
<P>
   The concept isn't new. The first dial-arounds appeared more than
15 years ago, when consumers who wanted a company other than AT&AMP;T
for their long-distance service had to dial a code to reach another
provider. The past few years have seen an explosion in 10-10
numbers, as consumers have gotten used to competition and become
more price conscious about phone service, according to industry
watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Even having to dial two extra digits hasn't curbed the public's
appetite for dial-arounds. Earlier this year, the FCC began
requiring the companies to add an extra 10 to their codes _ 10-321,
for example, became 10-10-321 _ in order to make sure there are
enough dial-around numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say one reason the services are so popular is
because people don't realize the rates are high. The ads make the
10-10 numbers sound like great discounts, and many people never
check their phone bill to see how much they were actually charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads really border on being deceptive,'' said Ken
McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action in San Francisco.
``The truth is, people could probably get a better deal with their
standard service than with a dial-around.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry calls these services dial-arounds because a
customer dials a special access code, which routes the call around
their long-distance carrier and onto a different phone network. The
name of the dial-around company and the charges are included on the
customer's next phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   Big Names Behind the 10-10s
</P>
<P>
   What's confusing about the dial-arounds, say regulators, is
determining the companies behind them. Most dial-arounds are
actually controlled by the big phone giants.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Dog, or 10-10-345, for example, is an AT&AMP;T subsidiary, but
even consumers who scour the fine print of a Lucky Dog ad won't see
that. Two of the most popular dial-arounds, 10-10-321 and
10-10-220, are controlled by a company called Telecom USA, a
subsidiary of MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, customers who dial a 10-10 number unwittingly use
their own long-distance carrier _ and pay higher rates to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-10 companies say they cloak their parent companies
because consumers identify with a brand more than the company
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You identify with Skippy or Jif, rather than Procter &AMP; Gamble.
And you identify with Old Navy, but you don't necessarily know
that's the Gap,'' Siegel said. ``We wanted to have something that
would distinguish us.''
</P>
<P>
   The main targets for dial-arounds, according to MCI WorldCom,
are customers who aren't on a calling plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 10 percent to 40 percent of customers out there are
not on a calling plan,'' said Brad Burns, a spokesman for MCI
WorldCom. ``Either they thought they were on a calling plan or they
just weren't motivated enough to do it. We're looking for a way to
tap into those consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major long-distance companies offer discount calling
plans to customers who make a lot of long-distance calls. AT&AMP;T, for
example, offers rates of 5 cents and 10 cents per minute for
long-distance calls. And Sprint just recently began offering
unlimited long-distance calls on weekends for just $25 a month.
Some of these plans also have monthly fees.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; A Matter of Timing
</P>
<P>
   Sachs of TRAC said those plans guarantee customers certain rates
at certain times, regardless of the length of the call. With
dial-around numbers, the per-minute rate may depend on the length
of each call.
</P>
<P>
   ``10-10-321 is one of the more misleading ones in that it has a
20-minute talking minimum in order for a customer to get the
discounts that are advertised,'' Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   If a customer hangs up before the 20 minutes are over, it can
cost as much as 28 cents per minute _ one of the highest rates
charged by any long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows before you get on the phone how long a call is going
to last?'' Sachs said. ``Unless you know for a fact that you're
going to call someone who's definitely home and can definitely talk
for 20 minutes, you can wind up paying really high rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads also boast that customers can save 50 percent over
AT&AMP;T's basic rate by dialing 10-10-321. What they don't tell you is
that AT&AMP;T's basic rate is among the highest in the industry and
that hardly anyone pays that rate, Sachs said. The majority of
people are on a discount calling plan, which has significantly
lower per-minute prices.
</P>
<P>
   Burns of MCI WorldCom said 10-10-321 does save people money if
they talk for more than 20 minutes. A 25-minute daytime call from
San Francisco to New York, for example, would cost $4.20 with
10-10-321.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T customer without a calling plan would pay $7 for the
same call. But someone with a calling plan might pay as little as
$2.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``If customers don't realize the savings that we promised them,
they're not going to use the service again,'' Burns said. ``Of the
consumers who use dial-around products, we've found that 88 percent
of them are very satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies also defend their rates and promotions, saying
dial-arounds wouldn't be so popular if people weren't getting a
good deal.
</P>
<P>
   Something for Everyone
</P>
<P>
   ``It may very well be that for lots of consumers, being on a
calling plan of some sort is the best thing for them,'' said Mark
Siegel, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T's consumer services. But some
consumers might do better with Lucky Dog, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many of these dial-arounds out there, and they
change their plans so frequently. In order to avoid getting ripped
off by one of these, we suggest consumers get on a calling plan,''
Sachs said. ``If they're on a calling plan, chances are they will
save as much if not more money than if they used a dial-around.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, state Assemblyman Scott Stringer plans to propose
legislation that would restrict what dial-arounds can claim in
their ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a famous actress telling you this is the buy of the
century, only then you dial and find out it's not such a great
deal,'' said Stringer, a Democrat. ``People are easily misled and
we need to simplify the way consumers gain information so they're
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Stringer said consumers should ``be careful,
price the services out, ask questions and find out if that's the
package for you. Don't watch a television commercial and then dial
10-10 because you miss your grandmother. You should call your
grandmother, but there's no need to be gouged while doing it.''

 &HT;    Forcasters predict major cold snap for Florida
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A hard frost early next year, prompted
by the La Nina weather phenomenon, may cause ``devastating'' damage
to South Florida crops, weather forecasters said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But agricultural officials in Palm Beach County and the Treasure
Coast said damage would depend on the crop and the timing and
severity of the cold snap.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service's freeze prediction came during an
assessment of the hurricane season, which ended Monday. The season
did not cooperate with the calendar, as Nicole, far out in the east
Atlantic, became the year's 14th hurricane early Monday. But Nicole
was expected to dissipate in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a 75 to 80 percent chance we'll have a freeze'' in
January or February, said Jim Lushine, Warning Coordination
Meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Miami office.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters can't say how deep the mercury will drop or for how
long. But the moderate weather of the last few months, which is
expected to continue through December, will leave crops more
vulnerable than if they'd toughed out cooler weather, Lushine said.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina is a cooling of the tropical waters of the eastern
Pacific Ocean, the opposite of the El Nino effect.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina is expected to leave the Midwest and Northeast colder
and wetter than normal, Lushine said. He said extra snowfall and
resulting wind patterns will draw the jet stream down into Florida,
bringing the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   A typical freeze brings one or two nights with lows dipping to
the high 20s from Miami-Dade to Palm Beach counties and perhaps to
the mid-20s in the Treasure Coast, Lushine said. The last one
occurred in January 1997 and lasted two days, causing an estimated
$300 million in crop damage in South and Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A two-day freeze in 1989 brought an estimated $1 billion damage
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   A hard freeze could also leave a lot of dead vegetation, fuel
for summer fires often sparked by lightning, Lushine said.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials tempered Monday's dire crop predictions.
</P>
<P>
   A January freeze would not be as devastating as a December snap
to vegetable crops in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast,
said Dr. Thomas Shueneman, a Palm Beach County agriculture agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, there are two seasons for vegetables, and January
falls right in between so if there's going to be a frost we can
plan around it,'' Shueneman said.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus starts to die if the temperature falls below 28 degrees
for more than four hours, said Steve Ebersbach, production
supervisor for the 4,000-acre Callery-Judge Groves in Loxahatchee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into trouble when you get a sustained cold,'' he said.
``Then previous weather doesn't make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   A freeze in late December or early January, which is only
halfway through the sugar cane harvest, would cause more damage
than a later snap, said John Dunckelman, vice president for
agriculture research for the Florida Sugar Cane League in
Clewiston. He said if temperatures are in the mid-20s for up to
eight hours, stalks would freeze and split, sugar juice could be
ruined, and new plantings could die, affecting future crops.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina historically brings almost twice as many landfalling
tropical storms and hurricanes, but most do not strike Florida,
Lushine said, citing a study by Florida State University's Center
for Oceanic-Atmospheric Prediction Studies.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina might also prompt tornadoes in December or January and
again in May or June, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all of this, forecasters predict another El Nino
running from the fall of 1999 to the summer of 2000, Lushine said.
He said forecasters can't explain the quick turnaround; the current
La Nina followed the second-greatest El Nino this century in
1997-1998, which succeeded a La Nina in 1996-1997. El Ninos usually
alternate with La Ninas and occur every two to seven years, but not
always. The last El Nino before 1997-1998 was in 1982-1983, while
the last La Nina before the two most recent was in 1988. Some
years, of course, are neither El Nino or La Nina years.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mayfield, the hurricane center's deputy director, also said
Monday that the 34 hurricanes in the last four years is an all-time
record; the previous four-year record was 32 from 1948 to 1951. He
said the total of seven tropical storms or hurricanes striking the
U.S. mainland this year, causing $6.5 billion in damage, was double
the historical average.

 &HT;    Television show may air segment on missing Florida man
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Police have asked the television show
America's Most Wanted to run a segment on Singer Island resident
Christopher Benedetto, who has been missing since before his wife's
body was found Nov. 23 in a freezer in the couple's garage.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance it will air, but not this week, America's
Most Wanted spokeswoman Cindy Smith said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was scheduled for today on the body of Benedetto's
wife, Janette Piro, 45. She was found by relatives stuffed in a
fetal position in a freezer under a workbench at 1160 Dolphin Road.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Seibert, associate Palm Beach County medical
examiner, said the autopsy could not be performed last week because
the body was frozen solid and needed ``four to five days'' of
thawing to prevent deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go slowly,'' he said. ``You can't just leave it
out at room temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dade County Medical Examiner's Office was performing a
special test Monday on the body at the local medical examiner's
office that required four or five hours, a spokeswoman at the local
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Riviera police nor the county medical examiner would say
what the Dade County test involved, or why that agency was called
in.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetto, 42, has been missing since the couple failed to show
for a dinner date with neighbors Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Riviera Beach Detective Pat Galligan
said Monday that the couple's financial accounts had not been
touched, but he wouldn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Benedetto retired after receiving a seven-figure
insurance settlement for seriously injuring his back in a
construction fall in New York, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Galligan refused to comment on whether credit cards issued to
the couple had been used since Benedetto's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined comment on results of Luminol tests done to
detect blood traces in the home or whose fingerprints were found in
the couple's Toyota 4-Runner, which was discovered parked at a
Singer Island hotel.

COLOMBIA COURTS CONGRESS, BECOMES A TOP RECIPIENT OF U.S. AID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes 2nd graf. Inserts 2 new grafs, beginning ``It's
another step.'' Begins 2nd take at same place as optional trim.)  (htv) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration initially opposed it, and the
Colombian government was taken by surprise. But a recent
congressional initiative, spurred by direct appeals to conservative
Republicans by the Colombian national police, has more than doubled
drug-fighting money to Colombia and made the country a top
recipient of U.S. foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Along with an administration-sponsored increase, the
congressional infusion brings the assistance to $289 million for
1999, compared with $80 million in 1997 and $88.6 million this
year. It is mostly in the form of weapons, helicopters and
surveillance planes and will sharply increase the American-supplied
firepower to the Colombian police.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are calling it the first installment
of a three-year campaign to reduce substantially the flow of
illicit drugs into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But critics fear that the huge jump in aid and the heightened
U.S. interest in attacking the drug trade at its source will lure
Washington into supporting the seemingly endless war by Colombia's
armed forces with leftist guerrillas, which has slowly bled
Colombia of tens of thousands of lives and untold resources for
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the money has been designated for use against drug crop
growers and drug traffickers, much of the equipment could easily be
used against the guerrillas. The equipment will require substantial
American training of pilots, maintenance workers and support staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal for aid by the Colombian police, and in the
congressional response, the distinction between drug traffickers
and guerrillas usually insisted on by officials of the State
Department and other American agencies has become blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Some guerrilla groups are involved in protecting coca crops and
landing strips in southern Colombia and skim a commission from the
drug trade. A report last year by the Colombian drug police
estimated that 3,155 of the country's 15,000 guerrillas were active
in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers like Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., have adopted
the label applied to the rebels by the Colombian police and
military _ narcoterrorists _ lumping the insurgency and drug
traffickers into a single threat to United States interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian drug police have at times dropped the distinction
altogether. For instance, they recently highlighted an army defeat
at the hands of rebels to press the case for acquiring
American-made Blackhawk helicopters, even though the combat had
nothing to do with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another step in the wrong direction,'' said Adam
Isaacson, an associate at the Center for International Policy, a
Washington-based research institute. He said the increased American
commitment could bring closer the prospect of American involvement
in Colombia's war with the rebels. ``I would call it a danger,'' he
said. ``There is all that overlap to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was more concerned, however, with growing cooperation
with the Colombian military, which Washington has kept at something
of a distance in the past because of human rights concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase in aid will come as part of a $690 million
package of supplemental appropriations for drug interdiction
throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional aid for the national police includes the
following:
</P>
<P>
   _$96 million for six Blackhawk helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   _$40 million for upgrading and arming 34 Huey helicopter
gunships, which can fire high-powered machine guns over long
distances.
</P>
<P>
   _$6 million for beefing up a crop fumigation air wing, in part
with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Administration-sponsored aid for Colombia also approved by
Congress includes the following:
</P>
<P>
   _$70 million for aerial fumigation of drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   _$20 million in helicopters, transport and surveillance planes,
weapons and other equipment for the Colombian National Police.
</P>
<P>
   _$20 million in patrol boats, weapons, ammunition and other
supplies for the Colombian military.
</P>
<P>
   The $165 million in supplemental aid from Congress is in
addition to $124 million already appropriated for Colombia, and
represents a tenfold increase in counter-narcotics funding over
five year period. Roughly 80 percent of the cocaine in the United
States originates in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a decision that surprised everybody,'' Colombia's
defense minister, Rodrigo Lloreda, said in an interview. He added
that the Clinton administration had previously supported
drug-fighting efforts in Colombia, ``but they kept a certain
balance between Colombia, Peru and other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Both administration and congressional officials described the
appropriation as a kind of ``wish list,'' that they were surprised
to see pass virtually in its entirety. Administration officials
like Barry McCaffrey, the retired general who is in charge of
anti-drug efforts, initially complained that the congressional
authorization _ which at first specified that $1.2 million should
go for concertina wire around a Bogota prison _ ``micromanaged''
drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials said the initial spending plan
overextended the American commitment to Colombia, and was too
costly. But in the end, the plan won White House backing because it
was more attuned to overall strategy, and won their support.
</P>
<P>
   Though Congress took the lead, the increased spending matches a
growing closeness between Washington and Bogota since Andres
Pasrtrana was elected president last summer. Pastrana, who has
visited Washington three times in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum for the increase came from a group of conservative
Republicans who have embraced the Colombian national police and who
are determined to increase anti-drug efforts and lend a show of
force as Pastrana sets the stage for peace talks with leftist
rebels.

UNDATED: leftist rebels.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With government forces having temporarily evacuated an area of
Colombia as big as Switzerland, congressional Republicans describe
the infusion as a signal of American interest in the outcome of
peace talks. It will also shore up Colombian security forces, which
have been humiliated by the rebels in a series of clashes over the
last two years, they say. Until now, a de facto division of labor
has had the Colombian military leading the fight against rebels,
while the police tackled drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as giving Colombia the support it needs to do
what it wants to do,'' Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said. ``It will
put the government in a better bargaining position.''
</P>
<P>
   The major share of Washington's anti-drug aid is trained on
stepping up aerial eradication in zones under rebel control and
intercepting boats and planes transporting drugs. Officials say the
Blackhawk and upgraded Huey helicopters are better for reaching
high altitudes, where opium poppies are grown. The Blackhawks,
armored and able to transport up to 15 troops, would also represent
greater firepower and maneuverability in Colombia's continuing war
against leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to perhaps appease Washington and the Colombian
government, the rebels have said they would eliminate the drug
trade in areas they control as part of an eventual peace agreement.
Respected political analysts in Colombia, including Alejandro
Reyes, a professor at the National University in Bogota, contend
that the guerrillas are the only authority with enough credibility
among peasants to eliminate the trade.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the insurgents' fighting strategy has grown from
hit-and-run ambushes of soldiers to more conventional assaults on
military and police bases, in which the rebels have repeatedly
outnumbered and overrun government security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent of these occurred last month in an attack
against the police base at Mitu, where Lloreda said 45 policemen
and civilians were known to have been killed and 48 people were
abducted. He said 82 others had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mitu attack bolstered Colombia's case for the
Blackhawks, the police had earlier cited military defeats _
unconnected to the drug trade _ in appealing for the more
sophisticated helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last March to Rep. Dan Burton, R.-Ind., Col. Jose
Leonardo Gallego reiterated an appeal for Blackhawk helicopters he
made in testimony before Congress only a month earlier. In
requesting the helicopters for drug-fighting missions he cited the
deaths of hundreds of government troops in rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those deaths, however, occurred early this year after
rebels ambushed the Colombian army's third brigade at a canyon in
El Billar. The operation was unrelated to any fumigation or
anti-drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the State Department had initially opposed sending
Blackhawks to Colombia, largely because of the higher expense and
maintenance costs involved, Colombia's national police chief, Gen.
Rosso Jose Serrano, has set up direct lines of contact with the
congressional committees controlling the pursestrings. He has acted
as host to most of the key figures in the congressional debate on
their visits to Colombia, making his case for increased firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano has also been adopted by conservative policy advocates
influential with congressional Republicans. One of these is F. Andy
Messing Jr., executive director of the National Defense Council
Foundation, a conservative think tank whose chairman is congressman
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Messing, a retired Special Forces major, has been a frequent
visitor to Colombia and was honored with an anti-narcotics award
from the Colombian police last year. He predicts that as the
situation stands now, the rebels will take control of the Bogota
government in one year, regardless of the outcome of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   During the years of alienation between Washington and Colombia
during the presidency of Ernesto Samper, who was accused of
accepting $6 million from drug traffickers, Serrano became the face
of the Colombian government on Capitol Hill, as relations between
the United States and Colombia narrowed down to the drug issue. In
congressional hearings, Serrano has been hailed as ``a cop's cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was someone during that administration who Congress felt
comfortable with,'' said Senator DeWine.
</P>
<P>
   In the atmosphere of violence that dominates Colombia, the
rebels and the government forces have continued to wage war while
talking peace. ``You can't negotiate unless you have strength,''
LLoreda, the defense minister, said. ``We would all like peace to
come spontaneously out of good will, but it doesn't always work
that way.''

HOLYFIELD AND LEWIS TO FIGHT AT THE GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The acrimonious negotiations are over. Cablevision
and Time Warner have put up the money. On March 13, Evander
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis will step into the ring at Madison
Square Garden to determine the undisputed heavyweight champion of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first heavyweight championship bout at the Garden
since 1993, when Riddick Bowe retained his title against Michael
Dokes. And the winner will be the first undisputed heavyweight
champion since Bowe defeated Holyfield on Nov. 13, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden is hoping to re-establish itself as a
historical monument to some of the world's greatest fights.
Although the bout would have difficulty matching the Muhammad
Ali-Joe Frazier fight in 1971, a card featuring two best
heavyweights in the world will go a long way toward erasing some of
the inglorious moments the Garden has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1) is the World Boxing Council champion, and Holyfield
(36-3) holds the World Boxing Association and International Boxing
Federation titles.
</P>
<P>
   After a bout between Bowe and Andrew Golota in 1996, a riot
broke out inside and outside the ring when Bowe's manager, Rock
Newman, and members of Bowe's entourage threw punches at members of
Golota's corner. And this past June, a bout between Holyfield and
Henry Akinwande was canceled when Akinwande tested positive for
hepatitis B and a female boxer on the card turned out to be 21
weeks pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something equally bizarre happens this time around, the
Holyfield-Lewis card could be the kind of signature event that puts
the Garden back on the big-time boxing map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're tired of hearing everyone say that the last
time we had big fight here was 1971,'' Dave Checketts, the Madison
Square Garden president, said. ``This fight puts the Garden back in
the fight business in a big way. Whenever there's a fight that's
compelling, you have to think of the Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, which owns the
arena, the Knicks and Rangers, put up just over $8 million to stage
the fight at Madison Square Garden. That bid went beyond anything
that Las Vegas or Atlantic City would come up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought we would be able to capture this event,'' Dolan
said. ``This setting is unlike any venue in the world. We like to
think that the name of the Garden went a long way to attracting
this fight on March 13, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   With around 19,000 seats and tickets priced from $1,500 for
ringside to a minimum of $100, Checketts said he hoped that the
fight would be a sellout and earn a gate of $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and HBO Sports guaranteed Holyfield $20 million to
gain his commitment. They hope the fight will have more than a
million pay-per-view orders to prevent a loss. It's a risk
considering that Lewis has never come close to producing a million
pay-per-view orders. Holyfield has gone over a million in bouts
against Mike Tyson, George Foreman and Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we're going to lose money on this fight,''
said Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner and HBO Sports.
``We have a substantial guarantee upfront on this fight. But we
pride ourselves on putting on the best fights in boxing. My boss
didn't ask me if we were going to make money or lose money when I
first told him about this fight. He asked me if it was a good
fight. I believe it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight would not have happened without the promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   King pulled the fight together by getting Lewis to agree to a
$9.5 million purse, and then mended his relationship with Abraham.
The two men were partners in boxing events for HBO Sports 13 years
ago, before a bitter split in their business relationship drove a
wedge between them.
</P>
<P>
   Their acrimony got in the way of the original negotiation, which
fell apart because Lewis' exclusive deal with HBO did not allow
King to shop the fight to Showtime, which was apparently willing to
offer more than the $16 million HBO had been offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharing a boxing podium with Don King must be like dating your
ex-wife,'' Abraham said. ``You think it's the best thing, but only
time and another date will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the two boxers, they were just pleased that the fight had
finally been made. Lewis said he was playing golf when he heard the
news, but that it didn't send him jumping up and down on the links.
Lewis said Holyfield had been ducking him and that the pressure
from outside influences finally made Holyfield step up to take the
fight. &QL;

   ``Habs have no backbone,'' a Montreal Gazette headline
proclaimed after Friday's 5-1 loss at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop the bleeding!'' another begged Sunday after the
Canadiens' 4-3 loss to Pittsburgh the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens had lost seven of their previous eight games
before Monday night's meeting with the Kings. It got so bad, they
were even taking hits from one of their own _ the legendary Guy
Lafleur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only team that would remind me of teams when I played is
Detroit,'' Lafleur told a Canadian newspaper last week. ``As for
Montreal, I just look at them as one of 27 in the league.... The
problem is there is only one good line. The rest are mostly
defensive players. They can score a few goals, but are they guys
you can count on for the big goal in the playoffs?''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to one of the Canadiens' players, Lafleur added:
``Brian Savage gets paid as a 35-40 goal scorer ($3.5 million), but
he's never done that. What's the motivation for making more money?
They don't have any because they're already making millions. When I
was playing, you were told, `Score more and we'll give you more
money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what Lafleur's comments would be if he weren't working
these days as a goodwill ambassador for the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   The players are feeling the tension. Defenseman Eric Weinrich,
recently acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks, has noticed the
increased pressure playing for his new losing team as opposed to
his old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to compare it is if I'd played on the Bulls last
year,'' he said. ``Here, the people and the media don't leave any
stone unturned. The people here, when they talk about the game, if
we win, they say, `We won.' If we lose, they say, `We lost.' It's
not like the team lost. It's like the city lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The days of dynasties are probably gone. Canadiens fans should
accustom themselves to winning once in awhile, not all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a bad thing? For those who enjoyed the aura of the
Canadiens, it most definitely is. But it's a new era. The NHL will
soon have 30 teams, and prolonged dominance is a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league's been talking about parity for years and years,''
said Kings coach Larry Robinson, a former Canadiens great. ``Well,
they've got it. Nashville comes in, an expansion team, and they're
right in the middle of the pack. That's parity for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's some more parity: Les Habitants can only wish they had as
many victories as those fabled Predators from Music City USA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One down, two to go
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won the Petr Nedved sweepstakes, leaving disgruntled
Canuck Pavel Bure and unsigned Islander Zigmund Palffy as the two
best hockey players not playing in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the Penguins won, ridding themselves of someone who
wouldn't play for them and getting a talented if underachieving
forward, Alexei Kovalev, in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It does not appear the Nedved acquisition eliminates the Rangers
from making a bid for Bure. Before making the Nedved deal, Rangers
GM Neil Smith reportedly checked with Canucks counterpart Brian
Burke to make sure Burke wouldn't want Kovalev in a deal for Bure.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped Penguins' standoff with Nedved _ who sat out
all last season and the first quarter of this one _ ended as well
as Pittsburgh could have hoped. Not only did the Penguins get
Kovalev in the five-player deal, they saved $2 million in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm happy; I don't know what my sentiments
are,'' Penguins general manager Craig Patrick said. ``I guess I'm
pleased to finally be able to get proper value for our asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings GM Dave Taylor said he'd had interest in Nedved, but it
cooled when the Penguins insisted on a deal that would have
included 19-year-old center Olli Jokinen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hockey culture 101
</P>
<P>
   A major issue last week in hockey-crazed Canada was a report by
an academician who spent a year studying an unidentified American
Hockey League team. He concluded that the ``hyper-masculine'' world
of hockey has created a social sub-group with unique
``homo-social'' practices.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Robidoux, who recently completed a Ph.D. on hockey
culture at a Canadian university, wrote about such hazing rituals
as players drinking from a punchbowl filled with alcohol, spit and
urine at a party, and stripping on the team bus, then seeing how
many nude players would fit into the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no room for self-development,'' Dr. Robidoux told the
National Post. ``If you don't fit within this one, singular notion
of what it means to be a man, you're not welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robidoux also found that the single-minded participation in
the sport stunts some players' intellectual growth. One 25-year-old
player could only spell phonetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spelled self-esteem `self of steam,''' Robidoux reported. &QL;

U.S. PLEDGES MILITARY HELP TO COLOMBIA IN DRUG WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
Colombia's new president, Andres Pastrana, announced steps Monday
to intensify military cooperation in the war on drug trafficking,
including a pledge to increase Pentagon training of Colombia's
armed forces and to share more aerial and satellite intelligence
data.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Colombia have worked closely together to
stanch the flow of drugs for decades, but the new steps underscored
the deepening of American diplomatic and military engagement after
the election of Pastrana, a reformist who replaced Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Cohen and Colombia's defense minister, Rodrigo
Lloreda, are scheduled to sign an agreement setting up a formal
working group that will bring officials from both countries
together for regular consultations. The United States has similar
relationships with Argentina, Chile and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements come on the heels of a sharp increase in aid and
equipment, including six Black Hawk helicopters that Congress
approved for Colombia's fight against narcotics as part of last
month's increase in spending on defense and intelligence. The aid
will total $289 million, nearly triple the recent annual American
contributions to Colombia's anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion during Cohen's meetings with Pastrana and
other Colombian leaders here focused on how the United States can
help Colombia's police and military to make the best use of the
unexpected windfall, which was driven by Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we are being treated completely differently than was
the case during the previous four years,'' Pastrana said Monday,
referring to the Clinton administration's isolation of his
predecessor, Samper, because of evidence indicating he accepted
campaign funds from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Pastrana after a breakfast meeting at the
president's guest house along the bay near this Caribbean port,
Cohen praised the new Colombian government and said the American
military was prepared to help restructure Colombia's armed forces
into a modern professional force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military background and expertise could be shared with the
Colombian forces to deal with this particular and very serious
problem,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is in Cartagena to attend a three-day conference of
defense ministers from all countries in the Western Hemisphere
except Cuba. The conference, the third since 1995, is meant to
increase cooperation in the fight against drugs and terrorism and
to cement the transition many Latin American countries have begun
in establishing civilian control over their militaries.
</P>
<P>
   That the conference even took place here in Colombia has been
seen as an improvement in Colombia's international standing; last
year's conference, also planned for Cartagena, was canceled because
of tensions over Samper.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was elected four months ago, Pastrana has, by contrast,
gone to Washington twice for meetings with President Clinton.
Cohen's current visit is the highest-level visit to Colombia by a
U.S. official during Clinton's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's aides emphasized that any new help to Colombia's police
and military would only involve the fight against drug traffickers
and not against the leftist insurgents who have battled the central
government here for years. But the increasing aid and cooperation
has blurred the line between the two wars Colombia is fighting,
raising concerns among some human rights advocates that the United
States is involving itself in Colombia's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans agreed, for example, to provide additional aerial
and satellite photographs of a large swath of rebel territory that
Pastrana's government unilaterally evacuated on Nov. 7 as a way to
spur peace talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said Monday that the Colombians
wanted the added intelligence to make sure drug traffickers did not
use the withdrawal to expand operations in the area, but the
information could be used to observe rebel movements as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lloreda, Colombia's defense minister, who expressed pessimism
that his president's gesture would produce a peace accord, said in
an interview that Colombia needed to strengthen the military to
defeat the rebels and that American aid, even if ostensibly devoted
to narcotics, helped that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The counternarcotics aid will help liberate troops,'' he said,
``so they can fill other roles.''

EDITORIAL: A GUN CONTROL GAIN, AND LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 1:
</P>
<P>
   A new national computerized system for conducting instant
background checks of prospective gun purchasers went into effect
yesterday. The rules for the new ``instant check'' system call for
the FBI to conduct background checks before the sales of all
firearms, not just of handguns, the previous focus of concern. This
broadened coverage is potentially a big advance for public safety.
But gun control advocates are correctly worried that the mandatory
``cooling off'' period previously required before a purchaser could
take possession of a gun is expiring with the beginning of the
federal background checks.
</P>
<P>
   The new system has limitations that could allow convicted
criminals, the mentally ill or other prohibited purchasers to walk
out of a store with a weapon. Some states will continue to check
their own files. But for now, at least, the more than 500 people
hired by the FBI to field calls from the nation's gun dealers and
pawnshop owners lack immediate access to some critical state and
local records, including involuntary admissions to mental
hospitals, domestic violence misdemeanors and arrests too recent to
be in the computer.
</P>
<P>
   A minimum three-day waiting period makes sense to give local
police time to participate in the background search and to defuse
impulse crimes of violence. Congress, which eliminated the waiting
period as a gift to the gun lobby, ought to promptly reinstate it.

LONDON FINANCIAL FUTURES EXCHANGE GOES ELECTRONIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Spurred by competition from the Continent, about 50 of
the 1,500 traders on London's futures markets hung up their
bright-colored blazers Monday and turned to computer screens,
abandoning open-outcry trading in favor of electronic dealing.
</P>
<P>
   For the London International Financial Futures Exchange, the
switch came as an acknowledgment that it had fallen behind
electronic rivals, particularly in Frankfurt, who captured the
benchmark German bond contract this year, displacing London as the
unchallenged leader of Europe's derivatives markets.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Denton, a spokeswoman for the exchange, said the
intention was to transfer the bulk of the exchange's business to
electronic screen trading by next July. About 1,500 people work in
the exchange's open-outcry pits, but more than 200 of them have
been retrained to operate trading screens in the offices of the
exchange's 212 members.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Denton said 47 member companies took part in trading 75
equity options Monday, and 11,600 contracts were traded. Some
traders said the real test would come with busier trading. Ms.
Denton said the volume Monday was average for equity options and
that the changeover had worked well.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the London exchange is driven by the planned
introduction of Europe's single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1. The
currency change has galvanized European financial markets into
cross-border deals to strengthen their positions and compete for
business in the 11-nation euro zone. This year, the futures markets
in Frankfurt and Zurich set up a joint exchange called Eurex in
direct opposition to the London exchange, just as the stock markets
in London and Frankfurt formed what they called a ``strategic
alliance'' as the core of a putative pan-European equities market.
</P>
<P>
   In a further acknowledgment that the insurgents are gaining
ground, the London exchange also announced Monday that starting
this month it would use two competing euro interest rates as a
reference for euro futures contracts _ the Euribor, which is
calculated by 57 mostly European banks, and the euro Libor, which
is based on daily quotes from 16 international banks. Traders said
it was unclear which rate would be most commonly used and how much
they would differ from each other.

COMMODITY INDEX HITS 26-YEAR LOW, LED BY OIL AND GAS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commodity prices, led by a plunge in oil and natural gas,
dropped sharply Monday, pushing one key index to a 26-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent weakness of commodity prices continues to hobble
many emerging-market countries _ from Russia and Indonesia to
Mexico and Chile _ that depend on such exports for economic growth
and government financing.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say they doubt there will be a turnaround in
commodity prices until sometime in mid-1999, which means prices are
likely to fall further. The turnaround, analysts say, is contingent
on a revival of the Asian economies that were hit hard by the
financial crisis that began in Thailand in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge Monday came as commodity prices had been experiencing
a slight rebound from the low set at the end of August when the
stock market was falling sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there had been a rally in some agricultural commodity
prices, including wheat, corn, sugar and coffee. But prices for
industrial materials remained weak. ``We had a rally that was not
steeped in industrial commodities,'' said William O'Neill, director
of futures research at Merrill Lynch. The Journal of Commerce index
of 17 industrial commodities is down 5.5 percent since the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   But now some of the agricultural price gains are slipping, and
the price of oil is plunging. By contrast, at the August low in
commodity indexes, oil prices were rising.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the price of oil for January delivery dropped 65
cents, or 5.4 percent, to $11.22 a barrel, its lowest in 12 years.
During the day the price fell as low as $10.82 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge came after last week's meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Counties failed to extend the group's earlier
agreement to cut production. ``The meeting had the worst possible
result,'' O'Neill said. ``They didn't even roll over the agreement,
and they left people concerned about OPEC in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas prices, which have suffered because of warm
late-autumn weather in the Northeast, dropped 22 cents, or 10
percent, to $1.976 for 1,000 cubic feet. The price has dropped 23
percent in just over two weeks. Prices also fell for home heating
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for cocoa, silver, gold, live cattle, orange juice,
coffee and cotton also slipped. Copper dropped to an 11{-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldman Sachs index of 22 commodities fell 3.97 points, to
133.55, its lowest in 26 years. The Commodity Research
Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities, which is more heavily
weighted to agricultural products, dropped 1.57 points, to 195.42,
just above its 21-year low close on Aug. 28.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As in August, the weakness in commodity prices is a reflection
of the decline in demand for oil, copper and other commodities
since Asian countries fell into recession after the devaluation of
currencies in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill said an additional factor was the prospect of slower
growth in the United States and in Europe next year. ``I see
evidence, in talking to domestic copper refiners, that their order
books are good but are starting to slow down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while demand is the core problem, oversupply of many
commodities also plays a role. The breakdown of the OPEC agreement
to curb production probably means that supplies will be more than
plentiful. And in copper, Chile, which is a major producer, has not
curtailed its effort to raise production despite the fall in price,
which is down 42 percent since June 1997. &QL;

VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY RECEIVES $300 MILLION GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it had received
stock currently valued at more than $300 million, which may be the
largest private gift ever made to an American college or
university.
</P>
<P>
   The gift was made by Martha Ingram, chairwoman of Ingram
Industries Inc., a privately held wholesale distribution company
based in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ingram set the gift in motion by contributing 20 million
shares of Ingram Micro Inc., a computer distribution company spun
off by Ingram Industries two years ago, to the Ingram Charitable
Fund, a family charity established in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's charter specifies that it must dedicate 40 percent of
its income and assets to Vanderbilt. So at $42.50 a share, Monday's
closing price for Ingram Micro, the gift would be worth $340
million to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is a record is a matter of conjecture. In 1994, Sir
Harold Acton donated a 57-acre Italian estate, an art collection
and other valuable assets to New York University. The value of that
gift was estimated at as much as $500 million, but because so much
of it was relatively illiquid, the estimates were regarded as
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond doubt, though, the gift to Vanderbilt is one of the
largest ever, outstripping the $295 million to Emory University in
1996 and the $240 million to the University of California at San
Francisco earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt University, founded in 1873 by a $1 million gift from
the railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, is a private research
university in Nashville with about 10,000 undergraduate, graduate
and professional students in 10 schools and colleges, a medical
center and a wide range of research institutes.
</P>
<P>
   The largest previous gift to Vanderbilt was $41 million, from
Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, a grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, the university's chancellor, Joe Wyatt,
said that there were no formal restrictions on the Ingram gift but
that he could not specify what uses would be made of it until he
had had further discussion with Mrs. Ingram and members of her
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Ingram family has had a half-century's association with
Vanderbilt. Mrs. Ingram's husband, Bronson Ingram, whom she
succeeded as head of Ingram Industries, was a trustee of the
university, and three of their four children graduated from it. In
addition, Ingram's father, Orrin Henry Ingram, was a trustee from
1952 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt said that while he was surprised by the enormous size of
the gift, he had been aware that a major contribution was being
planned by the Ingram family. Wyatt said he had frequently
discussed the prospect with Bronson Ingram, who was president of
the trustees from 1991 until his death in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bronson was one of those who talked to me in 1982 about coming
down here to this job,'' said Wyatt, who at the time was vice
president for administration at Harvard University. ``I worked on
this with him, and he understood very well that in the long run
resources have everything to do with what can be accomplished.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While some educational institutions, like Harvard University,
stockpile gifts in their endowments, a handful, like New York
University, have spent much of the bounty of their successful
fund-raising campaigns to hire top-flight faculty, build
cutting-edge facilities and bolster financial-aid packages to
attract superior students.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt said he was well aware of the distinction and would expect
that with the guidance of the Ingram family he would put ``a
significant'' share of the gift into the university's endowment
($1.5 billion before the gift, putting Vanderbilt among the 20
wealthiest institutions) and devote another amount to ``capital
programs such as laboratories and facilities to enhance our
education and research programs.''

GOP INCUMBENT DROPS BALLOT FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Vacco all but conceded defeat Monday in his bid for
re-election as New York's attorney general. His campaign dropped
its challenge of thousands of uncounted ballots from the Nov. 3
election and said it accepted state tallies showing Eliot Spitzer
in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, the Republican incumbent, had fought for weeks to delay
the opening of paper ballots that had been challenged by the two
sides. As a result, more than 20,000 ballots remain to be counted _
a number roughly equal to Spitzer's lead _ out of 4.2 million cast.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Thomas Spargo, Vacco's lawyer, acknowledged what
Spitzer's campaign had long contended: that the disputed ballots
were likely only to increase Spitzer's margin of victory. Most of
the challenges came from the Vacco campaign, and they involved
ballots cast in largely black and Hispanic areas in New York City
and other heavily Democratic areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not reasonable to expect that, when you open the paper
ballots that are set aside around this state, the outcome of the
election will be different than it is now,'' Spargo said after a
hearing in state Supreme Court, a trial court, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   State election officials said they would tally the remaining
ballots this week and declare the final results on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19, Spitzer, saying that it was mathematically
impossible for Vacco to win, declared victory and began assembling
a transition team, although Vacco declined to concede or to
cooperate with any transition efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Vacco's lawyer said, ``There was not a mathematical
basis on the information I have today to overturn the election.''
Still, he added, ``That doesn't mean that this week and next week
that I will not be reviewing all the data I have accumulated to
examine whether or not there is another area that may have an
impact significant enough to affect a 20,000- or 25,000-vote
margin.''

<P>
   ``Now that the Republican lawyers have all but conceded, Vacco's
choice is obvious,'' said Steven Goldstein, press secretary to
Spitzer's campaign. ``He can now cooperate in the transition, or
have his name forever accompanied by an asterisk denoting the most
graceless exit in state political history.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Vacco's lawyers have made several charges
of election irregularities. They first said that 37,000 votes had
appeared without explanation after the unofficial Election Day
tally by the Board of Elections. Later, Vacco's lawyers said they
had found a 7,000-vote error in the results in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Spargo said that the Vacco campaign had obtained
material indicating that 1,000 people had voted in the names of
people for whom death benefits were being paid by the Social
Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But at the court hearing Monday, Spargo said the campaign was
satisfied that the count had been accurate so far and that the
Vacco campaign accepted the results as compiled by the State Board
of Elections, indicating that Spitzer had a lead of 21,415 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the claims that ballots had been cast in the names of dead
voters, Spargo said that the Vacco campaign had found ``a
significant number of irregularities.'' But he added that ``in
certain cases, because of a lack of a date of birth in the Board of
Elections records and people being in the same household with the
same name, we didn't always have the most accurate information.''
</P>
<P>
   With each of Vacco's accusations, Democratic leaders have in
turn accused the Republican attorney general of engaging in tactics
intended to stall the outcome of the election. They have harshly
criticized Vacco, all but accusing the state's top lawyer of
participating in hoaxes to delay the final count from being
tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Connor, the minority leader of the state Senate and a
lawyer for Spitzer's campaign, said it was time for Vacco to
formally concede. ``It's time for Attorney General Vacco and the
leadership of the Republican State Party to take off the earmuffs
and listen to that stout lady singing,'' Connor said. ``Because
she's singing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Connor denounced Vacco's accusations of voter
irregularities. ``In this court case, neither the attorneys for
Spitzer nor the court has been presented with one specific name by
the Republican lawyers of a dead person who voted,'' Connor said.
``They've never submitted a list of particulars. What dead
people?''

GYMNAST MOCEANU GETS PROTECTIVE ORDER AGAINST HER FATHER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu, the 17-year-old Olympic gymnast, received a
temporary protective order Monday against her father, whom she
accused of stalking and harassing her since she won emancipation
from her parents a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   She said in an interview Monday night that her father had hired
a private investigator to trail her, had waited outside her high
school as she arrived and left, and had tried to follow her.
Dominique Moceanu also said she believed her father had tapped her
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Her allegations come barely a month after she was granted adult
status by a Houston judge. That Oct. 28 ruling apparently resolved
a lawsuit in which she accused her parents of squandering the
earnings from her gymnastics career, which reached its zenith with
a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Monday night and in court papers, Moceanu said
Houston police detectives told her on Nov. 13 that they were
investigating allegations that her father, Dimitru Moceanu, was
trying to hire someone to kill one of her friends and her
gymnastics coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston police said Monday that its homicide division had
investigated threats allegedly made in the case, but that the
matter was inconclusive, no charges were filed and no arrests were
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is now closed,'' said Robert Hurst, a Houston police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Scardino, the Houston lawyer representing Dimitru
Moceanu, said Monday night that she had spoken with Sgt. Hal
Kennedy of the Houston police about a tape-recorded conversation
during which threats were allegedly made by Moceanu against a
32-year-old friend of the gymnast, but that police felt there was
insufficient evidence to make a case.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said she told Dimitru Moceanu that his daughter was an
adult and that it was time to ``back off and leave her alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Yarrell, Dominique Moceanu's lawyer, said from Houston,
``This is a story about a father stalking and threatening his
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu left her family's home in October and moved to
an apartment in the Houston area. However, she has not lived in the
apartment for the past two and a half weeks, she said, because she
fears for her safety. She has stopped attending Northland Christian
School in Houston and may hire security personnel to protect her,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' Dominique Moceanu said Monday night. ``You just
don't know what's possible. This has been tough on my mental and
physical health. I'm really stressed out. He's trying to control me
and my life. He's been following me and knows my every move.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, Moceanu said, three homicide detectives came to her
apartment and said that her father was under investigation for
allegedly trying to have the friend and her gymnastics coach,
Luminita Miscenco, killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this has no merit, why did three officers do this?''
Yarrell said. ``These are not trumped-up issues that this lady
heard a rumor. She had a visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimitru Moceanu may want to ``get his hands around'' the neck of
his daughter's friend, Scardino said, but he does not want him
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still 17 years old and running around with people who
obviously messed her up so bad,'' Scardino said. ``It's difficult
for a parent to back off and let her make all these mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said that ``it goes beyond the realm of realism'' to
think that Dimitru Moceanu would harm his daughter. She also said
that she was growing tired of Dominique Moceanu's ``whining'' about
an abusive childhood and blamed the gymnast for not appreciating
the sacrifices her parents had made for her career.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed Monday in the 309th Judicial District in
Harris County, Texas, however, Dominique Moceanu said that she was
``terrified that my father will soon be successful in harming me or
one of my friends or associates.'' Her affidavit added, ``I believe
that all of my father's actions are intended to result in physical
harm, bodily injury or assault to me or my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   She was granted a temporary protective order preventing her
father from communicating with her or going near her residence or
school. Another hearing is set for Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a great life living on my earnings and got greedy
over the years,'' Dominique Moceanu said in an interview. ``It tore
the family apart. It's sad that money does this to people. I was
hoping to get back together with them. I guess it's not possible.''

EDITORIAL: SPENDING THE TOBACCO BILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 1:
</P>
<P>
   New York politicians are salivating over the $25 billion the
state is expected to receive over the next 25 years as part of the
proposed $206 billion multi-state settlement with the tobacco
industry. But some hurdles still need to be cleared. State Supreme
Court Justice Stephen Crane, who is overseeing the state's lawsuit,
will have to approve the settlement. Many health experts, including
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, oppose the deal as being
insufficient to reduce teen-age smoking. Some anti-smoking
advocates are seeking to present their views in court before any
deal is instituted. They should be afforded that opportunity, given
the far-reaching impact of this settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved, the money should be dedicated to
anti-smoking programs and other health uses. The deal itself
contains no restrictions on how states spend the money. Attorney
General Dennis Vacco has indicated only that the state will share
the proceeds equally with New York's 62 counties. Politicians will
be tempted to siphon off the money for myriad uses that have
nothing to do with tobacco control or health care. Senator-elect
Charles Schumer has even suggested that half of the money be used
for local property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of mischief would make a settlement that is already
weak on health measures even worse. The advertising restrictions
have too many loopholes to prevent the industry from targeting the
youth market. The new deal contains no ``look-back'' penalties for
the industry if teen-age smoking continues to soar. It is therefore
imperative that states use a good share of the money to counter the
industry's marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and President Clinton have a significant role to play
in this fight. They have leverage through a strong legal argument
that the federal government has a right to part of the settlement
since it provides about 50 percent of the Medicaid funds that state
attorneys general were trying to recover. Indeed, a federal waiver
by Congress may be required for the states to keep all the money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should work with Congress to set conditions on any
waiver to insure that states use the money to improve health care,
particularly for children, and to combat smoking. Allowing state
legislatures complete control over the tobacco spoils could result
in no public health benefit at all.

TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE NOT FIRST TO TRY ESCAPE, BUT FIRST TO MAKE
IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Martin E. Gurule may be the first killer to
escape from Texas' death row in 64 years, but two other condemned
prisoners tried to flee just a year and a half ago, taking a
virtually identical roof-top escape route, prison officials
acknowledged Monday. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Prison records reviewed by the Houston Chronicle show that on
June 26, 1997, killers Willie Pondexter and Cedric Ransom cut
through a recreation yard fence at Huntsville's Ellis I Unit with a
hacksaw blade, just as Gurule and six other death row inmates did
Thanksgiving night. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Pondexter and Ransom then climbed onto the roof, ``headed south
to the end of the building and climbed down to the ground between
the chapel and south gym'' and made a dash for the perimeter
fences, records show.
</P>
<P>
   That escape attempt, which Texas Department of Criminal Justice
officials never publicly reported, was thwarted when a tower guard
spotted Ransom climbing the first fence and ordered him to drop to
the ground. Ransom did, and prison guards then found Pondexter
lying on the ground inside the recreation yard compound, according
to an official report filed a day after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials confirmed Monday that they had found a fragment
of a hacksaw blade on the prison roof, where Gurule and the other
inmates apparently waited for several hours before sliding down the
side of a building and running for the fences before dawn Friday.
Only Gurule succeeded in escaping.
</P>
<P>
   A prison official also confirmed Monday that Panchai Wilkerson,
one of the six murderers who attempted t flee with Gurule, had
tried to escape from death row in 1993. In that incident,
Wilkerson, a 29-year-old killer from Harris County, and death row
inmate Jessy Carlos San Miguel, were caught after they used a
hacksaw blade to cut through a prison recreation yard fence, said
TDCJ spokesman Larry Todd.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that escape attempt, Wilkerson was placed in the ``work
capable'' program, a status that gave him and the others involved
in last week's escape the freedom to move about without constant
monitoring by guards.
</P>
<P>
   In both of the previous escape attempts, the inmates were
disciplined, but it could not be immediately determined how or for
what length of time they were disciplined, Todd said late Monday.
Traditionally, when death row inmates are disciplined, they are
removed from the work program, if they had that status. They also
can be denied visitation and commissary privileges.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for Gurule continued for a fourth day Monday,
Allan Polunsky, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice,
said that ``it's certainly a possibility'' that the work program,
which since 1986 has allowed death row inmates to work in a garment
factory, will be abolished as a result of the escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time we examine the policies with respect to the
work capable program,'' said Polunsky, who was in Huntsville to
observe the search. ``I am personally not a proponent of the work
program, but there are other board members and we all need to
assess this in calmer times.''
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky said he has appointed fellow board member Alfred M.
``Max'' Stringfellow of San Antonio to oversee TDCJ's
investigations into the escape and to report back to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there was a breakdown in procedures and the overall
security,'' Polunsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, a death row guard said that TDCJ has known for
some time that ``it was just a matter of time'' before a condemned
prisoner escaped because inmates routinely cut through recreation
yard fences.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite TDCJ official comment to the contrary, one national
expert in prison gangs said that Sammy Buentello, the prison
system's gang expert, alerted him by e-mail after receiving
information that Gurule was a member or associate of the Mexican
Mafia prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prison officials in Huntsville admitted they were
frustrated that their fourth day of searching for the escaped
killer appeared to be ending in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean we can just quit,'' said Gary Johnson,
director of the Institution Division of the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said as many as 500 officers and 70 search dogs were
engaged in the hunt, and will continue concentrating on the heavily
wooded area in which the Ellis Unit is situated ``until we have
hard proof he is not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they were investigating the weekend theft of a
blue 1989 GMC pickup from the parking lot of a Huntsville auto
parts store, but Johnson said they have no evidence that the stolen
vehicle was connected with the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared sensing devices turned up nothing Monday, and Texas
Parks and Wildlife officials patrolling the nearby Trinity River in
boats, also came up empty. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But Johnson and other prison officials insisted they believe
Gurule remains within the secured seven-mile perimeter south and
east of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans of pulling out. We're here for the long
haul,'' Johnson said. ``It is our mission to keep killers locked
up.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; And TDCJ spokesman Glen Castlebury added that the search will
continue 24 hours a day until Gurule is found. ``We never close,''
he said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Gurule, 29, sentenced to die for the 1992 murder of two men
during the robbery of a Corpus Christi restaurant, was the only
inmate who achieved his goal in the break-out, crossing a pair of
10-foot-tall razor-wire topped fences that ring the prison. The
other killers surrendered after sentries opened fire with AR-15
rifles. None of the inmates was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it is possible that Gurule and the others had
formulated no plans for their escape other than how to get out of
prison. If that was the case, Gurule might be wandering aimlessly
in the woods, possibly wounded, and likely without food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert L. DuPont, chief of internal medicine at Houston's
St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, said that with current temperatures
ranging from 70 to 80 degrees, Gurule could survive up to 10 days
with no water at all, and a couple of weeks without food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is the limiting factor,'' DuPont said. ``The weather is
OK, and he's hiding so he's going to stay out of the sun. The
temperature is about perfect. He has an advantage in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The death row guard, who declined to be identified by name in a
story, said he and other guards have long been concerned about the
freedom their wards have, and that every recreation yard has
``dozens'' of patches in the fence where inmates have tried to saw
their way to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Monday that the origin of the hacksaw blade the
inmates used to cut the fence is unknown, but the guard confirmed
suspicions that it could have come from a prison workshop. He said
death row inmates routinely obtain the hacksaws from general
population inmates by trading for drugs, cigarettes and other
contraband as well as commissary items.
</P>
<P>
   General population inmates have access to hacksaws in the school
bus repair barn and other work sites to which they are assigned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Death row prisoners assigned to work in the garment factory also
have far more freedom than other death row inmates, the guard said.
For example, they are allowed to go to indoor recreation areas,
called day rooms, and to outdoor recreation yards unaccompanied by
guards.
</P>
<P>
   A door leading from the day room to the recreation yard _ the
door that Gurule and his accomplices apparently used _ remains
unlocked about 14 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the guard said that cell block doors to work
capable death row prisoners automatically open every hour on the
hour, giving those prisoners the chance to leave their cells if
they choose.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, other death row prisoners remain locked in their
cells 23 hours a day, and are handcuffed, shackled and escorted
everywhere they go inside the prison. &QL;

(Eds.: changes in 7th and 14th grafs for clarification and

 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The defensive back, naturally, could not
believe the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back and get all the Hail Marys on tape, and I'll bet
you my next paycheck that you would be hard pressed to find two
with no shoving on it,'' said the Jets' nickel back Corwin Brown.
``There's shoving on every one of them. Give me a break, man.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback, not surprisingly, argued that a pass into the
end zone from the 26-yard line is no Hail Mary, and it was about
time the man on offense got a last-second break.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's pass interference, it's pass interference,'' Vinny
Testaverde said. ``There's always a lot of bumping, and I always
thought the refs ought to make that call.''
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture? It is always a tossup as to which side of the
official's judgment we are going to wind up on. Heads, we win.
Tails, we whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me into that one,'' Bill Parcells said, with no one
around to call the Jets' coach for delay of opinion. ``I have never
filed an official's report since 1983, and that's all I'm going to
say about it. When I'm retired from the league, I'll have something
to say about the officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country was not about to wait, after a long,
contentious holiday weekend that produced several episodes of ref
rage, and Monday's historic rule change that will now require an
official to raise the existential question _ heads or tails? _ and
receive an answer before he tosses his coin.
</P>
<P>
   The comically botched pre-overtime toss in Detroit last Thursday
was the prelude to stunning end-game calls missed and made Sunday
in New England, which helped keep the soon-to-be Foxboro ex-Pats in
their divisional chase. While no one yet knows if this was good for
the Jets, Keith Byars, the veteran fullback, said he couldn't
remember a last-second call that bad. ``I would hope,'' he said,
``for instant replay.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the replay, the Patriots' Shawn Jefferson was out
of bounds for the 10-yard pass he caught at the Bills' 26 from Drew
Bledsoe on fourth-and-9, with six seconds left and the Patriots
trailing by 4 points. Bledsoe then somehow hit Terry Glenn in the
chest, in the end zone, in a crowd. Glenn dropped the ball, but an
official dropped a flag. The interference call against the Bills'
Henry Jones set up Bledsoe's 1-yard touchdown pass to Ben Coates,
and produced renewed calls for impeachment hearings against those
enterprising souls who depart the conventional work force each
weekend to become the National Football League's adjunct officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys do a good job, mainly, but they're not involved,
they're not there every day,'' Byars said. ``I said a few years ago
I would like for us to have full-time officials. We're the only
sport that doesn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   An excellent point, except for this: Did we not just finish a
major league baseball season in which the unionized, full-salaried
umpires were vilified as the worst plague on the pastime since the
Black Sox scandal? And please tell me when anyone stood up recently
and applauded the work of those abused arbiters of basketball,
hockey, tennis, figure skating and any other sport whose winners
and losers are often determined by educated guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal, gut-wrenching calls have always been part of sports,
which have become more difficult than ever to officiate, with X-Ray
Cam waiting to freeze-frame every painful miscall. Granted, some of
these grandfatherly gents hanging on as N.F.L. officials can't
dodge their own flipped coin, much less a snorting nose tackle. But
then, a reasonable man in his prime can see that half the job is
making the calls; the other half is avoiding one's death.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of performance enhancement, these players are
increasingly pumped up by weights and dietary supplements and who
knows what else? They hit harder, move faster and, as Parcells
said, an entire season could come down to inches, split seconds,
millions of dollars potentially risked on a single play. The
intolerance for those who officiate is going beyond the point of
being unfair. It is beginning to sound absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't the Bills have stopped the Patriots from the 1-yard
line Sunday? Couldn't Pittsburgh have kicked off to Detroit and
held its ground? The N.F.L. can go ahead and bring back instant
replay, stretch out a game already too long. There will still be
human error, which the best teams will continue to find ways to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone sees one thing and someone sees another,'' a shrugging
Keyshawn Johnson said. ``There's good plays and bad, good calls and
bad. Everyone's human.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 1:
</P>
<P>
   With greater speed than anyone could have hoped a few weeks ago,
negotiations that might lead to congressional censure of President
Clinton are moving forward. The White House is now openly shopping
for a deal. Rep. Paul McHale's proposed language condemning Clinton
for ``deceitful and dishonest conduct that was grossly inconsistent
with his constitutional obligation and sacred duty'' catches the
spirit that should be reflected in censure proposals being quietly
drafted by Republicans and Democrats alike. Meanwhile, the specious
contention that the Constitution does not allow the House to
consider censure as an alternative to impeachment is fading away.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still formidable obstacles to censure, and a
continuing need for leadership on Capitol Hill if the country is to
arrive at the most politically healthy outcome attainable under the
circumstances of a flawed and dishonorable presidency. Such an
outcome has to meet several standards. It should allow the nation
to move on to other business. It should write into the historical
record a permanent condemnation of Clinton for lying to the
American people and failing in his duty to the rule of law. It
should also require a fuller admission by this president that he
knowingly and with calculation lied under oath and allowed others
to testify falsely in his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   A primary obstacle is, of course, Clinton's claim that he did
not testify falsely, which is an insult to the public's
intelligence. That contention is also a red flag for Republicans
like Rep. Lindsey Graham, who are clearly open to punishment short
of impeachment but understandably refuse to endorse a manifest
public lie. Yet as long as Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
continues his open-ended threats of indictments Clinton cannot
abandon this intellectually untenable but legally necessary
position. So what needs to happen to get Congress out of its
current box?
</P>
<P>
   First, Starr has to quit playing two hands at once. When he sent
his referral to the House of Representatives, he turned Clinton's
case over to Congress rather than the courts. Barring the emergence
of dramatic new evidence of the sort Starr does not seem to have,
Congress is where the issue ought to be resolved. Starr needs to
affirm that publicly. The idea of prosecution after the end of the
president's term is particularly erosive of constitutional process
and the orderly transition of power. We have supported Starr's
mandate as independent counsel. But we remind him now _ as his
fellow Republicans and his federal court supervisors should be
reminding him _ that in addition to his statutory duty he has a
civic obligation to facilitate a timely and proportional resolution
of the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Events in Congress, of course, are outside Starr's control, and
on that front, the House majority whip, Tom DeLay, is playing a
devious game. DeLay is addicted to the thuggish tactics of the
Gingrich era, and the speaker-designate, Robert Livingston, seems
afraid to confront him in public. Consider, for example, Delay's
blustering misrepresentation of censure on CNN. ``It means
nothing,'' DeLay said. ``It's a piece of paper that said the
president did something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That is pure hogwash. A suitable censure resolution would state
that this president has earned lasting opprobrium for failing in
his constitutional duty. It would pass with wide public support
provided the right conditions develop during this period of
negotiation. Those conditions include leadership from Livingston,
reasonable movement toward closure from Starr and an abandonment by
Clinton of the strategy of lying about his lies.

EDITORIAL: AID AND CORRUPTION IN THE MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 1:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's call yesterday for a new multibillion-dollar
international aid package for the Palestinians is a necessary
complement to the peace agreement he helped put together in
Maryland earlier this fall. That diplomatic deal remains wobbly. It
can be reinforced by showing that peace delivers tangible economic
and social gains to ordinary Palestinians. But outside financial
assistance will be effective only if the Palestinians can curtail
corrupt practices in administering the aid.
</P>
<P>
   The additional $400 million in American aid that Clinton
endorsed can also be a means of dissuading Yasser Arafat from
following through on his threats to proclaim an independent
Palestinian state when the original timetable of the Oslo peace
agreement expires next May.
</P>
<P>
   About $2 billion in international aid has been provided to the
Palestinians since 1993. Most has gone into specific projects,
supervised and monitored by the donor nations. The $500 million
already provided by Washington has been used to produce better
water access for Palestinian towns, loans for local businesses and
financing for Palestinian elections. Clinton now wants Congress to
supply additional money for the industrial zones, airport and
seaport agreed to in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Through careful supervision, Washington and other donor nations
can minimize the improper diversion of this assistance. But
corruption poses a potentially serious problem in other areas. For
example, the Palestinian Authority needs outside funding for
community social welfare projects to keep up with those now offered
by organizations like Hamas. But such money, much of it flowing
through the hands of Palestinian political appointees, is
especially vulnerable to misuse by corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Palestinian audit last summer found instances of
serious fraud and mismanagement within the Palestinian Authority.
Arafat has not addressed the problem. That cannot be the end of the
issue. Palestinian legislators and aid-giving nations must insist
that he crack down on corruption. The Palestinian Authority will
forfeit both domestic legitimacy and world respect unless it deals
firmly with those who steal money meant to improve the lot of the
Palestinian people.

LAWYER'S SUPPORTERS PUSH TO GET HIM OUT OF PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. _ Steven Romer stole more money from clients _ $7
million _ than any lawyer in the nation. He has already spent seven
years in Sing Sing state prison paying for the crime. He and his
family feel it is time for him to get out. And, increasingly, they
are getting politicians and parole experts to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Romer likes to compare his seven years behind bars to the two
years that Michael Milken served in a low-security work camp, after
making billions from security fraud. And the Rev. Jim Bakker served
only five years for bilking his supporters out of $158 million.
</P>
<P>
   Romer and his family repeat these and other similar facts to
anyone willing to listen. They took out an advertisement in The
Albany Times Union to plead his case of unfair treatment. An
untiring letter-writing campaign on his behalf has been mounted by
Romer; his wife, Rita; his brother, Ted; and his two sons.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike scores of his fellow inmates who are also claiming
that they are wrongly imprisoned, Romer has managed to get elected
officials and sentencing experts to agree with him. So far, four
elected officials, including Assemblymen Richard Gottfried of New
York City and Martin Luster of Ithaca, have written to state
officials to urge a review of Romer's case.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who lost their life savings are as angry with
Romer as they were when he was sent to the Sing Sing Correctional
Facility in 1992. They say that until Romer gives up his unbending
protestations of innocence and convinces the authorities that he
has no stolen money left, the Romer family's tenacious campaign to
drum up public sympathy for Inmate 92A0519 will cut no mustard with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why anyone would have any sympathy for him _ he
didn't have any for his victims,'' said Gabrielle Votano, a New
York art-gallery staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Votano was 17 when her father died _ she lost her mother at
13 _ and Romer, who was a family friend and family lawyer, spoke at
the funeral. Later that day he persuaded her to place her $750,000
inheritance in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well honey, don't worry, your dad and I were good
friends, and all I want to do is take care of you, and I wouldn't
dream of having you pay for my services,''' Ms. Votano recalled in
an interview. He took all her money.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve 1990, Romer disappeared. Nearly two months
later, he turned himself in to the Manhattan district attorney's
office, claiming that he had escaped from a kidnapping by General
Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he vanished from his office in Manhattan, Ms.
Votano and the other defrauded clients received a letter from him
saying that he was dying from a brain tumor but that he had a $23
million life-insurance policy to pay them back for their money,
which, he wrote, he had used ``to feed some hungry and
poverty-stricken people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a fuss, or contact the authorities, the Insurance
Company will use it as an excuse to claim fraud and avoid paying
the Face of the Policy,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Romer was convicted on multiple counts of theft, fraud
and forgery and sentenced to 7{ years to 22{ years in prison. The
state Supreme Court jury found that in addition to Ms. Votano's
money, Romer had stolen $4.1 million from Joseph Marion (the
proceeds of the sale of a business entrusted to Romer), $1.2
million from Judith Ripps, also a lawyer, and $1 million from Ira
Saferstein, an investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not just someone who got in over his head,'' said
Roslynn Mauskopf, who prosecuted Romer in state court and who is
now the state inspector general. ``This was a man who calculated
what he wanted to do and systematically over a period of time stole
more money than any lawyer in the history of the country in order
to feed his grand scheme. And in the process, he devastated the
lives of people who had trusted him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mauskopf said the investigation disclosed that Romer had
deposited the stolen money in various business ventures that he
owned, including a gold mine and an electric-car company, but
prosecutors were not able to trace the money after that. This led
them to believe that Romer had laundered the money and still had it
hidden somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement with Chemical Bank, where the original accounts
were held, Ms. Votano got back about a quarter of what she had
lost, she said. His other victims could not be located for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Romer acted in his own defense and clung to his
assertion that his clients' money had been stolen through
sophisticated computer manipulation by ``X Corporation,'' which he
later said was General Motors. He has never recanted that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never stole a dime,'' he said in a recent interview in the
Sing Sing visitors' room. ``I was kidnapped, my head was split. I
was set up. I was framed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Romer invites skeptics to feel the groove behind his right ear,
where, he said, his kidnappers struck him. But none of his
kidnapping and X Corporation conspiracy defense was allowed to be
entered at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife had two daughters and a son and then adopted
eight more children. They say their family fortune has been
destroyed by the case. Mrs. Romer says she gets by as a teacher at
a halfway house. One daughter, Yael, is a rabbi, and the other
children, all grown, are in business. They and his brother have all
contributed to his campaign to gain his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Romer's manner in the prison visiting room was friendly and
solicitous. When a visitor told him that his conspiracy story was
too far-fetched to be believed, he gave no sign of taking offense.
</P>
<P>
   He compiled an exemplary disciplinary record in Sing Sing while
waiting for his first chance to apply for work release and, last
June, for parole. But the state would not hear of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you in one sentence why he did not get work
release, and that is `Show me the money,''' said James Flateau, a
spokesman for the New York State Department of Correctional
Services. ``Romer can talk all he wants about people in for this
crime or for that crime who got out eventually, but that is totally
immaterial. Every inmate does his time based on his particular
crime. Romer was convicted for stealing, and the prosecutors have
stated that he has millions stashed away for the day he is released
and can live on the fruits of other people's labor.''
</P>
<P>
   In prison parlance, Romer is a ``CMC,'' a centrally monitored
case, and his appeal for parole was handled in Albany instead of by
a downstate parole board, nearer this Westchester County prison.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22 the state Division of Parole wrote to Romer: ``The
multiplicity of the offenses involving numerous victims occurring
over an extended period of years which demonstrated a high degree
of sophistication in you taking advantage of victims who were
particularly vulnerable indicated to this panel that your parole
now would be inappropriate, as well as incompatible with the public
welfare. We note your exemplary institutional programming and model
disciplinary record. You are urged to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The parole board set June 2000 as the earliest that Romer can
apply again.
</P>
<P>
   None of Romer's supporters necessarily buy his X Corporation
story or condone what he did. All crimes are heinous in their own
way, they contend, but that should not prevent the parole system
from working.

THREATENED OVER BOOK, TEACHER LEAVES SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A white third-grade teacher said Monday that she
feared for her safety and would not return to the Brooklyn school
where black parents lashed out at her use of a book that they
believed depicted blacks in a negative light.
</P>
<P>
   It was undecided where the teacher, Ruth Sherman, would be
transferred, but it would not be within District 32 in Bushwick,
where the incident occurred, said Robert Brasco, deputy
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman, 27, was temporarily transferred out of the school a
week ago after at least two parents publicly threatened her over
using a book titled ``Nappy Hair'' by Carolivia Herron, a black
writer and scholar. The class Ms. Sherman taught at Public School
75 is composed largely of black and Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   The book, a coming-of-age story about a black girl, received a
recommendation for classroom use from instructors at Teachers
College at Columbia University. But some parents were offended by
the book's colloquialisms and illustrations, which they construed
as negative characterizations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was the opposite of what Ms. Sherman had hoped to
achieve by reading the book, which was written to build
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My love and sympathy for my students remains, and their love
and support has made my nightmare tolerable,'' Ms. Sherman said in
a statement released Monday by the United Federation of Teachers,
which is assisting her. ``But I have experienced abuse and
tremendous fear brought on by an angry group, and I strongly feel
that I am in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman informed Felix Vazquez, the superintendent, of her
decision not to return to the district during a 20-minute meeting
Monday morning at district headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over'' is all that Ms. Sherman said after the meeting as
she dashed through the parking lot with her fiance and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began on Nov. 23 at a community meeting called to
discuss the hiring of an assistant principal. The meeting turned
raucous when about 10 parents, waving photocopied excerpts of the
book, complained that it was racially insensitive. At least two
threatened ``to get'' Ms. Sherman, said Ron Davis, a spokesman for
the teachers' union. Brasco said the parents could face criminal
charges for threatening Ms. Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman was transferred to district offices while the
superintendent conducted an investigation of the book, which was
deemed appropriate.

OLYMPIAN MOCEANU SEEKS PROTECTIVE ORDER AGAINST FATHER; POLICE
INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS HE TRIED TO HIRE HITMAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Saying her ``life has been hell'' since being declared
a legal adult a month ago, Olympic gold medal gymnast Dominique
Moceanu returned to court Monday to get a protective order against
her father, whom she accuses of stalking her and hiring a man to
kill two of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's known every step and move I've made; everywhere I've
been,'' Moceanu, 17, said Monday evening from an undisclosed
location.
</P>
<P>
   The protective order, which is temporary until a hearing on a
permanent order is heard Dec. 9, prohibits Dumitru Moceanu, 44,
from going to his daughter's school, apartment or training facility
or in any way trying to contact her.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said two Houston police officers came to her Houston
apartment Nov. 13 and told her that her father was negotiating to
pay a hitman $10,000 to kill two of her friends. The friends, Brian
Huggins, 32, and coach Luminita Miscenco, 26, helped Dominique run
away from her parents on Oct. 17 and helped her hide after she
filed her lawsuit Oct. 19 to be declared a legal adult.
</P>
<P>
   HPD spokesman Robert Hurst confirmed Monday that there was an
investigation of alleged threats made by one of the ``parties'' in
Moceanu's adult status lawsuit, but said there is not enough
evidence to pursue any criminal charges. He said the case is closed
and declined to give more details.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Huggins said he will go to court Tuesday to keep
both Dumitru and wife Camelia from contacting his client. Miscenco
was in Las Vegas and not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu, who learned about the protective order from a
reporter because he had not been served with court papers, said he
had no knowledge of murder-for-hire scheme or a HPD investigation.
He denied that he was part of a plot to kill anyone.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Katherine Scardino, said earlier in the day that
she has had conversations with Dumitru Moceanu about the
investigation. She said the allegations were baseless. The lawyer
theorized police felt the need to warn the young gymnast so the
department would not be liable should anything come of the threats.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu said that after all the recent turmoil between
her and her father, she has no doubt he intended to carry out his
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what he's capable of,'' she said. ``For the past 17
years I've suffered mental and physical abuse and stress and I
haven't been able to speak about it till now.''
</P>
<P>
   After running away from home, Dominique has repeatedly said her
parents squandered her money and her childhood. She said a trust
fund established for her since she turned professional at age 10 is
all but gone and that her parents _ immigrants who competed for the
Romanian national gymnastics team _ constantly pressured her to
train and compete.
</P>
<P>
   The parents deny the charges, saying all of Dominique's money
was used to build a 70,000-square-foot gym at 6120 Louetta that she
wanted. Scardino has said her clients told her the gym cost about
$2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique said the two HPD detectives told her, ``Dumitru knows
everything you've done, and basically hired a hitman to kill two of
my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the detectives told her that Dumitru had discussed the
possible death threat with a private investigator whom the father
had hired to watch his daughter. According to Dominique and her
attorney Ellen Yarrell, the private investigator told police about
the plot, and HPD enlisted him in an undercover investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The private detective secretly recorded a conversation with
Dumitru on the matter, Yarrell said. She said she will subpoena the
tape recording that she believes exists. The attorney said the
investigation ended before any money changed hands after her father
found out he was under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said it was her understanding ``someone taped a
conversation that turned out to be nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to speculate on what Dumitru might have said on the
recording, and blamed Dominique for the family friction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole entire actions in this episode have been
incredible,'' Scardino said. ``She has turned her back on her
parents, who've done nothing but devote their lives to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, who was declared a legal adult in court on Oct. 28,
said she has been in hiding since police came to her apartment to
warn her.
</P>
<P>
   She said before that incident, her father would wait outside her
school at Northland Christian School and follow her home to try to
see where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was changing cars on and off, he was trying to sneak up
on me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the only face-to-face encounter she has had with her
father was when he pulled up next to her car after school and
started yelling at her about breaking up the family.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu denied following Dominique after school or
hiring any private investigators to follow her.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique said her father has not cooperated in providing
financial documents so she can figure out where her money has gone.
She said she may take further court action to get an accounting of
her money.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu and his lawyer said they have not been asked for
any documents.
</P>
<P>
   The young gymnast said she will work to persuade the Legislature
to pass laws to ensure that all trust funds set up for children are
controlled by a court. In Texas, trust funds for minors can either
be controlled by a court or trustee, often, and in the case of
Dominique, the parents are the trustee of their children's funds.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is not currently training and has to put these
event behind her before she can think about her gymnastic goals.
Dominique was part of the American gold medal team at the 1996
Olympics and won the all-around competition at the Goodwill Games
in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, there is a love (for her father) but I can't
forgive him. I've gone through so much,'' Dominique said. &QL;

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY TURNS TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite)  (Eds: See also IMPEACH-DEMS-ASSESS, RENO-ICKES) 
(htv) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee took
renewed interest Monday in President Clinton's 1996 campaign
finances and planned to subpoena the director of the FBI and the
Justice Department's former senior prosecutor for campaign finance
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment inquiry into Clinton moving into its final,
critical stages, Republican aides said the committee would vote on
the subpoenas on Tuesday after a full-day hearing intended to
underscore the seriousness of perjury charges like those leveled
against Clinton by Kenneth Starr in his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But moving beyond the Lewinsky matter in yet another effort to
broaden the impeachment inquiry, the committee could take
depositions from the FBI director, Louis Freeh, and the senior
prosecutor, Charles La Bella, as early as the end of this week.
Both Freeh and La Bella have unsuccessfully urged Attorney General
Janet Reno to seek an independent counsel to scrutinize the
president's 1996 campaign finance practices.
</P>
<P>
   The committee Republicans also plan to issue subpoenas demanding
that Clinton and Reno provide the full, unedited memorandums that
Freeh and La Bella wrote to Reno to support their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   And looking for any new evidence of obstruction of justice by
the president, another of the allegations in the Starr report, the
Republicans said they would also seek Justice Department documents
concerning an array of figures under scrutiny in the inquiry into
Democratic fund-raising: John Huang, Johnny Chung, Charlie Trie and
Mark Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' move came on the same day that the White House
rebuffed a committee invitation for Clinton to appear before the
panel, saying it would serve no purpose. The White House left open
the possibility that his lawyers would appear.
</P>
<P>
   With new issues before the committee, Republicans in the full
House appeared divided over how they want to proceed against
Clinton. Some Republicans were starting to call for their
leadership to take a stronger hand in developing a strategy for how
the issue will be dealt with on the floor in December and whether
an impeachment vote would be followed by one on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the most important vote any member of Congress
will ever take and yet there appears to be no strategy,'' said Rep.
Peter King, R-N.Y., who is opposed to impeachment. ``We have
seven-year plans for a balanced budget and five-year plans for a
balanced budget, but there doesn't seem to be a three-week plan for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to approve on a party-line
vote one article of impeachment and possibly up to three by the end
of next week. Republicans were said to be drafting three articles,
one on perjury, one on obstruction of justice and witness
tampering, and one on abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Committee aides said the examination of campaign finance
questions would not alter the plans of the committee chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to send the committee's recommendations on
impeachment to the full House in December.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the committee wanted to see if inquiries into
campaign finance had uncovered accusations of wrongdoing by the
president and whether there was information that could contribute
to a case of obstruction of justice. ``We want to make sure that
we've covered the area,'' the official said. ``It would be
dereliction of duty not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats denounced the new move and were expected to vote
against the subpoenas. ``So we're going to dive into campaign
finance now?'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., a member of the
committee. ``The process gets stranger and stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had previously sought the memorandums of Freeh
and La Bella, but a federal court had told the Justice Department
that it had not shown sufficient reason to hand over the full
documents, which contain grand jury information, lawyers familiar
with the issue said. The Republicans are hoping that the court
would consider a subpoena from Congress to be more serious.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several law-enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity insisted Monday night that the Freeh and La Bella
memorandums did not contain information that would amount to
evidence of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering over campaign finance questions came as
positions appeared to be hardening in the House, in the wake of
Clinton's legalistic answers to 81 question from the committee,
making any compromise short of impeachment ever harder to work out.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the situation, House members say, is that
they are scattered across the country, and the Republican
leadership is still in disarray as the new speaker, Robert
Livingston, tries to assemble a staff and an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to manage the process of coming to rational
decisions when you have chaos around you,'' said one Republican
House member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde Monday denounced Clinton's responses to the 81 questions
about the scandal surrounding his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. ``Instead of shedding new light on the key facts, the
president chose to evade them,'' Hyde said in a two-page statement.
``He has made it very clear he is going to stick with his reliance
on bizarre technical definitions and legalistic defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the president ``did not challenge the truthfulness of
the evidence. Rather, his responses revealed a selective ability to
recall information.'' He warned that Clinton would soon have his
last chance to contest any aspect of the impeachment case built by
Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House left the door open Monday to an appearance
by Clinton's lawyers before the Judiciary Committee, it ruled out
an appearance by the president. ``It won't add any new information
and can be put in the category of a stunt,'' Joe Lockhart, the
White House press secretary said, Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's irritation appeared widely shared by Republicans, even
moderates who might be expected to be skittish about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the presi/dent did a disservice to his case by the
deceptive nature of his responses,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.,
who has said he would not say how he would vote until the House
Judiciary Committee completed its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the public has made clear that it opposes the
impeachment of Clinton, House Republicans now seem to be split. The
Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, one of the most
ideologically polarized committees in the House, are pushing
steadily ahead for an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, too, favor an impeachment vote, most vocal among
them Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip. Republicans
in this faction argue that their party will suffer few political
consequences whether they narrowly fail to impeach the president on
a perjury count, or narrowly succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If they fail, said one House Republican strategist, they will be
able to tell core conservative voters that they made their best
effort against the president. If they succeed, the strategist said,
they do so knowing that the Senate will never muster the votes to
remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans fear that their party will suffer a
backlash from voters if they push through a near-party-line
impeachment vote and that their ability to work with Democrats on
issues of concern to voters will be impaired. Some would like to
see their leaders join with Democrats to work out an agreement to
censure Clinton as an alternative to impeachment, or as an option
for a second vote should an impeachment vote fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you either give him the death penalty or set him
free is kind of ridiculous,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for
Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have a strategy and we go ahead with an
impeachment vote and lose and Congress censures the president,''
said King, ``that will be looked at as a Democratic initiative and
a Democratic victory. We should be on the forefront on censure.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far neither Livingston nor Newt Gingrich, who is speaker
until the 106th Congress convenes in January, has taken an active
role in planning strategy, Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has said he would consider impeachment a vote of
conscience and would not be putting pressure on members. He has
also said he believed the Senate, not the House, would be the
proper forum for any censure agreement. But he has also left the
door open for a censure option to come to the House floor through
the Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Livingston, said Monday that until
the Judiciary Committee takes its final action, ``the question of
who's in charge is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser, Nathan Landow,
invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when
the Judiciary Committee staff sought to depose him. Landow had
invoked the same right when called before the federal grand jury by
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans wanted to question Landow about whether he tried to
influence the testimony of Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer who has said Clinton groped her outside the Oval Office.
Last week, Ms. Willey's lawyer, Daniel Gecker, gave committee
lawyers a sworn statement, but aides said Gecker's answers did not
break any new ground. Republican committee aides said Monday that
they would most likely cancel a deposition scheduled for Thursday
with Robert Bennett, Clinton's personal lawyer in the Paula Corbin
Jones sexual-misconduct case.

ANGELS RESUME QUEST FOR PITCHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Big Unit made a big decision Monday, and
in the process forced the Angels and Dodgers to go to Plan B.
</P>
<P>
   Both local teams were in the hunt for free agent pitcher Randy
Johnson, but Johnson picked the Arizona Diamondbacks, who will pay
him $53 million over four years. His average annual salary of
$13.25 million is second in baseball to Mo Vaughn's $13.33 million
with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what the decision came down to was not money. All
four teams in the running -- Dodgers, Angels, Rangers and
Diamondbacks -- made similar offers. But the Diamondbacks' Bank One
Ballpark is in Phoenix, about a half-hour drive from Johnson's
Paradise Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Diamondbacks convinced Johnson that they are committed
to winning immediately. And with Johnson in their starting
rotation, their chances got significantly better.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Johnson in the Diamondbacks' rotation are recently
signed Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso. Andy Benes and lefties
Brian Anderson and Omar Daal return from last year's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, obviously there are family issues and he's pleased to
spend his life in the Valley for hopefully the rest of his baseball
life,'' Barry Meister, one of Johnson's agents, told a Phoenix
radio station. ``But also from the top, we have a commitment that
the Diamondbacks are going to do what it takes to get to the World
Series and we believe that. . . . What it came down to was that
Arizona really showed us a blueprint for success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was always an interest in his part and a tug in
his heart relative to playing at home,'' Diamondbacks owner Jerry
Colangelo said. ``The big question was how soon could we become
competitive as compared to all of these teams because of his fierce
competitiveness and desire to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt confident from the first day I met with Randy and his
agents. And I felt in my heart of hearts that this was the right
place for him. I believe that many of the moves we made since that
first meeting 29 days ago made the difference. All of those moves
were significant in his eyes, in terms of commitment to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who said the club will now
go after free agent pitcher Kevin Brown, wasn't surprised at
Johnson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you how important his family is to him,'' Malone
said. ``I think you have to compliment and respect a man like that.
You can't be disapppointed knowing what his priorities are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was a longshot because of the commitment to his
family. We knew Arizona probably was the favorite all along because
he just built a home there.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, was 19-11 with a major league-leading 329
strikeouts pitching for the Mariners and Astros last season. He
struggled with the Mariners in the first half of the season (9-10,
4.33 ERA) amid bad blood between himself and Mariners management
because of strained contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But after being traded to Houston on July 31, Johnson went 10-1
with a 1.28 ERA while helping the Astros win the N.L. Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, believed to be one of the two finalists for Johnson,
are disappointed but will move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we made a good, honest effort,'' Angels general manager
Bill Bavasi said. ``We made an effort right out of the chute. We
talked to him the first day we were allowed to. We were up front;
there were good negotiations. But they don't all work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' top priority remains finding a No. 1 starter, which
is bad news for center fielder Jim Edmonds. Had the Angels signed
Johnson, the Angels likely would have kept Edmonds and possibly
traded Garret Anderson for a No. 3 or 4 starter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Edmonds can be used as trade bait to get an ace. Roger
Clemens and Pat Hentgen of the Blue Jays, and Francisco Cordova of
the Pirates are reportedly available for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free agency, trades, you name it -- we've got to find more
pitching,'' Bavasi said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Angels' policy not to discuss names of players they
have an interest in, but Malone made it clear -- the Dodgers want
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had discussions with (agent) Scott Boras about Kevin
Brown,'' he said. ``And there are other pitchers available. Maybe
not high profile, but guys that fit in for us. I like our pitching.
Sure, Randy Johnson or Kevin Brown would help, but we're in good
shape with (Chan Ho) Park, (Darren) Dreifort, (Ismael) Valdes,
(Carlos) Perez and (Dave) Mlicki.''

SOFT OPENING OF `BABE' SEQUEL IS CLOSING ACT FOR EXECUTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The flops just keep coming, and so do the
resignations.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Pictures Chairman Casey Silver, 43, departed Monday
following the disappointing Thanksgiving weekend opening of ``Babe:
Pig in the City.'' The $90 million sequel took in $8.2 million over
the five-day period, or less than one-fifth of Disney's ``A Bug's
Life'' and less than one-third of Paramount's ``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The ax has now fallen on a half-dozen top-level Universal
executives since last spring as Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman of
studio parent Seagram Co., asserts more direct control over
Universal's operations. Bronfman's family controls about one-third
of Montreal-based Seagram.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar wants to take control and run the show,'' said Barry
Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``There's nobody
to blame but him now, because now it's his company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said the poor timing of the release rather than the
quality of the ``Babe'' sequel was likely the key factor in
Silver's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely it would have done better at almost any other
time,'' he said. ``It's hard to compete with a Disney animated film
and their marketing power. So someone has to take the heat, and
it's probably better to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of ``Babe: Pig in the City'' was nearly a repeat
of what happened two weeks ago when ``Meet Joe Black'' opened with
a disappointing $15 million weekend and Universal chairman Frank
Biondi Jr. resigned. Silver's departure has been widely rumored in
recent weeks with the studio's hitless streak dating back to ``The
Lost World: Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his company bought control of Universal in 1995, Bronfman
has shifted Seagram's focus toward entertainment and away from
beverages. The music and theme park businesses have been solid
performers, but the company's core enterprise of making movies has
stumbled at a time when the industry's revenues continue to rise 10
percent annually in the United States and even higher overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Silver's resignation is any surprise, because
the film division has performed so badly,'' said David McFadgen of
Griffiths McBurney Partners. ``Right now, my outlook on Seagram is
it's mildly positive but at the end of the day, I'm in more of a
wait-and-see mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street values Seagram stock far lower than rival
entertainment conglomerates, and the issue was off 93.75 cents
Monday to $34.3125. Shares hit $45 in May following the
announcement of its $10.4 billion buyout of music giant PolyGram
NV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the company continues to underperform, the stock will
continue to be cheap,'' McFadgen said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement of Silver's departure after three years in
the post said his responsibilities would be assumed by Ron Meyer,
Silver's boss and president of Universal Studios. It also said
Stacey Snider, who had been co-president of production, had been
elevated to the post of president of production, a post that had
been vacant since Marc Platt departed in April.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to Universal employees about Silver's resignation,
Meyer said, ``Although it was difficult, both Casey and I believed
it was time to make a change. We have underperformed in our motion
picture business, and we are going to fix what isn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver had been telling reporters and analysts for months that
Universal's late fall-holiday season schedule would pull the studio
out of its downward spiral, but the prospects for its next movie _
an updated version of ``Psycho'' that opens Friday _ are not
particularly impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, believes ``Psycho'' will open with a solid but hardly
blockbuster weekend total of $10 million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes among trackers are much higher for ``Patch Adams,''
opening Dec. 25 with Robin Williams as a medical student who uses
laughter to treat patients.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poor performance of the ``Babe'' sequel was deeply
disappointing, given the good will generated by the 1995 sleeper
hit about a pig who learns to herd sheep. It received an Academy
Award nomination for Best Picture, grossed $64 million in the
United States and about $150 million abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Universal had heavily promoted the movie with a large program of
tie-ins and toys with about 100 licensees. But the film received
only mixed reviews and a spate of negative publicity when it was
forced to delay the world premiere two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst Arthur Rockwell said the studio should have
seen better grosses from the film, adding that the apparent lack of
executive direction in movies might be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted that it's a crowded market, but it's a film designed
for this time of year,'' said Rockwell, a former studio executive.
``The poor grosses are a function of it being mishandled, so they
haven't blown the franchise, but they've damaged it. There has been
no sense that anyone has been running the division effectively for
several years now, along with a sense that the top executives are
preoccupied with music.''
</P>
<P>
   As for 1999, Universal has a respectable slate of films ready,
including ``Life,'' an Eddie Murphy comedy due in February; ``Ed
TV,'' a ``Truman Show''-like comedy out in March; ``The Mummy'' in
early May; and a Steve Martin-Eddie Murphy comedy, ``Bowfinger,''
due in midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still on the fence on Seagram,'' said Linda Bannister of
Edward Jones. ``We're more interested right now in how the PolyGram
integration goes. Box office can be very cyclical, but that doesn't
mean next year won't be good. Movie success is very difficult to
anticipate.''

COURT ALLOWS LIMITED RALLY AT CITY HALL
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court arrived at a Solomonic
solution Monday in a legal challenge to the Giuliani
administration's virtual shutdown of public access to City Hall,
ruling that hundreds of demonstrators could hold a rally Tuesday in
the parking area in front of City Hall but could not set foot on
the building's 11 steps.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, by a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Manhattan, left both sides publicly declaring
partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that the panel had largely ruled in their
favor by reversing several aspects of a decision last week by a
District Court judge and by not impinging on their right to assess
the security needs for City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come in the plaza but not go on the steps,'' Michael
Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said. ``And that's a major
victory for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for Housing Works, an AIDS service organization
that had sued the city over access to City Hall, said that by
winning the right to step beyond the concrete barriers that
surround the building, they had won. ``Our whole point was to be at
City Hall to make this statement,'' Charles King, the group's
co-director, said. ``If I'm standing one step in front of the
steps, I'm going to consider this a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the court left unanswered its reasons for barring
the demonstrators from City Hall's steps. Norman Siegel, the
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which had argued
the case for Housing Works, said he was disappointed with that part
of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel and representatives from Housing Works met Monday with
city and police officials to work out the details for the rally,
which will begin with a parade down Broadway from Houston Street
and end with a news conference in the parking area, which is called
City Hall Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   About 550 people are expected to attend. It marks the first
event staged in front of City Hall by anyone other than the city
since mid-August, when the Police Department launched Operation
Bravo, a plan to tighten security in lower Manhattan.

JOHNSON'S TITLE HOPES WILL SUFFER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It basically came down to a coin flip. The
immediate futures of four franchises were up in the air while star
pitcher Randy Johnson took his sweet ol' time calling out his
preference. Which would it be, the Anaheim Angels or the Arizona
Diamondbacks?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Johnson's decision finally landed with a thud heard
around Southern California. The Diamondbacks it was.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say the Angels lost.
</P>
<P>
   So Anaheim didn't add the left-hander to its starting rotation.
Neither did its hated neighbor to the north. No matter what spin
they put on it publicly, the Dodgers had to be privately gnashing
their teeth over letting Johnson slip through their fingers for a
second time in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   First they moved too slowly to consummate a trade for Johnson in
the spring when he was unhappily ensconced in Seattle, and now
they'll have to face him in divisional play. At least the Texas
Rangers, who were the other team reportedly in the final running
for Johnson, won't have to suffer through that ignominy.
</P>
<P>
   One of Johnson's representatives said the former USC standout
was swayed in the end by the fact ``Arizona really showed us a
blueprint for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but we seem to recall the Angels led their division
for a lot more days this past season than did the expansion
Diamondbacks. Moreover, Anaheim's signing last week of free-agent
slugger Mo Vaughn would seem to have reinforced its foundation
against late-season collapses.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a starting rotation of Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre,
Armando Reynoso, Andy Benes and Brian Anderson or Omar Daal is a
significant stride in the right direction for a Diamondbacks team
that went 65-97 in its inaugural season. But the last time we
checked, Arizona's offense was Travis Lee, Matt Williams, Jay Bell
and a pile of rust.
</P>
<P>
   Williams pursued a move to Arizona because he wanted to be near
his children who reside there with his ex-wife. Johnson also has
familial ties to the area; his permanent residence is in Paradise
Valley, a half-hour's drive from the Diamondbacks' ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing inherently wrong with wanting to be a
year-around father and/or husband. The problem arises when a
quality-of-life decision is passed off as being all about the
quality of the offers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson chose the Diamondbacks because of their blueprint for
success? Yeah, right, and we chose to live in Southern California
because of the traffic. If what Johnson really wants is to win a
World Series title, the Angels would have been his clear-cut
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it's true what one of his representatives
insinuated, that Johnson was put off by the higher taxes in
California, it says a lot about the price Johnson was willing to
pay to contend for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   You would think baseball's ultimate prize would be an
irresistible lure to someone who already has won a Cy Young and the
respect (and in many cases, fear) of his peers. What else
individually is there left for him to achieve?
</P>
<P>
   But hey, we hope he enjoys pitching for a team that's liable to
trigger more flashbacks to his last few weeks in Seattle than those
few blissful months he spent in Houston. At least his wife will be
there to leave the light on when things on the field turn bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the events of the past few days have made it
abundantly clear the egos driving the Fox Group and the Disney
Company are rubbing up against each other like the tectonic plates
underneath our feet.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever there's Fox and Disney in tight proximity, there's
friction. And the resulting tremors would appear to be a fine thing
for long-suffering Dodgers and Angels fans. Or did it escape your
notice that the Angels couldn't be bothered to go after slugger
Mark McGwire or pitching ace Roger Clemens when the Dodgers were a
family-owned entity.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fox takes over the Dodgers and makes noises about becoming
a major player in the free-agent market. And fast as you can say
about-face, the Angels are reaching for their checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the Angels made Vaughn the game's highest-paid
player, the Dodgers reportedly upped their offer to Johnson. Now
they have little choice but to turn their checkbook to San Diego
free agent Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Why, if Fox and Disney aren't careful, their personal grudge
might escalate into the kind of bidding war that makes Southern
California the envy of baseball fans everywhere. &QL;

STORE OWNER INDICTED IN '75 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC KILLING

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An immigrant from the Dominican Republic who has
quietly run a Bronx liquor store for the last few years has been
indicted on charges that he carried out a politically motivated
killing of a journalist in his native country 23 years ago, federal
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Mariano Cabrera Duran, 49, was arrested Saturday
evening at his store, M &AMP; N Wines and Liquors, by federal marshals
and New York police officers at the request of the Dominican
authorities. According to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court
on Nov. 28, the Dominican authorities said Cabrera was ``one of the
persons that shot and killed'' Luis Orlando Martinez Howley in
Santo Domingo on March 17, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was a journalist who wrote articles critical of
President Joaquin Balaguer, now 92, who left office in 1996
following international pressure and allegations of vote fraud in
his 1994 election victory. Balaguer was long accused of human
rights abuses and corruption, and three lawsuits in November 1996
charged that he misappropriated at least $740 million in government
funds and ordered the killing of two opponents, including Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint said Cabrera was implicated as long ago as
Oct. 29, 1975, when he admitted participation in the killing to a
military board of inquiry. Later that year, three other men _
Joaquin Antonio Pou Castro, Rafael Alfredo Lluveres Ricart and Luis
Emilio de la Rosa Beras _ also accused Cabrera, but he was allowed
to immigrate to the United States in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet that killed Martinez was traced by the Dominican
authorities to a .38-caliber revolver assigned to Cabrera while he
served in the Dominican Air Force, the federal complaint said.
Cabrera retired with the rank of sergeant in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera's lawyer, Antonio Martinez of Manhattan, said Monday
night that the federal complaint, which outlines the Dominican
authorities' grounds for extradition, was ``not very specific.'' He
said his that client has a wife in the United States and four
children, three of whom are in the Dominican Republic, and that
Cabrera has never been arrested in the United States or the
Dominican Republic. Cabrera has legal residence in the United
States and has traveled without restriction to the Dominican
Republic, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what he has told me, my client is innocent,''
Martinez said. `` Cabrera has no motive in this affair. Whatever he
did, he would have to do under orders from the military.'' Martinez
said he was not acknowledging any role of his client's in the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, a woman at the liquor store at 550 East 180th
Street, who residents said they thought was Cabrera's wife, hung up
when reached by telephone and ordered a reporter who later went to
the store to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Rojas, 44, the manager of the grocery store next door,
said he did not know Cabrera well, but said to his knowledge,
``He's never been in trouble.'' He added that when federal marshals
and police officers burst into Cabrera's store on Saturday, ``I
thought it was city permits or immigration or something. I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is the victim of a political show,'' said the
lawyer, Martinez. He noted that Balaguer was succeeded by Leonel
Fernandez Reyna, who is critical of Balaguer. ``My man is a very
little fish in this political struggle in the Dominican Republic.''
Cabrera is being held without bail by federal authorities. A
hearing has not been scheduled, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Santo Domingo, Balaguer was called to testify at
the trial of former military officers accused of killing Martinez,
the journalist. In an autobiography in 1988, Balaguer said he knew
more about the Martinez killing, but he inserted a blank page at
that point. He said he had left the relevant information with a
friend, ``who has been instructed by me to make it public some
years after my death.''

NEW YORK LAW FIRMS DISCUSS POSSIBLE MERGER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Partners at two prominent New York law firms _ White
&AMP; Case and Brown &AMP; Wood _ are discussing merging their practices to
create a law firm that would be among the nation's 10 largest.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Wall, a partner at White &AMP; Case who serves on the firm's
management committee, confirmed that the firms were talking, but he
called the discussions ``preliminary.'' Partners at Brown &AMP; Wood
could not immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   If a merger is ultimately approved, the two firms would become
the largest to combine at a time when many have been scrambling to
find partners. Firms say they need to be larger and have offices in
cities throughout the world to better serve their multinational
clients, who are merging themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Citibank is not big enough to compete in the global
economy, it's hard to see how a law firm of 200 or 300 lawyers can
have positive long-term prospects,'' said Jonathan Lindsey, a
recruiter in Manhattan for the legal search firm Major, Hagen &AMP;
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by The National Law Journal, White
&AMP; Case is the nation's seventh-largest firm, with 848 lawyers,
while Brown &AMP; Wood ranked 71st, with 366 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And according to The American Lawyer magazine, the average
compensation for each partner at White &AMP; Case in 1997 was $605,000.
In comparison, the average partner at Brown &AMP; Wood earned $490,000.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a possible merger has spawned discussions in Manhattan's
legal circles of new names for the combination. ``I suggested the
name could be ``Beige &AMP; Wood'' or ``Tan &AMP; Wood,'' Lindsey said,
``but it doesn't seem to have caught on.''

JERSEY CITY TEACHERS RETURN TO WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ A day after ratifying a new three-year
contract, teachers returned to work Monday at the city's 39
schools, with classes returning to normal after a five-day strike
that had paralyzed the school system of 32,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the students were in class Monday, according
to school officials, a notable difference from the 30 percent or so
who attended during the strike. High schools had been closed for
four days, and elementary schools were in session only half days.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge had ordered the teachers back to work by
Monday at the risk of losing their jobs. On Monday, teachers and
administrators tried to get back to the business of education in a
district that has been under state control for nine years because
of poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators and teachers also said they had to begin the work
of healing relations after a bitter dispute that pitted the
teachers mostly against Richard DiPatri, the state-appointed
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and students said that Monday was spent catching up on
what was missed during the strike. Joanne Kenny, DiPatri's
executive assistant, said the school year would probably not be
extended to make up for the strike days.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said that they were glad to get back to
classes, and that they had become bored sitting at home watching
television or talking on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed my chemistry class because we were starting something
real interesting, the periodic table,'' said Shante Brown, 16, who
is in the 11th grade.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 12 down the street, children said they were
again working on real lessons, and not just sitting around coloring
or playing on computers or watching videos as a handful of
substitute teachers watched over them.
</P>
<P>
   At several schools, teachers reported that their principals
brought in cakes and other pastries to welcome the teachers back,
and others broadcast their welcome over the public address system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal told the students that they only had to remember
what last week was like to see how important it was that we were
there,'' said Janet Fegely, who teaches math at Public School 15.

AVERAGE LEGISLATOR PAY COULD RISE TO $91,000 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As the Democratic leaders of the State Assembly
proposed a 38 percent salary increase for the state's elected
officials, Gov. George Pataki reiterated Monday that he did not
think legislators deserved higher pay, but left open the
possibility of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are returning here this week, ostensibly for the
business of electing their leaders for next year, but the question
on most of their minds is whether they will be able to secure their
first raise in 10 years. There is overwhelming support for it in
both houses of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, had a
bill printed over the weekend that would raise the base salary for
members of the Assembly and the Senate to $79,500 a year from
$57,500, starting in January. With stipends for leadership and
committee positions, legislators would earn more than $91,000 on
average, making them the second-highest-paid state legislators,
after California's.
</P>
<P>
   The same bill would increase the annual salaries for the
lieutenant governor, the attorney general and the comptroller to
$151,500 from $110,000. In a separate resolution, the Assembly
Democrats proposed raising the governor's pay to $179,000 from
$130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has signaled for months that he did not favor a raise,
but that he would allow one to become law if he got some
legislation he valued in return. The most commonly mentioned
candidate is a law allowing charter schools, specialized or
privately run schools within the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   The majority Republicans in the Senate have not printed a bill,
but they left no doubt today that they endorsed the Assembly
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Bruno of Brunswick, the majority leader, said Monday
that the raises in the Assembly bill merely kept up with the level
of inflation since the previous raise. ``They are a cost-of-living
adjustment, not an increase in compensation,'' he said. ``Do I
think a cost-of-living adjustment makes some sense? If we're going
to vote on anything, then I think that would make some sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators' pay has not changed in 10 years. Salaries for
statewide officeholders have not changed in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly bill would raise salaries for judges, whose pay
last rose six years ago, by 21 percent. The pay for a justice of
the Supreme Court, the state's principal trial court, would rise to
$136,700, from $113,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also give a 38 percent raise to the commissioners
of state departments, many of whom now earn $90,000 to $105,000 and
have not had a pay increase in 10 years. The salaries of the
governor's own staff members are not set by statute and have been
raised regularly, so that many of the aides now earn well over
$100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he favored a pay increase for judges and
commissioners but considered being a legislator a part-time job.
Legislators protest that the work is full time, even if the
Legislature is only in session six months a year, and that most of
them do not have outside employment.

STANLEY B. KEARL, 84, SCULPTOR AND PROFESSOR

<P>
   Stanley Brandon Kearl, a sculptor, died on Nov. 21 at his home
in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Kearl's small bronze figurative sculptures, which he described
as ``metaphysical realism,'' drew on archaic and classical Greek
art, European Surrealism and biblical references to create private
scenarios that some critics compared to science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Kearl had solo shows at the Institute of Contemporary Art in
Boston (1957), the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers (1969) and the
Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, N.Y. (1982), as well as at
museums and galleries in Basel, Munich, Rome, Stockholm and
Bangkok, Thailand. His work, which is represented by the Arlene
Bujese Gallery in East Hampton, was included in group exhibitions
at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1962) and the Museum of
Modern Art in New York (1965), and at the Venice Biennale in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Kearl had a doctorate in sculpture from the University of Iowa
and most recently taught sculpture at the Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn. For nearly a decade, he lived in Rome as a Fulbright
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Trudie; two stepsons, Richard C.
Holbrooke, President Clinton's special envoy to the Balkans, and
Andrew Holbrooke of Manhattan, and two sisters, Lucille Armati of
Reston, Va., and Roberta Kearl of Connecticut.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the names on Time magazine's list of the 100
``most influential business geniuses of the century,'' some belong
to bosses who dominated American industry: Henry Ford and Bill
Gates, for example. And then, right after Walt Disney, is the name
of a different kind of boss: Charles ``Lucky'' Luciano, the
legendary mafia leader.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, Time had Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much weak thinking about the mafia and so much
romanticizing of it,'' the mayor said at City Hall. ``This idea
that most of these mafia people could have been successful
businessmen if they had only gone into business completely begs the
question. They have a tactic available to them that people can't
use in business, at least not openly, and that is murdering lots of
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``So most of the mafia people that I've met, prosecuted and put
in prison basically have sub-par intelligence, would not have been
successful in business, other than the business of murder,'' he
added. ``And the whole idea of suggesting that creates the further
romanticization of an organization that now is hopefully ending.''
</P>
<P>
   One can only wonder what the mayor would have said if he had
accepted Time's offer to write its article about Luciano (``He
downsized, he restructured and he used Standard &AMP; Poor's as much as
Smith &AMP; Wesson,'' the headline says).
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was, as a former prosecutor, he'd be the perfect
choice to not glorify this guy,'' Bill Saporito, Time's business
editor, said of Giuliani. ``The mayor's people accepted on his
behalf, saying he was excited about it, and two weeks later they
said he'd changed his mind. Didn't say why.'' In place of the
mayor, Time recruited Edna Buchanan, who won a Pulitzer Prize in
1986 as a reporter for the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   An Odd Couple
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the usual sight at the Four Seasons,'' the Rev. Al
Sharpton said, sounding as if he relished the understatement.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was, having lunch (chicken salad) with former Mayor
Edward Koch, who had the chef's salad and who once had him
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago. Monday, they talked about an idea Koch
calls the ``second chance proposal'' to help nonviolent felons
clear their criminal records. Koch said that he and Charles
Ogletree Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, had been
discussing ways to remove the stigma that mandatory sentences for
drug convictions create.
</P>
<P>
   The idea would be to pardon felons who had served their jail
time if they joined some kind of national service corps and passed
drug tests over several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My proposal was you serve for a year or two, during which time
you are tested regularly for drugs and you have to get your GED and
you learn a skill,'' Koch said. ``And then you'll be tested again
for another one or two years, and if you don't show drug use and
don't have another altercation with the law, you'd get a
presidential pardon. So, if you are asked, `Have you ever been
convicted of a crime?' you could answer no. So you can get a job,
vote, raise a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch and Sharpton said they had agreed to arrange a conference
on the proposal next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unlikely combination of Koch and I coming together might
spur people to push for legislation,'' Sharpton said. ``It's not a
sexy issue, and I think we've got to make it that.''
</P>
<P>
   As if that were not enough for one midday encounter, the lunch
proved that Sharpton is something of a celebrity in Koch's circles.
For there was a third person at the table: James Gill, a managing
partner at the law firm where Koch works when he is not deciding
cases on the syndicated television show ``The People's Court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lunch was for 12:15,'' Koch said. ``About 10 of 12, he said:
`I just saw your schedule. Can I come to lunch with you? I want to
meet Al Sharpton.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
More than a month after beginning the free-agent process, Randy
Johnson found the answer he was searching for right outside his
front door.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnson, who spent the final two months of the 1998 season with
the Astros before becoming one of the most sought-after prizes of
this offseason, elected to stay close to his family and in the
National League by agreeing Monday to a four-year, $52.4 million
contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The $13.1 million average annual salary makes Johnson the game's
highest-paid pitcher and second-highest-paid player behind Mo
Vaughn, who will average $13.33 million from last week's six-year
agreement with the Anaheim Angels. Johnson's deal also includes a
club option for a fifth year with a buyout provision.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, a second-year expansion team, had plenty of
leverage in their pursuit of the 6-10 lefthander. Johnson lives in
Paradise Valley, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix and a 20-minute drive
from Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was always an interest on his part and a tug in
his heart relative to playing at home,'' Diamondbacks owner Jerry
Colangelo said. ``The big question was how soon could we become
competitive as compared to all of these teams, because of his
fierce competitiveness and desire to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson chose Arizona ahead of the Angels, Texas Rangers and Los
Angeles Dodgers, each of whom made the Big Unit a four-year offer
worth at least $12 million a year, his representatives said.
</P>
<P>
   If his agent is to be believed, not everything came down to
dollar signs for Johnson. He also was impressed with the
Diamondbacks' commitment to improve drastically from 1998, when
they went 65-97 _ the third-worst record in baseball _ and finished
their inaugural season 33 games behind the San Diego Padres in the
NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to weigh all the factors _ how competitive the team
would be in the future, where his family would be comfortable,''
said Johnson's agent, Barry Meister. ``Money was a non-factor,
because everything was pretty comparable. He made the decision
late, late, late Sunday night, slept on it, still felt that way in
the morning, and we called the other clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who owns a career record of 143-79 and won the 1995
American League Cy Young Award, was unavailable for comment Monday.
He will be introduced as a Diamondback at a Wednesday news
conference at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Already this winter, the Diamondbacks have opened their
pocketbook to the tune of almost $100 million to upgrade a pitching
staff that tied for 12th in the NL with a 4.63 ERA and was last in
the 16-team league with 908 strikeouts. Arizona recently signed
free-agent pitchers Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso to
respective four-year and two-year deals worth $32 million and $5.5
million. They also added reliever Greg Swindell and first baseman
Greg Colbrunn to a nucleus that includes third baseman Matt
Williams, infielder Jay Bell and up-and-coming first baseman Travis
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When the Diamondbacks report to spring training in Tucson,
Ariz., this February, they will have a pitching staff with six
proven starters _ Johnson, Stottlemyre, Reynoso, Andy Benes, Brian
Anderson and Omar Daal. The last two, like Johnson, are
lefthanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Randy, it's possible that we could have the second-best
staff in baseball,'' Colangelo said. ``Our rotation is as
formidable as anybody out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say pitching wins championships. We're going to test that
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Johnson by Arizona did not surprise many,
including Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker. The Astros, to
whom Johnson was traded by the Seattle Mariners on July 31, had
hoped to re-sign Johnson and offered $33 million for three years
before dropping out of the bidding early last week by refusing to
commit to a guaranteed fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt Arizona was the front-runner all along, given
the importance Randy placed on family and the fact he built a
beautiful new home out there,'' Hunsicker said. ``All signs pointed
toward Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker added that, barring injuries, the Diamondbacks are
shaping into a contender within the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are putting a rotation together that has the ability to
win every series they go into,'' he said. ``As we saw in the
playoffs, one player doesn't make the difference in winning or
losing. If they keep their rotation healthy, then other clubs will
have their hands full when playing Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, spent more than eight seasons with Seattle, helping
the Mariners to AL West titles in 1995 and 1997. His relationship
with the Mariners' front office soured after the club refused to
give him a contract extension following the 1997 season. He went
9-10 through July before being shipped to Houston just minutes
before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson became more marketable during his stint with the Astros,
going 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA and 116 strikeouts in 84 innings. In
all, he struck out 329 batters in 1998, the fifth time he has led
the major leagues in strikeouts and the highest total since Nolan
Ryan's 344 with the 1977 Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will get a $5 million signing bonus, $7.35 million next
year and $12.35 million in each of the following three seasons.
Arizona has a $12 million option for 2003 with a $3 million buyout
clause. The contract also includes bonuses if Johnson is a Cy Young
winner.
</P>
<P>
   In order to lure Johnson, the Diamondbacks were apparently
willing to do anything. During Monday's announcement, manager Buck
Showalter said his rules prohibiting facial hair and long hair will
not apply to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Randy right from the get-go we like him just the way
he is,'' Showalter said. ``That rule will be grandfathered for him.
If someone comes to me and says they want to do that, I'll say,
`You match what he does on the mound, and we'll talk about it.'''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ When Texas kicker Kris Stockton booted a 24-yard
field goal with five seconds left to sink Texas A&AMP;M 26-24 on
Friday, the emotions of the Aggies arched over the crossbar with
the ball and plummeted to earth with a resounding thud.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest game of A&AMP;M's year brought the agony of defeat,
leaving the Aggies with the prospect of wrestling No. 2-ranked
Kansas State for the Big 12 championship while riding their lowest
ebb in an otherwise triumphant season.
</P>
<P>
   But coach R.C. Slocum said Monday there is no reason to believe
No. 10 A&AMP;M will be anything less than confident when it bursts onto
the field Saturday at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team, as I've said all along, has demonstrated great
character throughout the course of the season,'' Slocum said. ``I
thought they did that (Friday) playing on the road in an atmosphere
that was charged with all the Ricky Williams record-breaking, big
crowd and all that. I thought they showed a lot of character in
hanging in there, playing, fighting back and actually taking the
lead late in the ballgame. I think we'll have the same thing this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize how good Kansas State is, that we're getting
ready to play a team that a whole lot of people think is the best
in college football,'' added Slocum, who served as a K-State
assistant coach in 1970 and 1971. ``We're seeing that as a
challenge and looking forward to it. And I think our players will
be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after Thanksgiving, the Aggies were outplayed in
virtually every phase of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams ran the Wrecking Crew ragged, gaining 259 yards against
the nation's No. 2 defense to become Division I-A's career rushing
leader.
</P>
<P>
   As for A&AMP;M's offense, running backs Dante Hall and Ja'Mar Toombs
were rendered ineffective as the Aggies netted minus-seven yards on
the ground. And with the exception of a fourth-quarter spurt when
he rallied the troops to a brief lead, quarterback Randy McCown was
kept in a vise.
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly the scenario Slocum had talked about wanting to
avoid at all costs during the preceding week. But the aftershock,
he said, won't be long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to make a point in visiting with the team (to
remind them) that we're 10-2,'' Slocum said. ``Had we lost our
opening game, then lost a game in the middle of the year, we'd be
sitting here 10-2 as the (Big 12) South Zone champions and ranked
No. 10 in the nation. With this team, I think we'd all be very
happy. I think our team will bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we are 10-2 is that this team has great character.
We lost a two-point game on the road to a team that probably has
the Heisman Trophy winner playing tailback for them. They've got an
experienced offensive line. So I don't think there's any
embarrassment over the fact we lost a road conference game by two
points.''
</P>
<P>
   All-America linebacker Dat Nguyen thinks the Aggies will be over
their emotional trauma come kickoff Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge challenge,'' he said. ``We didn't play as well as
we wanted to do, and Texas had a great game. (Saturday) just gives
us another opportunity to go out there and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, having the chance to go play what may be the best team
in the country, I think it's a great opportunity to just go out
there and enjoy ourselves, have some fun. And hopefully, we'll
finish on a positive note.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting on a sour note, losing 23-14 to then-No. 2
Florida State in the Kickoff Classic, A&AMP;M reeled off 10 wins in a
row. Included in that string were victories over No. 2 Nebraska
(28-21), No. 25 Texas Tech (17-10) and No. 13 Missouri (17-14).
</P>
<P>
   But after losing to the Longhorns, the Aggies are again hearing
the tired refrain of Slocum's critics, who say the coach has
repeatedly been unable to win ``the big one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Slocum said. ``I could care less about that.
I think it's something that's been greatly exaggerated. We won a
bunch of big games. This team won 10 straight football games
without a break. Along there were several games that could be
classified as big games. Whether they were winnable or not
winnable, we won 10 in a row. And (Texas) was one where we were on
the road playing a conference game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, Kansas State lost no league games this year.
We lost one. Everybody else lost multiple games. I'll take our
record and put it against anybody else. I think there are about
four teams in the country that would have a better record than we
have (against A&AMP;M's schedule).
</P>
<P>
   ``And to say that you can win 90-something games, average 9.3
wins a year for 10 years, and to say that you don't win big games
somewhere, the logic in that whole statement is missing.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Kansas State coach Bill Snyder is a quiet man who doesn't show much
emotion. He is a man who believes any obstacle can be overcome
through hard work and proper preparation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult to find something that will upset his resolve.
But it's easy to detect a twinge of disgust when Snyder is asked
about the complicated formula that may leave his Wildcats out of
the national-championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series ranks undefeated Kansas State third
behind Tennessee and UCLA. The Wildcats still have the Big 12
Championship Game against Texas A&AMP;M on Saturday in St. Louis to try
to move up a spot _ but A&AMP;M's loss to Texas didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   A win by the Aggies would have made it possible for Kansas State
to earn more BCS points by defeating A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M winning would have been better for us as it relates to the
BCS, but I have a hard time understanding all that,'' Snyder said.
``It still depends on whether we win this game, and we can't take
that for granted by any stretch of the imagination. We're just
preparing to try to win the conference championship. That's what's
on our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe for Snyder. But a few of his players are honest enough to
admit the BCS situation haunts their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real frustrating,'' All-America punt returner David Allen
said. ``We have worked so hard all year to get to this point. We
are the first Kansas State team in history to go 11-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not get a chance to play for the national championship
would be a big disappointment to us. We just have to hope if we win
this game, something good will happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder tells his team to focus on the task at hand and not get
wrapped up in the BCS madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we have an opportunity to impact is the outcome
of our game,'' Snyder said. ``That's the only thing we have any
control over. We understand the situation, but we don't understand
the (BCS) system itself and all the nuances that go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State ranks No. 1 in the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll and
No. 2 in the Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   But the BCS ranking _ which is what matters _ has the Wildcats
No. 3 because of a non-conference lineup of Indiana State, Northern
Illinois and Northeast Louisiana (which have a combined 12-21
record, and Indiana State is a Division I-AA member).
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA defeats Miami on Saturday and Tennessee wins against
Mississippi State in the Southeastern Conference Championship Game,
the only chance Kansas State has of moving up in the BCS is to
defeat the Aggies by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
   So will the Wildcats go in trying to run up the score?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start thinking along those lines, you can create some
big problems for yourself,'' Snyder said. ``A&AMP;M is too good a team
for us to think about winning by a particular margin. We have to do
things the right way just to have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If the oddsmakers are correct, winning shouldn't be much of a
problem for the Wildcats, who are 15-point favorites over the
Aggies (10-2). Texas A&AMP;M was in the BCS picture until its 26-24
loss to Texas on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it (the loss) was very disappointing for them,''
Snyder said. ``But I know (A&AMP;M coach) R.C. (Slocum) does a
marvelous job with his players. I think they will respond in a
positive way. I think they will bounce back and use that game as
motivation, more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies gave up 259 rushing yards to Heisman hopeful Ricky
Williams, the most ever by an individual against an A&AMP;M defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a far better defense than the impression some
people might have gotten against Texas,'' Snyder said. ``It's a
very aggressive defense. They play hard and run extremely well,
which is why they always have a lot of people around the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their players seem to know their schemes well, and they
respond to it. They are very good at handling their individual
responsibilities. But when you watch the (Texas) game on tape, you
see the field condition was not conducive to real efficient
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The only advantage Snyder believes his team might have over the
Aggies is that Kansas State had Thanksgiving weekend off to spend
with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back Sunday, I sensed we were physically
refreshed and mentally refreshed as well,'' Snyder said. ``I think
that's important at this stage of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder wants his players to forget about the BCS rankings and to
try to treat this game like a normal week on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way it is treated by the conference helps us,''
Snyder said. ``It's handled like a regular week, with no hoopla or
extra events to be concerned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's a lot more riding on it than a regular
game. But in terms of preparation, it has some semblance to a
regular game, and that's what we want.''

RADIO DISNEY MAY REPLACE SINATRA IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ WQEW, New York City's only round-the-clock radio
outpost of swing, Sinatra, Broadway and big bands, is about to
trade in its format of American popular standards for all-day
children's programming from the Walt Disney Co. as part of a
proposed marketing deal, executives close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that The New York Times Co., which owns the station,
and ABC Inc., which is owned by the Walt Disney Co., were close to
a deal that would pave the way for the formatting change. In
effect, it would add WQEW, at 1560 on the AM band, to Disney's
national children's radio network, called Radio Disney, which
features music, games and stories for the under-12 set. One
executive said the target date for the agreement was Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The price and terms of the deal _ most likely a so-called local
marketing agreement between the companies that would not involve a
sale _ have not been announced, and officials at ABC and The New
York Times Co. declined to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at WQEW said they had not been told of any coming
change, although one said Monday that a meeting with Times Co.
management had been called for Tuesday morning at the station's
headquarters at 122 Fifth Avenue. The station has a staff of about
20, divided among various unions, including the American Federation
of Television and Radio Artists. Questions about their future have
not yet been publicly answered. Rumors of a possible sale or
business deal have been circulating for weeks, and The Daily News
reported Thursday that talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   In a marketing agreement, the owner of a radio or television
station leases a block of time _ sometimes all its broadcast time _
to another operator. The buyer of the time then arranges the
programming and, depending on the agreement, reaps all or part of
the advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The last Arbitron ratings gave WQEW a weekly cumulative
listenership of 649,000, or 2 percent of the radio audience, a
``very respectable'' share, said Thom Mocarsky, an Arbitron
spokesman. He said this ranked 20th out of about 70 stations in the
metropolitan area. Half the station's listeners are over 65; the
prime age group for radio audiences is considered 25 to 54, but
older listeners may have special appeal for some advertisers, like
retirement funds. Stan Martin, the station manager and music host,
said the figures had been ``trending upward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mocarsky said that Arbitron counted 391 stations devoted to
popular standards as against 38 featuring children's programming,
out of the 12,840 stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to WQEW, there are four stations in the metropolitan
area that emphasize popular standards, all operating outside New
York City with signals that can be heard only intermittently in
small parts of the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the WQEW deal goes through, it will be the second time in
less than seven years that New York City's lone American standards
format has lost its home. That type of music reigned on WNEW-AM for
many years until 1992, when the station was sold to Michael
Bloomberg L.P., which switched to financial news.
</P>
<P>
   The format was then adopted by WQXR-AM, which switched from
classical music. The Times Co., with FCC approval, changed the call
letters to WQEW. The company continues a classical music format on
its other station, WQXR-FM (96.3), which is not involved in the
negotiations, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Where, when and whether show tunes and big bands might find
another all-day home on the radio is not clear. Nathan Leventhal,
the president of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, said he
had heard reports of the possible changeover and had already been
talking to parties who might be interested in relocating the
format, although he would not say whether they controlled radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As just someone who lives this music,'' he said, ``it would be
a tragedy if there's not an outlet for it.'' He said that he was
not taking a position on any format change at WQEW and was speaking
personally, and not an official of Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Lincoln Center is about to inaugurate a new
series called ``American Popular Standards'' under the artistic
direction of Jonathan Schwartz, the author and disk jockey who is
host of a weekend Frank Sinatra show on WQEW. Asked last week about
the reported changeover at the station, Schwartz said he could not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, WQEW will become Radio Disney's 36th
broadcasting outlet in the nation and its first in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Disney entered the field aggressively in 1996, after a
contentious relationship with a partner, Children's Broadcasting
Corporation, a company based in Minnesota that operated 25 stations
as Radio AAHS. Children's Broadcasting later successfully sued
Disney and ABC Radio Networks, claiming that in violation of their
agreement Disney and ABC set up their own competing network, Radio
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Broadcasting later sold its stations and left the
radio business.

CALL HER AN ADVOCATE, NOT AN ARISTOCRAT

 (ATTN: Kan.)   (mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What's a career girl to do when she marries a
millionaire and doesn't have to work anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of women have answered that question by buying Versace,
training at the Waldorf for the right charities and raising money
for hot political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   For Ann Rubenstein Tisch, the answer was to fight bureaucracy
and establish a school for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tisch is a former television reporter whose first job was
carrying her own camera while covering the county courthouse in
Topeka, Kan. ``I thought that was a really good job,'' she said the
other day, sitting in the office of the school she created.
</P>
<P>
   She scraped her way to New York, subbed for Jane Pauley on ``The
Today Show'' and met Andrew Tisch on a blind date, entering the
lives of the rich and famous, rather than just pressing her face
against the glass, as reporters tend to do. But these days, she is
rarely identified as the second wife of Andrew Tisch, heir to the
Loews Corp. family fortune in hotels, insurance, watches and
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, touched by the yearnings of poor minority girls to
aspire to more than having babies, she founded the Young Women's
Leadership School, a public middle school for girls in East Harlem,
two years ago. To the consternation of civil libertarians and
old-line feminists _ who have filed a civil rights challenge
against the school _ it has quadrupled in enrollment, to 217
students.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Tisch is thinking of going national.
</P>
<P>
   When she started the school, she was portrayed in the tabloids
as Lady Bountiful, the dilettante backer of a lace-collar imitation
of Upper East Side prep schools and parochial schools. Ms. Tisch
attends her share of benefits _ breast cancer, Library Lions, the
homeless _ though less so since the births of her two daughters,
now in preschool.
</P>
<P>
   But, she insists, ``I am not a socialite.'' When The New York
Post called her one, she called to complain. The Post reporter
looked it up in Webster's (``a socially prominent person''). ``I
don't go to fashion shows,'' retorted Ms. Tisch, who doesn't even
polish her nails.
</P>
<P>
   She also objects to being called a philanthropist. ``I don't
think I've earned enough of my own money,'' she demurs. What, then,
to call her?
</P>
<P>
   She ponders the question. ``A public-school founder,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Tisch name is etched on brass plaques around the city, from
the Central Park petting zoo to the Children's Museum in Manhattan,
but it is not on display in the Young Women's Leadership School,
which is tucked away on the ninth and 10th floors of a leased
building at 106th Street and Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Private donations to the school, including hers, come to less
than 3 percent of its budget, she said. ``We did not approach this
feeling that money is the school system's biggest problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tisch, 44, who lives on the Upper East Side, functions as
the school's trouble-shooter, fixer and influence peddler.
</P>
<P>
   The school has no gym, so she arranged for the girls to swim at
Asphalt Green, with girls from the Brearley School. When the school
was awaiting books in mid-November because the Board of Education
had not cut a check, Ms. Tisch gave the vendor her American Express
card. ``I'm their mad dog,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Rubenstein grew up in the Country Club district of Kansas
City, Mo., a neighborhood as affluent as the name implies. Her
father, an Annapolis graduate, owned a small finance company. Her
mother volunteered for organizations like the American Jewish
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tisch has looked at both Public School 6, in her
neighborhood, and Nightingale, the single-sex private school, for a
daughter who is entering kindergarten. She thinks that everyone,
not just those who can afford private school, should have the
single-sex option.
</P>
<P>
   The do-good impulse comes naturally. As a child Ann Rubenstein
was stricken with shame when her friends teased a fourth-grade
classmate for doing a project in pencil, instead of Magic Marker,
which the girl could not afford. As a reporter, she hated the
churning of daily journalism, each story as disposable as a wet
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Working as a national correspondent for ``The NBC Nightly
News,'' she visited a school in Milwaukee that had established a
day care center for teen-age mothers. ``Where do you see yourself
10 years from now?'' she asked the students. Out of the corner of
her eye, she saw a tiny girl start to weep quietly. Ms. Tisch
approached the girl but could not get her to talk to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it told me was, the day care center was terrific, but it
was not the answer,'' Ms. Tisch recalled. ``I didn't do anything
with it, but I filed it and I didn't forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She met Andrew in 1989. She left her TV job in 1991, after 19
years in the business.
</P>
<P>
   In her mental Rolodex, she looked up the image of the weeping
girl. The answer, she thought, was a school where girls would be
valued for their intelligence, not their sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Ms. Tisch created the Young Women's Leadership
Foundation and began consulting with people who wanted to set up
similar public schools across the country. It will happen, she
said, though _ scarred by the pending legal action _ she won't say
exactly where. ``I'm a journalist,'' she said. ``I thought people
would talk about this for a day or so. I've been amazed at the legs
it has.''

STATE REJECTS PLAN FOR CULLING HERD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey attorney general's office announced Monday that
plans by Princeton Township to begin eradicating deer with paid
sharpshooters would violate state hunting laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement and a seven-page legal opinion, Attorney
General Peter Verniero said the town could put out bait for deer
and then shoot them with shotguns, muzzle loaders or arrows during
the limited hours permitted for conventional hunting.
</P>
<P>
   But the law allows no exceptions for culling deer with
high-powered rifles, using silencers, shooting at night or using
spotlights, Verniero said. All of these were techniques that the
township was prepared to approve if it had been allowed to retain
White Buffalo Inc., a wildlife management organization that
specializes in culling suburban deer herds using sniper technology.
</P>
<P>
   Township officials said they were disappointed with the decision
and planned to explore whether legislation could be drafted
specifically to permit sharpshooting as a wildlife management tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that is not going to go away and we are
going to have to find some way of addressing it,'' said Phyllis
Marchand, the township mayor and one of hundreds of residents who
has been in a car-deer collision in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bob Shinn, commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Protection, issued a statement saying that the
department was ``sympathetic to the situation of Princeton'' and
would help the township develop a plan for managing its deer that
did not violate state law.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-square-mile township is estimated to have about 1,300
deer in an area that biologists have calculated is appropriate for
300 of the animals.

PASSING OF HOV LANES BRINGS LITTLE SORROW
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARDING TOWNSHIP , N.J. _ Jennifer Heald cannot think of a car
pool that would have anything to do with her.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney, she lives in Bridgewater in central New Jersey,
works in Hackensack up north, and is not sure from day to day
whether or when she is going to her law office or one of three
different courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a soul that goes from Bridgewater to
Hackensack,'' she said. ``It's not a common destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for a long time she has been forced to bear the indignity of
watching a handful of drivers sail along the special car pool lanes
on Interstates 80 and 287 with the hauteur of members of a snooty
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible, absolutely horrible,'' she recalled of her
daily commuting. ``Two lanes would be dead stopped and people in
the HOV lane would be going by at 50 to 55 miles an hour. It
clogged things up and made me half an hour late for work.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, those 30 miles of special lanes for
high-occupancy vehicles, or HOV lanes, were opened to all comers,
which meant that solitary drivers like Ms. Heald had their choice
of as many as four lanes (instead of three or two).
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, it was zooming,'' Ms. Heald said. ``Everybody
was going along like a normal highway.''
</P>
<P>
   The special lanes were consigned to the dustbin of noble
governmental failures under an order from Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman, who has even got federal officials to excuse repayment of
the $240 million it took to build the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   By several standards, the HOV lanes on the two interstates were
a failure. Not only did a number of resentful solitary drivers
sneak into the special lanes each day, but even supporters of
reserved lanes concede that they work best on highways carrying
commuters to a single destination, like the devoted bus lane
leading to the Lincoln Tunnel into Manhattan. Where commuters are
bound for an archipelago of scattered office parks, as they are in
northern New Jersey, arranging car pools and bus schedules becomes
the transportation equivalent of a Rubik's Cube.
</P>
<P>
   According to state transportation officials, no more than 452
vehicles and as few as 32 an hour used the HOV lanes on Interstate
287, compared with an average of 1,500 vehicles per regular lane.
Interstate 80's HOV lanes were used more often, but they did not
relieve congestion in the three general-admission lanes. The
experiment proved that the ``Field of Dreams'' philosophy _ ``if
you build it, they will come'' _ may work for baseball stadiums but
not for HOV lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some car pool adherents were proud of their
contributions to a cleaner environment, of course. At dawn Monday,
Jack Crowley sat in his Toyota pickup in the bleak parking lot of a
Pathmark in Jefferson Township, smiling the smile of the just _ the
last of the just. Crowley had just dropped off his 14-year-old son,
Casey, who was hooking up with three schoolmates and Mike Metalsky,
a biology teacher, to travel in a car pool along Interstate 80 to
Seton Hall Prep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send four boys from Sparta and a teacher to Seton Hall Prep
in West Orange in a single car,'' said Crowley, with the precision
of a consultant for an engineering firm, which he is. ``That's
pretty energy efficient.'' But Monday, Crowley might just as well
have been a righteous teetotaler helplessly watching the beer flow
like water at the end of Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   As with Prohibition, the episode of the northern New Jersey
H.O.V. lanes shows that it is hard for government to make people do
what they see no great reason to do. With an initiative like
recycling, most people have gone along because they know that
cities and towns have run out of space for dumping garbage. But the
drivers on I-80 and I-287 could see firsthand that there was no
easing of congestion or increase in car pooling. By sticking their
heads out the window, they could sniff that traffic-stalled cars
were only aggravating pollution.
</P>
<P>
   However, supporters of car pooling like Judith P. Schleicher,
president of Mc Rides Inc., a nonprofit transportation group, worry
that a day of reckoning has been put off for a few years at best.
With houses and condos sprouting prolifically in northern New
Jersey, each one generating a car or two, the interstates are
expected to be congested again. Officials may once again have to
put pressure on businesses to help their employees arrange car
pools. They may even revive some form of specially designated
lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they do, they will no doubt find ways to claim credit
for the virtues of the outcome. It is interesting to note that
Monday there was only one traffic trouble spot: a three-mile jam on
Interstate 287 North. It was caused by rubbernecking drivers who
wanted to get a glimpse of Governor Whitman, surrounded by
photographers, taking down the last HOV sign.

DODGERS NOW NEED TO SIGN BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy Johnson on the mound Opening Day at Dodger Stadium. Count
on it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he'll be pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks, who
signed him Monday to a four-year, $53 million contract. But if he
is facing Kevin Brown on April 5 at Chavez Ravine, no one will
remember that the Dodgers started the 1999 season 0 for 3.
</P>
<P>
   Monday reminded many of last September, when the Dodgers wanted
Dave Dombrowski as their general manager and wound up with Kevin
Malone. It continued in October when they wanted Felipe Alou as
their manager and got Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, they missed on Randy Johnson, but it was hardly strike
three.
</P>
<P>
   It is not October. It is 2{ months to spring training. Malone
will build a team that will cover all the bases. Davey Johnson will
disrespect enough players to show he is boss. Individually those
two never have fielded teams that underachieved _ a word stitched
on the back of every Dodgers jersey in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But as November becomes December, the missing ingredient still
is Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson might be baseball's most dominant left-hander, a pitcher
the Dodgers courted with $52 million. In Brown, the Dodgers would
get baseball's much more _ and it is reflected in the six-year, $72
million contract he is seeking. But they must step up now if they
truly want to get their team rolling again.
</P>
<P>
   They must forget that Brown will be getting $15 million to pitch
when he is 39. Everyone will be getting $15 million by the time
Brown is 39.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the best teammate a player can have, not because he
always smiles but because he never smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would have made the Dodgers better every fifth day, but
Brown can make the Dodgers better every day. His conditioning, work
ethic and sinker are among the best in the game. Combined, they
provide an example for every member of the Dodgers starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who pitched in the World Series for Florida and San Diego
the past two years, doesn't have a better fastball than Ismael
Valdes, but he has the heart that is so much bigger than the one
Valdes lost the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's true Valdes might be long gone by spring training. He is
one of the few commodities suitable for helping rebuild the
Dodgers' feeble offense. The team likes his ability but says not so
quietly that there might not be any way to salvage the rest of his
game.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the best pitched games involving the Dodgers were
Brown's six-inning perfect game that was lost with one bad inning
and Valdes' two-hit shutout in June against the Oakland A's. Put
those two together and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   There are two names that come to mind when thinking about Brown.
Andy Ashby and Joey Hamilton _ two members of the Padres starting
rotation last season. They were ordinary pitchers who did
extraordinary things with Brown as their guide. Many credit
pitching coach Dave Stewart for adding grit to the Padres rotation.
But that was only partly true. Brown was the beacon and everyone in
the San Diego clubhouse knew it.
</P>
<P>
   He had a confidence that Chan Ho Park lacked for much of last
season. Park was brilliant down in the final months of the season
when everyone except Tom Lasorda knew the season was over. Now, it
is time to see Park do it when it counts, but he should not do it
while trying to be the ace of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of left-hander Carlos Perez. After coming over
from Montreal, he pitched four consecutive complete games in
September. But for all his bravado, Perez has never been in a
meaningful game beyond the All-Star break. It's not his fault, but
there is a lot to learn. Like the games you have to put aside after
the bullpen blows a certain victory. When that happened in the last
week of August, Perez didn't talk to his manager for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dave Mlicki joined the Dodgers, the New York Mets said he
had the best stuff in their organization. But he couldn't get over
the hump because he never believed in himself. In the clubhouse, he
wasn't pompous like Valdes, who never seemed to notice everyone was
glaring at him. Mlicki was one of the good guys. But he also
pitched scared.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Dodgers got closer Jeff Shaw to forget his trade
demand by reworking his contract into a whopper. And they signed
aging center fielder Devon White to a three-year, $12.4 million
contract. But that was just basic accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the heavy lifting. The St. Louis Cardinals know they
won't get 70 home runs from Mark McGwire again and will be going
hard after Brown. So will Baltimore, where Brown pitched in 1995
under Davey Johnson. Brown loved playing in San Diego, but it seems
unlikely San Diego can afford the salary he can command.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado tried to call the six-year contract bluff of Brown's
agent Scott Boras, then called back to say it would like to talk
some more.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Dodgers' competition. For a team that found a way
to unload Bobby Bonilla's contract, it can't seem that daunting.
</P>
<P>
   But the clock is running. Maybe Opening Day isn't so far away,
after all. &QL;

NO HOLIDAY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Holiday Bowl decided Monday that it will not
invite USC under any circumstances, meaning Oregon or Arizona will
be its Pacific-10 Conference representative for the Dec. 30 game.
</P>
<P>
   In a close vote, the San Diego-based bowl's selection committee
decided it would rather have Oregon than USC, provided UCLA goes to
the Fiesta Bowl. If UCLA ends up in the Rose Bowl, the Holiday Bowl
will select Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have every right to do what they want and I have no
problem with that,'' USC athletic director Mike Garrett said. ``I
knew we were bowl bound. You never know what's going to happen.
We're playing in a bowl game and that's what we're shooting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said he expects the Sun Bowl to extend an official
invitation to USC perhaps as early as today. The Trojans (8-4) will
probably play Purdue (8-4) in the New Year's Eve game, even though
the Sun Bowl is not happy about a rematch of the Trojans' season
opener, which USC won 27-17.
</P>
<P>
   If Ohio State were given an at-large berth in a BCS bowl game,
then Purdue would probably go elsewhere and the Trojans could
possibly play Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Bowl executive director John Reid informed the Pac-10
Monday afternoon that the Ducks had been selected over the Trojans
in a narrow vote.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's deciding factors were the number of fans it would bring
who would require hotel rooms, as opposed to USC fans driving down
the day of the game. Oregon also features quarterback Akili Smith,
a San Diego native. The Ducks will play Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the Trojans will play in El Paso will not be a
cause for celebration among most of the players, who preferred San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go to San Diego,'' wide receiver Billy Miller
said. ``It's close and my family can drive down.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne honored: Linebacker Chris Claiborne earned two
prestigious honors. He was named Football News' 1998 Defensive
Player of the Year and also named the Pacific-10 Conference's
Defensive Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players Claiborne beat out for the Football News Award
were linebackers Dat Nguyen of Texas A&AMP;M and Jevon Kearse of
Florida, his two main competitors for the Butkus Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want that Butkus,'' Claiborne said. ``I want to bring it
back here.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Pac-10 team: Five Trojans were first-team selections to the
All-Pac-10 team _ Claiborne, offensive lineman Travis Claridge,
defensive lineman Ennis Davis, cornerback Daylon McCutcheon and
free safety Rashard Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne and Arizona cornerback Chris McAlister were the only
unanimous selections to the team on offense or defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver R. Jay Soward, defensive end Sultan Abdul-Malik
and cornerback Antuan Simmons were named to the second team.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker David Gibson and tailback Chad Morton were named
honorable mention.
</P>
<P>
   Another commitment: Tailback Mike Wagner of Bishop Amat has
orally committed to USC, giving the Trojans their first running
back commitment.
</P>
<P>
   USC has also received commitments from defensive tackles Bernard
Riley and Sagan Atuatasi of Los Alamitos; linebacker Aaron Graham
of Bakersfield; defensive tackle Malcolm Woolridge of Boca Raton,
Fla; wide receiver Kareem Kelly and defensive back Darrell Rideaux
of Long Beach Poly; tight end Jacob Rogers of Oxnard, and
linebacker Markus Steele of Long Beach City College.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HE is a powerful, swift, awesome memory now, like one of those
twisters that come roaring out of the sky unexpectedly and leave
the broken litter of overturned trailer parks in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson and his ferocious fastball spent barely more than
two months in Houston and are now officially part of a brief and
glorious past here with the news that the Arizona Diamondbacks got
their man by putting $52.4 million, cash money, on the barrel head.
</P>
<P>
   For the Astros, it was a marriage that lasted barely longer than
the union of Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra and, in truth, had
the same chance of enduring. The fact the club never heard back
from either Johnson or his agent after making a three-year, $33
million offer says all you need to know about his intention of
returning to our city.
</P>
<P>
   So the Big Unit becomes the Tall Cactus, certainly an apt
description for one who'll be expected to stand like a giant
saguaro, a desert bloom in the midst of a vast, arid wasteland of
expansion talent. It is a prickly development for National League
hitters, who had hoped Johnson would take his gangly frame and
intimidating heater to the Texas Rangers or Anaheim Angels. That
way, he would line them up between his cross hairs in only the
All-Star Game, the World Series or an infrequent interleague
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is the AL batters who've been spared, now having to
stare down the barrel of the rifle at Johnson on only those rare
All-Star or interleague occasions. Because with this decision _ to
stay in his offseason home in the Phoenix area, ostensibly to
finish his career _ the Big Unit has all but written the World
Series out of his future, which speaks volumes about him as a
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   By turning down comparable offers from the Rangers and Angels,
Johnson snubbed both the 1998 AL West champs and the runners-up. By
joining the Diamondbacks, he goes from his last two mound
appearances as the ace of the Astros' staff in the NL Division
Series against the Padres to a role as the lead horse on a
last-place club. Arizona compiled a 65-97 record last season,
finishing 33 games behind the Padres, a gap that doesn't figure to
close much unless the Diamondbacks also plan to reel in free agent
Kevin Brown and an in-his-prime version of the ailing Joe DiMaggio.
By hitching himself to the Diamondbacks' wagon, Johnson confirms
what many have suspected all along. At 6-10, he is simply taller
than your run-of-the-mill money-grubber in baseball, interested in
reaching not so much for glory as for the biggest wad of money and
a comfortable place from which to put his feet up and cruise into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Perplexed Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said he had been
told that the location of spring training was the prime
consideration in Johnson's decision and that Texas and the Los
Angeles Dodgers never stood a chance because they hold their camps
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Is that nice? Johnson, it seems, wants to spend even the six
weeks of spring training near his loved ones. But while family
values are admirable, such a mindset raises considerable questions
about professionalism and a bid for greatness. It shows a player
who ranks personal comfort over team goals, a tepid competitor with
a low priority on winning.
</P>
<P>
   While Ken Caminiti chose to return to the Astros in part out of
desire to be at home with his family, he gave up an additional
$12.5 million in guaranteed money from the Detroit Tigers to do it.
Johnson, it seems, wanted his cake and a chance to eat it in the
outfield Jacuzzi at Arizona's Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   As strictly a capitalist exercise, it is certainly Johnson's
right to get whatever the market will bear. But it is always
disingenuous to hear players say that money and personal whims
don't matter so much. Remember those comments Johnson made about
wanting to see how committed the Astros were to making offseason
moves toward a championship? Obviously, they were more committed
than the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the stirring evenings and the excitement he brought
to our town, it still nags to think of Johnson's poor first half to
the 1998 season, when he underperformed with a 9-10 record and 4.33
ERA in Seattle while being insulted at the notion of pitching for a
mere $6 million. He touched down in Houston and cranked up his arm
to produce a 10-1 record and a 1.28 ERA and pumped up his value on
the free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is gone to the desert, a fitting place, home to other
cold-blooded lizards.
