<HEADLINE> Egypt Ready to Help Somali Reconstruction: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Monday expressed his country's readiness to contribute to
the reconstruction of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Somali President Abdiqasim
Salad Hassan, Moussa said that Egyptian and Somali teams will soon
discuss what Somalia needs and how Egypt could meet its demand.
</P>
<P>
Salad was in Cairo to take part in the 114th session of the Arab
League Foreign Ministers Council on Sunday and Monday during his
first foreign tour after he was elected on August 25 by a
transitional parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a speech Sunday to the council meeting, Salad called on the
other Arab countries to help Somalia in its reconstruction drive
since the country has now a parliament and a president, the first
since 1991 when former president Mohammed Siad Barre was toppled.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he expressed Egypt's support for Salad's election
and discussed with the president the future of the Egyptian-Somali
relations.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that Somalia has now a leader, a (would-be)
government and a system," he said, terming the two countries'
relations as deeply rooted.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the declared opposition of Somali warlords to
Salad, Moussa said Somalia has now a president and Egypt will
develop the relations with him.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he did not rule out the possibility that Egypt
may work to persuade the warlords to cooperate with the president
in a bid to help guarantee that the situation in Somalia will not
regress.
</P>
<P>
Somalia fell into civil strifes, lacking a central government
during the past decade. After the election of Salad, the powerful
warlords said they would not bow to his administration and demanded
that the international community not to recognize him.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Over 8 Tons of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces seized
some 8,874 kilograms of morphine-based drugs in the past two weeks
in the northeastern province of Khorasan, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Afghan drug-dealers were killed and 1,281 other
drug-dealers were arrested in 57 operations in the period,
according to Bahram Nowruzi, an officer of the provincial security
forces.
</P>
<P>
He added that 66 rifles and several rounds of ammunition as well
as 87 cars and 29 motorbikes were confiscated in the operations.
</P>
<P>
Drug hauls have become very common in Iran as it sits on a major
route for smuggling narcotics from the eastern neighbors of
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the lucrative markets in the Persian
Gulf, Europe and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
In July, Iran closed down 725 kilometers of borders with its
eastern neighbor Afghanistan as part of the stepped-up efforts to
fight drug trade and threats to its security.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has also earmarked 200 billion rials (about 24.4
million U.S. dollars) in credits to block the total 950 kilometers
of eastern borders from drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 740 drug traffickers and 174 Iranian police officers
were killed in narcotics-related confrontations, according to
government reports.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Prepares Poverty Reduction Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Monday said that his government has prepared a
poverty reduction strategy with emphasis on agriculture and
education.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is traveling across the country on a campaign tour,
said that the strategy, to be presented to the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors next week, is
designed to speed up the campaign against poverty within the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the strategy, Tanzania is aimed at boosting its
economic growth from the present 4.0 percent to between 7 to 10
percent, which can afford reducing the abject poverty facing most
Tanzanians who survive on 0.65 US dollars per day or less.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, IMF and other donors have asked Tanzania to
prepare the strategy as a condition for finalizing over two
billion US dollars being debt relief to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the government gave education and agriculture its
due importance in the allocation of national resources.
</P>
<P>
"We must modernize our farming system and improve education to
enable the people to have skills needed to manage a modern economy,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
With a foreign debt of around 6 billion US dollars, Tanzania
has been spending about 40 per cent of its annual budget to repay
matured debts.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the heavy debt burden and Tanzania's strive for
sound macro-economic stability, the country qualified early this
year as a potential candidate to get massive debt relief under
HIPC.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged his people to work hard and use their labor power,
knowledge and skills to produce crops and manufactured goods of
high quality and in large quantities to sell in the domestic
market and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Urges India Not to Carry Out New Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland has called on India
not to carry out any more nuclear tests, according to a Swiss
Radio International report.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting Monday in the Swiss capital of Berne,
Swiss Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss told his Indian counterpart
Jaswant Singh that India should show restraint in that aspect.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is among countries which have condemned the
underground nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan in
1998 and urged them to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
Deiss also said that Switzerland is willing to mediate at any
time between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian foreign minister responded that there is no
need for outside intervention. "The need to mediate and facilitate
does not arise since India and Pakistan speak the same language,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Singh stressed the need for more frequent meetings between the
two countries. His visit to Berne was the first by an Indian
foreign minister for nearly 20 years. The Swiss foreign ministry
said Deiss has received an official invitation from India and may
pay a return visit next year.
</P>
<P>
Singh also discussed ways to strengthen business and trade ties
with Swiss Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers have
approved a draft appendix to the Arab League (AL) charter that
would provide for a summit meeting to be held in March each year,
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers gave the approval during the two-day 114th session
of the league's Foreign Ministers Council, Abdel-Meguid told a news
conference at the end of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
A committee grouping the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman,
Tunisia, Syria and Yemen and the AL chief submitted a proposal to
the council meetings on holding annual Arab summits to discuss all
key issues related to the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the league's charter has made no provisions for
summits and considers the ministerial council as the league's
highest body.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said the foreign ministers would convene an
extraordinary meeting in October to consider arrangements
concerning the proposed appendix and to prepare for the summit next
year.
</P>
<P>
Following that meeting, the matter would go to member states for
their ratification, after which the appendix would become part of
the charter and enter into force, he added.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first appendix to the Arab League charter,
which came into effect in 1945 when the league was founded.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Rules out Statehood Declaration on September 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said here on Monday that the Palestinians may not declare an
independent state on September 13 as they have previously planned.
</P>
<P>
September 13 is not "a sacred date," and since the Palestinians
and Israel will continue their negotiations the Palestinians are
unlikely to declare a state that day, said Farouk al Kadoumy,
director of the political department of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is going to New York to meet
with United States President Bill Clinton and discuss with him ways
of seeking breakthroughs in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations, Kadoumy told a news conference after the 114th
session of the Arab League Foreign Ministers Council held in the
Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Clinton are due to meet on the sidelines of the
United Nations Millennium Summit on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The PLO's 129-member central council are reportedly to meet in
Gaza on September 9 and 10 to review the Palestinians' commitment
to declare statehood on September 13. Palestinian officials have
already suggested the move could be deferred.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy also said it is not Arafat's job, but a job of an Arab
summit to declare an end to the conflict with Israel. Arafat can
not proclaim an end to the conflict because it is a decision that
should be taken by an Arab summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said several times that a
final peace accord with the Palestinians must include a statement
declaring an end to their conflict which has lasted over half a
century.

the talks, Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remark on his departure for New York to join
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, who arrived there Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements recently made by Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis that it would be wrong for the Greek Cypriot side to
leave the negotiating table, Kasoulides said "his approach is not
different to ours. We are participating in this dialogue
constructively."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Larnaca airport, southern coast of the island,
Kasoulides made it clear that "we will assess our stance at the end
of this negotiating process and in the light of the facts we will
have before us, in coordination with the Greek government, and the
decision that will be taken by the National Council."
</P>
<P>
The members of the National Council, top advisory body to the
president on the Cyprus issue comprising the leaders of the five
parliamentary parties, will be in New York when the talks resume,
to be available for consultation with President Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the Mediterranean island after a failed coup in
Nicosia seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of proximity talks, or indirect talks between the
two sides through U.N. staffs shuttling between them, have been
held so far, which were aimed at paving the way for substantive
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of talks is due to start in New York on
September 12.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said that if no
substantive consultations take place in New York and if there are
no developments, the assessment is that this round of talks will
end before October.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Officials Visit Iraq for Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting senior Jordanian
officials said here Monday that their visit to Iraq was aimed at
enhancing bilateral relations in all fields, not just in the
economic field.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Trade and Industry Wasif Azar and Minister
of Transport Mohammad Kalaldeh arrived here on Monday evening for a
four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Azar expressed the hope that the visit could serve
to boost overall cooperation between Jordan and Iraq, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"This visit is complementary to the previous visits made by
other Jordanian government ministers," Kalaldeh said, adding that
they will discuss how to promote bilateral trade exchanges through
land and sea transportation.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah, who welcomed his
Jordanian counterparts, said Jordan is among Iraq's most important
trade partners in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
According to Jordan's official statistics, Iraq exported to
Jordan various products valued at some 206 million U.S. dollars in
the first half of this year, which accounted for 67 percent of
Jordan's total imports.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, the only source of crude for Jordan, provides the kingdom
with 50,000 to 750,000 barrels of oil per day at a preferential
price of 19 dollars per barrel, which is much lower than the
international market prices.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two Arab neighbors have witnessed a major
improvement following the July visit to Amman by Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein held talks with the Iraqi
vice president. It was the first time for the Jordanian king to
meet a senior Iraqi official since he assumed the throne in
February last year.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb, who took office on June
19, has pledged closer ties with Iraq and to help end the United
Nations sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Investment in Regional Trade Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania on Monday urged
the four countries involved in the planned Mtwara Development
Corridor to attract investment in the project.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day workshop on the corridor here on Monday,
Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Works, Solomon Odunga, said
the project has enormous potential for creating jobs and bringing
about rapid economic growth in the region, which includes Tanzania,
Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"Member countries of the corridor should improve the investment
climate in the region with a view to linking them with other
countries, other development corridors and the global economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The corridor project is to build a 820-kilometer highway from
the Mtwara Port on Tanzania's southeast coast to Lake Nyasa as a
shortcut for the transportation of goods from the Indian Ocean to
landlocked Malawi and Zambia. It is also expected to spur economic
development in northern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
However, shortage of funds has hampered the implementation of
the project. Bureaucracy, poor infrastructure are also cited as
snag to investors in the region.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Faces Famine Due to Record Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Georgian Agriculture and Food
Minister David Kirvalidze said Monday that a record drought this
summer might plunge his country into famine.
</P>
<P>
The drought, which destroyed almost all grain crops and many of
the vineyards, cost Georgia some 200 million U.S. dollars in
economic loss, the Interfax news agency quoted Kirvalidze as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a Red Cross report about the threat of famine
in Georgia related to drought "is quite true."
</P>
<P>
He said Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze had appealed to
international organizations and countries for aid in overcoming
the consequences of the drought. He said there is hope that the
European Union, the United States and some neighboring countries
will grant Tbilisi seeds and diesel fuel for autumn-time sowing.
</P>
<P>
Independent experts say Georgia will not be able to overcome
the aftermath of the drought alone, because it does not have
enough hard currency to import food, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Many of the country's poor population will face a difficult
winter ahead, the experts predicted.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's new president
will attend the Millennium Summit to be held from September 6 to 8
at the United Nations headquarters in New York, African diplomats
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abdiqassim Salad Hassan, who was elected a week ago by a
parliament operating out of the neighboring state of Djibouti,
will arrive in New York late Monday from Cairo where he addressed
a meeting of Arab foreign ministers, the African diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said Salad had the blessing of the Organization
of African Unity, the Arab League and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
His representation at the Millennium Summit will end more than
a decade's isolation of his impoverished nation, the diplomats
added.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a central government since 1991. Clan
leaders from across Somalia gathered in Djibouti in May of this
year to work out a plan to restore some sort of order to the
fractured nation.
</P>
<P>
A 245-member parliament was created three weeks ago with
representatives from all of Somalia's clans and sub-clans.
Elections were promised after a three-year transitional period.
</P>
<P>
With Salad's representation, only two of the 188 U.N. member
states will not send their highest-ranking representatives to the
summit, namely Kiribati and Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Acting FM Discusses Peace Process With Moroccan King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami visited Morocco on Monday to discuss the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process with King Mohammed VI there,
officials in Israeli Foreign Ministry confirmed.
</P>
<P>
A short statement issued by the ministry said that Ben-Ami, who
was born in Morocco and later immigrated to Israel, met King
Mohammed VI for about two hours.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials said that Ben-Ami left Israel for secret
negotiations abroad, but declined to reveal his destination and
other details.
</P>
<P>
The two, the statement said, discussed the current situation of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which had hit a deadlock since
the Camp David summit in July failed to reach any agreement due to
significant gaps between the two sides over the fate of Jerusalem
and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Ben-Ami reportedly relay the message to King
Mohammed VI that now is the "moment of truth" for Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to make a brave decision. Otherwise, the
statement added, the talks will be endless.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Israel had repeatedly urged Arafat to
show more openness and flexibility in the talks. However, the
Palestinians insisted that Israel should be the side that makes
further compromises in future talks.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference, the Moroccan monarch convened a committee
meeting last week to show Arab countries' support to Arafat's
stands on the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the Moroccan monarch and the Israeli
minister discussed the thorniest issue in Monday's meeting, which
had become the bottleneck of the peace track.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed the holy city as its "eternal and undivided
capital," while the Palestinians want at least East Jerusalem,
which Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, to be the capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the development of bilateral
relations between Israel and Morocco, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, who also holds the Public Security portfolio, took over
the foreign ministry after his predecessor David Levy resigned in
the wake of Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami had played an active role in the talks since May when he
and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala)
launched the so-called "back-channel" negotiations in Stockholm. He
also participated in the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is now also abroad as he has
arrived in New York for the United Nations' Millennium Summit
there. He is scheduled to hold meetings with United States
President Bill Clinton, who will later meet with Arafat separately.
</P>
<P>
The meetings, the first since the Camp David talks, are widely
regarded as the last chance for reviving the Israeli-Palestinian
talks in the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs Meeting Ends With Call for Supporting Palestinians, Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers ended a
two-day meeting here on Monday with a call for the Middle East
peace
talks to proceed according to United Nations Security Council
resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Final resolutions issued late Sunday night, the 114th session of
the Foreign Ministers Council of the 22-member Arab League,
expressed support for the Palestinians in their final-status
negotiations with Israel and for Syria in its frozen peace talks
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The statements said that the issue of Jerusalem is the key to a
final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Arab nation is keen to realize peace according to U.N.
Security Council Resolution 242 which affirms that the Israeli
occupation of Arab lands by force is unacceptable, they said,
calling on permanent members of the Security Council to recognize a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 242 demands Israel withdraw from lands it occupied in
the 1967 Middle East War, including Arab East Jerusalem. Israel has
claimed all of the city its united and eternal capital, but the
move is not recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League resolutions stressed that Palestinian refugees
have the right to return to their homeland, saying that Israel
should shoulder the legal, moral and political responsibility for
the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries also supported Syria's demand for the return
of
all of the occupied Golan Heights and resumption of negotiations
from where they ended, describing all Israeli measures on the Golan
Heights as "illegal, null and void."
</P>
<P>
Syria is seeking the return of the strategic plateau, occupied
by Israel during the 1967 Mideast War, where Israel has built
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers have approved a proposal submitted by
a five-way committee on holding annual Arab summits and decided to
convene an extraordinary foreign minister meeting to prepare for
the summit early next year.

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 4 (Xinhua)-- Iraq has invited 150 tourism
experts from countries worldwide to take part in the upcoming
International Tourism Week in the country, local media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Raheem Karim, director general of the Iraqi
Tourism Committee subordinate to the Ministry of Culture and
Information, said the International Tourism Week has been part of
Iraq's efforts to rejuvenate the country's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Committee will bring the international experts to
Iraq's scenic spots and ask their opinion about how to develop
Iraq's
tourism, Karim said.
</P>
<P>
If the international experts can draw up good tourism
development
plans, the Tourism Committee is ready to buy them over at a high
price, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 150 tourism experts who have been invited by Iraq are from
Indonesia, Lebanon, Bahrain, Japan, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Kenya,
France, Germany, Switzerland and other Asian, African and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with an ancient civilization of over 6,000 years, used to
be a tourism powerhouse with numerous world-famous cultural and
historic sites.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq's tourism industry has suffered heavily since the
United Nations imposed sweeping economic sanctions following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Deputy commander of the
Botswana Defense Force Tebogo Masire called Monday for more joint
training exercises and coordination in peacekeeping operations in
the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
He told a conference in Johannesburg that there was virtually
no combined peacekeeping training in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
"I am sure you will agree that the recent relief operations in
Mozambique did not reflect the combined operations that we dream
of," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 SADC mission to restore stability in Lesotho after an
army mutiny also exposed common shortcomings such as inadequate
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"A lot is still to be done to achieve an above average grade in
combined operations," Masire said.
</P>
<P>
He said a first step to improve coordination would be to set up
some kind of peacekeeping office within the secretariat of SADC.
In this way, the momentum of motivation for SADC members to train
together would be maintained, he added.
</P>
<P>
Masire said an inventory should also be compiled of precisely
what each SADC member could contribute to peacekeeping missions.

<HEADLINE> Poor Economic Situation Blamed For Child Labor in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (
WHO) says the poor economic situation in African countries has led
to unemployment, low income and high levels of poverty.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in high levels of child labor and a huge
problem of street children.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization country representative Edward Maganu
said child survival and welfare is a challenge, adding that there
is need to address priorities for improving the welfare of
children.
</P>
<P>
Maganu was speaking when he officiated at the Christian
Children's Fund(CCF) workshop on the integration of psycho-social
aspects in programming in Lusaka on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said HIV/AIDS pandemic is another serious threat to the
survival and welfare of children because it has left them as
orphans through the death of parents or guardians.
</P>
<P>
Maganu noted that the support that CCF is providing to Zambia
is broad based and multisectoral, adding that it is a clear
demonstration that the organization is committed to supplementing
government efforts in development.
</P>
<P>
He added that poverty should be alleviated at all levels
because it compromises the ability of families to provide their
children's needs.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainable development at community level requires that
families should have the means to raise healthy children and give
them good education. We should remember that children are the
future of our nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Maganu however commended the Zambian government for creating an
enabling environment for the implementation of child survival and
welfare programs as demonstrated through the declaration of 1992
as "The Year of the Zambian Child".
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier CCF Zambia national director Joe Konte said
the workshop would improve the participants knowledge and skills
in planning, programming and implementation of appropriate
strategies.
</P>
<P>
Konte urged the participants to utilize the deliberations fully
in order to find effective means of empowering the communities
they serve.

<P>
 JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A wild elephant
killed one American tourist and injured another during a wildlife
tour in remote northwestern Namibia, the South African Press
Association reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the American tourist named Dean Hall
was killed instantly and Dr. A. Said was injured when a desert
elephant charged a group of tourists trying to photograph it in
the Huab River Valley.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports indicated the tourists had left their
vehicle and walked between two groups of elephants from the same
herd, said Ben Beytel, a senior official with the Ministry of
Environment and Tourism.
</P>

By moving between the two herds, the tourists would appear to
be a threat to the desert elephants, a unique subspecies that has
adapted to the arid conditions of the Namibian desert, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to have been as close as 30 meters from the
smaller group before they realized the danger," he said. "There
are some calves with that group, and there also appears to be a
rather aggressive cow with the same herd," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hall died within minutes of the attack and Said suffered a
broken arm and a knee injury, a medical air-rescue worker told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation played itself out in a matter of 10 to 15
seconds," Said was quoted as saying by the report.
</P>
<P>
Hall's death was the third in the 25,000 sq.-kilometer- area
in three years, Beytel said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is the tourists forget that the animals are wild,
and that they are often spooked by people coming too close to them,
" he said. "We do not see the elephant cow as a problem animal yet.

<HEADLINE> Child Abuse on the Increase in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Child abuse was on the
rise at an unprecedented rate in South Africa with more than 40,
000 cases recorded by police in the past year alone, Jacqueline
Loffell of the Johannesburg Child Welfare Society said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at a three-day international conference on
child abuse and neglect in Johannesburg, Loffell said two children
were raped every hour. This was the tip of the iceberg because
statistics did not include the rape of boys, she added.
</P>
<P>
There were also more than 3,000 children abandoned each year,
resulting in increased child exploitation for commercial sex, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Loffell said the 17 million children in the country made up 40
percent of the population and South Africa was facing major
challenges in establishing protection mechanisms for children.
</P>
<P>
"We need an efficient child protection system because the one
we currently have is very patchy," she said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Noel Zaal, a member of the South Africa Law
Commission, said South Africa had to urgently look at legislation
to protect the rights of children.
</P>
<P>
Zaal called for a broader welfare grant system because the
current one was not easily accessible.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Denies Suspension of Flights to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The British Airways said on
Monday it will not withdraw its services to Harare due to fuel
shortages.
</P>
<P>
As a temporary measure, the British airline said flights from
Harare to London were refueling in Nairobi until sufficient
supplies could be found in Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The airline's country manager Peter Best denied British media
reports that the airline will suspend services until fuel
shortages in Zimbabwe have subsided.
</P>
<P>
The temporary stops in Nairobi would result in delays of about
two hours to the scheduled service.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe remains a critical and important hub for the British
Airways in east and central Africa," said Best. "Any idea that we
are even contemplating a suspension of the route is rubbish. The
British Airways remains wholly committed behind Zimbabwe."
</P>
<P>
Best said his airline was working with local authorities to
resolve the situation and resume normal non-stop service.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Leaves to Attend U.N. Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada left here Monday night for New York to attend the United
Nations Millennium Summit starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As part of his diplomatic and trade mission, Estrada will also
make a working visit to San Francisco, Chicago and Honolulu during
his U.S. trip, the Presidential Palace said earlier in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 heads of state and government from all over the world
have confirmed their attendance in the summit which the United
Nations has described as "the largest ever gathering of world
leaders."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. summit, which will coincide with the opening of the
55th session of the U.N. General Assembly, will be held from
September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Press Undersecretary Michael Toledo, who is a member of the
Philippine delegation, said earlier that President Estrada would
be the 26th speaker in the U.N. summit to be held at the U.N.
General Assembly Hall.
</P>
<P>
Before delivering his address, the president will sign, on
behalf of the Philippine government, two U.N. multilateral accords
namely the "Convention on the Rights of the Child, Optional
Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflicts" and
the "Convention of the Rights of the Child, Optional Protocol on
the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography,"
according to Toledo.
</P>
<P>
As part of his diplomatic thrust, while at the U.N.
headquarters, the president will also hold bilateral meetings with
his counterparts from Indonesia, Qatar, Morocco, Saudi Arabia,
Senegal, Iran and Bangladesh, Toledo said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Intensifies Development of Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is striving to raise the
number of telephone subscribers to 3 million by the end of this
month, Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had 2.95 million telephone subscribers by the end of
August or approximately four telephones per 100 people, according
to the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Corporation (VNPT).
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to gain a year-on-year increase of 80 percent in
telephone expansion as it installs 18,000-20,000 telephones per
week.
</P>
<P>
VNPT is preparing to link its mobile network with international
ones. Agreement has been reached with 80 foreign partners for
provision of mobile phone services and with 25 others for
exploiting its two mobile phone networks, Vinaphone and Mobiphone.
</P>
<P>
The country's international network was officially linked to
the international undersea fibber optic cable named SEA-ME-WE3
along with 34 European, Asian and American countries in 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are now 5,764 direct international channels, with 60
percent operating through fibber optic cables and the remainder
through satellite, thus enabling thousands of international calls
to be carried out simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
In its strategy until 2020, Vietnam plans to raise the number
of telephones for every 100 people to 12-15 by 2010 and 20-25 by
2020, and the rate of households using telephones to 50 percent
and 75 percent in 2010 and 2020, respectively. Its turnover will
be 3 billion U.S. dollars in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam ranked second in the world in terms of telephone
subscription growth in 1999, becoming one of 30 countries
worldwide with more than 2 million phone lines, according to the
International Telecommunications Union.

<HEADLINE> British Hostages in S. Leone to Be Freed Soon: Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The British military mission in
Sierra Leone has expressed optimism that all six soldiers still
being held hostage by the rebel West Side Boys would soon be freed.
</P>
<P>
Talks with the rebel group are progressing well, a spokesman
for the mission was quoted as saying by reports reaching here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys captured 11 British soldiers on August 25.
Those soldiers were among the hundreds staying in Sierra Leone to
help training the country's national army in the densely-forested
Occra Hills area, about 80 kilometers from the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the West Side Boys are expected to leave Freetown
on Monday for the rebel group's base to make a fresh appeal for
the release of the captives, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The first such plea was made last Tuesday, the day before five
of the captives were released.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys had demanded the release of their supporters
from jail, a review of Sierra Leone's peace agreement and their
integration into the country's army, all of which were refused by
the government.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government has reiterated several times its
determination not to make concessions to the hostage-takers.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Supports Debate on Therapeutical Cloning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Romano Prodi, president of
the commission of the European Union (EU) on Monday expressed his
support for the debate on the therapeutical cloning.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the commission should assist a public debate
that resembles the common values of the European Community," said
Prodi in a written statement issued by the commission.
</P>
<P>
He expected that an equilibrium could be struck through the
debate between the ethical concerns and the commercial aspects of
the therapeutical cloning.
</P>
<P>
The EU, however, is opposed to cloning of human embryos. The
union's fifth Framework Program for Research and Technology
Development from 1998 to 2002 excludes financial support for any
research projects concerning the cloning of human embryos for the
purpose of reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Therapeutical cloning involves two basic techniques -- cellular
therapy and formation of embryos via cloning.
</P>
<P>
Cellular therapy, already used for several years already to
cure such diseases as leukemia, aims at replacing diseased human
cells or increasing insufficient cells in human bodies.
</P>
<P>
While it has a prospect of being able to cure degenerative
diseases including the Alzheimer and Parkison syndromes, the
cellular therapy has displayed an inefficiency in dealing with
such problems as incompatible immunology, lack of transplant
organs and absence of graftable cells for several types of human
tissues.
</P>
<P>
Therapeutical cloning, expected to be able to cope with these
problems, will replace the nucleus of ovum with a cell taken from
the patient to be treated and the embryo thus created will only be
used to provide the cells that will later be transplanted back
onto the patient in question.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Urges EU Not to Aid Ukrainian Reactors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The environmentalist group
Greenpeace on Monday urged the European Commission not to finance
Ukraine's nuclear reactors supposed to replace those destroyed by
the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union (EU), is considering a Euratom (European Atomic
Energy Community) loan of 610 million U.S. dollars to the
Ukrainian reactor replacement program.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is still suffering from Chernobyl," said Tobias
Munchmeyer, Greenpeace international nuclear campaigner, adding it
was hardly believable that the commission would support replacing
Chernobyl with two reactors equally dangerous rather than seeking
safer and cheaper energy options.
</P>
<P>
Munchmeyer said that nuclear reactors are never safe and that
the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 reactors expected to replace the
Chernobyl reactors cannot reach the highest possible safety
standards as they are of old design and Ukraine lacks the money
for their maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission is expected to decide on September 6
how to go on with the financing program through the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development for the Ukrainian nuclear
reactors.
</P>
<P>
The bank itself will finally decide on the loan to the
Ukrainian nuclear reactors later this year.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Belgium are formally
opposed to the Ukrainian nuclear reactor program known as the K2R4
project while other EU member states have shown concerns as well,
according to Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
As most EU countries are opposed to financing K2R4, said
Munchmeyer, the European Commission "must reflect this balance"
and reject any commitment to financing the project.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The long weekend for Canada's
Labor Day holiday turns out to be one of the most tragic with 16
people reported killed in road accidents.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was 13 by Monday in Quebec alone, while in
Ontario, three teenagers were dead Sunday after stealing a car and
plunged into a ditch during a high-speed flight.
</P>
<P>
Two horrific crashes claimed nine lives between Friday and

aged from 14 to 20 were in hospital Sunday night without risk of
life.
</P>
<P>
Ontario police said the Pontiac had been reported stolen

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian press Monday warned
that the country's federal government may go bankrupt if it tries
to keep the current wage for its employees under the circumstances
of an oil price fall.
</P>
<P>
The federal government increased the minimum wage for its
government employees from 3500 naira to 7,500 naira (about 110
naira equals to one U. S. dollar) in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has to pay 400 billion naira per annum
for its workers, while its total income stands at 500 billion
naira if the world oil price could maintain at a high level, said
This Day, a leading Nigerian newspaper. The oil price must not
fall below 25 dollars per barrel, the newspaper said, anything
less will be catastrophic as the government stands the risk of
going bankrupt because the balance of a little over 100 billion
naira will be insufficient to meet other pressing needs like the
development of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of Nigerian federal government's income
comes from oil revenue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The euro zone enjoyed a

</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical agency of the EU said that the

euro zone trade with the rest of the world, as expected by some
euro observers.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU, however, suffered a trade deficit of 5.1
billion euro (4.59 billion dollars) with the rest of the world in
June. The bloc enjoyed a surplus of 2.4 billion euro (2.1 billion

OTTAWA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian inspectors have spent
up to 14 hours a day since the Oregon-based Freightliner Corp.

He also explained the Chinese government's consistent position
on chemical weapon disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The five-day symposium, co-sponsored by the Chinese government
and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)
, focuses on the actual implementation of the CWC. More than 80
participants from more than 20 countries are expected to exchange
views for promoting an overall and effective implementation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's opening ceremony, Deputy Director-General of
the OPCW John Gee spoke highly of China's efforts in implementing
the convention and expressed satisfaction with the whole
implementing work within the world since it took effect in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to him, among the 135 contracting countries and the
37 signing countries, most have made obligatory announcements.
</P>
<P>
The OPCW has so far completed 800 inspections on related
facilities of over 40 countries. All countries that own chemical
weapons have started destroying their stockpile and related
facilities, Gee said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on more countries to join the convention.

<HEADLINE> Contacts for Broad-based Coalition with Likud Underway: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Environment Minister
Dalia Itzik said on Monday that she and other members from the
ruling One Israel bloc have been talking with the opposition Likud
leader Ariel Sharon about forming a national unity government if
peace talks with the Palestinians fall though next month.
</P>
<P>
Itzik told Israel Radio that in her view, the Likud also
understands that the present system does not enable the prime
minister to run the country. She believes that time is ripe to cope
with social issues that have been neglected in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Sharon and other Likud members have rejected the idea of
building a national unity government. Likud Knesset (Parliament)
member Tzabi Hanegbi said that Prime Minister Ehud Barak has not
approached the key opposition party.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move late August, Barak reached out to the Likud,
saying that if he fails to reach a peace accord with the
Palestinians, he will form a broad government based on his newly
unveiled social "civic agenda."
</P>
<P>
He called the Likud a natural partner and even said Sharon was
qualified for the post of foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, held that Barak might use the Likud's
possible entry into the coalition as a scare tactic to pressure the
Palestinians into showing flexibility in the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak has slowed down his government reshuffle efforts while
waiting for Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
to demonstrate signs of "flexibility" so as to continue the peace
talks stalled since the July Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
The Barak government has been severely crippled by the
resignations of three right-wing and religious coalition partners
including the Yisrael Ba'aliya, the National Religious Party and
Shas on the eve of his departure for Camp David, and later by the
resignation of former Foreign Minister David Levy and his Gesher
Party from the ruling coalition One Israel.
</P>
<P>
The government is left with only 40 seats in the 120-member
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak has been unable to decide which parties he will bring into
the coalition as he is yet to determine which direction the
government is going to take.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming U.N. Millenium summit, where he is expected to meet
U.S. President Bill Clinton over the peace process, provides a
crucial opportunity for Barak in terms of the fate of the peace
process and of his government.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Barak's office have said that if Barak is able to
reach an agreement, he will bring it back to the Knesset and
breathe new life into his government. If he comes back empty-
handed, new elections appear almost certain.
</P>
<P>
A senior official close to Barak who is on his way to New York
for the Millenium summit said on Monday that the meetings at the
Millennium summit must not be seen as the final date for
negotiations. He emphasized that there is still time to see if
Israel has a true partner for peace.
</P>
<P>
Only then would Barak start to build a unity government with the
Likud, he added.
</P>
<P>
A trilateral meeting between Clinton, Barak and Arafat has not
been scheduled although Clinton is to meet separately with the two
leaders on Wednesday in a new effort to bridge the gaps between
their positions in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak as well as diplomatic officials have been pessimistic
about the chances of a breakthrough at the U.N. summit, the first
major opportunity for the revival of intensive Israeli-Palestinian
talks following the 15-day Camp David summit, which collapsed due
to differences over the core issues the Israelis and Palestinians
have been trying to settle, particularly the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stressed that any settlement must abide by the U.N.
resolutions which called for Israel's withdrawal from occupied
territories it captured during the 1967 Middle East war, including
East Jerusalem. The Palestinians have been striving to establish an
independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Romania Sign Protocol on Justice Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Romania signed on
Monday a justice cooperation protocol, Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The accord, signed by Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk
and his Romanian counterpart Valeriu Stoica, focused on exchange of
information and experience in jurisprudence, education of judges,
prosecutors and other judicial personnel, and preparation of draft
laws.
</P>
<P>
The protocol will be implemented through cooperation programs
that will be prepared annually.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will form expert and working groups to solve
the problems that may occur and to increase the cooperation
programs.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of information will be accelerated by conferences
and seminars that will be jointly held, it said.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing ceremony, Turk said that Turkey and
Romania are two friendly countries which share a common geography
in the Balkans and Black Sea, adding that bilateral relations in
every field will be further improved by this cooperation protocol.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's (EU) acceptance of the two countries as
candidates brought a new dimension to the relations while the
globalization forces all countries to have cooperation with other
countries to fully implement their laws, Turk said.
</P>
<P>
Stoica, who arrived in Ankara Sunday for an official visit, said
that as the members of the Council of Europe (CE), the two
countries has signed several international agreements, adding that
improving cooperation in jurisprudence is important for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Turk indicated that there was no agreement with Romania on the
extradition of political criminals. "The political criminals are
never extradited but there are not any problems in the extradition
of (common) criminals," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Falls to 32-month Low </HEADLINE>

<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso ended
weaker on a 32-month low Monday against the U.S. dollar amid
higher demand for the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed at 45.30 pesos to one dollar, 15 centavos
weaker from last Friday's close of 45.15 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said there is high demand for dollars, as import
requirements of local manufacturers have started picking up.
</P>
<P>
"There are still many corporate clients buying dollars,
especially because it's the import season, and there's little (
dollar) liquidity in the system," a dealer at a major local bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The unresolved domestic political woes and the softer Thai baht
have also helped dampen sentiment on the local currency.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said currency players prefer holding dollars on
expectations the lingering political unrest in Mindanao would haul
up dollar's value over the peso.

Last Saturday, a bomb blast allegedly set up by the Muslim
separatist group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, destroyed an

<HEADLINE> Mandela Vows to Help Rebuild Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela Monday vowed to make war-torn Burundi "a
showpiece of peace and stability", the South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Accepting honorary doctorates from two Sydney universities in
Australia, Mandela said he would mobilize international support to
drag the tiny African country out of poverty because poverty has
compounded Burundi's problems.
</P>
<P>
"The roots of the conflict in Burundi run very deep, but the
competition over scarce resources in a poor country adds
significantly to its occurrence and intensity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is for that reason that I committed myself to mobilizing
international resources and energy to assist in the reconstruction
and development of the Burundi economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mandela helped broker a peace accord last month aimed at ending
the seven-year-old civil war in Burundi which has cost more than
200,000 lives. However, there are still many problems yet to be
resolved before the country can achieve full peace.

This was announced by Angolan Minister of Tourism Jorge

Angola is abundant in tourist resources, with various landforms

<HEADLINE> Romania's Interest Rates to Rise As Inflation Mounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 4 (Xinhua) -- As Romania's inflation is
predicted to go up to 37-38 percent this year, the National Bank (
BNR) plans to raise interest rates, the local Ziarul Financiar
daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year inflation was originally estimated at 27
percent, but such factors as drought and high prices in the
international oil market have pushed it higher. In the first seven
months of the year, the aggregated rate was 24.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We do not seek a sudden rise in interest rates, but they must
be adjusted to the new inflation target," BNR Deputy Governor
Cristian Popa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on deposits currently range between 30 percent
and 38 percent, and with the T-bonds, they stand at 40 percent per
annum. Bankers predicted that the interest rates will hit 40-50
percent this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Romania's national currency leu has depreciated by 26.09
percent since the year's beginning, with the dollar quoted at 23,
019 lei at the end of last week.

MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Five people were detained
Monday on suspicion of involvement in a blast earlier in the day
that killed two people and injured five others in Ryazan, a city
175 kilometers southeast of Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Withdraw From CIS Visa System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday notified the
Executive Committee of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
that it would withdraw from a 1992 agreement on visa-free movement
of CIS citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Bishkek agreement "loses force for Russia 90 days following
the CIS executive committee's receipt of this note," the Interfax
news agency quoted the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov has defended the move,
which was criticized by some other CIS members including Georgia
and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the decision was prompted by concerns over the
dangers of international terrorism, drug trafficking and organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
"These dangers compel the Russian leaders to take appropriate
steps," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Tbilisi, Georgian Minister Without Portfolio Malkhaz
Kakabadze said on Sunday that Russia's withdrawal from the visa-
free system would undoubtedly influence the normal functioning of
the CIS.
</P>
<P>
He accused "certain Russian circles" of being no longer
interested in the CIS, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with reporters last Friday,
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said Russia's withdrawal from
the Bishkek treaty destroys the idea of a CIS free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
"This is Russia's right, but I believe that it should have been
discussed, if we recognize such an instrument as the CIS," Kuchma
said.
</P>
<P>
A free trade zone presupposes "the free movement" of capital,
goods, and people. "If this (free movement) is missing, the idea
of a free trade zone is killed. The question arises: who in this
case needs the CIS?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The CIS includes former Soviet republics Russia, Belarus,
Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Georgia.

<HEADLINE> No German Referendum to Be Held on EU's Enlargement: EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
information service on Monday ruled out what the press described
as a panic caused over the weekend by the EU's German commissioner
on the issue of the EU's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
What the commissioner said in a newspaper interview was meant
to get the broadest possible public support for the process of
enlargement, said a spokesman of the European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
"Both Commissioner Guenther Verheugen and the commission only
wish to get the broadest possible support from the citizens in the
EU member states," said spokesman Jean-Christophe Filori.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen told the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an
interview that German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder should ask the
Germans how they feel about the EU's expansion which is expected
to include 13 more countries.
</P>
<P>
Some press took Verheugen's remark as calling for a referendum
in Germany on the issue of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Filori denied that the commissioner called for a referendum in
his interview with the newspaper, saying that both the
commissioner and the commission wanted to strengthen the process
of enlargement which already went well under way.
</P>
<P>
In August, the EU started a publicity campaign for the
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The EU began talks in 1998 with Hungary, Poland, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus on their entry into the

National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met with Jaime Octavio Cardona Ferreira,

which is of great importance for working out the country's 10th "
five-year plan" (2001-2005) and its economic and social
development in the 21st century, the official said.

<P>
He criticized some local officials for their wrong views of
various issues. On behalf of the State Council, Wang reiterated
that the fifth census is a major government work for this year and

precisely, so as to acquire accurate information on the population,
he said.

socialism.
</P>

As participating partners, these non-communist parties hold
political consultations with the CPC on major issues, so as to
materialize scientific and democratic decision-making while
supervising the ruling party, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The non-communist parties are existing as close friends and
partners of the CPC rather than opposition parties, Wang said. He
called it as a strategic task to train young and middle-aged
cadres of these non-communist parties and build up a high-quality
teams of cadres for the parties.

<P>
Sponsored by the CPPCC National Committee, the academy was
founded in 1956. It was forced to suspend when the "Cultural
Revolution" broke out in 1966 and was reopened in 1983.

and better corporate governance will expand and deepen Hong Kong's
well-established role as a fund of professional expertise, a
center of international experience, and a source and channel of
investment.
</P>
<P>
Yam noted that Hong Kong's banking sector, with its strong
reputation and long involvement in mainland business, stands to
benefit greatly from the liberalization in this area, providing
that it can position itself to make the best out of the
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"As the largest source of foreign direct investment in the
mainland, and as China's main financial conduit and funding center,
Hong Kong will stand to benefit considerably from the increased
demand for banking services in China," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the monetary sphere, the various predictions about the
future development of the Renminbi (the Chinese currency) in the
light of WTO membership would most likely have positive
implications for Hong Kong's economy as a whole, Yam concluded.

<HEADLINE> International Yak Symposium Opens in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Third International
Symposium on Yaks opened today in Lhasa, capital of Tibet
Autonomous Region in southwest China, attracting over 200 Chinese
and overseas experts.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from a dozen of countries and regions have presented
more than 120 academic papers on the breeding, nutrition, and
treatment of diseases of yaks.
</P>
<P>
Business and cooperation talks will also be held during the six-
day symposium to promote the yak industry in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tibet, one of China's five major pastoral areas, is home to
four million yaks or 30 percent of China's total yak pollution.
Meat, dairy and woolen products from yaks are important resources
for the Tibetan economy.
</P>
<P>
However, research on the eco-system of yaks and exploitation of
yak resources are still insufficient, said Jia Bao, a vice-
chairman of the regional government.
</P>
<P>
Denis Hoffmann, a representative from the United Nations Food
and Agricultural Organization, said the symposium will promote the
research of yaks, the protection of relevant resources protection,
tourism and the development of yak products.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliamentary Delegation Visits Poland to Cement Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) delegation left here on Monday for Poland, aiming to
strengthen relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib Al-Jasim, National Assembly secretary and also head of
the delegation, said in a statement that during the visit, he will
hold talks with the speaker and other members of the Polish
parliament to boost ties between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet Polish ministers of foreign affairs,
agriculture, health and higher education to discuss ways to promote
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will brief the Polish side on Iraq's stance on
international issues, Al-Jasim said, adding that Iraq will stress
the necessity of observing the international norms "to guarantee
the interests of all states."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Polish relations have witnessed improvement in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
Polish Ministry of Economy Undersecretary Tadeusz Donocik
visited Iraq at the end of July and held talks with Iraqi Trade
Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah, Minister of Industry and Minerals
Adnan Abd Al-Majid Jasim Al-Ani, and Irrigation Minister Mahmoud
Diyab Al-Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
The Polish official said that Poland is keen to develop trade
ties with Iraq to make up for the heavy losses it suffered in trade
dealings with the country during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade exchanges, which used to be more than 500
million U.S. dollars, almost came to a standstill after the United
Nations imposed stringent sanctions on Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Poland is just one of the European countries which have been
developing trade relations with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food
program in order to gain a slice of Iraq's lucrative reconstruction
market, estimated at about 200 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian program allows Iraq to sell oil under U.N.
supervision to buy humanitarian supplies to alleviate the crippling
impacts of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Hoss Concedes Defeat in Lebanon's Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss Monday conceded defeat in the parliamentary elections and
accused his rival former Premier Rafik al-Hariri of using political
money to influence the elections.
</P>
<P>
"I accept the result democratically and I will act according to
it," Hoss said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
However, Hoss denied reports on his resignation and confirmed
that he will not withdraw from the political scene and will work
outside the parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial results, Hariri scored a landslide
victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections, capturing 18 of the 19
seats in capital Beirut. The only one quota left belongs to a
Hezbollah candidate.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Hoss and parliament member Tammam Salam, who long
dominated Beirut's political scene, were ousted from the 128-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Local media revealed that Hariri won 75 percent of the votes
while Hoss only got about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the elections were "Lebanon's fiercest and dirtiest
elections so far," referring to Hariri's political money and
factional sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Hariri, a billionaire who accumulated money
from construction projects in Saudi Arabia, has earmarked about 50
million U.S. dollars for the elections. The total amount of all
candidates' expenditures is about 200 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israel Opens Domestic Telecoms Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Communications
Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer Monday signed a series of regulations
to open Israel's domestic telecommunications market to competition.
</P>
<P>
The statutes, approved in a vote by Israeli Knesset's
(Parliament) Finance Committee members early Monday, are aiming to
end the market monopoly by the state-owned Bezeq, or Israeli
Telecom company.
</P>
<P>
At a specially-arranged press conference, Ben Eliezer said that
the signing of the statutes ushers in a new era which will give
Israeli citizens a greater choice in all telecommunications fields
as well as better service and prices.
</P>
<P>
"Today I can appear before you and say that the era of
monopolies is over," said Ben Eliezer. "Today we are firing the
starting pistol to open competition in the field of
telecommunications in Israel."
</P>
<P>
He said that any company which wants to enter the market could
apply for licenses from his ministry, providing that the company is
registered in Israel with 20 percent of it controlled by Israeli
residents, has experience in operating telecommunications systems
and has at least 60 million U.S. dollars in capital.
</P>
<P>
Once getting the license approval, the company should begin its
service in 12 months, according to ministry officials. The licenses
will last for 15 years with an option for a 10-year extension.
</P>
<P>
Israel's cable television companies, which have essential
infrastructure to compete with Bezeq in the market, might be the
most likely capable competitor to Bezeq in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Ben Eliezer promised to remove the obstacles for cable companies
to enter the market in the next two or three months, referring to
the ban imposed by the government on these companies' entering the
market.
</P>
<P>
Another regulation, from which Israeli net surfers could
benefit, will allow Bezeq to provide high-speed Internet service to
Israeli households in the nearest future.
</P>
<P>
Israeli antitrust authorities earlier ruled that Bezeq should
not be allowed to begin the service before any competitors could
get a foothold.
</P>
<P>
However, Ben Eliezer said Monday that considering the public's
demand, he preferred to grant Bezeq a license for the service in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Bezeq's ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Loop) technology
will allow net surfers to enjoy fast downloads of music files and
video clips from the Internet at high bandwidth on existing phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
Cable companies are also expected to enter the high-speed
Internet service market through their cable lines.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts also warned that the approval of
deregulation in the telecommunications market will not make the
market inundated with dozens of new companies within days. The
process, they argued, could last for at least 12 months, or even
years.

to bolster Nigeria's peacekeeping capability, Nigerian press
reported Monday.

peacekeeping capability and "increased ability to coordinate
complex operation", they said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Attracts 1.5 Million Tourists in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.5 million
tourists poured into Israel for sightseeing in the first half of
the year, official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
And even better times are expected for the Israeli tourism next
year, given the bookings, particularly if the peace process
continues, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The first six months saw a 30-percent rise in tourism as
compared to the same period last year, the Ha'aretz newspaper
quoted official statistics as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1.4 million tourists arriving in Israel (excluding
visitors participating in cruises), nearly 280,000 came from the
United States, up 14 percent since 1999.
</P>
<P>
The share of the Israeli tourist market from North America,
including Mexico, during the first half of the year, stood at 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
Europeans held a 64 percent share of Israel's tourism during the
same period. Most were from Germany, 114,809 in all, accounting for
8 percent of the total for the period and an increase of 28 percent
over last year.
</P>
<P>
One source to tourism to Israel which witnessed a decline in
figures was Russia. The figures dropped from 25,552 during the
first part of the last year to 18,675 this year, a 27 percent
decline.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the pillar industries of Israel which is rich
in holy sites.
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, Israel reacted strongly to a U.S. statement
warning its citizens over the increase of terrorist threats and
safety concerns in the region, fearing that the warning might
negatively affect the country's tourism.

<HEADLINE> China's Accession to WTO to Boost HK Economy, Economist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior financial official
said Monday that the considerable increase in business on China's
mainland expected to result from its prospective entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will eventually boost Hong Kong's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
made the remarks at a conference on globalization, addressing the
implications for Hong Kong of China's accession to the WTO laying
particular stress on the likely effects on Hong Kong's financial
and banking sector and the question of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"Our estimates within the authority suggest that our re-export
trade, involving the movement of goods to and from the mainland
through Hong Kong, will be considerably boosted, and should raise
our annual GDP growth rate by somewhere between 0.5 percent and
one percent," Yam said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yam, the stimulus to liberalization, globalization
and better corporate governance will expand and deepen Hong Kong's
well-established role as a fund of professional expertise, a
center of international experience, and a source and channel of
investment.
</P>
<P>
Yam noted that Hong Kong's banking sector, with its strong
reputation and long involvement in mainland business, stands to
benefit greatly from the liberalization in this area, providing
that it can position itself to make the best out of the
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"As the largest source of foreign direct investment in the
mainland, and as China's main financial conduit and funding center,
Hong Kong will stand to benefit considerably from the increased
demand for banking services in China," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the monetary sphere, the various predictions about the
future development of the Renminbi (Chinese currency) in the light
of WTO membership would most likely have positive implications for
Hong Kong's economy as a whole, Yam concluded.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Launches Programs to Speed up Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
officially announced here Monday the programs to speed up economic
recovery process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Rizal Ramli told a
press conference, the programs consist of ten points which among
other things are creating the financial stability, increasing the
people's social welfare, developing small and medium industries,
increasing farmers welfare and productivity, prioritizing the
equity-based recovery, increasing exports, launching the value-
creation privatization programs, carrying out the economic
decentralization as well as safeguarding fiscal balancing,
optimizing the use of natural resources and accelerating the
corporate and banking restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
Ramli said the programs will also be outlined in detail under
the new memorandum on the financial and economic policies or so
called the letter of intent (LoI) that is due to be signed by the
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we announce what we said as ten points of programs for
the acceleration of economic recovery. And the IMF has agreed to
include such programs in the new LoI. And I also hope that the
parliament will also give its support to the programs," Ramli said.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic that with the implementation of the programs,
the economic recovery process could be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Ramli said that in a bid to boost efforts in creating financial
stability, his side will strengthen cooperation with the country's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
"We will synchronize our policies with the central bank (
policies) to avoid overlapping," he said, adding the economic team
will also try to improve the market confidence in the national
economic recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
"In term of exports, we hope that the national exports will
become a second locomotive for the economic recovery after
consumption," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, based on a report issued by the National Bureau of
Statistic (BPS), the country's export in July reached its all-time
high with a record of 5.353 billion U.S. dollars or 1.17 percent
higher than the figure in June when it stood at 5.291 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau also disclosed that during January-July this year,
the country's export value reached 34.653 billion dollars or up by
33.68 percent against the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes "Collection of Anna Chennault's Writings" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hebei Publishing House (
HPH) of north China today released in Beijing its latest
publication, the "Collection of Anna Chennault's Writings".
</P>
<P>
The nine-volume collection includes most of Anna Chennault's
writings from the last five decades or more. Articles on political
events, stories on past experiences and memories, novels, poems,
and translation works are included in the collection.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Baoping, HPH president, the collection contains
Anna Chennault's writings published in the Chinese mainland,
Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as in the Chinese-language
newspapers and magazines in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Anna, born in Beijing in 1925, worked as a war correspondent
for the Central News Agency from 1944 to 1948. After being married
in Shanghai to Claire Lee Chennault, commander of the US 14th air
fleet, she emigrated to the US and became a US citizen in 1950.
</P>
<P>
Anna's experiences in the past 75 years have been a major
source for her writing. Anna said she would not have written
anything had it not been for her rich life experiences.
</P>
<P>
Most of Anna's novels use love as a theme. She said, "One will
feel happy in his life only when his heart is filled with love.
Here 'love' is in a broad sense, love for the motherland, love for
his people, love for his friends, and love for all those objects
he admires around him. Love is more important in this material
society."
</P>
<P>
Anna Chennault pays steady attention to the development of
education in the motherland. She has set up funds for college
teachers, and donated funds for the construction of primary
schools in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Anna plans to write another book on the ups and downs she has
witnessed. Although she is engaged in business and politics, it is
writing that she loves the most. "So long as I can hold a pen, I
will continue writing," said Anna. She published her first book at
the age of 15.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on China's Political System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said the election systems in China and the United States can not
possibly be exactly the same, because the historical traditions,
level of education, cultural and economic development and social
systems of our two countries differ.
</P>
<P>
"Each country should institute a system of election in the
light of its own conditions," Jiang said in an interview with Mike
Wallace, 82-year-old anchor of the "60 Minutes" program of the
Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in the seaside resort of
Beidaihe, about 300 kilometers east of Beijing, on August 15.
</P>
<P>
China pursues the National People's Congress system and the
system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under
the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Jiang said,
adding that the CPC is the ruling party, and the eight non-
Communist parties have a role in state affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Some American congressmen ask me which is the opposition party.
And I replied 'Why do you think that there must be opposition
parties?" he said.
</P>
<P>
"You are trying to apply the American values to the whole world,
and you always use your own logic in making judgments about the
political situation of other countries, thinking that everywhere
in the world the American political system may prevail. But that
is not very wise," he said.

BANGKOK -- Thailand's inflation rate is increasing as higher
crude oil prices pushed up retail prices of gasoline and diesel
and increased electricity costs and food prices, a report from the
government said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index, the broadest gauge of inflation, rose
O.6 percent in August from the previous month, the biggest monthly
increase since April 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government will try to limit price increases to a maximum
of 2.2 percent for the full year through price controls and
informal requests to vendors, the report said.

NEW DELHI -- India's inflation rate fell below the six percent

The inflation rate fell to 5.73 percent from the level of 6.03
percent in the previous week mainly due to a decline in the prices
of non-food articles, said the release.

CHANGSHA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A bullet-shaped locomotive

the Zhuzhou Locomotive Plant in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The electric-powered train engine called "Lanjian" (Blue Arrow)
has been designated as one of China's key technological research
programs. Ten academicians from the Chinese Academy of Engineering
(CAE) observed the production with engineers and experts from the
plant here Sunday.

MANILA -- The Philippine government said Monday it has the
capacity to finance the budget deficit which shot up to 59.7
billion pesos (1.49 billion U.S. dollars) as of July against a
full-year target of 62.5 billion pesos (1.56 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This position was made by National Treasurer Leonor Briones to
downplay reports that the government may incur more than the
target deficit set by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Briones said that the financial situation in the country is
strong because the domestic market is liquid at this time
considering that there are more fund inflows brought about by the
raising of the proceeds from the privatization bonds amounting to
8 billion pesos (200 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants Non-Trade Barriers Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday suggested
that the non-trade barriers be removed first between ASEAN and
Australia/New Zealand, which is known as Closer Economic Relation
(CER).
</P>
<P>
A special task force is studying the possibility of setting up
a free trade area (FTA) between the two groupings.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz proposed that the special task force focus on removing the
non-trade barriers and look at facilitating trade between the two
groupings as a short-term measure as efforts to establish a FTA
will take time.
</P>
<P>
"Removing trade barriers would require time as it involves
further negotiations on the mechanism for the free trade area,"
Rafidah told reporters after meeting New Zealand's Minister for
Trade Negotiations, Rural Affairs and Agriculture, Jim Sutton,
here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is less concerned over removing the trade barriers
since 60 percent of its goods are already on the zero-duty list,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are more concerned on the removal of non-trade barriers
which hinder the smooth flow of goods and services between the two
groupings," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
She said ASEAN was currently fully occupied with the process of
implementing AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area) rather than focusing on
establishing FTA between AFTA and CER.
</P>
<P>
The task force, set up after the ASEAN Economic Ministers
Meeting (AEM) in Singapore in September 1999, is scheduled to
table its study and recommendations for consideration at the next
AEM in Thailand this October.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia-Motor Sales Show Strong Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian motorcycle
sales demonstrated a strong recovery to increase 54.3 percent in
the first seven months on a year-on-year basis, according to a
report from Honda Motor Company's regional headquarters here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Total sales in the Southeast Asian market during the January-to-
July period recorded at 1.15 million units, with Thailand
maintaining its position as the region's largest motorcycle market,
followed by Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, it said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the regional growth is largely powered by a 101.6
percent increase in Indonesia, it said if the Indonesian sales
continue to grow, it is likely to take Thailand's place as the
world's third-largest motorcycle market, after China and India, at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Based on the current sales trends, it expected that the total
Southeast Asian motorcycle sales this year is likely to reach 2.7
million units, up 80 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The regional sales have peaked in 1997 with total sales of 3.3
million units, but severely decreased in 1998 and 1999 due to the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, Honda company still led the market share of 30
percent, followed by Kawasaki, Yamaha and Suzuki, it added.

<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Two persons died while 11
others were injured in two incidents triggered by grenade blasts
Sunday in Cotabato province in the southern Philippines, the
official Philippines News Agency said Monday in a report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the first explosion occurred in a
benefit dance in Libungan town after a drunkard dropped a hand
grenade in the middle of the dance floor that killed him and
another male. Nine people were hurt in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Pigcawayan town, two farmers were injured when an
M-79 grenade landed at their farm lot in a remote village.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still trying to determine the perpetrators'
motive in both incidents.
</P>
<P>
Only last Thursday, three separate blasts rocked Kidapawan City
and Kabacan town, both in Cotabato province. A total of 19
civilians were injured, including an 11-year-old boy who is
suffering from third degree burns.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors' Share Accounts for 7.8 percent of S. Korea's GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The share by foreign investors
in South Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) hit 7.8 percent in
1999, up from 2.6 percent in 1996, the South Korean Maeil Business
Newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said foreigner investors are responsible for 30-
percent of the local stock market's capitalization and their
contribution to the economy has been on a steady rise.
</P>
<P>
Sales by South Korean firms with foreign stock ownership
surpassing 50 percent grew to 18.5 percent in the manufacturing
sector in 1999, up from 5.5 percent in 1996 before a financial
crisis hit the country in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Those firms also saw their value-added and job creation rates
rise to 21.2 percent and 9.7 percent from 4.6 percent and 3.8
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government said the ratio of foreign
investments against GDP remain at a low level, compared with the
worldwide average of 11.7 percent in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy wishes to raise
the GDP portion of foreign investments to around 20 percent, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
However, some South Korean experts are concerned about the
widening gap between foreign owned firms and South Korean firms as
the former registered a growth of ordinary profits at an average
11.7 percent in 1999 while the latter recorded a 1.1-percent loss
in ordinary profits.

<HEADLINE> Metal Strip Causing Crash of Concorde Could Have Come from U.S. Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The metal strip which caused the
crash of the Air France Concorde aircraft on July 25 could have
come from a DC10 plane of the U.S. Continental Airlines, the U.S.
Continental Airlines said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. air company said in a communique that the French
Bureau of Accident Investigation (BEA) informed it on September 1
that it would inspect the DC10 plane which made a transit at the
Charles-de-Gaulle-Roissy airport soon before the accident took
place on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The BEA wanted to make sure if the 43-centimeter metal strip
found on the runway of the Concorde was from the DC10.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Continental and officials from BEA and the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board which is the U.S. counterpart
of BEA inspected the plane on Saturday in Houston and found that a
metal strip "of a shape similar" with the metal strip suspected to
have caused the crash of the Concorde was missing from the plane,
said Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
But it is not determined so far whether the metal strip found
on the runway was really from the DC10 or not, it said.
</P>
<P>
The metal strip could have punctured a tire on the
undercarriage of the Concorde, resulting in a chain reaction
including the fire which broke out on the rear part of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The Concorde crash killed 113 people, most of them German
tourists.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang on Press Freedom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said recently that "We do have freedom of the press in China."
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark in an interview with Mike Wallace, 82-
year-old anchor of the "60 Minutes" program of the Columbia
Broadcasting System (CBS), in the seaside resort of Beidaihe,
about 300 kilometers east of Beijing, on August 15.
</P>
<P>
He told the American newsman that China carries out the policy
of "allowing one hundred different flowers to blossom and one
hundred different schools of thoughts to contend".
</P>
<P>
But freedom of the press "should be subordinate to and serve and
defend the interests of the nation and the public," Jiang stressed.
"I suppose it is the same case in the West."
</P>
<P>
"I think all countries and parties must have their own
publications to publicize their ideas and propositions", he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I want to say is that in such a big country
with a population of over 1.2 billion, the media indeed plays a
very important role in shaping public opinion," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"I think for both the Chinese media and Western media, one thing
is very important, that is, they should never distort facts though
they are free to have their own opinions," the Chinese President
said.
</P>
<P>
People in China pay great attention to the media, especially
the People's Daily, Jiang noted, and if there is a factual error,
people would take it for truth.
</P>
<P>
He told the American reporter that "it is not like in your
country where some people may sometimes make up stories at will.
They don't care even if their report does not reflect the whole
truth."
</P>
<P>
He said that we hope people will learn a lot of useful things
and useful information from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, sometimes there is also unhealthy
stuff, and especially pornography on the Internet, which does a
great harm to our youngsters.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be selective, as is in the United States," Jiang
said. "For instance, as far as I know, there is little U.S.
coverage of news in China."
</P>
<P>
"One thing I have to admit is that the level of the U.S.
technology in this field is much higher than ours. I am not
talking about advanced equipment, but rather the requirement of
the U.S. media in selection of the news," the Chinese President
said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua)-- "I often ask myself how to
ensure a happy life and constantly improve the living standards
for the 1.2 billion Chinese people," said Chinese President Jiang
zemin during a recent interview with an American newsman.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in an interview with Mike Wallace, 82-
year-old anchor of the "60 Minutes" program of the Columbia
Broadcasting System (CBS), in the seaside resort of Beidaihe,
about 300 kilometers east of Beijing, on August 15.
</P>
<P>
"First I joined the student movement fighting against Japanese
imperialism," Jiang recalled. "After World War II, we fought
against the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang, because at that
time there was no democracy, no freedom in the country."
</P>
<P>
"But ever since the People's Republic of China was founded, we'
ve always been working to promote people's democracy in our
country," the Chinese President said.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang said, "we could not possibly allow those people
with ulterior motives to overthrow the government under the
pretext of democracy and freedom."
</P>
<P>
Under China's Constitution and law, people have the freedom of
religious belief, Jiang noted. But Falungong is a cult, he
stressed, adding that it is totally different from religion.
</P>
<P>
"I think China and the United States differ greatly in terms of
our values," Jiang told the American reporter.
</P>
<P>
Everyday, 52,000 babies are born in our country and this will
add up to 20 million a year, Jiang said. So, it is indeed a very
tough job to upgrade the living standards of the Chinese people,
Jiang noted.

</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by a farmer in Xianyang, where 27 tombs
dating back to the Han (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) and Tang (A.D. 618-907)
dynasties were found. The farmer found a great amount of bones
scattered underground on a piece of land near the Yangling
Mausoleum when he dug a reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Further excavation showed that the place had been a graveyard
for more than 10,000 mausoleum builders, whose heads and bodies
were buried in different places.

-- Ancient Tombs Discovered in Beijing
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have discovered an unusual group of 72
tombs in Beijing's eastern suburbs, with the earliest dating back
to 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The graveyard is the biggest of its kind found in the Chinese
capital, the archaeologists said, adding that they might lead to
the discovery of a big ruined city in Yanqing, Beijing's satellite
city.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tombs belonged to the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 220 A.
D.) and Tang Dynasty (A.D. 618-906), from which the archaeologists
have unearthed some pottery and iron and bronze vessels.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Acting FM Abroad on Secret Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami had left the country for secret
negotiations abroad, officials with the Foreign Ministry confirmed
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The officials refused to reveal Ben-Ami's destination and any
other details, only saying that his travels are related to the
ongoing peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.It appears,
according to a report on Israel's Ha'aretz daily's website, that
Ben-Ami has gone to an Arab country for secret talks.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, who also holds the Public Security portfolio, took over
the foreign ministry after his predecessor David Levy resigned in
the wake of Camp David peace summit in July.
</P>
<P>
He had played an active role in the talks in May when he and
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala)
launched the so-called "back-channel" negotiations in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
He also participated in the U.S.-sponsored Camp David talks,
which was attended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
The summit failed to reach any agreement after 15-day-long
exhausting talks.
</P>
<P>
Since the summit failure, Ben-Ami and Israeli Regional
Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres had spearheaded Israel's
worldwide campaign to explicate to world leaders Israeli stands on
all core issues between Israel and the Palestinians, especially on
the thorniest issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak had arrived in New York to attend the United Nations'
Millennium Summit there. He is scheduled to hold meetings with
Clinton, who will later meet with Arafat separately.
</P>
<P>
These meetings are widely regarded as the last chance for
reviving Israeli-Palestinian talks in the next few weeks.

expected to sign the long-awaited regulations on Monday that will
open the domestic telecommunications market to competition and lay
down provisions for high-speed Internet.
</P>
<P>
The signing comes as the government moves toward the

telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said during the weekly
cabinet meeting on Sunday that Lebanese parliamentary elections
mark a change in direction that will help diminish Syria's
influence in Lebanon.

<P>
The poll is the first tangible evidence of the changes wrought
by Israel's unilateral withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some 100 days have passed since the Israeli pullout,
Barak said there were hope and opportunity now for relations with
Lebanon as well as Syria, which still maintains a presence of some
30,000 soldiers in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Former leader of the Israeli ultra-Orthodox Shas party Aryeh
Deri began serving his three-year prison sentence at Ma'asiyahu
Prison in Ramla in the midwest part of the country as the first ex-
minister in Israeli history to go to jail.
</P>
<P>
Deri, convicted of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, arrived
at the prison two hours late accompanied by thousands of
supporters, including Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Sunday night left for New
York to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit after telling his cabinet
that he would make use of the meeting to determine whether
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is willing to
show any more flexibility since the failed Camp David peace talks
in July.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to discuss the peace talks stalemate when he
meets U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is also to meet Arafat
during the U.N. summit which will attract some 160 world leaders.

<P>
ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>

<P>

items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian government has decided to carry out a new
program to upgrade its economic performance, find out final
solutions to the problems of recession and liquidity squeeze,
increase foreign investments, curb imports and raise exports.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atef Obeid will review Monday in a ministerial
meeting the government's plan on upgrading the country's
infrastructure and setting up new schools.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian government has drawn up plans for more gas
drilling operations in the Western Desert, where recent surveys
have indicated new reserves. Preliminary statistics show that the
region's natural gas reserves now exceed 471 billion cubic meters,
plus 12 million barrels of oil products from new discoveries.

<HEADLINE> Strong Demand Keeps Turkish Inflation at High Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A strong domestic demand
continued to fuel inflation in Turkey, pushing the monthly
wholesale prices index (WPI) and consumer prices index (CPI)
respectively at a high of 0.9 percent and 2.2 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The figures, published by the State Institute of Statistics on
Sunday, sent the eight-month inflation of this year to 20.9 percent
on the WPI, above a year-end target of 20 percent and to 23.1
percent on the CPI, slightly below the government's 25 percent
year-end target.
</P>
<P>
According to the current figures, the year-on-year WPI and CPI
were expected to remain at a high of 48.9 percent and 53.2 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is implementing a three-year economic stability program
under the 4-billion-U.S.-dollar stand-by deal signed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year IMF loan package, Turkey pledged to reduce
its chronic inflation and budget deficits, undertake a
comprehensive privatization program and reform agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to reduce inflation to 20 percent in 2000,
10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002. The annual inflation
rate stood at 68.9 percent at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the August figures, Turkish officials said that it was
unnecessary to revise this year's target because the inflation was
on the down trend.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the figures were at the lower end of market
expectations and would be perceived as good news.
</P>
<P>
Economists argued, however, the CPI figure would provide a
further excuse for the government and the IMF to worry about
growing domestic demand, and look for a set of fiscal tightening
measures in order to cool the economy and avoid inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's gross national product (GNP) posted a robust 4.4
percent growth in the second quarter of this year, against a 3.2
percent contraction in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A pent-up consumer demand and falling interest rates have
boosted consumption in the first six months of the IMF-sponsored
anti-inflation program. Turkey posted a gross domestic product
(GDP) growth of 5.7 percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
IMF's Turkey desk chief Carlo Cottarelli said that the economic
program may need some fine tuning, after seeing growth and current
account balance data.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's current account balance has been worsening in the face
of a surge in imports and reached 5.6 billion dollars in the first
six months.
</P>
<P>
Economists have been suggesting that measures are needed to
contain the current account deficit, at least for next year. A
possible package of fine-tuning measures would therefore serve both
ends.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in September and October is seasonally high and will
be a harder test of the government's disinflation program,
economists argued. Monthly inflation has averaged about 6 percent
in September in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The national support behind the anti-inflation economic package
of the government has dipped to a mere 11.7 percent. A recent poll
showed that 80.9 percent of Turks no longer believe that the
government can pull down the annual inflation rate to around 20
percent as it had pledged when launching the anti-inflation
economic package.
</P>
<P>
While 46.1 percent of the group interviewed said that they
wanted the government just to continue implementing the program,
almost equally, 40.3 percent said that they wanted the program
shelved and 13.6 percent were undecided.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Kills 160 Rebels in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Defense
Ministry said Monday that at least 160 Tamil Tiger rebels have
been killed in the northern Jaffna peninsula as the military
launched a fresh offensive.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said ground troops have observed more than
80 bodies of rebels during the operation on Sunday and the
estimated number of rebels killed is at least 160.
</P>
<P>
He said eight officers and 63 soldiers were killed in the
offensive, while 225 soldiers were wounded. Another 254 soldiers
were treated for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed soldiers advanced into territory held by the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at Sarasalai,
Maduvil and Nunavil in the Jaffna peninsula on Sunday, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of the operation is to provide more protection
for Jaffna town, which has been surrounded by the rebels since
they captured large amounts of territory in the area early this
year.
</P>
<P>
The army began its assault with heavy bombardment by multiple
rocket launchers. Numerous high-ranking military officials are
reported to have gone to Jaffna from Colombo to supervise the
operation.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from the LTTE to the casualty
claim.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels said in a statement from their London office on
Sunday that more than 100 government troops have died and several
hundred more have been injured. They said thousands of civilians
have been forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of fighting ended a four-month lull in fighting in
the Jaffna Peninsula. In April, the rebels captured Elephant Pass -
- the only land route to the Jaffna Peninsula. The government has
been under pressure to gain ground in the war since then.
</P>
<P>
The military in recent weeks have boosted its firepower with
new combat aircraft and field guns ahead of an anticipated
showdown with the rebels prior to parliamentary polls on October
10.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting came as political parties prepared to hand
in their election nominations which closed at noon Monday.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Finance Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday it has the capacity to finance the budget deficit which
shot up to 59.7 billion pesos (1.49 billion U.S. dollars) as of
July against a full-year target of 62.5 billion pesos (1.56
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This position was made by National Treasurer Leonor Briones to
downplay reports that the government may incur more than the
target deficit set by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Briones said that the financial situation in the country is
strong because the domestic market is liquid at this time
considering that there are more fund inflows brought about by the
raising of the proceeds from the privatization bonds amounting to
8 billion pesos (200 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
There are also other sources of revenues which the government
can tap to make the financial system liquid, the Bureau of the
Treasury official said.
</P>
<P>
One of which is the full implementation of the small-
denominated treasury bonds at the local bourses within this month.
When put on streams, this project could earn for the government an
estimated 30 billion pesos (750 million dollars) in proceeds.
</P>
<P>
Another source, she said, is the scheduled privatization of
three big tickets items of the national government -- the stakes
in the Philippine National Bank, the Philippine National
Construction Corporation, and the Manila Electric Company.
</P>
<P>
This effort could possibly earn for the government about 22
billion pesos (550 million dollars) in proceeds from the sale of
these assets, she said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Rebels Suffer Heavy Casualties in Fresh Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- At least 216 Tamil Tiger
rebels have been killed in Sri Lanka's northern Jaffna peninsula
as the military launched a fresh offensive, a government spokesman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director of Information Ariya Rubasinghe said those rebels were
killed during the confrontations with troops on Sunday in
Colombuturai, Sarasalai, Maduvil and Nunavil.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
were wounded in the fighting, he said, adding that troops are
consolidating the newly captured areas in Colombuturai.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the Defense Ministry said eight officers and
63 soldiers were killed in the offensive, while 225 soldiers were
wounded. Another 254 soldiers were treated for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The operation aims at providing more protection for Jaffna town,
which has been surrounded by the rebels since they captured large
amounts of territory in the area early this year.
</P>
<P>
The army began its assault with heavy bombardment by multiple
rocket launchers. Numerous high-ranking military officials are
reported to have gone to Jaffna from Colombo to supervise the
operation.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from the LTTE to the casualty
claim.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels said in a statement from their London office on
Sunday that more than 100 government troops have died and several
hundred more have been injured. They said thousands of civilians
have been forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of fighting ended a four-month lull in fighting in
the Jaffna Peninsula. In April, the rebels captured Elephant Pass -
the only land route to the Jaffna Peninsula. The government has
been under pressure to gain ground in the war since then.
</P>
<P>
The military in recent weeks had boosted its firepower with new
combat aircraft and field guns ahead of an anticipated showdown
with the rebels prior to parliamentary polls on October 10.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting came as political parties prepared to hand
in their election nominations which closed at noon Monday.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes to Resume Talks With MILF Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government hopes
to resume the stalled peace negotiations with the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) this week in the southern Cotabato City,
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Zamora said the government has suggested
to the MILF that the meeting would resume either September 7 or 8.
</P>
<P>
"We will wait. If they don't show up on September 7, we will be
back the next day and wait again. But we want to show our people
that we are ready to talk anytime," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He said back-channel negotiations are still being held between
the MILF and the government panel, headed by Edgardo Batenga.
</P>
<P>
According to Zamora, the government is now waiting for the
appropriate response from the MILF.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Batenga said he is now waiting for the
MILF central leadership to inform him on when it is ready to
resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Let me emphasize that the government panel will pursue the
peace process. We'll explore all possible means to bring back MILF
to the negotiating table," Batenga said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no concrete formula at this time for the
resumption of talks as the government is willing to be flexible on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Batenga also cited information reaching his office that the
members of the MILF central leadership are meeting to decide on
the date when to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the MILF withdrew all authority to its peace panel to
negotiate a peace agreement with the Philippine government,
following a series of clashes in Mindanao resulting in the falling
of most of MILF's camps in the island.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF is the Philippines' largest rebel group
which has been fighting for an independent Muslim state in
Mindanao for more than two decades.

NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government loses 24
million shillings (about 300,000 U.S. dollars) in revenue annually
due to piracy, the East African Standard reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Torome, chairman of the Kenya Music Anti-piracy
Association, was quoted as saying on Sunday that most pirated
music cassettes came from Uganda, Tanzania and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to seal off entry points for pirated
cassettes along its borders to curb the illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the media to assist in creating awareness on
the illegality of piracy and the abuse of the Copyright Act of
Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Reviews Quality Control Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya government is
reviewing the National Standard Act to rally more powers to
control sub-standard goods, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philip Okundi, managing director of the Kenya Bureau of
Standards (KBS), was quoted as saying that there are some
weaknesses in the present National Standard Act which need to be
removed to deal with those who flout the rules.
</P>
<P>
"The Kenya Bureau of Standards aims at providing quality
services and establishing a more effective quality surveillance of
products coming into the country," he said while launching a
quality testing laboratory at the bureau's Mombassa Office in
southeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the laboratory is part of the wider
strategy of the KBS to make testing services available for all
types of imported or locally-made products, including food,
chemicals, petroleum, electrical and electronic accessories and
building materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the laboratory will target sub-standard goods such as
dairy products, juices and water, which pose a health hazard to
the general population.
</P>
<P>
According to Okundi, the Mombassa port is Kenya's largest entry
point for many imported products, some needing immediate testing
in order to accept or bar their entry into the market.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland to Host Convicts in Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland has become the
third country agreeing to have persons convicted by the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to serve their
sentences in the country, newspapers here reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to that effect was signed in Mbabane, Swaziland
last Wednesday by the country's Minister for Foreign Affairs and
Trade Albert Shabangu and U. N. Assistant Secretary General and
Registrar of ICTR, Agwu Okali.
</P>
<P>
Okali paid tribute to Swaziland's political stability,
effective institutions and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
These factors, he said, in addition to the high standards of
Swaziland's correctional facilities, mean that the tribunal would
have no hesitation to approach the government for this kind of
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Mali and Benin are the other two countries which have reached
agreement with the United Nations to ensure the enforcement of
such sentences.
</P>
<P>
According to the statute of the U.N. tribunal, those convicted
of genocide can serve their sentences in Rwanda or any other state
that has indicated its willingness to U.N. Security Council to
assist the tribunal in this way.
</P>
<P>
Based in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, ICTR has handed
down only five verdicts since it was set up six years ago to try
leading architects and perpetrators involved in the 1994 genocide
in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four suspects are currently held in custody in Tanzania
while Rwanda's jam-packed prisons have some 125,000 suspects,
awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Mori Remain Apart on Territorial Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori failed to
narrow their differences over a long-standing territorial dispute
in their first round of talks in Tokyo Monday, dimming prospects
for any breakthrough to conclude a peace treaty between Russia and
Japan by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, however, agreed to continue talks on the
dispute in their remaining two rounds of discussions during
Putin's three-day official visit which began Sunday, Kyodo News
quoted a Japanese official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Mori are scheduled to meet again on Monday afternoon,
and then on Tuesday morning for their final session.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Putin said that while Russia respects previous
agreements between the two countries, Japan's proposed compromise
on the territorial dispute "is not in full accordance with
Russia's ideas," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Putin also said that Japan's 1998 proposal aimed at resolving
the territorial row cannot be a basis for compromise toward a
peace treaty, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted sources from
the Russian delegation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official said Mori called for efforts on both
sides to "seek a mutually acceptable peace treaty," and reiterated
Japan's compromise proposal on the territorial issue.
</P>
<P>
The proposal Japan first made in April 1998 would give Russia
temporary administration over a string of disputed islands as long
as Moscow agrees to draw a demarcation line between the
northernmost of the disputed islands and Russia's Urup Island.
</P>
<P>
The four Russian-held islands off Japan's northernmost
prefecture of Hokkaido, seized by Soviet troops at the end of
World War II, are known as the Northern Territories in Japan and
the Southern Kurils in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia rejected Japan's proposal in November 1998. Instead,
Moscow proposed signing an interim "peace, friendship and
cooperation treaty" and leaving the resolution of the islands
problem to a separate pact.
</P>
<P>
The decades-old territorial dispute has prevented Tokyo and
Moscow from concluding a peace treaty although they established
diplomatic ties in 1956.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Russia and Japan agreed to strive toward resolving the
territorial row and concluding the peace treaty by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
As the gap between the two countries on the territorial issue
remains wide, Japanese government officials said Putin and Mori
are likely to effectively give up the year-end target by signing a
document confirming continued treaty talks and calling for a new
guideline to accelerate work by a joint committee dealing with the
territorial row.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said that as the new century approaches, it is imperative to "
build towards a constructive strategic partnership" between China
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I believe whoever becomes the President of the United States,
he will try to improve Sino-U.S. relations, for this is in the
strategic interest of the whole world," said Jiang in an interview
with Mike Wallace, 82-year-old anchor of the "60 Minutes" program
of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), in the seaside resort
of Beidaihe on August 15.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that when he met U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993,
he pointed out that "We should look at the world from a long-term
perspective and on a higher plank and should work together to
bring into the new century a world of peace, stability and
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relationship has been good on the whole, he said,
adding that such a relationship has undoubtedly experienced the
wind, the rain and sometimes clouds or even dark clouds. However,
sometimes it clears up.
</P>
<P>
There are some people in the U.S. who are not happy to see
China and the U.S. become friends, and there are always some
people who would make noises, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that maybe it is because of the economic power and
leading edge in science and technology that the U.S. enjoys that
more often than not it tends to overestimate itself and its
position in the world, adding that there may be a touch of
hegemonism and power politics in the leadership of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with a 5,000-year history and culture and
more than 1.2 billion people, Jiang said, noting that "We have
accumulated a significant economic foundation and national
strength in the past 20 years of reform and opening-up. So I am
afraid that the U.S. simply can not afford to look down on China."

"We are opposed to the NMD and TMD programs, and we are
unambiguous about this," Jiang said, adding that China's national
security interests should not be impaired in any way, and it is

defense.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said that China is building socialism with Chinese characteristics
and the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are
unequivocal about this question which bears on the direction of
China's development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview with Mike Wallace, 82-year-
old anchor of the "60 Minutes" program of the Columbia
Broadcasting System (CBS) in the seaside resort of Beidaihe, about
300 kilometers east of Beijing, on August 15.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the policy of reform and opening-up initiated
by Deng Xiaoping has been a great success, adding that the theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as advocated
by Deng Xiaoping, does encourage some people and certain areas to
become prosperous before others, and the ultimate objective is to
achieve common prosperity for all.
</P>
<P>
"To get rich is glorious" is not capitalism, he said.
Socialism is to make all the people rich and prosperous, and to
make their country strong and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
China has all along attached great importance to spiritual
civilization and moral integrity, he said, adding that "I think
the last thing the leaders in the world would wish to see is the
scenario where you have material wealth on the one hand, but moral
decline on the other."
</P>
<P>
"We want to learn from the West everything advanced and
progressive including science and technology and its experience in
managing the economy. Of course, This must be combined with China'
s specific conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is exactly because China has been following these principles
that the country has scored great achievements in the past few
decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
But people in the West always hope that China can become a
capitalist country, Jiang said, adding that "If capitalism
prevails throughout the world, won't the world be a very dull
place? I still believe the world should be a diverse and colorful
one."

<HEADLINE> China to Produce Universal Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China will begin to
manufacture universal blood with the help of a new technology that
turns blood of different types into a universal one via transgenic
engineering, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
The technology has been developed by the Institution of
Transfusion under the Chinese Academy of Military Medicine, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Huayu Group and the Tianjin New Technology Industrial Park
will jointly set up the Huayu Bio-Garden Development Co. Ltd., to
manufacture the blood, with an investment of 240 million yuan (
about 29.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new company will be located in the Torch Venture Garden of
the industrial park in north China's port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
According to some experts involved in the research, so far,
they have succeeded in transforming the "B" type of blood to the "
O" type.
</P>
<P>
They said that the transformations from the "A" group to the "O
" group and from porcine blood to human's are being studied and
are expected to be put into future industrial production.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges to Quicken Reform of Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Labor and
Social Security has urged to accelerate the reform of China's
pension system.
</P>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the ministry to ensure timely and
sufficient payment of pensions to the retired, said Vice-Minister
Wang Jianlun, who was speaking at a national work conference.
</P>
<P>
The official has urged localities to increase their efforts in
raising money for the pension funds.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that at the end of May, a total of 97.7
million Chinese retirees had signed up the endowment insurance, up
15.3 percent from the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The number of endowment insurance participants is likely to be
extended to 103 million by the end of this year, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged to implement the Provisional Regulations on the
Collection of Social Insurance.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 18.6 million retirees, approximately 64
percent of the country's total retirees, will receive their
pension through the social security system, up 4.78 million year-
on-year.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has demanded that 80 percent of the retirees
get their pension benefits through banks, post offices and other
social institutions by the end of this year, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Ex-Premier Sweeps Beirut Votes in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's former prime minister
Rafik al-Hariri scored a landslide victory in Sunday's
parliamentary elections, capturing 18 of the 19 seats in capital
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star newspaper reported Monday that initial results in
the southern Lebanon and eastern Bekaa valley districts showed the
Resistance and Development list, anchored by Hezbollah and Amal
militias, headed for victory over several incomplete tickets.
</P>
<P>
Official results of Sunday's polling, the second of two rounds,
were expected to be announced later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's race culminated that for the first time the capital
elected a woman Ghinwa Jalloul, among Hariri's election list, into
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
There was very little cross-list voting as Hariri has been
imploring supporters to vote for the whole lists as they were.
</P>
<P>
The elections in Beirut were marked by a brisk turnout of Sunni
Muslim voters and poor participation by Christians, Armenians and
Shiite Muslims. Some 40 percent of Beirut's 397,000 eligible voters
cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial results underlined loyalty of the Sunni community to
the former prime minister, trouncing incumbent Prime Minister Salim
Hoss and parliament member Tammam Salam, who long dominated the
capital's political scene.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's campaign machine claimed a clean sweep, 18 out of 19
seats in Beirut. He had left a Shiite seat vacant to accommodate
Hezbollah's Mohammed Berjawi.
</P>
<P>
On the national level, he has also secured an overwhelming
majority in parliament through his alliance with Druze leader Walid
Jumblatt, who swept the votes in two of Mount Lebanon's districts
last week, and the support of several other MPs across the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite his known reservations about Hariri, President Emile
Lahoud suggested that MPs would have a decisive say in the choice
of the new premier.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the voting ended at 6 p.m. (1500 GMT) Sunday, Lahoud
released a statement praising the elections as a "model" of
democracy. He referred to the "next big event" of designating a
premier, promising to abide by the "constitution."
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election was relatively trouble-free. There were no
serious problems except that one voter was stabbed and wounded.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, the current government must
resign when the new parliament first meets on October 17. The
president must then consult MPs over selecting a new premier, with
the results binding for the president. The candidate of the new
premier must get two thirds of the votes in the 128-seat
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Meeting A Test for Unity: UAE Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A leading newspaper in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) Monday praised the ongoing 114th meeting
of the Arab League foreign ministers council as a test for Arab
unity.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based Arabic-language daily Al Bayan commented in an
editorial that the meeting, which opened Sunday in Cairo, is "a
practical test for the required total unity that may prevent the
Arab situation from further collapse."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was reportedly to adopt unanimous stances on
Jerusalem and a comprehensive peace to end the 52-year-old Arab-
Israeli conflict, on the basis of international norms.
</P>
<P>
"The current meeting in Cairo supports Jerusalem's cause and
reaffirms to the world that Arabs have chosen peace as a strategic
choice, not because they are weak, but because they are seeking a
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The holy city of Jerusalem is a Palestinian, Arab, Islamic and
Christian city, which constitutes the basic issue in the
Palestinian cause and in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo meeting or the Jerusalem session reiterated the unity
of Arabs towards Jerusalem as a national right, and affirmed their
refusal to Israel's illegal occupation of the whole city, concluded
the paper.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and later
declared the whole of the city as its "eternal and indivisible
capital," a claim the international community has never recognized.
The Arabs are insisting on Palestinian sovereignty over the eastern
sector of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Private Hospitals Offer Free Treatment to Iraqi Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ten private hospitals in Jordan
have offered free treatment to Iraqi children in a sign of
solidarity with the sanctions-hit Iraqi people, sources with a pro-
Iraqi committee said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Popular Committee for Solidarity with Iraq said six private
hospitals in Amman and four others outside the capital city have
responded to its call to provide free medical care to Iraqi child
patients who can not get proper treatment in their own country.
</P>
<P>
The committee is a non-profit and independent organization
formed by Jordanian academicians, doctors, lawyers and political
activists, who are eager to see the lifting of the decade-old
international sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of Iraqi child patients to be treated in
Jordan is expected to be highly symbolic as the medical facilities
in the kingdom apparently can not afford to admit Iraqi patients on
a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian patients resort to public hospitals for free medical
care despite the fact that private hospitals offer better expertise
but at high prices.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said some 1.5 million of its citizens, mostly children and
the elderly, have died of the crippling sanctions due to
malnutrition and a lack of sufficient medical care.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious private Al Hayat Hospital in Amman has offered
full treatment to three Iraqi children a year, and five other
private hospitals offered to treat Iraqi children with brain and
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
Private hospitals in the southern districts of Madaba and Aqaba
have also offered free treatment to Iraqi children with chronic
diseases but on a similarly small scale.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Support Palestinian Efforts to Recover East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries have expressed
unanimous support to the Palestinian people for all their struggles
to restore sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers opened the 114th session of the Arab
League council on Sunday to discuss the Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations, especially the issue of Jerusalem. The ministers
released a statement late Sunday night reiterating rejection of any
attempts aimed at tampering with Palestinian sovereignty over the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been stuck over the
issue of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries support all efforts exerted by the Palestinian
people to restore self-determination and freedom, and the
declaration of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as
the capital within this year, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It called on the international community to recognize the
Palestinian state when it is declared.
</P>
<P>
It urged Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories,
including East Jerusalem, to the borders of June 4, 1967 under the
United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries stressed that Palestinian refugees have the
right to return and Israel must shoulder legal, political and moral
responsibilities for the refugee problem.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Kenyan Teachers Killed by AIDS Over Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- At least 10,000 teachers in
Kenya have died of HIV/AIDS over the past five years, a consultant
with the Kenya Institute of Education has said.
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 teachers succumbed to the killer disease last year
alone, Sobbie Mulindi was quoted by Monday's Daily Nation
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mulindi, also a lecturer at the Nairobi University's Medical
School, said the impact of the disease has adversely affected
staffing and distribution of teachers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The deaths are expected to lower the quality of education in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He advised the teachers to be sensitized to ways of preventing
the spread of the disease as most people in rural areas look up to
them for information.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Education Ministry has introduced the HIV/AIDS lessons
to primary and secondary schools as well as to teachers' training
colleges.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that almost 1 million Kenyans have died of AIDS
since the first AIDS case was found in the country in 1984.

<P>
Ironically, after being "too old" eight year ago, Phillips will
become an Olympian at the age of 44 as a pitcher for the South
African baseball team at the Millennium Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Sporting isolation robbed Phillips, the holder of an incredible
27 national badminton titles and a baseball pitcher for 35 years,
of the chance to compete internationally at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
Phillips, now a pither for the Bellville Tigers in Cape Town,
made his South African debut against Chinese Taipei team in 1982,
but had to wait until the end of isolation in the early 1990s to
resume his international career.
</P>
<P>
He said he was dumbfounded when he heard of his selection for
Sydney Games. "To be quite honest I did not think I would make it.
I have been fortunate enough to represent South Africa to go to
the Commonwealth Games in Canada in 1994 and competed in badminton,
but the Olympic Games is something else," Phillips said at the
squad's training camp in Randburg, Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite ironic seeing as I had a chance to go to the
Barcelona (Olympic) Games in 1992, but the powers could be decided
otherwise. The real irony is that at the peak of my career
nothing was happening for us in terms of internationl sport, but
in the twilight of my career all the exposure's begun," he joked.
</P>
<P>
His selection for Sydney had an element of good fortune, but
the Olympics can be no better swansong for a man who has been a
fantastic servant to South African sport.
</P>
<P>
"My role in the team is on the pitching side and in a squad of
24. I am looking forward to contributing to the team at the Games,
as I feel you need a bit of experience," Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
"However, it's one thing throwing in South Africa in front of
500 people, but it's another thing playing in international
matches in terms of composure and concentration, and you need some
old hands,"the old athlete added.
</P>
<P>
Phillips is still doing the job for his club Tigers, who won
the league this season in Cape Town with his featuring in over 30
games.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed: "For an older player it's a lot more
demanding to keep up with the young guys and play my part and to
cope with the demands on my time and body. For the past four
months we have been training six days a week, so without the
support of my family it would have been virtually a no-go
situation."
</P>
<P>
"And as our training has gone on, I've dropped a couple of
kilos. Now I feel fitter and stronger than I have in years and
can't wait for the Games," Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> Book Fair Witnesses Copyright Trade Imbalance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded Beijing
International Book Exposition witnessed a remarkable imbalance in
the copyright trade, the Beijing Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although local publishers flocked to buy the copyright of
foreign books at the fair, local book sales were low, resulting in
a ratio of 8:1.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 500 domestic and overseas publishing houses from
42 countries and regions attended the five-day exposition.
</P>
<P>
China should import various foreign books to meet the demands
of the country's social, economic and scientific and technological
development, said Cai Yuniang, director in charge of copyright
trade at the China National Publications Import &AMP; Export
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Being a major book exporter, China lacks books with unique
characteristics, which has blunted its edge in the international
book market, said Cai. India has exceeded China in exporting books
for children and books on computer technology.
</P>
<P>
Lacking variety, creativeness and imagination has also weakened
the international competitiveness of Chinese books, according to
some local experts.
</P>
<P>
Local experts also noted that before striking a deal, foreign
buyers often attach greater importance to China's counterparts' in
terms of reputation, popularity and circulation.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Doctors Urged to Be on Lookout for New Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Ministry of
Health has issued a warning to local doctors to be on the lookout
for a new and potentially dangerous virus, which has infected at
least 50 people in the country.
</P>
<P>
A senior public health advisor, Doug Lush, said in a press
release issued by the ministry here Monday that symptoms of Echo
33 can include diarrhea, headache, fever and a rash, but the virus
can also cause a type of meningitis, which is different from the
potentially fatal meningococcal meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The illness differs from meningococcal meningitis in that a
virus, and not bacteria causes it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Echo 33 is not spread through sneezing and coughing, but
through poor hygiene, Lush said, adding handwashing and good
personal hygiene is the best way to stop the virus from spreading.
</P>
<P>
While most victims do not need treatment, some people,
particularly small children, may have to be hospitalized if they
contract Echo 33, according to the public health advisor.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Achieves Land Acquisition Target of 5 Million Hectares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
achieved its land acquisition target of 5 million hectares under
the A1 model scheme and is now preparing tillage units for people
resettled under the fast-track program, The Herald newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural
Resettlement Joseph Made as saying on Sunday that at least 1,952
farms have so far been gazetted for compulsory acquisition, and
with more farms expected to be acquired this week, the total
hectarage would come up to about 7 million, way above the targeted
5 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would then move onto the A2 and A3
models on which people would be resettled on small-scale and large-
scale farming areas, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tillage units would be set up across the country to provide
tillage services to people being moved onto the land, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have identified the land that we want to acquire. The base
is set and we should now move into the production channel. What we
now need to look at are all the aspects of tillage -- tractors and
fuel, among other things," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, "95 percent of the major exercise to
identify land for compulsory acquisition is complete and this will
bring peace in the minds of the people."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Local government, Public Works and
National Housing Ignatius Chombo, who chairs the inter-ministerial
task force on land acquisition, was quoted as saying on Sunday
that a sub-committee on tillage, led by Minister of Rural
Resources and Water Development Joyce Mujuru, will work out the
distribution of tractors per province and the amount of resources
needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen pieces of 400-
year-old steles were discovered recently on a section of the Great
Wall near Shimenzhai Village, Funing county in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
These steles are located along a four kilometer length of the
Great Wall, which lies on Mount Qingshi at an altitude of 600
meters.
</P>
<P>
The steles are almost free from artificial damage thanks to the
steepness of the area. The legible epigraphs record the
construction history of that section of the Great Wall built
between 1607 to 1608 in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Zhao Huanlai, a local expert on relics, said that the epigraphs
contain a clear record of the conditions and scale of the
construction, and list all of the officials who built and guarded
the Great Wall there, during the time.
</P>
<P>
"It also includes names of the plasterers and stonemasons,
which are rarely recorded by other steles on the Great Wall." Zhao
added.

BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and other people of

<HEADLINE> Longtan Hydropower Plant in Pre-Construction Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for construction
of a new hydropower station on the Hongshui River in south China
have been carried out as planned.
</P>
<P>
Longtan hydropower station, which will be situated in Tian'e
County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will have a generating
capacity of 5.4 million kw. It has been listed by the state as
one of the major projects aimed at speeding up development in west
China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Li Zhinong, deputy manager of
Longtan Hydroelectric Development Co. Ltd., said that 530 million
yuan (one U.S. dollar equals 8.3 yuan) would be raised this year
to finance the pre-stage construction.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory construction included building two highways
with a combined length of 95 km connecting the construction site
to the outside world, transport facilities, water and power supply
works inside the construction site, as well as facilities to store
construction materials.
</P>
<P>
By late July, 199 million yuan of the funds required had been
paid and 133 million yuan had been spent on construction.
</P>
<P>
Building of the two highways has already finished.
</P>
<P>
Li said that other jobs also needed completing including,
relocating residents from the reservoir area, acquiring land,
raising funds, in addition to constructing facilities for
transport, water and power supply inside the construction site, as
well as works to store construction materials in the second half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Longtan hydropower station is one of several key power plants
that are planned to be built to utilize hydroelectric resources on
the Hongshui River. Planning and prospecting of the project began
in 1958.

people -- it often runs toward people, "bites" them first and then
turns around and "kicks" them.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Shouzhong, a zoologist of the park, gnus are
among the most "feint-prone" wild herbivores.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a herd of gnus would rush offensively toward people
from one hundred meters away. If the targets keep still calmly,
the gnus would soon retreat. But if the people drew back, they
would keep running around the horrified people without hurting
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He argues that these animals are doing this just for
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Wang's colleague Zhang Xueli pointed out that in most cases,
the wild herbivores would not attack people unless they are
disturbed when eating.
</P>
<P>
"However, some animals may also play with people by feinting
especially when they meet small groups of visitors," said Zhang, "
But they are not malicious."
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao Safari Park covers an area of 300 hectares, with
some 6,000 wild animals living there.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Coffin to Be Opened in Late September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A coffin in an ancient tomb
dating back to some 2,000 years is expected to be opened in
Beijing by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists who have been excavating the tomb for eight
months will take the coffin out of the outer caskets and open it
in the Beijing Research Institute of Cultural Heritage in late
September, said Wang Wuyu, vice-director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, located 10 kilometers west from downtown Beijing, is
well preserved by a wooden structure, known as "ticou" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Ticou is a wooden tomb structure used during the Han dynasties
(206 B.C. to 220 A.D.). The wooden structure encased the tomb and
prevented moisture and earth entering the tomb.
</P>
<P>
This structure was reserved only for the tombs of emperors,
empresses and princes. Thus, archaeologists believed that the
ancient tomb was an imperial mausoleum, though the identification
of the occupant is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
China Central Television (CCTV) telecast live the excavation of
the tomb on August 20. Part of the wooden outer casket was shown,
drawing dozens of millions of Chinese audience.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists expect silk, seals, and other small ornaments to
be found in the coffin, which would help identify the occupant of
the coffin.

<HEADLINE> Prestige Chosen Over Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Although many Chinese colleges
promised substantial monetary prizes for the best performing
students in this year's national college entrance exams, most of
these students still chose Qinghua University and Beijing
University, the most prestigious universities in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University of Science and Engineering, Harbin
Polytechnic University and other universities in Shanghai and
Guangzhou promised 50,000 yuan (6,204 US dollars) to attract the
top students.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the money offered by the above universities, the
4,000 yuan (482 US dollars) fellowship offered by Beijing
University is very small, as is the prize offered by China's
another top university, Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
But because of their academic reputation, these two
universities still attracted most of top students from all around
the country, according to a report by the Beijing Morning Daily.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University enrolled 43 of the top students in the
entrance exams from 23 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions, while the Qinghua University recruited 70 percent of the
top ten students for the above areas.
</P>
<P>
Educational departments oppose the practice of offering
monetary prizes to attract top students, says the paper.
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities usually start their new semesters in early
September.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Mori Begin Talks on Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori began
Monday their first round of talks which are expected to focus on a
bilateral peace treaty Russia and Japan are struggling to conclude
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Mori are scheduled to hold three rounds of talks
during the Russian president's three-day official visit to Japan
from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's talks, Putin and Mori are expected to take up a
decades-old territorial dispute that has prevented Russia and
Japan from signing the peace pact.
</P>
<P>
The two countries remain far apart over a string of Russian-
held islands off Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido. The
islands are known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the
Southern Kurils in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Japan has called for the return of the islands, which were
seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II, but Russia has
rejected the calls.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed in 1997 to conclude a peace pact by
the end of 2000, but negotiations have stalled due to differences
over ways to resolve the territorial row.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, Japan offered a compromise that would give
Russia temporary administrative rights over the islands as long as
Moscow agreed to draw a demarcation line between the northernmost
of the disputed islands and Urup Island.
</P>
<P>
But Russia rejected the proposal in November that year. Instead,
Moscow proposed signing a broader "peace, friendship and
cooperation treaty" and leaving the resolution of the islands
problem to a separate pact.
</P>
<P>
Mori is expected to reiterate Japan's compromise plan in the
talks, but Putin is unlikely to make any concessions, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
As the gap between the two countries remains wide, analysts
said, Putin and Mori might again end up their talks merely
confirming the two countries' resolve to continue negotiations on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Putin signaled his intention to resist Japan's
demand for the turnover of the islands, saying, "We are not
talking about turning over the (Southern) Kuril Islands."
</P>
<P>
"We are negotiating over the issue, but it is no more than that,
" Putin told reporters in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, capital of Sakhalin,
before leaving for Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Narrow South-North Gap in New Millennium (Part I)  By Yang Qiuyan, Wang Zhenhua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The agenda of the forthcoming
U.N. summit will highlight, among other topics, the seemingly ever-
enlarging gap between the South and the North.
</P>
<P>
The gap has been a wide concern across the world when the
human being is entering the new Millennium and hoping for a
common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, during their three-day summit in New York, the more
than 160 top leaders from countries the world over will have to
address themselves to a new world economic order and a hopeful
ensuing solution to the South-North gap.
</P>
<P>
In the past hundred years, the recent 10 years in particular,
the world economic growth has gathered momentum prompted by the
progress of high technology in spite of countless difficulties and
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
While the Western economy, particularly the U.S. economy,
continues to grow, many developing countries have experienced
economic slowdown with some even suffering from economic
stagnation or retrogression.
</P>
<P>
As the result, the gap between the south and the north has
widened. Although the international community has tried to tackle
the problem, the gap between the most developed nations and the
most undeveloped nations is growing.
</P>
<P>
Former International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
warned that if the South-North gap continues to grow, poverty will
lead to social unrest and conflict which will eventually destroy
the order of the human society.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the current per capita GDP (gross domestic
product) in developed countries is over 60 times of that in
developing countries, compared to 43 times in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program Human Development Report for 1999
showed 20 percent of the world's population living in developed
countries takes up 86 percent of the world's GDP and 82 percent of
the world market, while more than 75 percent of the world's
population living in developing countries shares only 14 percent
of the world's GDP and 18 percent of the world market.
</P>
<P>
Amid the global economic development, the number of the least
developed nations has risen to 48 today, compared to 36 ten years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Narrow South-North Gap in New Millennium (Part III) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the international community has
acknowledged more and more clearly that the most important factor
to narrow the South-North disparity is to introduce a just and
reasonable international economic order, which fully reflects and
guarantees the economic interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries enjoy dominating benefits from the
economic globalization while many developing countries are
burdened with heavy debts mainly due to long-time colonial rule
and plunder, and an international economic order which is unjust
and unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
Many developing countries said cutting and alleviating the
debts of the poorest countries by developed countries can never be
regarded as a kind of charity but their unshirkable responsibility
and obligation.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have repeatedly called on the rich
countries to stick to their commitment and provide more assistance
to the developing countries. At the same time, in relieving the
debt burdens of the developing countries, the developed countries
should not put unreasonable conditions under the pretext of
improving human rights and democracy, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the developed countries to open markets to
the developing countries, expand trade and transfer new and
advanced technologies to the developing states.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Narrow South-North Gap in New Millennium (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History shows that besides the interior problems in some
developing countries, the most important cause for the ever
growing gap lies in the failure to establish a just and rational
economic order, which benefits the common development of all
countries.
</P>
<P>
The current world economic order was created and defined by a
few developed countries after World War II, mainly reflecting
their interests. It did not embody the legitimate interests and
reasonable demands of the developing countries, most of which were
still under the colonial or semi-colonial rule at that time.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of such an economic order, the developed
states have built up their economic superiority by expanding all
over the world to seek more resources and markets.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of the developing nations were
shackled by the unfair and irrational economic order. Heavily
dependent on resources export, some of the developing countries
met a series of problems such as fund shortage, heavy indebtedness
and worsening conditions in trade and ecological environment. In
some sense, historians said, the developed countries achieved
their economic growth at the expense the interests of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from the 1970s, pressed by many developing countries,
the U.N. stipulated that the rich states provide development
assistance to poor, especially the least developed nations. The
developed states promised that each of them would set aside 0.7
percent of its gross national production (GNP) as official
development assistance.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, statistics show that most of the developed
countries have failed to honor their commitment, as their
assistance fund has never reached the promised amount and gone
down year by year.
</P>
<P>
The member states of the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) just provided 0.24 percent of their GNP as
official development assistance in recent years with their per
capita assistance declining from 32 U.S. dollars in 1990 to 19
dollars at present. The United States, the richest country in the
world, just appropriated 0.11 percent of its gross domestic
production (GDP) as official development assistance in the fiscal
year of 2001, setting the lowest record of the post-war period.
</P>
<P>
When providing assistance, the Western nations often attach
some harsh conditions which do not tally with the actual situation
of the poor countries, making the assistance nominal or
inefficient.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Inflation Rate Rises on High Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's inflation rate is
increasing as higher crude oil prices pushed up retail prices of
gasoline and diesel and increased electricity costs and food
prices, a report from the government said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index, the broadest gauge of inflation, rose
O.6 percent in August from the previous month, the biggest monthly
increase since April 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, the index rose 2.2 percent, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
An 80-percent rise in world crude oil prices this year has also
pushed up transportation and production costs in the country, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation may rise further if oil prices extend their gains, it
said, noting that at least 50 consumer-goods makers are now
awaiting governmental approval to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
The government will try to limit price increases to a maximum
of 2.2 percent for the full year through price controls and
informal requests to vendors, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Six children and one
elderly person were drowned in Takeo Province over the weekend as
flood waters continued to rise around the region, according to the
local media Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Takeo Province is the hardest hit," Peou Sarmy, secretary-
general of the Cambodian National Committee for Disaster
Management, was quoted as saying by The Cambodia Daily. "The water
keeps rising."
</P>
<P>
In Takeo, in the south of Cambodia, 9,000 hectares of rice
crops have been destroyed and 252 families have been evacuated to
higher ground. Also in Stung Treng, located in the northeast part
of the nation, 250 hectares of rice crops have been destroyed by
flooding.
</P>
<P>
The local media reported that elsewhere in the country,
unusually heavy monsoon rains threaten more damage to crops and
homes.
</P>
<P>
Authorities will send 4,000 liters of gasoline to Stung Treng,
Kratie and Kompong Cham provinces to prepare for an evacuation of
the area, Peou Sarmy said.
</P>
<P>
In Phnom Penh, about 40,000 sandbags were filled to prevent
flood waters from inundating the capital, Municipal Cabinet Chief

<HEADLINE> Industrial Restructuring Helps Boost Farmers Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Facing the international
competition and outdated growing patterns, China's booming
agricultural industry is setting all out to address the core
problems -- a slump of profits and the plummeting of farmers'
income.
</P>
<P>
According to China Daily today, better crop-growing mix, higher
farming skills and stronger processing ability are all among the
solutions.
</P>
<P>
"As the prices of a large number of China's major agricultural
products have neared or even exceeded those in the global market,
it is impossible for the country to add to the coffers of the
farmers by raising the farm produce prices by a large margin," Han
Jun, director of the Rural Development Research Institute under
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The per capita annual income growth of the farmers plummeted
from nine percent in the mid 1990s to 4.6 percent in 1997 and to 3.
8 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
With the incremental opening up of the country's agricultural
product market pending China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), China has embarked on a painful process to
overhaul the agricultural industry, the Daily said.
</P>
<P>
With a stockpile of 500 million tons of grain, the country is
still facing a shortage of higher-quality, special wheat for the
making of bread, cakes and biscuits. The Ministry of Agriculture
has asked farmers to reserve more acreage for efficient cash crops
and export-oriented agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem of irrational crop-growing mix and
agricultural structure, the ministry required earlier this year
that poor quality rice varieties in the South, winter wheat grown
south of the Yangtze river and spring wheat in Northeast China be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
With bumper harvests in five consecutive years since 1995, the
largest agricultural country in the world is now looking for
better ways to turn raw materials into better food.
</P>
<P>
By vigorously expanding farm produce processing, China is
expected to resolve the farmers' difficulty in selling their
products, down-sizing stockpiles and helping reverse the downward
trends in the prices of raw agricultural products, according to
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Han Jun proposed a model for co-operation between farmers and
agricultural product processing enterprises, in which agriculture
will become the "first workshop" where farmers-turned "workers"
grow what the market needs with financial and informational input
from the businesses.
</P>
<P>
China's investment in application and dissemination of advanced
agricultural technology and farming skills will be increased in
the years to come. New techniques, especially water-saving, cost-
effective technology and variety in crops and breeds will spread
to more areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government is also to simplify administrative
structure in rural areas and eliminate the random and irrational
fees and measures imposed on farmers, China Daily said.

<HEADLINE> China, Iceland Agree to Enhance Cooperative Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
REYKJAVIK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China and Iceland expressed
here on Sunday their shared desire to further develop and enhance
the friendship and cooperative relations between them.
</P>
<P>
During their talks Sunday evening, Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, and
Acting Speaker of the Icelandic parliament Gudmundur Arni
Stefansson agreed that joint efforts should be made to further
promote the exchanges between the two countries in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Saturday on a four-day official visit,
said he hoped his current visit to Iceland will help strengthen
the cooperative ties between the two countries, especially
cooperation between the legislative bodies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that relations between Iceland and China have been
developing smoothly in recent years, Stefansson said Iceland
attaches great importance to its ties with China and hopes to
further strengthen its friendship with China, deepen mutual
understanding and push forward the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Impressed by Iceland's economic achievements, Li said the
economic success of Iceland again proves that only by choosing a
path of development according to its specific conditions can a
nation succeed in economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Stefansson agreed with Li and said Iceland respects the
cultural traditions and histories of other countries and their
choice of ways of development. Every country has the right to its
own way of development, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Hopes to Expand Economic Cooperation With China EDS-rpts with corrected dateline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VILNIUS, Lithuania, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Parliament Speaker
Vytautas Landsbergis has said Lithuania hopes to expand business
and economic cooperation and develop closer economic ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation has already begun between the procuratorial organs
of Lithuania and China, and the two countries could also develop
cultural contact and expand their trade and economic links,
Landsbergis told Xinhua on eve of his Chinese counterpart Li
Peng's visit.
</P>
<P>
While Chinese restaurants and other enterprises in Lithuania
have helped improve mutual understanding between the two countries,
Lithuania is also eager to further develop cooperation in other
fields like investment and trans-continental transit transport,
the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis said that as a prospective member of the European
Union, Lithuania could become the intermediate depot for Chinese
commodities to be exported to Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the economic situation in Lithuania, Landsbergis said the
country is now undergoing economic reforms. Lithuania has already
overcome the effects of the Asian and Russian financial crises and
its economy began to pick up in the first half of this year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
These are the favorable conditions for the economic cooperation
between Lithuania and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis also said the coming visit to Lithuania by Chairman
of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress Li
Peng will further strengthen relations between the two countries
and will result in broader cooperation in more areas.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's two-way trade with China is the biggest in volume
among the three Baltic countries. According figures from Chinese
Customs, trade between the two countries in 1999 reached 27.13
million U.S. dollars, an increase of 12.6 percent over the
previous year. And in the first half of this year alone, it rose
to 22.77 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 52.7 percent over a
year earlier (volume of entrepot trade not included).

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wins Merdeka Cup Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia won the four-team
Merdeka Cup (Independence Cup) soccer tournament when they blitzed
Iraq 3-0 in the final at Senayan stadium here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Senior midfielder Aji Santoso opened the scoring in the 54th
minute. Two minutes later compatriot Bima Sakti added a goal,
beating Iraqi goalie Saad Nasir out of balance.
</P>
<P>
In the 65th minute, Indonesian striker Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto
passed the ball from the midfield, which was converted to a goal
by junior Gendut Doni Christiawan with a header.
</P>
<P>
Coach Nandar Iskandar said that he changed his strategy in the
second half after noticing the void in center field. "The
distance between strikers and defenders was too far and
midfielders had to cover quite a spacious area. I ask three
defenders to help their teammates at the center," he was quoted by
Monday's Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nandar said he had picked 20 out of 23 players who attended the
training program for the 2000 Asian Cup finals in Lebanon from
October 12 to 29.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Soccer Association of Indonesia Agum Gumelar
expressed hope that Sunday's victory could serve as a starting
point for Indonesia to achieve better results in regional events.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we beat a strong team like Iraq.
Hopefully it can be a starting point to move ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other teams in the tournament are Myanmar and Chinese Taipei.

<HEADLINE> Hendrawan Unpretentious About His Chance in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian men's singles
badminton player Hendrawan is unpretentious about his chance of
winning a gold in the upcoming Olympic games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not talk about my target at the Olympics. Everybody has
equal chances there. All I can say is that I am well prepared,"
he was quoted by Monday's Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Making his Olympic debut, Hendrawan hoped to continue the
country's recent gold medal success in badminton.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won its first golds thanks to Susi Susanti in the
women's singles and Alan Budikusuma in the men's singles at the
1992 Olympics in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky saved the
country's pride by winning the gold in the men's doubles at the
Olympics in Atlanta, the United States.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Badminton Association of Indonesia and the
National Sports Council target the shuttlers to bring home two
golds in men's singles and doubles.
</P>
<P>
World number three Hendrawan managed to beat world number one
and compatriot Taufik Hidayat 9-15, 15-12, 15-13 for the first
time at the simulation last week.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year shuttler said that he still needed to improve his
emotional condition for the quadrennial event from September 15 to
October 1.
</P>
<P>
"I still have to learn to control my emotions better. I can't
overestimate myself or lack motivation for the event. In the
Olympics, the emotional and mental factors are really important,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan is Indonesia's hero in 1998 and 2000 Thomas Cup
championships. He is training with Paulus Pasurney. He has
improved his fitness and stamina.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm so exhausted from training, it is difficult for me to
concentrate. I have problems sleeping at night. Maybe when we
are there (Sydney), we will have a different atmosphere that will
help me increase my fighting spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia qualified Taufik Hidayat, Hendrawan and Marlev
Mainaky in the singles event.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan regarded Taufik and Dane Peter Gade Christensen as
the strongest candidates to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
"Taufik is playing well lately, winning in both Indonesia and
Malaysia Open tournaments. While Peter, after his poor form in the
Indonesia Open in July, might be better prepared, helping him to
reach the finals," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Emperor Buried in Luxury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found more than 5,000 graves and over 260 pits near the tomb of
Jing, the fourth emperor of the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24
A.D.) and his empress in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
These graves and pits, covering 3.5 square kilometers in area,
were found in good order and are divided into different groups
according to the identity of the buried people.
</P>
<P>
The graves and pits were constructed in the period between the
early Western Han and the mid Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), said
Jiao Nanfeng, who led a group of archaeologists to unearth the
tomb of Emperor Jing.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 relics have been excavated from over 300 tombs.
The relics include various porcelain documents and wares, bronze
wares, jade wares, lacquer wares and copper coins.
</P>
<P>
Relics unearthed from the pits include a large number of
colored porcelain tomb figures, such as various animals, copper
and iron weapons, tools, wooden carts, adornments, currency and
grain.
</P>
<P>
Han Wei, director of the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological
Institute, noted that excavation of the tomb of Emperor Jing is of
great significance in studying the burial culture in ancient China
and especially in the Qin (221 B.C.- 207 B.C.) and Han dynasties.

<HEADLINE> China Assured of Grain Self-Sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China is assured of self-
sufficiency of grain supply despite increasing pressure of
population growth, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language newspaper, China is expected
to import 20 million to 30 million tons of grain every year in the
first decades of the 21 century.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that that by using advanced farming
techniques, the country will be able to increase grain output per
hectare by 1.5 tons.
</P>
<P>
The per hectare output of two-thirds of China's grain field is
four-plus tons at present, far below the average output in western
countries.
</P>
<P>
With the population peaking at 1.6 billion in 2030, China's
total demand for grain will be approximately 640 million tons
every year. Fifty percent of the demand will be used for feed.
</P>
<P>
The country is to slow down the rapidly increasing demand of
grain used for feed by promoting scientific and technological
advances in aquatic and animal farming, according to Mei Fangquan,
an expert with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
As people eat more meat, poultry and fruits, the directly
consumed per capita grain ration were on the decline over the past
two decades, dropping from 253 kilograms in 1985 to 234 kg in 1995
and to 213 kg this year, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Investigates Foreigners' Visit to Opposition Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government is
investigating a matter said to be in connection with some 14
foreigners and a team from the U.S. Congress who recently visited
the headquarters here of the opposition political party, the
National League for Democracy (NLD).
</P>
<P>
An official Information Sheet available here Monday morning
charged that certain quarters of the NLD have been conspiring with
the God's Army, an outlawed armed youth organization based on the
Thai-Myanmar border which is said to have been involved in the
smuggling of five remote-controlled bombs into the country to
engage in terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
NLD senior leaders have been told to remain at home, the
information sheet said, denying that they are put under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
The government released this information sheet one day after
NLD General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi and more than a dozen
others were brought back by the authorities before dawn last
Saturday from Dala, the area where they had been barred from
travelling further after staying there for eight days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the same day following the return of the NLD
leaders, the NLD headquarters in the capital's Bahan township was
surrounded by armed police and a search operation was carried out
at the headquarters, eyewitnesses said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Evaluate State of Emergency in Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
evaluate the implementation of the civilian emergency in Maluku
Province in the eastern part of the country, The Indonesian
Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Amir Hamzah, chairman of the Christian working
group, as saying President Abdurrahman Wahid has ordered
Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security Affairs
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Minister for Home Affairs and
Regional Autonomy Soerjadi Soedirdja to evaluate the state of
emergency in the province.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah disclosed details of the request following a meeting
with the president here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah said the situation in the province is now more conducive.
</P>
<P>
"If there are attacks, they are due to miscommunication," he
said, adding that the working group has asked the president to
make every effort to halt any further conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah said that after receiving the Christian working group,
the president is due to receive leaders of the Muslim working
group. He will later bring the two groups together in hopes of
reaching agreement on the long-standing conflict.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah added that the president agreed the Maluku communal
conflicts would be settled by the people in Maluku and without
international intervention.
</P>
<P>
The government imposed a state of emergency in Maluku and North
Maluku provinces, where more than 3,500 have died since the bloody
violence between Muslims and Christians erupted in January last
year.
</P>
<P>
Based on Presidential Decree No. 88/2000, the state of
emergency was in force from June 27 to the end of August.
</P>
<P>
There are calls for an extension to the emergency status and an
evaluation of the emergency to determine whether it would be
extended.
</P>
<P>
Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina who heads the emergency
authorities supported calls for the central government to extend
the status.
</P>
<P>
"I believe a civil emergency status is still needed,"
Latuconsina was quoted by the paper as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- At least three passengers were
drowned in a boat accident in waters off Maluku islands, Indonesia,
according to The Jakarta Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Mulya Star, a boat carrying 43 people, sank off the Manipa

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Warns GAM Not to Violate Aceh Cease-fire Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
warned that it would suspend the newly extended humanitarian pause
in Aceh if the separatist Free Aceh Movement (GAM) violates the
accord during the one-month probation period.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made by Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab on Sunday,
The Jakarta Post daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government will evaluate the monitoring
team's monthly report to see if GAM adheres to the ground rules of
the accord which was reached by the two sides last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's accord said the two sides "reconfirmed their support
for the humanitarian pause in Aceh and have agreed in principle to
extend it to the second phase."
</P>
<P>
The first cease-fire accord was signed in May and expired last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, GAM's commander in Aceh Besar Abutazurra welcomed
the extension of the humanitarian pause and hoped it would pave
the way for a clear political solution to the Aceh issue.
</P>
<P>
But it is unclear whether GAM negotiators are willing to enter
discussion on any other alternatives to separation from Indonesia,
which has been the main call to arms of the separatist group.
</P>
<P>
Alwi said, "We should start to see what we can agree on for the
status of Aceh. For Jakarta, Aceh is an integral part of Indonesia.
We are open to suggestions and we are going to offer special
autonomy for them."
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed, the Indonesian government will not tolerate
any talk about the status of the province outside the context of a
unitary state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Aceh have been fighting for 25 years for independence,
a greater share of oil profits and the right to impose Islamic
religious laws. Thousands have been killed in decades of fighting
between Indonesian security forces and Aceh rebels.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns to Ease Rural Strain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts said that
construction of small towns below the county level is a major way
to ease the tension between the rural population and arable land.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, with a per capita average of
arable land of about 0.1 hectare, China is expected to have 1.6
billion population in 2030. Nearly 80 percent of the population
are now living in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Du Yin, of the Ministry of Agriculture, said that one key
solution to the strain of land resources is to move rural
population to small towns, where tertiary industry and township
enterprises could be greatly expanded.
</P>
<P>
Already 138 million rural residents do not work in agricultural
production, according China Daily.
</P>
<P>
However, the construction of rural towns should not result in a
flurry of modern towns, said Wen Tiejun, a senior researcher with
the Rural Economic Research Center under the Ministry of
Agriculture.

Wen said that the ultimate goal of building small towns is to
step up the shuffle of the rural population to small towns bellow
the county level.
</P>
<P>
Du Yin noted that this lies in line with the country's efforts
to pursue sustainable agricultural development and increase the
income of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that as more and more rural surplus labors are
taken up by the accelerating process of urbanization, the tension
between arable land and agricultural population will be greatly
eased and the production and quality of farm produce will be
further lifted.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Party Says Zambia Should be Better Managed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the recently founded
Republic Party, former Environment Minister Ben Mwila said here
Monday that Zambia should be better managed and its resources used
more prudently to foster higher and sustainable growth rates.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the policies of free market
economy of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD)
were and are good for the nation and failings have been in the
implementation and the misfocus which has now set in.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia was the second largest economy at its
independence in 1964 in the southern African sub-continent with
its GDP roughly about 35 percent that of South Africa but now its
GDP is only two to three percent that of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zambia still has large tracts of arable land and much of Zambia
is in the reliable reainbelt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has one of the vastest water reservoirs both surface and
underground and a refocus can result in a stronger economy which
would furnish his country with means to tackle poverty, said Mwila.
</P>
<P>
Mwila said he believes in government which pays attention to
management and doesn't leave things to chance, a government which
is action-oriented instead of meaningless gimmicks and ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is not the so-called crippling external debt
that chokes economic development, but the way we use the available
resources."
</P>
<P>
Zambia with reasonable rates of growth can easily manage annual
debt repayments of 200-300 million U.S. dollars, said Mwila.
</P>
<P>
Mwila lost his ministerial portfolio early last month and days
after he was expelled from MMD on charge of involvement in anti-
party activities.
</P>
<P>
Mwila announced his candidature for the MMD presidency on 26 of
last May in a bid to run for the country's presidency in the
general elections to be held 2001.
</P>
<P>
Mwila launched his Republic Party on August 19.

<HEADLINE> British Cabinet Office Minister to Quit Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam is to stand down as a member of the
parliament at the next general election, the BBC reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam, who now serves as the cabinet office minister, said it
was a personal decision and her commitment to Labor was as strong
as ever.
</P>
<P>
She insisted her decision to retire is "nothing to do with
politics," and rejected suggestions of a conspiracy against her.
</P>
<P>
Ms Mowlam was made Northern Ireland Secretary by Prime
Minister Tony Blair in 1997 and steered the 1998 Good Friday
Agreement through its difficult initial stages. But she was
replaced in October 1999 by Peter Mandelson when the peace process
stalled.
</P>
<P>
She had a 15-minute meeting with the prime minister at Number
10 earlier on Monday. Downing Street said she would keep her job
as Cabinet Office minister until the next election.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said Blair believed she would be "a
great loss to the government and a great loss to parliament."
</P>
<P>
Ms Mowlam has consistently been one of the most popular
ministers in Blair's government since New Labor swept to power in
May 1997.

<P>
Lukashenko and the delegation he leads also plans to visit the

<HEADLINE> Britain Proposes a Military Staff College for U.N. Peacekeeping Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Monday called for
the United Nations to create a military inspectorate and staff
college to command and train U.N. peacekeeping operations around
the world.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
and Menzies Campbell, the foreign affairs spokesman for the
Liberal Democrats, a smaller party on British political platform,
the college could be located in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The report said the United Nations must provide better-trained
and better-equipped peacekeepers who can respond quickly to
aggression.
</P>
<P>
"No longer must U.N. 'blue helmets' stand by while the most
serious crimes against humanity are being committed," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the United Nations to restructure its
peacekeeping role to focus more on conflicts within countries
rather than between nations, and to allow intervention in the
countries where the likelihood of mass murder exists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the BBC, Cook and Campbell called on the United
Nations to establish a military staff college to train
peacekeepers and a central command center to offer stronger
leadership.
</P>
<P>
"Britain would be a very logical place to have it because of
our expertise in peacekeeping and our commitment to the United
Nations," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
This joint report was released shortly ahead of the U.N.'s
Millennium Summit in New York. About 150 world leaders are
scheduled to meet in the summit and to discuss the United Nations'
peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the U.N.'s peacekeeping role has repeatedly
come under fire after the U.N.'s passive performance in some of
the peacekeeping missions failed to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
In May, about 500 U.N. peacekeepers were seized by rebels in
the west African nation of Sierra Leone, causing another
embarrassment to the international organization.
</P>
<P>
The British report also suggested that the United Nations
should require member states to provide quarterly assessments of
the soldiers available for peacekeeping operations.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Seeks Far Right Party Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The federal government will deploy all of its forces to defend
the state and secure the democracy," said Schroeder. "We should
not tolerate anti-Semitism and neo-Nazi violence here in Germany."
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, Germany's reputation in the world will be hurt and
foreign investors will be scared off," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder told 197 German ambassadors at a foreign policy
meeting that he was determined to put forward the legal steps
aimed to prohibit the far right National Democratic Party (NPD).
</P>
<P>
The government will launch the lawsuit as soon as it has
collected enough testimony against the extremist party, and the
petition "should at least have a little chance at the Federal
Constitutional Court," said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
A public debate is going on around whether to ban the NPD,
which has been advocating "Germany belongs to Germans" and
encouraging violence against foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Basic Law says the Constitutional Court is empowered
to outlaw any political party if the party has been ruled as a
threat to democracy.
</P>
<P>
The law has been invoked only twice since 1945, and many are
afraid that the government's petition against the NPD may be ruled
by the Constitutional Court as short of testimony.

<HEADLINE> Czech Current Account Deficit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Czech current account
deficit doubled on a year-on-year basis in the first half of this
year, the Czech central bank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the Czech balance of
payments deficit for the first six months jumped to 27.2 billion
crowns (about 716 million U.S. dollars) from 11.5 billion crowns (
303 million dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Czech central bank attributed the growth in the current
account deficit to the rise of the foreign trade deficit. The
trade gap rose to 43.4 billion crowns (about 1.14 billion dollars)
in the January-June period of this year from 25.2 billion crowns (
about 660 million dollars) in the mentioned period last year.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said the rise was expected and should have
little impact on full year estimates. But some analysts warned
that if the deficit continued to worsen, the crown would fall.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund expected last month that the
current account deficit of the country would rise to 3.5 percent
of GDP in 2000.

the signing of a number of bilateral cooperation agreements.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Disagree on Debates Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush and his Democratic rival Al
Gore still disagree on the schedule of debates that will affect
the fall presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor Bush has offered three presidential debates,
including one next week, but his proposal was immediately rejected
by Gore.
</P>
<P>
Bush suggested to have the first debate next week on September
12 during a special prime-time edition of NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
He also offered to hold a debate on October 3 in Los Angeles on
CNN's "Larry King Live" and another one on October 17 at
Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally before a Labor Day parade in Chicago suburb
Monday, Bush described Gore's rejection of his proposal as "
Washington doublespeak."
</P>
<P>
"My opponent said he would debate me anyplace, anytime,
anywhere," Bush said. "I said fine. Why don't we just show up...
and discuss our differences."
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden the words 'anytime, anywhere' don't mean
anything," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gore, however, insisted that Bush must first accept the three
90-minute debates proposed by the Commission on Presidential
Debates.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about what is best for George W. Bush or what is
best for Al Gore. It's about what's best for the American people,"
said Gore, who has accepted the commission's offers for three 90-
minute debates.
</P>
<P>
Gore maintains that the three events proposed by the commission
will reach the widest audience, but Bush's proposed debates will
not.
</P>
<P>
Gore's campaign chairman, William Daley, also said: "We reject
George Bush's plan to shortchange Americans by cutting tens of
millions of people out of the presidential debate audience."

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls in Myanmar Ambassador to Protest Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Office minister
John Battle on Monday called in the Myanmar ambassador to protest
at the regime's latest repression of the opposition party, the
Burmese National League for Democracy (NLD).
</P>
<P>
The move was taken after Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi
had been kept locked in her residence in Yangon, the capital of
Myanmar, where she was forcibly returned in the early hours of
Saturday following a nine-day standoff in her car after
authorities barred her and her supporters from traveling outside
the capital.
</P>
<P>
"I shall be making clear to Ambassador Hyaw Win that the
forcible return of Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto house arrest of
NLD leaders and the search of the party headquarters are still
serious infringements of the Burmese (Myanmar) people's human and
political rights," Battle said in a statement issued in London by
the foreign office.
</P>
<P>
"I deplore this treatment of the leader of a democratically
elected party and other members of the NLD," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I shall be conveying to Dr Kyaw Win our protest at the
manhandling of the British ambassador in Rangoon (Yangon) over the
weekend as he tried to establish contact with members of the NLD.
I will also demand that diplomatic access to Aung San Suu Kyi and
her colleagues be immediately restored," the statement quoted
battle as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office statement said NLD won the 1990 elections in
Burma with an overwhelming 80 percent of the seats, but they have
never been permitted to take office.
</P>
<P>
Britain had persuaded its European Union partners to strengthen
the common EU position on Myanmar, cosponsored resolutions in the
UN Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations General
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Meets Former Fijian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook and Foreign Office Minister John Battle Monday met former
Fiji Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry here in London and called on
Fiji's interim government to restore democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Battle said he had assured Chaudhry,
former ethnic Indian prime minister of the Pacific island state
who was deposed by armed rebels in May and held hostage in Fiji's
parliament building, that Britain was "committed to ensuring that
Fiji rejoins the international community as a constitutional
democracy as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"Britain will continue to make clear to the Fiji interim
government that we want to see them map out, and stick to, a
timetable for an early return to democracy, one that is within the
framework of the 1997 constitution and respects the rights of all
the people of Fiji," said Battle.
</P>
<P>
He added that Commonwealth countries will discuss Fiji when
their foreign ministers meet in New York next week, on the
sidelines of a United Nations meeting.
</P>
<P>
Fiji businessman George Speight, who is behind the coup attempt,
wanted the constitution of the Pacific island state redrawn to
exclude ethnic Indians from government.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry is touring foreign capitals to muster support for the
reinstatement of his ousted government. He has already visited
India, New Zealand and Australia and held talks with European
Union representatives in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
He visited London last week and held talks with Commonwealth
Secretary General Don McKinnon.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Fischer Expect EU to Accept Eastern Members in 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer Monday said the
European Union would accept first new members in central and
eastern Europe in year 2005 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
At a foreign policy meeting in Berlin, the two rejected the
proposal of Guenter Verheugen, a German Commissar in the European
Commission, to hold a referendum before the EU's eastward
enlargement. Attending the meeting were 197 German ambassadors in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the EU should be ready to accept new members in
year 2003, and then it should be left for the candidate countries
to decide themselves when they would take the membership.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The eastern candidates should not think that Germany
put its national economical interest above the EU enlargement
policy, we are not willing to see any problem with the time plan."
</P>
<P>
While the EU is under pressure from some member countries to
postpone its time plan for eastward enlargement, Verheugen, a
supporter of eastward enlargement himself, last Saturday indicated
Germany should at first hold a referendum on whether the EU should
accept new members.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen's proposal has aroused anxieties of the candidate
countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Cyprus. But both
Schroeder and Fischer rejected it as "not allowed under Germany's
Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said it was "totally unacceptable" as Verheugen had
proposed to modify German's law for a referendum on eastward
enlargement, and he urged the bloc to accelerate the steps.
</P>
<P>
He told the diplomats, "I hope the first group new members of
EU, including Poland, should join the bloc in year 2005 latest."
</P>
<P>
Fischer indicated the leaders of the present 15 EU member
countries should hammer out a "driving map" at the end of this
year to lay down most important steps.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Fischer also repeated their support to a "multi-
speed Europe." There should be "deferent integration processes" in
a much-enlarged group, they said.
</P>
<P>
"In a union with 25 or more member countries, not always all
the partners have the same willingness and ability to cooperate,"
said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
He also supported a reform of EU's decision making process,
stressing the present "one ballot veto" voting system would not
fit an enlarged group.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he would call on another EU "reform summit" in
year 2004 aimed to create a "European Charter" that would divide
the power between the Union and member countries.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Rejects NATO's Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Belarusian government
reiterated on Monday its rebuff to the enlargement of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), considering this "making the
political situation in Europe more tense."
</P>
<P>
President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, who will conclude
his visit to Cuba on Tuesday, said at a press conference at this
capital that his country keeps a firm opposition to the
enlargement of the military organization.
</P>
<P>
President Lukashenko was the first leader of the former Soviet
republics to make a call against the NATO's advance towards the
East.
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO "is in the gates of our borders" when asked
what is the purpose of enlarging a military block, and that
nowadays in Europe there are no other military alliances.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recent entry of the Czech Republic and the
possible future entry of Slovakia to NATO, Lukashenko said that
the situation is going to become more tense for neighboring
countries, and that they will have to strengthen their defense.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, invited by Cuban President Fidel Castro, arrived to
this island last Saturday, in the first visit of a Belarusian
leader to Latin America.
