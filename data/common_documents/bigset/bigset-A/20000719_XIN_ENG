<HEADLINE> Bio-Safety Guidelines Streamline Genetic Research in Bangladesh: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's research activities in
the field of biotechnology entered into a new phase as Science
Ministry had endorsed "Bio-safety Guidelines" to boost ingenuous
endeavors in genetics, experts said at a lecture conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fresh efforts are in the take-off stage following creation of
the new guidelines for streamlining research on genetically
modified organism, researchers said at the conference hosted by
the Science Museum as part of its annual popular science discourse.
</P>
<P>
Bio-technologist Professor Syed Hadiuzzaman of Dhaka University
said the bio-safety guideline of Bangladesh would serve as
protective shield against unscrupulous research with transgenic
plants or bacteria popularly known as genetically modified
organism.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Human Genome Project, he said the scientists have
discovered the secret map of life and this would create huge
impact on the future medicine and pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
Science Minister Noor Uddin Khan said the government is aware
of the impact of innovations in the field of life science and the
authorities would place bio-safety guidelines before parliament
for legislative endorsement.
</P>
<P>
The proposed National Institute of Biotechnology (NIB) in Savar,
a suburb of Dhaka, will add further impetus to the
biotechnological research in the country, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Jones to Race against Miller in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- American star Marion Jones will
race against rival Inger Miller in the 100 meters in next month's
British Grand Prix track meet, organizers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The event will be held in August 5 at Crystal Palace following
the U.S. Olympic trials in Sacramento, California, this week.
</P>
<P>
It could be their final clash between Jones and Miller ahead
of the Olympic Games in Sydney in September, where Jones will be
seeking a record five gold medals.
</P>
<P>
It will mark one of Jones' first appearances in Europe
following the U.S. trials, where she has already won the women's
long jump and the 100, beating Miller with a time of 10.88.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who finished second to Jones in the 100 in last year's
World Championships and won the 200 after Jones was injured in the
semifinals, finished second in Sacramento in 11.05.
</P>
<P>
At Crystal Palace last year, Jones set a season's world best
time in the 100 of 10.80 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Donors Promise Zambia 1 Billion Dollars for Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Donors including the World Bank
Tuesday promised to provide Zambia with slightly over one billion
U.S. dollars within one year in support of the country's economic
reform and poverty reduction programs.
</P>
<P>
They made the promise at the end of the three-day 12th
Consultative Group meeting, the first ever here in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by 25 bilateral and multilateral agencies
discussed the country's economic reform and poverty reduction
programs.
</P>
<P>
The discussions focused on the issues including public
expenditure priorities and management, political governance, HIV/
AIDS, diversification of the economy, Zambia's high debt burden,
and most importantly the need to focus development efforts on
poverty reduction and homegrown development strategies.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed the need for the country and its
cooperating partners to work toward expeditious access of Zambia
to debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by delegations from Belgium, Britain,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United States, the African
Development Bank, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa,
the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the Food

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Executive and Legislative in Efforts toward Rapprochement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
and House Speaker Ghali Umar Na'Abba held a closed-door meeting
Monday to patch the much troubled ties between the executive and
legislative branch of the west African nation's government.
</P>
<P>
The President was said to have vehemently dismissed allegations
that he was bent on disrupting the House leadership by helping a
come-back of the resigned former house speaker Salisu Buhari,
reported Nigerian press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly pleas from both parties at the meeting to
sink their differences whereupon they promised to respect the
principles of separation of powers and work toward the promotion
of democracy.
</P>
<P>
In another unusual approach toward rapprochement, President
Olusegun Obasanjo Monday commissioned the Senate President Chuba
Okadigbo's capital residence.
</P>
<P>
"Let there be harmony among all the realms of government, with
mutual respect and tolerance as our guides and with the common aim
of providing good governance in a free society, where prosperity
and happiness will reign", said Okadigbo at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The two branches of government had often been found at odds
since the returning into power of the civilian government last
year. Since then, Obasanjo often criticizes the top legislature of
low efficiency and selfishness, resulting in the delays of coming
into effect of important laws, the legislature trading words back
by accusing the president of acting in a totalitarian style like
former military rulers.

<HEADLINE> Tetanus Kills 34,600 Nigerian Infants Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Tetanus still causes about 34,600
infant deaths in Nigeria yearly, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said
in its report, which became available Tuesday to Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
Tetanus attacks new-born babies through unsanitary birth
practices, including the cutting of umbilical chord with unclean
blade.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF report, Nigeria has the second highest
figure of infant deaths caused by neonatal tetanus, with India
topping the list with 48,600. Pakistan is placed the third.
</P>
<P>
It said the figures for the first three countries on the list
accounted for more than half of the world's neonatal tetanus
deaths, an "entirely preventable" disease.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Conservative GC Pledges Cooperation with Majlis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Guardians
Council (GC) pledged on Wednesday to cooperate with the sixth
Majlis (parliament) which is dominated by reformers supporting
President Mohammad Khatami's liberal policies.
</P>
<P>
GC members had already voiced their support for the Majlis in
their meeting with speaker Mehdi Karrubi and the two bodies will
work together for the development of the country, spokesman of the
12-member body Ayatollah Reza Ostadi said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a meeting between GC members and Majlis
speaker Karrubi early this month, in which both sides called for "
understanding and coordination."
</P>
<P>
Ostadi dismissed allegations that the GC had acted in a biased
manner in its supervision of the parliamentary elections in
February, saying the council would not be swayed by the wishes of
any particular (political) faction.
</P>
<P>
February's elections resulted in a landslide victory for
reformers, who seized control of the legislative body after years
of conservative dominance. But the conservative GC, supervisor of
the elections, had gone out of its way to prevent reformers from
taking over the Majlis smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Citing vote-rigging in the election process, the council
annulled balloting results in a number of constituencies, in some
cases even directly transferring the seats of reformist winners to
their conservative opponents.
</P>
<P>
Although the new Majlis managed to start work on May 27, many
people believe that it will face many obstacles in pushing through
the country's reformist programs advocated by Khatami since 1997.
</P>
<P>
All bills passed by the Majlis have to be approved by the GC
before they become law. And if there is any conflict between the
two bodies, a third body, the State Expediency Council (SEC), will
act as the arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
The SEC is headed by former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, a
moderate believed to be close to the conservatives. Rafsanjani had
taken part in the February elections and managed to win a seat in
the new Majlis, but quitted the seat after being accused of
receiving help from the GC, the election watchdog.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, U.S. Presidents Discuss Palestinian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
received a telephone call from United States President Bill Clinton
Wednesday night on the ongoing negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Clinton briefed Mubarak on the
Palestinian-Israeli talks under way at the Camp David presidential
retreat near the U.S. capital of Washington, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on the contentious issues
between the two sides, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Since July 11, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, hosted by Clinton, have been negotiating
final solutions to the thorniest issues including the final borders
of the future Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the fate
of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The summit has entered a make-or-break stage as President
Clinton is preparing to leave for Japan to attend a Group of Eight
summit. Clinton had planned to depart on Wednesday, but he latered
postponed by 24 hours to give peace efforts one last try.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Barak was reported to be preparing to go
home after concluding that "the Palestinians are not a true partner
for peace." White House spokesman Joe Lockhart confirmed later
that the discussions were continuing.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, plays
an active role in mediating the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Suspended Egyptian Islamist Party, Newspaper Face Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's socialist public prosecutor
on Wednesday filed nine charges against leaders of the suspended
Islamist Labor Party and its newspaper Al-Shaab that could land the
defendants in jail for up to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Party leader Ibrahim Shukri, secretary-general Abel Hussein and
Al-Shaab editor-in-chief Magdi Hussein are accused of having links
with the banned fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood and members of
other Islamic extremist groups, prosecutor Gaber Rihan said.
</P>
<P>
Magdi Hussein has been serving a two-year prison term since
April for defaming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Agriculture and Land Reclamation Youssef Amin Wali.
</P>
<P>
The bi-weekly Al-Shaab offered a platform to Muslim Brotherhood
and other Islamist groups to spread incitement and propagate their
tenets, Rihan was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The defendants are also accused of changing the orientation and
the emblem of the party, turning it into an Islamist party without
notifying the country's Political Parties Committee, which
regulates party activities, changes introduced to the internal
structure of the party, particularly its name and conditions for
joining.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1979, the party was originally called the Socialist
Labor Party. In 1987, it formed an electoral coalition with the
Muslim Brotherhood and two years later adopted an Islamist
political line.
</P>
<P>
The party officials were also accused of not informing the
parties committee of meetings held by its leader and officials with
foreign groups and political organizations, Rihan said.
</P>
<P>
The defendants asked for donation from citizens without the
authorization of the Social Affairs Ministry, and they also failed
to declare some of their sources of financing and donors' names and
prepare an annual party and newspaper budget, he added.
</P>
<P>
The defendants face sentences of between three and 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
The parties committee, which includes figures close to the
government, suspended the party and newspaper in May, citing
divisions in the party. The suspension came before Egypt's
parliamentary elections, expected in November.

<HEADLINE> 17 Elderly Costa Ricans Die in Asylum Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The asylum is situated 190 kilometers northwest of San Jose,
said Red Cross and Judicial Investigations Organization (OIJ)
sources on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross official Walter Zarate told Xinhua that it was the
Tilaran Home for the Elderly, an asylum managed by a national
association that housed a number of old people.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire has not been determined, but police
sources said that it could have been caused by a short circuit in
a television set.
</P>
<P>
The judicial authorities are investigating the possibility of a
fire caused on purpose, but so far that hypothesis has no ground.
"There are no circumstances that could point to a fire started by
arsonists," said the OIJ director Lineth Saborio.
</P>
<P>
The fire spread rapidly for the strong winds dominating in that
area. The main Fire Department station is located in the city of
Canas, 22 kilometers from Tilaran, which delayed the assistance to
the old persons.
</P>
<P>
The death of the 17 persons and the injuries suffered by 24
more were attributed to the fact that only two persons were in
charge of the asylum management, and to the situation of the old
people who had difficulty to move without assistance.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Defense Slams Frankfurt Airport Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The defense team
at the Lockerbie trial on Wednesday pointed its finger at the lax
of security at the Frankfurt airport.
</P>
<P>
Jack Davidson, one of the defense counsels, said a United
States Federal Aviation Authority inspection had criticised Pan Am
security at the airport just months after the December 1988 mid-
air bombing that killed 259 people on board Pan Am Flight 103 and
11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"It is my opinion that U.S. citizens are at risk when they fly
out of this airport," said Davidson quoting a Federal Aviation
Authority report dated May 23, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The defense counsel said that undercover Federal Aviation
Authority inspectors had been able to rummage unchallenged through
Pan Am luggage containers at the Frankfurt airport in January 1989
and roam around parked aircraft and unguarded luggage with no
visible identity badges on them.
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that drastic measures must be taken to ensure
that Pan Am conforms to even minimum requirements," said Davidson
quoting the same report.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution accused Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin
Khalifa Fahima of working as Libyan Arab Airlines employees at
Malta's Luqa airport to put a bomb on a plane heading for
Frankfurt. The bomb was then transferred onto the New York-bound
flight.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said that the two Libyans had put stolen Air
Malta luggage tags on the suitcase containing the bomb that caused
the mid-air explosion on December 21, 1988, over the Scottish town
of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
But the Libyans have entered a special defense by blaming
Palestinian terrorists in Frankfurt for the blast.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution will have to prove its case against the two
Libyans beyond reasonable doubt for the three Scottish judges to
give verdict. The two Libyans are charged with conspiracy of
murder, murder and breach of international aircraft safety laws.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the two Libyans will have to serve their life
sentence in Scottish jail. If the case could not be proven, the
Libyans will have to be set free.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial went underway on May 3 this year after
almost 12 years of investigation and preparation and is now
expected to last up to a year.

<HEADLINE> Frost in Brazil Raises Colombian Coffee Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Freezing weather that affected the
coffee harvest in Brazil has caused a rise in the price of the
Colombian grain, Coffee Raisers National Federation (FNC) manager
Jorge Cardenas said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian coffee internal quotation rose 17 percent, from
164.2 dollars to 192.2 dollars for a 125-kilo bag, Cardenas told
the press.
</P>
<P>
A cold wave from the Antarctic affected last week the coffee
plantations in the states of Parana and Sao Paulo, in the south of
Brazil, and Monday those of Minas Gerais, the biggest coffee
producer.
</P>
<P>
The temperature drop in Brazil, the biggest coffee producer in
the world, became "a lifesaver" for the depressed Colombian coffee
sector, added Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
The prices of Colombian coffee in the international markets,
which was 0.82 U.S. dollars per pound two weeks ago, jumped
Tuesday to 1.21 dollars because of the nervousness of the market
after the frost in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The frost in Brazil was not as intense as others that have
destroyed up to 10 million 70 kilo bags, producers said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia will produce this year 11.5 million bags, a little
more than what was estimated before, 10.5 million bags, because of
better weather conditions, after a long raining season.

<HEADLINE> Panama Starts to Replace Canal's World War II Rails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The breaking of the concrete structures that support the steel
rails started with great speed in the Gatun sluices, in the
Atlantic, in order to reduce the time of waiting for the ships
that traverse the 80-kilometer long waterway.
</P>
<P>
Canal engineer Jose Reyes, in charge of the works, said that
the rails had to be replaced because of the increase in the
tonnage of the ships and the natural wear of the steel with time.
The canal was inaugurated in 1914.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that the work is complicated because of the
structures that must be demolished, built to resist an eventual
air bombing by Japan against the Canal during World War II (1939-
1945).
</P>
<P>
The works include the remotion and replacing of several
kilometers of rail lines, the weight of which has not been
determined by the technicians.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) is also modernizing the
structure and widening the so-called "Culebra Cut" at a total cost
of one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ACP said that the cut, 13 kilometer long and 15 meter deep,
has needed tons of explosives and the dredging of the Canal bottom,
with millions of cubic meters of mud and rocks, with the goal of
widening it from 152 meters to a minimum of 192 meters.

<HEADLINE> Trade Groups Resolved to Crack Down on Conflict Diamonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTWERP, Belgium, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The world's two largest
diamond trade groups Wednesday worked out a resolution on how to
crack down on conflict diamonds that have been used to fund wars
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The resolution by the International Diamond Manufacturers
Association and the World Federation of Diamond Bourses came out
at the end of a three-day World Diamond Conference, held at the
world's largest diamond trading center.
</P>
<P>
"Over the three days of deliberations it was clear that the
feeling of everyone was that conflict diamonds are not acceptable,
" said Sean Cohen, president of the International Diamond
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for an international system to certify as
legal rough diamonds bound for export and a global electronic
registry mechanism to monitor the export and import of rough
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also wanted legislation by all countries
importing rough diamonds that would accept only diamond parcels
officially sealed and registered in the exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
It also warned to ban any dealer trading conflict diamonds that
are banned by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Both the diamond industry and opinion groups welcomed the
resolution that was a revised combination of two separate
resolutions by the two diamond groups.
</P>
<P>
The diamond industry is better known for its tradition of
secrecy by conducting million-dollar deals on a handshake.
</P>
<P>
The measures proposed by the Antwerp resolution are expected to
bring both transparency and control to trade of rough diamonds,
according to delegates to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Lax controls at international markets have been blamed for
allowing conflict diamonds to continue to reach the markets though
major diamond centers like Antwerp, Bombay of India, Tel Aviv of
Israel and New York have worked out tougher rules on certifying
the origins of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The South African diamond conglomerate, De Beers, said that it
was instructing its 125 major diamond buyers not to purchase gems
from African conflict zones. The conglomerate controls 60 percent
of the uncut diamond market of the world.
</P>
<P>
The global diamond business obtains each year 6.8 billion U.S.
dollars from trade in rough diamonds which in turn generate a
retail diamond jewelry sales of around 56 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Antwerp is the world's largest diamond trading center, handling
some 80 percent of the world trade in rough diamonds and around 50
percent of the trade in polished gems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Feels "Pressure, Impatience" Over EU GMO Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- There was "pressure and
impatience" in the United States over the European Union's
moratorium on imports of genetically modified food and also
exasperation among U.S. corn farmers and exporters as well as the
lawmakers who represent them, a U.S. official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Robert LaRussa, acting U.S. undersecretary of commerce, said
despite the anger about the EU's stance on genetically modified
organisms (GMOs), the United States is not currently involved in
talks about filing a complaint on the issue to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
But he said the GMOs was among the issues he discussed in talks
with European Commission officials this week.
</P>
<P>
The 15-country EU has had moratorium on new GMO approvals since
October 1998, while new legislation is being drafted. EU
environmental ministers agreed this month to keep the ban, but
European environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom said she was
hopeful the ban would be lifted by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, some EU countries, such as France, are reluctant to
lift the ban until legislation is drawn up establishing the
liability of producers for any damage GMOs may cause to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
"Given consumer concerns in the United States, the United
States is not insensitive to the concerns of the European Union
and its consumers in this area," he told reporters here in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, however, it is a market access issue
ultimately to us. There is a lot of money in U.S. exports at stake,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The undersecretary also welcomed the agreement reached at an EU-
U.S. summit in Lisbon in May to set up an independent panel to
review biotechnology issues, including genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
Before the de facto ban imposed in October 1998, the EU
approved only 18 genetically modified products for sale or
production.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Build More First-aid Stations Along Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to build more
first-aid stations along its highways to give emergency medical
care to people who are injured in traffic accidents, a medical
official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government made this decision in a bid to rescue more people
injured in car crash because road accidents are frequent across
Egypt, Hashem Allam, director of the Emergency Medical Care
Department of the Health Ministry, was quoted as saying by the
country's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A total of 387 stations will be set up every 30 to 50 kilometers
along the highways, Allam said, adding that they will be equipped
with ambulances and skilled medical workers, who will stand by
round the clock.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention the number of the existing stations and when
the new stations will be constructed.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has worked out comprehensive and integrated
measures for saving the lives of citizens on highways, he said,
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt as vehicles are often
driven at high speed and rules are neglected. On Monday and
Tuesday, two serious accidents left a total of 31 people dead and
40 others injured when overcrowded mini-buses crashed head-on into
other vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Ready to Negotiate Cyprus Issue Seriously: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
said Wednesday that the Greek Cypriot side would be attending talks
on the Cyprus issue and is ready to negotiate seriously, "with
courage and flexibility," depending on the stand of the Turkish
Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
In a message issued on the occasion of the 26th anniversary of
the 1974 coup in which Turkey invaded and seized the northern third
of the Cyprus island, Clerides expressed hope that the
international community would succeed this time in persuading
Ankara to display the political will required to resolve the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities since the failed 1974 coup launched by
supporters for union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of United Nations-sponsored indirect talks on Cyprus
issue have been held since December 1999, aimed at preparing the
ground for substantive negotiations leading to a comprehensive
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks started on July 5 in Geneva, but
adjourned in July 12. It will resume on July 24.
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed that it is Greek Cypriots' "fervent desire" to
see a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus issue achieved as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots must find a
good solution which will heal the wounds of the past, overcome the
suspicion and sense of insecurity felt by both communities, dispel
their fears and concerns and consolidate a climate of confidence,
mutual understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We must create, all together, new prospects for peace,
stability and security on the basis of the U.N. resolutions and
international law and legality so as to be able to enjoy the
benefits of harmonious coexistence and cooperation within the
European Union," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides reaffirmed that until a solution is found, the Cyprus
government will continue its policy of strengthening the defense
within the framework of the joint defense pact between Cyprus and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Greek Cypriot-dominated Cypriot government signed
a joint defense pact in November 1993, under which Greece will
provide Cyprus with air, sea and land cover in case of a fresh
Turkish offensive against Cyprus.

MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor Yushchenko, agreed
here Wednesday to speed up the settlement of the mutual debts of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Yushchenko, Kasyanov told reporters that
Moscow will honor its pledge to quickly address its debts to
Ukraine over the Black Sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries will establish a joint fuel and
energy system, including use and payment, and on this basis seek
an overall settlement of Ukraine's natural gas debts to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov also said that Russia would consider constructing its
western Europe-bound natural gas pipelines through Ukraine if the
problem of Ukraine's unauthorized skimming of Russian gas is
settled.
</P>
<P>
Russia will also help finish the construction of the Ronvno and
Khmelnitsky nuclear power plants in Ukraine, Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Black Sea fleet's arrears in infrastructure
payments to Ukraine and Kiev's gas debt of 1.9 billion U.S.dollars
to Russia have long hampered their bilateral ties and economic and
trade cooperation.

<HEADLINE> New Technique Helps Retrieve Data From Damaged Magnetic Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers have developed
a new technique for recovering analog and digital data from
mangled tapes or other storage media, according to July's TechBeat.
</P>
<P>
Termed second harmonic magneto-resistive microscopy, the
technique uses high-resolution magnetic sensors developed for
modern computer hard disk drives. These sensors map the
microscopic magnetic fields across the samples, allowing
investigators to rebuild the original signal and gain insight into
the recording process and history.
</P>
<P>
For forensic experts, this can provide critical information
regarding the authenticity of evidence, said TechBeat, a
newsletter published by U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST).
</P>
<P>
Audio cassettes, video tapes, credit cards and computer disks
all store valuable information using very small magnetic tracks.
Sometimes these instruments are accidentally damaged or
intentionally modified. When this happens, recovery of the stored
data or verification of authenticity becomes extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
The researchers demonstrated the technique by recovering audio
data from a tape fragment provided by the National Transportation
Safety Board. They also showed that raw digital data can be read
from a very short segment of tape from a flight data recorder,
tape that's unreadable in a conventional tape deck.
</P>
<P>
For the FBI, the researchers used the technique to reveal
magnetic marks produced by the erase and record heads during the
recording process. They also showed that the audio data from test
tracks can be reconstructed and played back directly from the
second harmonic magneto-resistive microscopy images.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are David Pappas at NIST, and Steve Voran at
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.

<HEADLINE> Multichannel Companies to Dominate U.S. B2C Web Sales, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A new study released Wednesday
said that multichannel retailers will dominate business-to-
consumer (B2C) sales over the Internet in the United States in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. B2C sales over the Web will grow from an estimated 25
billion U.S. dollars in 1999 to 152 billion dollars in 2002 and
233 billion dollars in 2004, according to the study by Giga
Information Group, a U.S. e-business advisor.
</P>
<P>
As a share of total U.S. consumer spending, Giga estimates
Internet sales will grow from 0.4 percent in 1999 to 3 percent in
2004. By 2002, multichannel retailers will dominate B2C sales
after sharing the growth with dot-com merchants and mail-order
converts.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer use of the Internet for product research will grow,
but the majority of sales will still close in stores where
consumers can touch products and take them home immediately," Giga
said in a report. "This pattern plays to the advantage of click-
and-mortar companies that can operate in real-world, and Internet
sales channels."
</P>
<P>
According to Giga's research, more than half of 1999's U.S. B2C
sales were handled by dot-com merchants. Although many analysts
and investors remain wary of the ability of some dot-coms to
survive their excessive burn rates, Giga foresees room on the
permanent retail landscape for dot-coms, predicting them to
capture 39 billion dollars in revenues in 2002 and 49 billion
dollars in 2004.
</P>
<P>
But the real B2C opportunity lies with multichannel retailing,
according to Giga. Companies with a real-world presence that build
Internet sales channels constituted 33 percent of B2C sales in
1999. Travel companies, brokerages and computer companies
dominated click-and-mortar sales. However, other click-and-mortar
companies like many chain stores showed evidence of real-world
retailers starting to compete effectively in this channel.
</P>
<P>
Giga expects these multichannel companies will dominate B2C
Internet sales by 2002, growing their share of Internet spending
to two-thirds of the market by 2002 from one-third in 1999.

BRUSSELS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) adopted a
proposal Wednesday on the opening of negotiations for a
Stabilizaton and Association Agreement with the Republic of
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, EU's executive body, said its decision

The new agreement with Croatia will be the second under the EU
Stabilization and Association Process, launched last year with the
aim of strengthening political and economic stability in the
Balkan region. Such an agreement is already under negotiation with
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Commission said in

<HEADLINE> Romania Delegation Calls for Lifting U.N. Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A Romanian delegation currently
visiting Iraq has sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan calling for lifting the U.N. embargo on Iraq,
the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter stressed that the decade-old U.N. embargo on Iraq
must be ended because it violates the U.N. Charter as well as
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
If the embargo is to continue, it will kill more Iraqis because
of the acute shortage of food and medicine, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that as many as 1.3 million people, mostly children
and the elderly, have died as a direct result of the stringent
embargo imposed in 1990 following Iraq's invasion of neighboring
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. and Britain of putting on
hold contracts it signed with foreign countries to import food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies within the framework of
the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian program, which allows Iraq to export oil
in return for humanitarian goods, is an exemption to the sweeping
and crippling U.N. sanctions still in force.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian delegation came here to attend the 32nd anniversary
of the Iraqi July revolution, through which the Arab Baath
Socialist Party came to power in 1968 and has ruled Iraq since
then.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Returns Home After Syria Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
returned home Wednesday afternoon after a brief visit to Syria for
cementing ties, according to Jordan's official news agency Petra.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who arrived in Syrian capital Damascus early in the
day, held talks with the newly-inaugurated Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad. They later presided over a meeting attended by senior
officials from both sides, said the report.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed ways to promote
bilateral cooperation and the two leaders pledged to continue
coordination and consultation and intensify top-level meetings.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to hold the Joint Jordan-Syria Higher Committee
session soon to look into all bilateral issues such as trade
exchange, water, transport, and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed regional situation and the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, stressing their
support for all efforts towards a just and durable peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, King Abdullah reiterated Jordan's support for
Syria's demand for the return of the Golan Heights, seized by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stressed the need to revitalize the inter-Arab
unity for the interests and prospects of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Syrian ties cooled down after Amman signed a peace
treaty with Israel in l994. However, their bilateral relationship
gradually improved since Abdullah came to the throne in February
last year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries established a joint Free Trade and Industrial
Zone early this year. Syria has set free three Jordanian political
prisoners after they completed their jail terms as a goodwill
gesture.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said in Amman earlier this month that there were
brotherly and good-neighborly ties linking Jordan and Syria,
stressing that he noticed Bashar's keenness to develop ties with
Jordan and other Arab countries during their several previous
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Bashar was sworn in as Syrian president on July 17 after winning
overwhelming support in a sole-candidate national referendum,
succeeding his father, late President Hafez al-Assad, who died on
June 10 at age 69 after ruling Syria for three decades.

<HEADLINE> Fist Fight Breaks out Aboard Turkish Airlines Flight to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A fist fight broke out aboard a
Turkish Airlines flight to Cairo on Wednesday when a German
passenger tried to stop a Turkish passenger from making a mobile
telephone call, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
A number of passengers asked the Turk, Abideen Farul, not to
make the call after the cabin crew announced that using cell phones
could affect the navigation of the plane, which was preparing to
descend into Cairo International Airport, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency quoted the officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Farul ignored them, and then came to blows with a German
passenger of Egyptian origin, Ahmed Hashem, who tried to force him
to end the call.
</P>
<P>
Police at Cairo airport booked and warned the two passengers who
were bruised after the skirmish.
</P>
<P>
It was the third incident aboard planes using Cairo airport in
less than a week.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians engaged in a drunken brawl on an Air Ukraine
flight from Kiev to Cairo on Sunday, forcing fellow passengers to
try to stop them and the pilot to radio authorities on the ground,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
And on Friday a Saudi passenger who refused to wear his safety
belt was taken off a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight at the Cairo
airport after delaying take-off for an hour, they added.

<HEADLINE> Arab Anti-Drug Abuse Conference Opens in Tunis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab officials in charge of combating
drugs met here Wednesday to discuss ways of fighting drug
production, trafficking and distribution in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The 14th session of the Arab anti-drug department heads,
inaugurated by Ahmed Bin Mohammad Salim, Secretary General of Arab
Interior Ministers Council, also explored means of stepping up Arab
cooperation on drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The Arab officials discussed a proposal on controlling money
laundering in the Arab countries to deprive drug traffickers of
their over 500 billion U.S dollars annual profits.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, suggested by the council's general secretariat,
hopes to help Arab countries enact relevant regulations to this
effect.
</P>
<P>
A study submitted to the conference showed that anti-drug abuse
departments in some Arab countries seized 500 tons of hashish, 300
kilograms of opium, 25 million drug pills while 230,000 were
convicted in 150,000 drug-related cases during the 1997-1999
period.
</P>
<P>
The conference will work out a report for discussion at the
next session of the Arab Interior Ministers.
</P>
<P>
In l999, the Arab Interior Ministers Council approved an Arab
anti-terrorism Treaty signed by 12 countries, namely Saudi Arabia,
Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Egypt,
Jordan, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen.

ATHENS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek scientists recently found the
remains of a huge ancestor to the modern-day elephant in a field
in the northern part of the country.
</P>

the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted the scientists

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The White House on Wednesday
said the negotiations at Camp David continued, denying earlier
reports that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was planning to
quit the three-way Middle East peace summit.
</P>
<P>
"The White House has not been informed of anyone planning to
leave," spokesman Joe Lochkart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We checked with the spokesman for Prime Minister Barak, who
assured us there was neither a written nor an oral official
statement issued from Jerusalem this morning," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Bill Clinton, who delayed his departure
for a summit of industrialized nations in Japan by one day, opened
the ninth day of talks at Camp David by meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to leave sometime Thursday for Japan, with
or without a deal between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said earlier Wednesday that Barak was planning
to walk out of the Camp David talks and return home because Arafat
had not been willing to compromise on the key issues.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States will offer
one billion U.S. dollars a year in loans to sub-Saharan African
countries to help them buy U.S.-made drugs to fight AIDS, the U.S.
Export-Import Bank announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to announce today a pilot program to finance
one billion dollars per year in exports of the most modern and
successful HIV- and AIDS-related pharmaceuticals and supplies to
sub-Saharan Africa -- at the lowest prices and on the friendliest
terms possible under the authority of this bank," James Harmon,
chairman of U.S. Export-Import Bank, said.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after five major U.S. drug companies agreed in
May to cut the prices they charge African nations for drugs to
combat AIDS and HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
But anti-AIDS drugs are costly even at discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
At a conference held in South Africa this month, U.N. officials
said an estimated three billion dollars are needed each year for
awareness drive, prevention and treatment of AIDS in African
countries.

LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- British police confirmed on
Wednesday that a suspect device exploded by a railway track in
west London was bomb.
</P>
<P>
Police conducted a controlled explosion on the device in the
suburb of Ealing near a main railway line into the city center as
thousands faced travel chaos.
</P>
<P>
The bomb alert triggered a series of security scares that
brought transport chaos to the capital hours before celebrations
in central London of the Queen Mother's 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
The controlled explosion followed tip-offs from the Irish
capital Dublin early on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson blamed the
attack on renegade Irish Republican guerrillas opposed to Northern
Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Dissident Irish republican guerrillas were blamed by security
sources when a bomb damaged a bridge over the River Thames in west
London in June, causing no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating further security alerts at the
central London underground rail stations of Victoria and
Westminster, near the houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Both stations were evacuated and cordoned off.
</P>
<P>
London Underground said it had suspended services on parts of
several lines in central London at the request of police.

</P>
<P>
Annan, who just returned from his trip to Europe and Africa,
told the press that the Mideast summit was at a very critical
stage as U.S. President Bill Clinton would be leaving for Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"What I will say is to urge all parties to really focus on the
issues in the spirit of give and take and make the kind of
compromise that is necessary for them to get compromises so that
we can move on," the Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>

Annan said.

"I have been in touch with a senior member of the Palestinian
team. But I can't tell you what we discussed because of the
blackout," he said.

President Clinton has been shuttling between Israeli Prime

<HEADLINE> Swiss Federal Court Rejects Marcos Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's Federal Court has
turned down an appeal by the family of former Philippines ruler
Ferdinand Marcos to block the repatriation of disputed money in
Swiss accounts,according to a Swiss Radio International report
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the Marcos family cannot invoke the
statute of limitations to prevent disputed assets in Switzerland
from being sent back to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in response to an appeal by the brother-in-law
of the secretary of Marcos's wife, Imelda. He was seeking to
prevent the Zurich legal authorities from sending information to
the Philippines on an account he holds through a Panama-registered
company.
</P>
<P>
The account, which contains about 10 million Swiss francs (
about 6.6 million U.S. dollars), has been frozen since 1986, when
Marcos fled the Philippines to avoid being overthrown.
</P>
<P>
The court said that since Switzerland was merely offering
Manila legal assistance in the case, Philippine law and not Swiss
law was applicable. It noted that in a recent ruling, the
Philippine Supreme Court said the state's right to claim the
restitution of assets illegally acquired by state officials was
not subject to a statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 620 million francs (about 370 million U.S. dollars)
has so far been transferred to the Philippines, where it remains
blocked until the legal process against the Marcos family and its
allies has been concluded. There are another 35 million francs (
about 21 million dollars) being frozen in Swiss accounts.

WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit rose 1.8
percent in May to a record level of 31 billion U.S. dollars as
America's trade imbalance with oil-producing nations climbed to
its second-highest point ever, the Commerce Department reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total imports of goods and services fell 0.3 percent in May to
116.8 billion dollars from 117.1 billion dollars in April. But
exports fell more sharply by 1 percent to 85.7 billion dollars,
thus widening May's trade gap.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with oil-producing nations jumped by 17.8
percent in May to 4.1 billion dollars, second-highest on record.
Imports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
rose to 5.4 billion dollars in May, also the second-highest ever.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the trade deficit was
147.7 billion dollars, compared with 92.6 billion dollars during
the same period last year. For all of last year, the deficit
soared to a record 265 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the strength of the U.S. dollar against other key
currencies, which tends to make U.S. goods more expensive abroad,
was a key reason for the continued record level of the U.S. trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
As expected, trade gaps with major U.S. trading partners
increased in May, as American consumers continued to draw in
imports even after a string of interest-rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit with Japan narrowed by 5.4 percent in May to
6.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with the United States' North American Free Trade
Agreement partners Canada and Mexico rose to a record 6.41 billion
dollars in May.
</P>
<P>
Broken down, the gap with Canada increased to 3.96 billion
dollars from 3.70 billion dollars in April, while the deficit with
Mexico rose more sharply to 2.45 billion dollars in May from 1.45
billion dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Western Europe rose to 5.69 billion dollars in
May from 4.65 billion dollars in April. But the trade deficit with
Japan eased in May to 6.94 billion dollars from 7.33 billion
dollars in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> High Street Sales In UK Show Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua)-- Retail sales rose more than expected
in June, raising fears that UK economy was overheating.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Wednesday that
retail sales last month grew by 0.7 percent - stronger than many
economists was expecting.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, for the three months to the end of
June, the volume of sales is up 0.3 percent more than in the
previous three months and 4.3 percent than in the same period a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts in the City have been predicting sales growth
of just 0.1 percent on the month, compared to 0.5 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
They said that the data released by the ONS warns that the
slowdown seen earlier in the year might prove to be temporary or
at least not as marked as originally seemed to be the case.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urged by Lawmakers to Reshuffle Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 210 out of a total of 290
Iranian lawmakers on Wednesday urged President Mohammad Khatami to
take immediate action to reshuffle his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In their letter to the president, the lawmakers called on
Khatami's government to submit a bill to the parliament within a
month on the merger of several ministries doing similar jobs, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Since restructuring the government organization and merger of
several ministries are on your agenda, the parliament is expected
to receive the relevant bill to debate the matter," the letter was
read at an open session of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers believed the plan to merge at least three
ministries is necessary to improve government administration and is
the best way to solve the problems of the ministries working in the
field of energy and those working in the fields of agriculture,
livestock breeding, rural development, industries, mines and
metals, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Since the reformists' landslide victory in the February
parliamentary elections, Khatami has been urged to make big changes
in his cabinet, a coalition of reformists, centrists and leftists.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the reformist circle had predicted that Khatami would
change at least eight ministers and several vice presidents once
the new parliament dominated by reformists was formed on May 27.
The aim was to remove those who were not fully coordinated with the
reformists.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's current cabinet, formed in August 1997, consists of
reformists of the Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF),
centrists of the Party of Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI)
and leftists of the Assembly of Combatant Clergy (ACC).
</P>
<P>
However, relations between reformists and centrists soured
before the February elections as the IIPF strongly opposed the
participation of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani in the race
while the PCEI supported him to run for a seat in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Khatami last month appointed former Minister of Post, Telegraph
and Telephones Mohammad Reza Aref to head the newly formed State
Management and Planning Organization, a merger of the Planning and
Budget Organization and the Civil Administration and Recruitment
Organization.
</P>
<P>
This signalled the beginning of the scheduled reshuffle, which
was expected to also involve the first vice president, vice
president for executive affairs, ministers of defense, culture and
Islamic guidance, interior, education as well as economic and
financial affairs.

<HEADLINE> Legislation Proposed to Curb Money Laundering in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Central Bank Governor Riad
Salameh is proposing a legislation that would modify the country's
laws against money laundering to be in line with the world campaign
against dirty money, a local newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salameh said in a statement that the proposed legislation will
not entail relaxation of the banking secrecy law, long considered
the cornerstone of Lebanon's successful banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"We have to respond to the request of the international group
charged with fighting money laundering by modifying our laws and
devising a mechanism for removing banking secrecy in case any
suspect money is detected," Salameh told Al Mustaqbal newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he ruled out the possibility of a complete lifting of
banking secrecy due to the national consensus on maintaining it.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been accused of not cooperating with international
efforts to combat money laundering not because any money laundering
takes place in Lebanon, "but because of its laws" which need to be
upgraded without necessarily affecting the banking secrecy law.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank governor's remarks coincided with another
interview carried by An Nahar newspaper with Partick Mollet,
secretary general of the international group for combating money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
Mollet reportedly said that there was no intention to harm
Lebanon or undermine its banking secrecy law which he deemed "
legitimate." "All we are asking is to modify Lebanon's laws so that
they don't appear to conflict with the efforts to fight money
laundering," he added.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Lebanese law should be made flexible
enough to enable specialized international authorities to probe and
investigate suspect funds that move across borders. Other countries
confiscate dirty money, but Lebanon usually turns such money back
to where it came from.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Plane Prepares for Leaving Summit: Israel Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has ordered the ground crew of his plane to prepare for his
departure from the Camp David summit within hours, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The order showed that Barak may be serious about his threats to
leave Camp David, where he, United States President Bill Clinton
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have convened since July 11
for reaching an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Barak threatened early Wednesday to leave the Maryland
presidential retreat without an agreement in his hands. The report
was confirmed by Barak's One Israel coalition whip Ophir Pines-Paz.
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said later that the
Americans had no information about the imminent departure of Barak
from Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian sources described Barak's threat as a
negotiating ploy to force Clinton to increase pressure on Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has postponed his trip to Japan for a G-8 economic
summit for 24 hours to give Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
extra time to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also accused that the event was a signal that
Israel was not ready to do enough for reaching a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israel Radio quoted a "senior source" close to the
talks as saying that Barak had reached the conclusion that Arafat
is just not acting as "a true peace partner."
</P>
<P>
Now it appears that the summit might fail, the source said,
Israel had warned the Palestinians not to take unilateral actions,
such as declaring an independent state and deteriorating security
situations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned With Iran's Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Huseyin Dirioz, deputy spokesman of
Turkish Foreign Ministry, said on Wednesday that Ankara was
concerned about Iran's test of the Shahab-3 medium-range missile
four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's daily Milliyet reported that Iran successfully tested
its Shahab-3 missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers on July 15
and Turkish intelligence organization claimed that most of the
missiles with warheads carrying chemical weapons have targeted
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Dirioz said at a news briefing that because of its geography,
Turkey has been "sensitive" on the risk of proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction in its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is sensitive about Iran's second test of the Shahab-3
medium-range missile on July 15. We are closely monitoring the
developments," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Mohammad Hussein Lavasani, Iranian ambassador
to Turkey, said that Iran's Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic
missiles did not pose a threat against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The missiles were not against a third country," said Lavasani
following his one-hour meeting with Ugur Ziyal, deputy
undersecretary of Turkish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue of the missiles was not taken up at the
meeting, rejecting claims that the Shahab-3 missiles will pose
threats to neighboring countries, including Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Tehran and Ankara soured on several fronts. On
top of the long-standing accusations made by Turkey is Iran's
permission to Kurdish separatists who have since 1984 fighting for
an independent Kurdish state in southeast Turkey to operate from
bases inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit accused Tehran on May 17 of
wanting "to export" its Islamic revolution to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Turkish press launched a huge campaign
accusing Iran of being behind a series of assassinations of non-
religious Turkish intellectuals in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has vehemently denied the accusations while lodging
official protests at what it terms "huge" arrests of Iranians in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Iran is also highly critical of Ankara's military cooperation
with Israel, which Iran refused to recognize. Turkey has also sent
Iran a detailed dossier drawn up by its security forces on the
Turkish Hizbollah, a secretive fundamentalist organization
suspected of carrying out hundreds of assassinations in Turkey with
support from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Amid the tension, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer decided
not to attend a summit of the regional Economic Cooperation
Organization (ECO) held in Tehran early last month.
</P>
<P>
Iran, Turkey and Pakistan were founder members of the
organization back in 1985, with the aim of establishing a "Muslim
common market" with cooperation and regional discussion.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Iraq for MKO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday condemned Iraq for the recent attacks
on the country by the Iraq-based Iranian opposition group
Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO).
</P>
<P>
Iran holds the Iraqi government responsible for the terrorist
acts committed by the MKO in Iran, Asefi was quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He accused Baghdad of violating the principle of good-
neighborliness by backing the MKO in its terrorist moves and
sabotage activities in Iranian soil.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government must bear all the consequences of the MKO
terrorist acts in Iran, the spokesman warned.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, which fought a bloody war in the 1980s, have
recently accused each other of supporting terrorist acts in the
other country's capital. Both Tehran and Baghdad host opposition
groups of the other.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO has launched series of mortar attacks on
Iranian government and military targets during the past six months.
Following such MKO attacks, explosions and sabotage operations
would usually also be reported in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The MKO on Saturday night fired 12 mortar shells at a
residential area near the Iranian State Mint House. The group
claimed that the attack targeted the Iranian Intelligence Ministry
about one kilometer south of the hit area.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a major political and military group which had fought
against the Iranian shah regime before the 1979 Islamic revolution,
was outlawed in 1981 and fled to Iraq following sharp conflicts
with the Iranian cleric regime.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," the MKO has launched
series of cross-border attacks inside Iran in recent years,
including bombings and assassinations of senior Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Thai Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here Wednesday that China and Thailand have always
enjoyed sound cooperative relations in the international and
regional affairs and have jointly made positive contributions to
the regional peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai in the
morning, Hu said that the continued healthy and stable development
of Sino-Thai relations is based on the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, which helps bring about a good momentum of mutual
trust, mutual benefit and mutual assistance.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the sound development of bilateral ties to
the importance the two countries' leaders have long attached to
and the firm foundation of the Chinese-Thai friendship, saying
that the friendship between the two peoples are like relatives and
brothers.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts by the two governments and peoples,
Hu said, the relations between China and Thailand have grown
steadily with fruitful cooperation in all fields since the
establishment of diplomatic relations 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Thai relations are very close," said the Chinese Vice-
president.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, Hu said, the bilateral friendly
relations based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence are
displaying "ever-increasing vitality".
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a successful
visit to Thailand, Hu said, adding that in the same year the two
countries issued a joint statement on Sino-Thai cooperation for
the 21st century which mapped out the blueprint for the
development of bilateral and all-directional cooperation in the
new century.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Thai Queen Sirikit's visit to China this fall, Hu
said, it will be another event in the history of bilateral
relations which will facilitate the furtherance of the friendly
relations and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chuan welcomed Hu's visit to Thailand which
occurs when the two countries are celebrating the 25th anniversary
of the establishment of diplomatic relations, noting that the
visit will play an important role in promoting bilateral friendly
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Besides the brotherly relations between the Chinese and Thai
peoples, the Thai prime minister said, the two governments have
always been making joint efforts in strengthening and promoting
bilateral cooperation in the fields of politics, economy and
academics.
</P>
<P>
The constructive and significant achievements of bilateral
cooperation have already benefited the two peoples and contributed
to the regional peace, stability and security, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and
people for their careful preparation for Queen Sirikit's visit.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the Taiwan issue, Hu pointed out the Chinese
government never changed its basic policies of peaceful
reunification and "One Country, Two Systems".
</P>
<P>
Chuan reiterated that Thailand will firmly stick to the "One
China" principle and will never try to establish any official ties
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Chuan hosted a grand reception party for Hu'
s visit.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his meeting with Chuan, Hu met two former Thai prime
ministers, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, also head of opposition New
Aspiration Party, and Banharn Silpa-archa, also head of coalition
Chart Thai Party.
</P>
<P>
Both of the former premiers promised that their parties will
stick to "One China" policy and expressed support for an early
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the good-neighborliness and mutually
beneficiary cooperation between the two countries conform to the
common aspirations of the international community and future
development of the international situation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Vice-President arrived here Tuesday evening for a
five-day official visit to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces Policy on Internet Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 19 (Xinhua)-- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) Wednesday announced that internet banking will
operate within the same prudential framework as traditional
banking but banks should be responsible for assessing and managing
the risks associated with their operations in internet banking.
</P>
<P>
In a policy statement on its approach to the licensing,
regulation and supervision of internet banking in Singapore, MAS
said that internet banking, including internet-only banks (IOBs)
will operate within the same prudential framework as traditional
banking and MAS' admission criteria for new license applicants and
its regulatory and supervisory approach will apply across the
board.
</P>
<P>
The MAS announced that MAS' existing policy already allows all
banks licensed in Singapore to use the internet to provide their
services and MAS is prepared to grant new banking licenses to
Singapore-incorporated banking groups wishing to set up banking
subsidiaries to pursue new business models.
</P>
<P>
This will give a Singapore-incorporated bank the flexibility to
decide whether to engage in internet banking by way of a
subsidiary or by using a division within the bank, the MAS added.
</P>
<P>
Should a Singapore-incorporated bank choose to set up a
subsidiary in alliance with joint-venture partners, the MAS said,
the bank will be required as a must to maintain more than 50
percent of shareholding in the subsidiary bank and the chairman of
the subsidiary bank must be appointed by the Singapore-
incorporated parent.
</P>
<P>
The MAS also has decided to impose a minimum paid-up capital
requirement of 100 million Singapore dollars (about 58 million U.S.
dollars) on banking subsidiaries whose Singapore-incorporated
parent banks have already met 1.5 billion Singapore dollars (about
0.87 billion U.S. dollars) and all banking subsidiaries will
continue to be subject to MAS' current Capital Adequacy Ratio
requirement of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower minimum paid-up capital requirement will apply to all
Singapore-incorporated bank subsidiaries, MAS added.
</P>
<P>
MAS stated that its current framework for prudential regulation
and supervision provides flexibility for innovation in new
business models and technologies and there is no need for a new
prudential framework to manage or mitigate the risks involved in
internet banking.
</P>
<P>
However, the MASA emphasized that bank management must pay
special attention to the security, technology-related, liquidity
and operational risks which may be accentuated in internet banking.
</P>
<P>
Given the different models of internet banking that will be in
play, the MAS said, a risk-focused supervisory approach to
individual banks is more suitable than "one-size-fits-all"
regulation.

<HEADLINE> World Diamond Industry to Clamp Down on Conflict Diamond Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTWERP, Belgium, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The world diamond
industry on Wednesday announced their intent and measures to
combat trading in conflict diamonds that have been used to fund
wars in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 diamond miners, dealers, cutters, polishers and
government representatives from around the world decided after
three days of conference to introduce new strict measures to close
off all legal loopholes through which conflict diamonds have been
entering the international market.
</P>
<P>
One of the new measures will be a certification system to
monitor rough diamonds from the mines where they are found all the
way to international trading centers.
</P>
<P>
Any dealers found trading on conflict diamonds will face tough
penalty as losing qualification as diamond dealers.
</P>
<P>
The three-day World Diamond Conference, that ended on Wednesday,
formed an International Diamond Council from the existing
International Diamond Manufacturers Association and the World
Federation of Diamond Bourses.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed council will serve as a supervising body over
the international cooperation in the fight against conflict
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
An international outcry over the use of revenues from trade on
illegal diamonds to fund wars in Africa where lots of people have
been killed snatched the limelight at this year's conference, held
at the world's largest diamond trading center.
</P>
<P>
The biannual event happened to follow a United Nations embargo
over Sierra Leone diamonds in an attempt to cut off funding for
the African country's Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. embargo on the export of Sierra Leone diamonds has
raised a call for global measures to stop the smuggling of
diamonds from one African country to another in order to
circumvent national laws and international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report published in March on sanctions against illegal
Angolan diamonds used to fund the UNITA criticized some companies
in the diamond industry for allegedly allowing trade on what has
been described as conflict diamonds to flourish.
</P>
<P>
But observers believed that it would not be easy in that the
complicated chain system of dealers will only make diamond trade
difficult to track and therefore difficult to halt trade of
conflict diamonds.
</P>
<P>
Apart from diamond-producing countries in Africa, Russia and
Canada were also present while such diamond-cutting centers as
India, Belgium, Thailand, Israel and the United States also
attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
The global diamond business each year produces 6.8 billion U.S.
dollars from trade on rough diamonds which in turn generate a
retail diamond jewelry sales of around 56 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Barak Threatens to Quit Talks: Israeli Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is preparing to walk out of the Middle East peace summit in
Camp David without a deal with the Palestinians, a senior Israeli
source said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Barak is preparing to return home at the soonest moment after
it became clear to him that the Palestinians are not a true
partner for peace," the source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel was warning the Palestinians "not to take
unilateral steps or inflame violence in the region."
</P>
<P>
But Barak's official spokesman Gadi Baltiansky refused to
comment on the report. "I cannot comment on this report," he said.
</P>
<P>
Angered by a U.S. proposal reportedly adopting Israeli
positions, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also threatened to
leave Camp David on July 13 but was later pacified by President
Bill Clinton who promised to present a new version of proposal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Barak and Arafat have met in the Camp David
presidential retreat in Maryland since July 11 in a bid to work
out a framework agreement for a final settlement of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced early Wednesday that he would delay by one
day his planned departure for Japan to attend a summit of the
industrialized nations to give a last chance for Barak and Arafat
to strike a deal.

<HEADLINE> Russian Influential Tycoon Quits Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma Wednesday
passed a resolution accepting the resignation of Boris Berezovsky,
an influential business tycoon, from the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed by a vote of 346-5 with two
abstentions, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky announced his intention to give up his seat in the
parliament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Speaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky said that Berezovsky should
be thanked as this was "the first time in the history of the
Russian parliament that a deputy has courageously given up his
powers after understanding that he cannot fulfill his obligations.
"
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky said he decided to cede parliamentary immunity so as
to be in the same position as the other oligarchs, whom he said
were facing a state-run campaign against the business community.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to a series of high-profile probes
into alleged embezzlement and fraud by businessmen such as media
magnet Vladimir Gusinsky, whose property was announced seized on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was "no accident, not the initiative of some over-
zealous bureaucrat; it is aimed at essentially destroying large
independent businesses," Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying at a
press conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Berezovsky said he planned to build a "
constructive opposition to the authorities."
</P>
<P>
"I have enough strength to curb the authorities," he told
reporters shortly after he officially announced his resignation as
a deputy at the State Duma session.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky became a deputy after winning last December's
parliamentary elections in Karachayevo-Cherkessia, a tiny region
in southwestern Russia.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sees Higher Grain Harvest in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia will produce at least 65
million tons of grain this year, higher than a harvest of 54.7
million tons last year, Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture
Minister Aleksei Gordeyev said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This year is going well for Russia's agricultural sector, and
a harvest of 65 million tons of grain will make it possible to
meet most of the country's food grain needs," the Interfax news
agency quoted Gordeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there "will be a small deficit of feed grain,
largely of those crops (maize and soybeans) that Russia has
historically never produced in sufficient quantities."

<HEADLINE> Bodysuits Ban Lifted for U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Bowing to pressure from
swimsuit manufacturers, USA Swimming decided Tuesday night to
allow full-length bodysuits at the Olympic trials next month,
likely clearing the way for a major assault on the record book in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
The American governing body had voted less than a month ago to
ban the high-tech attire because of concerns there wouldn't be
enough suits to go around. But, facing a grievance from one
manufacturer and hearing assurances that all of the 1,300
competitors would have a chance to wear the suits, the board of
USA Swimming changed its mind during a conference call.
</P>
<P>
"This was not an easy decision and there are merits to both
sides of the issue," said Chuck Wielgus, executive director of USA
Swimming. "But with the U.S. Olympic team trials being just three
weeks away, it was important to get this issue resolved."
</P>
<P>
That means any full-length suit approved by FINA, the world
governing organization, will be allowed at the trials in
Indianapolis on August 9-16.
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary suits, some of which cover the entire body
except for head, hands and feet, already were cleared for use at
the Sydney Olympics and all other meets.
</P>
<P>
The bodysuit is viewed as the most significant advance in
competitive swimwear since the 1970s, leading to an outbreak of
record-breaking performances this year. Studies have shown it
improves performance by up to 3 percent, a significant amount in a
sport where races are decided by thousandths of a second.

<HEADLINE> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Arrested for Investigation of Marijuana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Former NBA legend Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar was arrested Tuesday night for investigation of driving
under the influence of marijuana in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The former Los Angeles Lakers and UCLA star was taken into
custody about 7 p.m. after a police officer who pulled him over
for speeding smelled marijuana fumes coming from the open window
of his car, said Officer Eduardo Funes, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar failed a field sobriety test administered near the
San Fernando Valley intersection where he was stopped, Funes said.
He was taken to a local jail, where he was booked on the
misdemeanor charge and released on his own recognizance.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Abdul-Jabbar was very respectful of the officers who
arrested him, and very cooperative," Funes said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, 53, is the NBA's career scoring leader with 38,
387 points in the regular season and 44,149 total, including the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
In a career spanning 20 seasons, Abdul-Jabbar played in 19 All-
Star games and won six MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
He played on six NBA championship teams, including one with the
Milwaukee Bucks and the last five with the Los Angeles Lakers when
he teamed with guard Magic Johnson during the Lakers' Showtime era
of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
He was an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Clippers this
past season.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday marked the second time in two years Abdul-Jabbar has
run into trouble with the law over marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Dekker Wins 17th Stage, Armstrong Helds on Overall Leads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GENEVA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Dutchman Erik Dekker won the 17th
stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday but Lance Armstrong still
stayed on the overall lead.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal captain's position was never threatened
throughout the 155-kilometer race, as he remained within the pack
with his closest challengers. Jan Ullrich of Germany's Deutsche
Telekom remained in second place, still 5 minutes, 37 seconds
behind Armstrong, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Dekker of Rabobank edged out Erik Zabel of Telekom and little-
known Fred Rodriguez, an American riding for the Italian Mapei
team, to take his third stage win of this year's Tour.
</P>
<P>
The riders went from the French southern shore of Lake Geneva
into the nearby foothills of the Alps before a frantic race
downhill to Lausanne, the Swiss home of the International Olympic
Committee on the lake's northern shore.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Armstrong and the race's eight other top
riders passed a surprise blood test taken in their hotel rooms. It
marked the latest step taken by International Cycling Union to
restore public confidence in the integrity of the competition
following a scandal-plagued Tour in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Massimiliano Lelli of Italy led the pack during Wednesday's
toughest challenge, a steep climb to the top of the 1,445-meter
Col de Mosses east of Lake Geneva. But a gaggle of pursuers
eventually swallowed up Lelli on the downhill side.
</P>
<P>
130 riders among the 180 who started the race July 1 remained
at Wednesday's finish. The lone American-sponspored team,U.S.
Postal, is the only one with all nine members still competing.

<HEADLINE> China Postal Bureau to Play Big Role in E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The State Postal Bureau (SPB)
today signed agreements with 14 companies, include Dell and Haier,
to provide e-commerce logistic services for them.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that this move indicates that the bureau has made
a decision to play a major role in the burgeoning e-commerce
business.
</P>
<P>
Liu Liqing, director of the SPB, told a seminar here today that
the logistics network of the bureau is the country's biggest and
best. He promised that his company will make every effort to play
an active role in e-commerce development.
</P>
<P>
The SPB has 236 large delivery centers across the country,
linking more than 2,300 cities and counties. Besides, its mailing
trunk line links all the cities in the country, and is connected
with more than 200 countries.
</P>
<P>
To provide better services, the company has invested to expand
its mailing network this year, enabling the network to deliver
parcels directly to customers.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan, the company will be able to deliver
parcels to all administrative units down to the county level from
October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that the bureau also has its own information dealing
platform. It has opened an e-commerce website "183" and a customer
service center "185" to provide Internet and phone-in service. The
postage deposit "Green Card" also provides on-line settlement
service, and is considered to be the solution to one of the
biggest bottlenecks in e-commerce.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.N. Oil-For-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi
Salah on Wednesday slammed the United Nations oil-for-food program
for failing to meet the objective of easing the living conditions
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's crude exports since 1996 under the oil-for-food program
have generated 29 billion U.S. dollars, while the value of goods
delivered to Iraq was only 7.5 billion dollars, Salah said.
</P>
<P>
Salah made the remarks when meeting the visiting Romanian
delegation which came to the Iraqi capital to attend the 32nd
anniversary of the Iraq's July revolution in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Salah said that since the oil-for-food was implemented in late
1996, the U.N. has granted 9 billion dollars of compensation to the
victims of the 1991 Gulf War, while Iraq only received 2 billion
dollars a year for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
This is in sharp comparison with the situation before the U.N.
sanctions were imposed on Iraq, when Iraq spent about 20 billion
dollars yearly to ensure the needs of the Iraqi people, Salah said.
</P>
<P>
The trade minister condemned the United States and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking the
contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to import food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods within the framework of the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly slammed the U.N. humanitarian deal for not
being able to meet Iraq's needs. The deal allows Iraq to export
crude every six months to finance imports of humanitarian goods to
help offset the crippling impacts of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed wide-ranging economic and trade sanctions on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which triggered the 1991
Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers of Iranian Jews Reject Court Ruling in Espionage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Defense lawyers of the Iranian Jews
convicted in an espionage case have raised protest against the
court ruling, spokesman of the lawyers Esmaeel Naseri Mojarad
announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mojarad said he has submitted a 95-page petition to the Islamic
Revolutionary Court of Shiraz, capital of southern Fars Province,
in protest against the ruling of the court on July 1, announcing
two to 13 years prison terms on 10 Jews and two Muslims, while
acquitting the other three Jews and two Muslims accused.
</P>
<P>
He said the lawyers of the Jews had cited legal and judicial
reasons to reject the court ruling, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The verdict found the convicted guilty of being members of a
spying network formed by Eshaq Belanas, an Iranian Jew who was said
to have fled the country in 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, the verdict has acquitted the accused of spying charges
of collection and transfer of classified information, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the accused were convicted of membership in a
spying network, their sentences should be between 3 months and 5
years in prison according to article 499 of the Islamic penal code.
</P>
<P>
The Jews and the Muslims were arrested more than one year ago in
Shiraz. The arrest and trial of the Iranian Jews sparked protests
from Israel, which denied any links with the accused, and Western
countries, who demanded Iran of their release.
</P>
<P>
Iran insists that the case has nothing to do with religious
beliefs and no foreign country should interfere in its domestic
affairs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 38 Pct of Pakistanis Have No Access to Contraception Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 38 percent of Pakistanis
have no access to contraception facilities despite the government'
s efforts to curb the alarming growth of population, said the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoting officials of the
Population Welfare Department.
</P>
<P>
The lack of facilities will probably hinder the steps of the
current government which is hoping to pull down the annual
population growth rate to 2.1 percent by 2003 from the current 2.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Though with one of the oldest population program of Asia,
Pakistan still lags behind in controlling the growth rate as
compared to Iran's 1.6 percent, Bangladesh's 1.5 percent and India
's 1.4 percent, according to APP.
</P>
<P>
The latest census shows Pakistan now ranks the seventh in the
world with a population of 137.5 million.
</P>
<P>
One major problem in the population program is the
superstitions of the illiterate women who are a majority in
Pakistan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials hoped that by 2003 facilities will be available
for all the people and the contraceptive prevalence rate, which is
mere 30 percent currently, will substantially be enhanced.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of former Afghan
king Zahir Shah Wednesday discussed with U.N. Secretary General
Personal Representative to Afghanistan Francese Vendrell on the "
Loya Jirga" (Grand Assembly) proposal aimed at a peaceful solution
of Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We exchanged views with Mr. Vendrell on the Loya Jirga
approach," Hedayat Amin Arsala, former Afghan foreign minister who
is leading the delegation, said after the meeting here, giving no
more details.
</P>
<P>
Vendrell in a last month interview had hinted U.N. support for
the former Afghan king's proposal to convene the Loya Jirga, a
traditional Afghan institute. "I think Loya Jirga can serve to
activate political issues in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, he said, encouraged any initiative by
civilian Afghans, particularly by the former king who enjoys
support in many sections of Afghanistan, to become involved and
convene a Loya Jirga.
</P>
<P>
The Zahir Shah team, which arrived here on Monday, met Pakistan
Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar Tuesday and will proceed to
Afghanistan for talks with both the ruling Taliban militia and the
opposition alliance on the Loya Jirga proposal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Thai King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China and Thailand have already
established an all-round partnership of good-neighborliness and
mutual trust which can be seen as an example of good-neighborly
friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries
with different social systems, Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej at a summer
palace in the resort city Hua Hin, some 170 kilometers south of
Bangkok, Hu agreed with the king's view that the Chinese-Thai
relations are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the traditional friendship between the two peoples can
be traced back to thousands of years ago, adding that the two
peoples are not only friends but also relatives and brothers.
</P>
<P>
"We respect each other, trust each other and cooperate with
each other closely, which is very valuable in the country-to-
country relations and should be treasured by the two governments
and the two peoples," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, he said, the bilateral relations
continue showing a momentum of vigorous development.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between China and Thailand has been deeply
rooted in the hearts of the two peoples, which is also the spring
of continuing development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that in the new century and new millennium the
traditional friendship between the two countries will be further
promoted and the two peoples will continue to be friends from
generation to generation," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He particularly "admired and appreciated" the support of the
king and the queen for developing Sino-Thai relations.
</P>
<P>
King Bhumibol welcomed Hu's visit to Thailand, saying that the
bilateral relations are "very good."
</P>
<P>
The two peoples share similar culture and tradition, and
understand and help each other in the long lasting friendship, the
king said, citing it as an advantage of the development of the
friendship.
</P>
<P>
He said the bilateral ties have been developing smoothly ever
since the establishment of diplomatic relations 25 years ago,
adding that there are no problems existing in the Thai-Chinese
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president arrived here Tuesday evening for a
five-day official visit to Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Cases of bubonic plague carried
by marmots have been found in several provinces in Mongolia, but
no people have been reported infected with this disease so far, an
official at the country's infectious disease research center said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Z. Adiacuren, deputy director of the Mongolian Natural
Infectious Diseases Studying Center, said that tests made by the
center showed that plague virus has been found in several
provinces and the outbreak possibility is very high in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said the regular outbreak of plague this year is
earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
The center is warning inhabitants close to the affected areas
not to hunt the animals.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent plague from breaking out and spreading,
vaccination has been organized nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Approves Final Draft on Upper House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's lower house of parliament
on Wednesday approved the finalized version of a draft law on
reorganizing the country's upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
The document was the revised edition of a motion tabled by
President Vladimir Putin on forming the Federation Council
following weeks of work by a conciliation commission composed of
members from the government and both chambers.
</P>
<P>
It cleared the Duma by a vote of 308-88 with five abstentions,
well above the 226 votes needed for approval, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, heads of the regional governments and
legislatures will no longer hold the two seats for each of the
regions, as is the case now. Instead, the seats will be held by
two representatives, one from the regional legislature and the
other from the government.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the regional parliaments will be elected for
the term the parliament is working. In territories with bicameral
parliaments, two representatives will be elected alternately from
each house for half the term.
</P>
<P>
Candidates to the Federation Council are to be proposed by
parliament chairman. Alternative candidacies may be proposed by a
group of at least one-third of the deputies.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the regional governments are to be appointed
by heads of the local executive authorities -- the governor in the
regions and the president in the constituent republics.
</P>
<P>
In another legislative development Wednesday, the Duma overrode
the Federation Council's veto on amendments to the federal law on
the general principles of legislative and executive government
bodies.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved in the initial reading with 362 votes in
favor, 35 against and eight abstentions. The required majority was
300 votes.
</P>
<P>
The amendments give the president the right to temporarily
remove and dismiss heads of territorial executive bodies for
breaking the law and on the grounds of court decisions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a court ruling, the president's move requires a
note from the Prosecutor General confirming that criminal charges
have been brought against a governor.
</P>
<P>
The amendments also provide for the dissolution of territorial
parliaments if they violate federal law. To this end, the
president will have to submit a corresponding bill to the Duma.
</P>
<P>
The amendments initiated by President Vladimir Putin will now
be submitted for his approval, bypassing the Federation Council,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Travel Banned in Canada's Park Where Anthrax Kills 22 Bison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A travel ban has been imposed in a
northwestern Canadian national park after 22 bison were recently
found dead in an outbreak of anthrax, a disease caused by a
bacillus that could also be transmitted to man.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Northwest Territories region confirmed
Wednesday they are taking precautions against a possible spread of
the disease after bison carcasses were discovered in Wood Buffalo
National Park, which straddles the northern part of Alberta
province and the southern part of the Northwest Territories.
</P>
<P>
A bison ecologist is monitoring the situation while the ban is
put into place in the northern Alberta part of the national park,
which is about 180 kilometers southwest of Fort Smith in the
Northwest Territories.
</P>
<P>
Ray Case, spokesman for the territories department of resources,
stressed the travel ban as a precaution to ensure that people don'
t come into contact with the diseased carcasses.
</P>
<P>
"In the past when Wood Buffalo National Park has had an
outbreak, we haven't seen any transfer of it to other populations,
" said the spokesman, adding there has been no sign of the deadly
disease spreading so far.
</P>
<P>
No humans have been infected by anthrax in Alberta since 1948,
although a number of cattle died from the disease as lately as
last year in the western province, officials say.
</P>
<P>
They believe the cattle deaths were resulted from spores left
behind decades ago when bison roamed the southern half of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax is an infectious disease of wild or domesticated
animals, such as cattle and sheep, which is characterized by black
pustules.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian authorities have seized the
property of Vladimir Gusinsky, a media magnet under investigation
for alleged financial fraud, the Interfax news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gusinsky heads Media-Most Holding, which controls media outlets
ranging from newspapers to radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
He was detained briefly last month on accusation of committing
"large-scale misappropriation by a group of persons through deceit,
abuse of trust and abuse of power."
</P>
<P>
The Prosecutor's Office said that investigators believe that
Gusinsky, along with some leaders of the federal government firm
Russkoye Video, "extracted property worth up to 10 million U.S.
dollars from government ownership."
</P>
<P>
Gusinsky was later released, but banned from leaving Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Valery Nikolayev, a senior prosecutor with the Russian
Prosecutor General's Office, said Wednesday that investigators
intend to freeze all of Gusinsky's assets, both at home and abroad,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
A plot of land and a house owned by Gusinsky in Moscow region's
Sakharovsky district have been seized, said his lawyer Pavel
Astakhov.

<HEADLINE> Russian Parliament Ratifies Friendship Treaty With DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on Wednesday
overwhelmingly ratified the Treaty of Friendship, Neighborliness
and Cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The treaty cleared the lower house of parliament by a vote of
363-8 with one abstention. The required majority was 266 votes.
</P>
<P>
The ratification coincided with the visit to DPRK by Russian
President Vladimir Putin, who arrived in Pyongyang earlier
Wednesday on the first trip by a Russian head of state to the
north Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov, who presented the
document before the lawmakers, said the treaty allows the two
countries "to jointly fight for peace and disarmament, which will
bring our partner out of international isolation to a significant
extent," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The treaty opens up great opportunities for cooperation,
including with South Korea, and the possibility to influence the
unification processes on the Korean peninsula, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The new friendship treaty, which was reached after talks that
lasted for three years, replaces the 1961 treaty between the
Soviet Union and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Chairman of the State Duma Committee for
International Affairs Dmitry Rogozin, Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said the old treaty "is obsolete and does not reflect
the new situation."
</P>
<P>
The parliament of the DPRK ratified the new treaty on April 6,
2000 "without any reservations," Ivanov said.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien promised a financial aid package to tornado victims
Tuesday during a visit tot the stricken campground in Pine Lake,
central Alberta.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who is scheduled to leave for this year's G-
8 summit in Japan Wednesday, said the federal government would
work with the province on a cost-sharing aid formula.
</P>
<P>
"Once the damage has been assessed, officials from both
governments will get together and decide how to share the costs,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Although he did not give details of financial assistance, he
made clear that the first damage is paid locally, and after that,
when it is very big, the federal government "sometimes pays up to
90 percent."
</P>
<P>
The Friday night twister is estimated to have caused direct
losses of 13 million Canadian dollars (about 8.8 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In another development of the day, incident commander Dave
Harvey of the Red Deer Fire Department announced the official end
of the search for bodies in Pine Lake.
</P>

hospital after tornado touched down at about 07:30 p.m. (0030 GMT)
at the speed of 300 kilometers an hour, cutting through the Green
Acre campground until it tapered off across the lake more than 20
kilometers away.

SOFIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria expects to bring home about
the same medals as they did from Atlanta in 1996 with 95 athletes
to be competing in the Sydney Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Shtarbanov, sports director of the Bulgarian Olympics
Committee, said on Wednesday that they expected about 14 medals
from the Games, mainly from weightlifting, athletics, boxing,

<HEADLINE> Former Salt Lake Bid Leader Expected to Go to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- As plea-bargain talks broke
down, former Salt Lake bid leader Tom Welch was expected to be
charged soon, said his attorney William Taylor on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, "it's going to end with a jury standing up and saying
'not guilty'", added the attorney.
</P>
<P>
Late last week, government prosecutors were ready to file
charges but held off to allow discussions over a possible plea
bargain. Yet, a criminal trial in the case would not take place
until next year, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
For the past 17 months, Welch and David Johnson, his former
assistant, have been cast by federal investigators as the
engineers of an alleged 1.2 million U.S. dollars gift-giving
campaign aimed at winning the votes of influential members of the
International Olympic Committee who awarded Salt Lake the 2002
Winter Games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Although Olympic organizers prefer to avoid a trial, Taylor
said that "basic differences between the Justice Department's
position and our side could not be bridged."
</P>
<P>
Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (
SLOC), said that SLOC always hope that the matter be resolved "in

<HEADLINE> Second Yangtze Flood Peak Approaches Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The second flood peak on the
Yangtze, China's longest river, is passing through the river's
most dangerous section in southwestern Hubei Province and is
approaching Wuhan, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Yangtze River Flood Control Headquarters
said when the second flood crest passed Shashi City, site of an
important hydrological station on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze, at 23:00 hours yesterday, the water level in the main
stream of the river was recorded at 43.12 m, and the water flow
was 43,300 cu m per second. By this morning, the water level fell
slightly back to 43.08 m, but still 0.08 meters above the danger
line.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Yangtze monitored at Jianli rose to 35.
54 meters this morning, exceeding the danger line of 35 m. The
flood peak will pass through Jianli tonight, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The temporary shiplock on the famed Three Gorges Dam Project
has remained closed to navigation since July 17, when the second
flood peak passed the Three Gorges area, driving up the water
level in the Yangtze to an alarming height and making navigation
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the second flood peak is expected to
reach Wuhan on July 23. By then, the water level there will rise
to 25.25 m.

WUHAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China's first environment industrial
park engaged in desulfuration went into operation today in this
capital of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Six companies and institutes became the first to set up
businesses in the park, which will concentrate its research
strength on developing desulfuration technology and equipment, and
turning them into products.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan has chosen environmental protection as a pillar industry.
Li Tao, deputy mayor of the city, said that the municipal
government will grant preferential policies, such as tax reduction,
to companies engaged in environment protection, and encourage them
to merge into large conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest coal consumer, with over 1,000
thermal power plants discharging 23 million tons of sulfur dioxide
every year. With the country's stepped-up efforts to treat
pollution, the desulfuration industry is expected to have a big
market.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cyber Trends Bring New Look to HK Book Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The rapid advance of e-commerce
in the publishing industry has breathed new life into the Hong
Kong Book Fair 2000, which opened here Wednesday to give
publishing professionals, book collectors and readers alike a rare
chance to access new publications and grasp the latest trends in
the publishing world.
</P>
<P>
"Development in information technology and the widespread of
the Internet have breathed new life into the publishing industry,"
said Secretary for the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Denise Yue while speaking at the opening of
the five-day fair.
</P>
<P>
"Education portals, cyber bookshops and e-publishing are
flourishing, offering a platform for the exchange of business
ideas," said Yue. The book fair helps boost these new trends in
the publishing industry, she said.
</P>
<P>
To common book collectors and readers alike, the fair,
organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC),
offered a wide range of books, almost suitable to every hobby or
commercial requirements, from finance, fashion to cookery, travel,
education, medicine and autobiography.
</P>
<P>
For the publishing professionals, the fair was not merely a
business venture, but also an important vantage point to grasp the
latest trends in the publishing world, especial in the emerging e-
publication world.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the cyber trends in the publishing industry,
this year's Hong Kong Book Fair broke new ground with the launch
of a Cyber World section, which featured the increasing popular e-
publications, cyber bookstores, publishers and education portals.
</P>
<P>
A number of on-line publishers displayed at the Cyber World
section their latest publications, drawing many cyber-fans to have
a new experience of the e-book store and e-publications world.
</P>
<P>
An equally significant development concerns multi-media. "CD-
ROMs and the Web are no longer viewed with mistrust, on the
contrary, many publishers maintain that books and information
technology will draw ever closer," said Frederick Lam, deputy
executive director of the TDC.
</P>
<P>
Two days' special conferences and CEO forum were scheduled for
publishing professionals to explore relations between traditional
and on-line publications and the prospect of e-publications.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the Asian Publishing Conference is "The Second
Wave Development of E-commerce and Traditional Publishing,
focusing on current trends in traditional publishing and the
impact of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The CEO forum, entitled "Frontier of E-commerce in Chinese
Books Publishing," will include presentations by high-profile
senior executives involved in the on-line book store businesses in
the Chinese mainland, China's Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is one of the world' largest centers for Chinese
language publications, with about 3,000 book titles published each
year, placing it behind China's Taiwan with 20,000 new titles
yearly and the Chinese mainland with 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Book Fair 2000 showcased many new titles as well,
a positive sign that the regional publishing industry is
recovering, after the Asian financial crisis when the publishing
industry was hurt seriously.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1990, the Hong Kong Book Fair has been
established as one of the most important events of its kind in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
This year's book fair has drawn more than 370 companies from
the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Egypt, Singapore and the United
State, requiring a 30 percent increase in total exhibition area
over last year's fair.

<HEADLINE> HK's Online Stock Trading Rises Sharply: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has registered a two
to three fold increase in the number of online brokers, as well as
the number of clients accounts and online trading transaction in a
seven-month period ending April this year, according to the latest
survey published by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 844 registered stock dealers in Hong Kong, 28 are
providing online trading facilities, with a total of 37,382 online
trading accounts, compared to the only 10 online brokers and 8,876
accounts when the previous survey was carried out last September.
</P>
<P>
The survey also says that another 242 dealers indicated an
intention to launch online trading facilities within the next 12
months. Most online brokers are participants of the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Among the existing online brokers, 22 are providing online
trading facilities in Hong Kong listed securities, two in overseas,
predominantly the United States, listed securities, two in both
Hong Kong and overseas securities and two in futures contracts.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that Hong Kong's online trading is still
in its infancy with the turnover constituting 1.3 percent of the
total market volume for Hong Kong securities, while online brokers
representing less than 4 percent of the total number of registered
dealers.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Procter, executive director of the Intermediaries and
Investment Products Division of the SFC, said the use of the
Internet by Hong Kong brokers is growing very fast, and the wide
choice of services on offer is good for investors and good for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the regulation of the industry will facilitate
that growth. "We want investors to be protected and we want to
assist brokers to understand the new challenges especially in the
areas of Internet security and systems development and maintenance,
" he added.

<HEADLINE> Metallurgical Industrial Profits Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry
achieved a profit of 5.43 billion yuan in the first half of this
year, 4.2 billion yuan more than in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the State Administration of the Metallurgical
Industry attributed the increase to the pick-up of domestic steel
prices.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the combined industrial output value of
the country's key iron and steel companies reached 104.7 billion
yuan in the six-month period, up 11.4 percent on a yearly basis.
Their sales income reached 155.8 billion yuan, up 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, 15 more iron and steel giants started to
yield profits; at present, only 24.7 percent of the country's key
metallurgical enterprises remain loss-making.

China exported 5.66 million tons of steel and steel products in
the period, tripling the figure for the same 1999 period. A total
of 15 iron and steel enterprises reported exports of more than 100,
000 tons of products each.

<HEADLINE> Gender Equality Makes Headway: UNIFEM (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua)-- The Progress of the World's Women
2000, a report released here today by the United Nations
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), says that much progress has
been made in gender equality in many countries since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The report, a biennial document initiated by the UNIFEM, points
out the achievements but also warns that there are worrisome
trends.
</P>
<P>
The report says that gender equality in primary education has
been realized in many countries, while in middle school education,
the situation is unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 11 percent of the world's nations have
realized gender equality in their middle school enrollment, and
the enrollment rate of girls is lower than that of boys in 51
percent of the countries and higher in 38 percent of the countries.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1997, the middle school enrollment rate for girls
was upgraded to some extent worldwide, the report says, pointing
out that the percentage dropped in 30 countries at the same time.
China has made some progress in this regard, the report says,
citing the percentage at 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that the rate of employed women in paid
work in industries and services has risen since the mid-1980s in
much of the world, adding that the work quality has declined.

<P>
The report noted that the social protection and empowerment for
women in paid work are inferior to those of their male
counterparts. The rate of Chinese women employed in the non-
agricultural paid sectors stands at 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
More women have won seats in parliamentary bodies, the report
says, pointing out South Africa, Uganda, Mozambique and Argentina
as the most notable examples. The percentage of Chinese women in
this regard is close to 22 percent, which is fairly high,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Information from the report shows that only a small number of
the countries have reached the three targets set by the United
Nations, namely 95 percent of girls enrolled in schools, at least
30 percent of parliamentary seats for women, and a 50 percent
employment rate for women in paid jobs in the industrial and
service sectors.
</P>
<P>
The countries that have already reached the three targets
include Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway, and countries close
to the targets are Iceland, Holland, Germany and South Africa, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the report discuss the issue of gender equality
in economic affairs and empowerment for women in the context of
globalization. It also explores ways to promote the advancement of
poor women in the face of globalization.

<HEADLINE> ``China Concerned About Drug Situation in Central Asia" : Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China keeps a watchful eye on the
drug situation in the Central Asian region, according to a Chinese
police officer.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qianrong, of the Narcotics Control Bureau of the Ministry
of Public Security, made this remark at the ongoing Fifth ICPO-
Interpol Heroin Conference, which opened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Evidence and statistics show that more and more drug-
trafficking organizations frequent Central Asia, and an increasing
quantity of drugs is being smuggled from Afghanistan, through
Central Asian countries, and finally into Russia and other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that, although most drug traffickers opt for
Europe as their final destination, the possibility can not be
ruled out that they may cross the Chinese border when other
channels are blocked.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
which borders Central Asia, had more than 24,000 drug addicts,
scattered across the autonomous region's 84 counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
He said that, although most of the opium and heroin now
consumed in Xinjiang is smuggled from the Golden Triangle Area, in
Southeast Asia, the large number of addicts in the autonomous
region provides a potential consumer market for drugs from Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The officer affirmed the positive role played by Interpol and
other international organs in the fight against narcotics, adding
that the Chinese government is willing to join hands with other
countries to eradicate the drug problem in Central Asia.

<HEADLINE> China Openly Recruits Department-Level Officials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- "Vote for me! Trust me to be
capable of filling the post of deputy director of the Anti-
Corruption Bureau!"
</P>
<P>
The campaign speech by the first candidate Xu Jinhui this
morning drew overwhelming applause from the 400-some audience in
the meeting hall of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP).
</P>
<P>
As of today, 86 mid-level SPP officials and prosecutors from
Beijing started to openly compete for 16 positions at higher
department levels in the SPP, including the deputy head of the
Anti-Corruption Bureau and head of department for the prevention
of malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
An open election for such high level officials on a large scale
is the first in a central authority department in China. According
to the Ministry of Personnel, this practice is to be followed by
other central authority departments soon.
</P>
<P>
"I prosecuted China's top tobacco giant Chu Shijian for
corruption." "I participated in the prosecution team against Hu
Changqing, the first ever provincial government official to be
executed." "I was responsible for the investigation of 21 cases in
the Xiamen smuggling scandal." "I cracked a four-million-yuan
corruption case."
</P>
<P>
Six candidates for the post of deputy chief of the anti-
corruption bureau did their utmost to show off their advantages
and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jianju, the fifth speech-maker, surprised the judges and
audience by exposing his shortcomings first.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go to college when I was young, and I am afraid that
I'm not as good as those who did," he said. However, he quickly
added: "Since I have studied many subjects in addition to law,
such as economics and accounting, I have a special advantage in
handling economic crimes."
</P>
<P>
His unusual tactic also won thunderous applause.

<P>
Of the 400 people crowding the meeting hall, 13 were high-level
judges, 37 were staff members of the anti-corruption bureau, more
than 40 were journalists, and the others were from other
departments of the SPP.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a speech, each competitor had to respond to
questions from judges. One question was as follows:
</P>
<P>
"People are complaining that corruption is bad, and the
corruption of anti-corruption officials is worse. What is your
comment on this, and what will you do if you get the post?"
</P>
<P>
Most admitted that such complaints are justified, and the
situation of judicial corruption is really shocking in some places.
Some pledged to step up supervision; others said they would
enhance the professional ethics of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Each competitor was assessed by the judges, and subject to a
vote by staff members of the department he wanted to take over.
The SPP would make a final judgment after an overall consideration
of various factors.
</P>
<P>
According to the SPP, 130 section chief positions will also be
open for public competition after the department heads are
appointed, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all the official
positions in the SPP.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really glad that I attended the competition," said Xu
Haifa, the third campaigner, after his speech.
</P>
<P>
"Opening such a high level anti-corruption position for public
competition is a measure to prevent corruption in public
administration," he added.
</P>
<P>
A 50-year-old staff member of the Anti-Corruption Bureau said
that "official selection used to be a matter of 'choosing among
the privileged few by the more privileged fewer."
</P>
<P>
"The new mechanism is bringing fresh air to the dreary offices,
and the lifeless bureaucratic work style is dying out," he
commented.

million U.S. dollars), up 40 percent from the aid in 1998, An Nahar
Newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report issued by the EU in Beirut as
saying that the total assistance provided by the EU to Lebanon

<P>
The report, which is the yearly account of the activities of the
EU in Lebanon, showed most of the assistance provided by the EU was
spent on reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
The EU recently formally notified Lebanon of its intention to
increase the pledged 120 million euros (105 million dollars) of aid
to more than 200 million euros (180 million U.S. dollars) for the
1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used in projects dealing with reconstruction,
economic and social development, human right, environmental

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 1.5 Tons of Morphine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's anti-narcotics agents have
managed to seize some 1.5 tons of morphine in Tehran and the
northwestern city of Mianeh in the past few days, a high-ranking
security officer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One ton of the confiscated drugs had been concealed in a gas
tanker and were detected by sniffer dogs in Mianeh," Tehran's
security forces Brigadier General Mohsen Ansari said.
</P>
<P>
He added that during the operation, six traffickers were
arrested
who confessed to concealing another 500 kilograms of morphine in
eastern Tehran for transit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to the commander, a total of 80 tons of narcotic
drugs, including 6 tons of morphine, have been seized all over the
country over the past four months, registering a rise of 12 tons
compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the drugs confiscated by the security
forces only account for 35-40 percent of the total narcotics
transited via Iranian border points.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the consumption of narcotics in Iran, he
said that about 1.3 million drug addicts live in Iran who consume
650-700 tons of drugs per year.
</P>
<P>
Iran is still a main transit of drugs from neighboring
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Gulf and European countries despite
its efforts to
crack down on drug traffickers since 1989 when its parliament
passed a strict anti-drug law.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iran closed down 725 kilometers of its
borders with eastern neighbor Afghanistan as part of the stepped-up
efforts to combat drug-trafficking and other security threats.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes Anti-Peace Bills in Preliminary Readings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset, or Parliament,
Wednesday approved, in preliminary readings, a series of so-
called "anti-peace" bills, which aim to set limitations on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The first bill, which was presented by Likud legislator Limor
Livnat, would require Israeli government to annex all Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip if the Palestinians
unilaterally declare an independent state this September.
</P>
<P>
The second bill, introduced by another Likud lawmaker Tzahi
Hanegbi, stated that if the Palestinians declare statehood without
coordination with Israel, the Israeli administration should cancel
the Oslo agreements, which began the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The two bills were approved in such a context that a unilateral
statehood declaration by the Palestinians and possible subsequent
violence in the West Bank looms because of the latest crisis in
Camp David summit talks.
</P>
<P>
The three-way summit attended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton began at Camp David, Maryland on July 11 in order to
resolve all the differences between the two sides for reaching an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, it ran into a crisis Wednesday when Barak prepared to
leave the summit, accusing the Palestinians of not acting as a true
peace partner.
</P>
<P>
According to a series of peace deals between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides should sign a final peace accord by
this September and the Palestinians prepare to declare an
independent state by then.
</P>
<P>
The third "anti-peace" bill approved Wednesday by Israel's
Knesset was co-sponsored by Likud legislator Silvan Shalom and
lawmaker Zvi Hendel from Yisrael Beiteinu - National Union faction.
</P>
<P>
The bill require that any Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements
approved in a referendum with the support of 50 percent plus one of
all Israeli registered voters, instead of those take part in the
vote.
</P>
<P>
It means all those fail to cast their ballots are interpreted as
voting against the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The fourth bill, proposed by Likud legislator Yisrael Katz, also
requests a special majority, or 55 percent of those who cast the
vote, in such a referendum for approving Israeli-Palestinian
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The bills, analysts believe, are aiming to counteract the vote
of Israeli Arabs, who support the peace process for certain. There
are about 1 million Arab citizens in the Jewish state's 6.5-million
population.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill needs three more readings to get final
approval and it is believed that Barak should have time to bury it
in the process.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Reports Clarifies Media Leak in Aborted Malaysian Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine leading English news
channel claimed a mistaken "media leak" in its coverage earlier
Wednesday afternoon of the aborted release of the remaining seven
Malaysian hostages of the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report, ABS-CBN's TV report clarified an earlier
report that the Malaysian hostages had been taken by boat from
Jolo, Sulu to Zamboanga at around 2 .m., Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At about 6:45 p.m., ABS-CBN reporter Erwin Tulfo in Sulu said a
media leak had disrupted the planned release of the Malaysian
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the earlier report, chief government hostage
negotiator Robert Aventajado said he could not confirm if the
Malaysians were released.

<HEADLINE> Three Indian Ministers Quit, Resignations Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three ministers are Heavy Industry Minister Manohar Joshi,
Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Suresh Prabhu and Minister of
State for Finance Balasaheb Vikhe Patil.
</P>
<P>
The three sent in their resignations amidst reports that the
Maharashtra state government in southwest India was planning to
arrest Bal Thackeray, party chief of Shiv Sena, for his connection
with the 1993 riots in Mumbai, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
Manohar Joshi told the press here that the three ministers were
resigning as they felt "uncomfortable" with being in the ministry
because the state government seems to have decided to arrest their
leader, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Citing "vitiated atmosphere" in the state, Suresh Prabhu
complained in his letter to Vajpayee of inadequate security to
Thackeray and his family, the PTI noted.
</P>
<P>
He said in view of the situation in the state and in support of
his leader, he did not want to continue in the central government.
</P>
<P>
However, Joshi, who handed in his resignation at the meeting of
the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment on Wednesday morning, said
that this is not a protest against the central government and "
this does not put a question mark over our alliance with NDA."
</P>
<P>
The ministers' resignation might be an attempt to put pressure
on the central government, the PTI said.

<HEADLINE> 6 Identified as Arms Heist Masterminds in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Six members of the Al Ma'unah
deviant group including its leader Mohamed Amin Mohd Razali have
been identified as the masterminds behind the arms heist at two
army camps in Gerik in Malaysia's northern state of Perak on July
2, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides Mohamed Amin, the others also include a Malaysian air
force serviceman Capt Jamaluddin Darus.
</P>
<P>
"We believe they play a key role in our investigations,"
Bernama news agency quoted police officer Hamzah Shamsuddin of the
Kuala Kangsar police station as telling reporters in Kuala Kangsar,
Perak, where the six are detained since July 6.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah said the six had given their cooperation to the
investigating team.
</P>
<P>
The six are among 27 who are allegedly involved in the arms
robbery on July 2 at the Sungai Rui army post and Territorial Army
's Battalion 304 camp and surrendered on July 6.
</P>
<P>
Twenty other members of the group are being held in the Perak
police headquarters in Ipoh and another is undergoing treatment in
Ipoh Hospital in the state.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah said: "Police are expediting the investigations as it is
of national interest and hope to complete the probe before August
1, the date the remand order expires."

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM on Arms Robbery by Al-Ma'unah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday night he felt the incident of the
arms robbery from military camps in Gerik in the northern state of
Perak on July 2 began with efforts to discredit the government.
</P>
<P>
"Beginning with the accusation that the government is unIslamic,
they began to win support for certain groups through a campaign of
hatred claiming that the government is unIslamic," he said when
analyzing the incident in a "Special Interview with the prime
minister" aired over Radio and TV Malaysia (RTM) and TV3
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
In the July 2 incident which occurred for the first time in
Malaysia's history of independence, 15 men posing as army officers
stole a huge arms cache including more than 100 rifles, machine-
guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition from two military camps
in Gerik and they joined 13 accomplices hiding in the Bukit
Jenalik jungle in Sauk in the state where they took four hostages -
- a durian collector, a soldier and two police personnel.
</P>
<P>
One of the gang members was killed in a crossfire with security
forces and the remaining 27 surrendered to the authorities five
days later but after killing two of the hostages -- a soldier and
a police detective.
</P>
<P>
The gang members were all identified as belonging to the Al-Ma'
unah religious deviationist and mystical cult.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his initial fears were that the arms robbery
could perhaps be the beginning of an armed rebellion in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"I was worried as to whether this was the beginning of
something bigger ... that there is to be a planned rebellion in
our country and probably result in many deaths, killings and so on.
I was greatly shocked as this does not normally happen in our
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, from the latest information and the results of
investigations the government has been able to identify who did it
and what was their real aim. "We are monitoring the situation as
this is what we fear most," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the opposition is trying to absolve the Al-Ma'
unah group of the criminal act of staging the arms heist and the
Sauk hostage episode by charging that it was the government's own
doing.
</P>
<P>
"We have now seen that to protect those directly or indirectly
involved or those sympathizing with the group, they hurl
accusations that the government planned the heist," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The accusations did not make sense at all and moreover the
government would never at all get involved in criminal acts which
resulted in the murder of two members of the security forces,
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The wholly baseless accusations would no doubt create feelings
of anger among Muslims who hoped that this country would follow
methods which they could consider were in line with Islamic
governance, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Lankan President Faces Uphill Battle to Push Through Constitutional Reforms  by Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga is facing a uphill battle to push through her long
cherished constitutional reforms in the face of divergence with
the main opposition United National Party (UNP), dissatisfaction
from moderate Tamil parties, and a total rejection by Tamil Tiger
rebels, political analysts said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance (PA) led by President Kumaratunga
struck consensus with the UNP on the proposed constitutional
reforms in early July after four months of arduous bipartisan
talks, but divergence remains in issues of the Executive
Presidency and the practical implementation of the reforms,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga wants to keep the Executive Presidency in a
transitional period extending to the end of her second six-year
presidential term in 2005, but the UNP wanted a shorter time frame.
</P>
<P>
"We will not agree to the continuation of the executive
presidency in any form, even for a transitional period. The UNP
Executive Committee has called for the abolition of the Executive
Presidency," said Mahinda Samarasinghe, a UNP member of parliament
(MP) and one of the representatives to the government-UNP
constitutional negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional reforms, first put forward by the president
in 1995 in the form of devolution package, aim to end Sri Lanka's
long-running ethnic conflict by devolving more powers to regions
including one administered by minority Tamils. The reforms will
turn the island into a de facto federal state with Westminster
style parliamentary system.
</P>
<P>
Moderate Tamil parties have also reacted vehemently towards the
proposed new constitution, deeming it "totally ignores the
political aspirations of the Tamil nation." Eight Tamil parties
said in a joint statement on Sunday that the proposed new
constitution did not guarantee the unity of the Tamil northeastern
region, which Tamils view as their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The parties demanded radical modification to the draft
constitution. They urged the PA government and UNP to put an end
to the war and initiated third-party mediation to bring the
government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels
to the negotiation table as the first step to bring peace to the
war-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
With the current parliament to be dissolved on August 24, and
new parliamentary election due on the first week of November,
President Kumaratunga needs Tamil MPs' support to achieve the two-
thirds majority in the parliament for the adoption of the new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga faces an arduous task of retaining her ruling bloc'
s hold on the 225-member parliament, as she herself got onto the
presidency last December with a mere 51.2 percent public vote.
</P>
<P>
Her People's Alliance, together with two small parties, managed
a one-seat majority in 1994 parliamentary election, but enjoys
support of some opposition defectors as well as minority Tamil MPs.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has said she would present the draft
constitution before the parliament in early August and have it
adopted before the parliament is dissolved on August 24.
</P>
<P>
However, even if the new constitution gets passed in the
parliament, it is still good-for-nothing without the cooperation
of the LTTE rebels who have been fighting for a separate homeland
called Eelam for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's North and East
since 1983. Up until now, the reaction from the rebel organization
is total rejection.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's spokesman and main theoretician Balasingham said his
organization had refused government's 1995 devolution package, how
could they accept such a draft constitution which grant even fewer
autonomous rights for ethnic Tamils now?
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga still faces opposition from Sinhala Urumaya (
Heritage), a newly founded Sinhala nationalist party who has vowed
to campaign against the draft constitution, saying it was
tantamount to separation.
</P>
<P>
Influential Buddhist clergies in this predominantly Buddhist
country also protested against the removal of an article in the
draft which grants the foremost place to Buddhism and ensures its
protection, accusing the government and UNP of doing so to pacify
the separatist LTTE.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Navy Chief Warns Foreign Warships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Navy Chief of Staff Adm.
Achmad Sutjipto Wednesday said he did not believe foreign warships
would dare to trespass on Indonesian waters to intervene in the
Maluku conflict.
</P>
<P>
"It's not likely to happen. The risks would be too high. I
think no country would purposely provoke an incident at sea,"
Sutjipto told reporters in Surabaya, capital of East Java.
</P>
<P>
The Navy chief was commenting on reports that a United States
warship had recently been spotted sailing in the vicinity of Biak
in Irian Jaya province.
</P>
<P>
Sutjipto confirmed that the Navy had detected the U.S. warship'
s presence but said its position was still outside Indonesian
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
"If they want to enter Indonesian territorial waters, they will
have to respect our rules as a sovereign country," he said, adding
that an intrusion into Indonesian territory would badly damage
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he had ordered all of the Navy's units in the provinces
of Maluku and North Maluku to carry out their duties without any
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Navy had seized 139 civilian ships carrying
weapons illegally in Maluku waters and 21 ships in North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
It had questioned 1,300 people, both civilians and military,
about their involvement in weapon smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"We check all ships (sailing among the Maluku islands). If they
resist, we will take stern measures, including sinking them, if
necessary," he was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Navy so far had not come across any foreign ship
transporting weapons illegally but was not ruling out the
possibility that warring elements in Maluku were receiving weapons
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Our territorial waters covering such a vast area, it is too
naive to think there can be no arms supply from abroad," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spice islands of Maluku have been wrecked by communal
clashes since early 1999. Thousands of people were either killed
or wounded and hundreds of public buildings destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid and other government
officials and military officers repeatedly said that the
government will reject foreign intervention in settling the
communal clashes in Maluku.

WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>

occasional hits of progress, bleary-eyed negotiators led by
President Clinton worked virtually around the clock Tuesday as
they tried to complete an Israel-Palestinian peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
-- In a sharp joint statement, China and Russia warned Tuesday

<P>
-- Microsoft reported that quarterly earnings were slightly
higher than expected, but sales were on a par with the year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
-- Drivers' use of cell phones will be discouraged by federal
regulators, who say those and other gadgets compromised safety.
The effort will take the form of advice, not bans, but may
encourage local laws curbing road use of the devices.

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Reach Understanding on Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and Japan
reached a mutual understanding Wednesday on substantial elements
of an envisaged cooperation agreement regarding the application of
both EU and Japanese competition laws.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the competition understanding, the European
Commission, the EU's executive body, said the envisaged agreement
would make it easier for the competition authorities in the EU and
Japan to exchange information on international competition cases
and coordinate their investigations to the extent possible under
domestic rules.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for competition Mario Monti said no body can
dispute the increasing international dimension of competition
policy. The European Commission has been pioneering closer
cooperation between antitrust authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The existing framework of bilateral agreements between the EU,
the United States and Canada will be completed by a very similar
agreement with Japan, Monti said. "Our experience so far has
demonstrated that cooperation in competition matters between the
world's major economies is beneficial not just for the authorities
but is also in the interest of companies and ultimately the
consumer," he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive and Japanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), the
Japanese competition authorities, agreed last October that it
would be mutually beneficial to work toward strengthening their
cooperation in the field of competition.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two sides has explored the possibility of
concluding a cooperation agreement in this area.
</P>
<P>
Having considerable experience in bilateral cooperation on
international competition matters, the EU has already concluded
basic agreements with the United States in 1991 and with Canada in
1999.
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, Japan signed a bilateral agreement with the
United States in this area. Now the European Commission is ready
to launch formal negotiations with the Japanese government on the
conclusion of an EU-Japan competition cooperation agreement
similar to the ones that both sides have concluded with the United
States and the EU-Canadian deal.

<HEADLINE> Advertisement Arouse Controversy in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the advertisement, Gong Li reads a letter from a girl of a
Hope Project school, who took the medicine given for free by Gong
Li and thanked for her kindness in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The liquid medicine, produced by the Harbin No. 6
Pharmaceutical Factory, is said to be especially helpful to
children's health by providing more absorbable calcium. The
advertisement also showed on China Central Television (CCTV) with
national coverage.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the advertisement was broadcast, China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF), the only administrative
organization of the Hope Project in China, announced that
according to their investigation none of Hope Project schools has
received Gong's donation of the tonic liquid, which probably means
that Gong has provided an untrue information to the public.
</P>
<P>
Even though few are skeptical of the medicine, many rebuke Gong
's behavior in the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot stand a public figure like Gong Li to make a puffery
advertisement for the product and herself in names of the clean
and holy Hope Project," said Ah Xiu, staff with a local
governmental office, who is the first to wrote an article on the
Internet websites early this month accusing of Gong's behavior.
</P>
<P>
However, some believe that Gong is innocent. "The factory and
advertising agent made the commercial, Gong just did what they
told her to do, it is not her business to check whether the
content is true or false, " said Lu Liping, a well-kwon Chinese
female movie star.
</P>
<P>
Many people criticize that they often see a well known actor
saying in TV advertisement that he always buy the medicine for his
son, but in fact he only has daughter. In another advertisement,
an actress says she buy the product for her baby, but in fact she
has no child at all.
</P>
<P>
Observers said public figures had better be aware of their
influence on the public and avoid releasing untrue information in
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
"Public figures can shoot commercials but they must be cautious
because their behavior will affect the public," said Ma Ji, an
senior actor with high prestige, in a comment posted on www.sohu.
com, one of China's most popular websites.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also believe that it is necessary to regulate public
figures' behavior in commercials, especially when a commercial
concerns with social service and charities.
</P>
<P>
Gong Li, a well-known Chinese female movie star with
international reputation, is named "Artist of Peace" by United
Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
this May. She was also elected as the chair of nine-member
International Jury for the 50th Berlin Film Festival this year.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project is widely recognized as a national charity
that helps young dropouts in poor areas return to school by
setting up schools of Hope Project on the social contribution.
</P>
<P>
Since initiated in 1990 by the CYDF under the Communist Youth
League of China, it has received over 1.78 billion yuan (about
214 million U.S. dollars) in donations and sent 2.29 million
children back to school over the past decade.

ZHENGZHOU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Wang Bo, the first convicted
hacker in central China's Henan Province, said he would appeal to
the higher court after being sentenced to one-year imprisonment
Tuesday by a district court in this provincial capital.

Wang, 23, was charged with destroying computer data system. He
was a former employee of the China Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.
in Zhengzhou. He had hacked into the company's database five times
by June 15 last year, and altogether deleted 1,510 policy records
from the computer system, altered the premium and benefit payment
schedules of more than 10,000 policy records, and changed the
company's service telephone number.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Wang's alterations, the insurance company issued
480 policies containing errors, which "seriously disrupted normal
business," according to a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he did this to take revenge on his former boss, as he
was very unhappy with the company.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Pumped-Storage Power Plant Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest pumped-
storage power plant, which is to provide emergency electricity for
Guangdong Province and the neighboring Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, became operational today in this provincial
capital of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
With a generating capacity of 2.4 million kw, the power plant
is the largest of its kind in the world. It is an affiliated
facility of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, also in Guangdong.
Its major function is to back up the power systems of Hong Kong
and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which can store surplus power and provide critical
support for emergencies, was co-funded by the Guangdong Electric
Power Company, Guangdong Nuclear Power Investment Company and
State Development and Investment Corporation. With 200 million U.S.
dollars in loans from the French government and the Asian
Development Bank, the plant imported world-class generating sets
and production equipment from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong China Electric Power Co. has bought the usufruct
of a 600,000-kw generating set. The company can use remote-control
to operate the generating set in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jirao, vice minister of water resources, said at today's
inauguration ceremony that the operation of the plant signifies
that China's construction and management abilities concerning
storage power plants have reached the world's advanced level.

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Output on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China manufactured 61.18 million
tons of steel in the first half of this year, up 3.4 percent from
the same 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
Pu Haiqing, director of the State Administration of the
Metallurgical Industry (SAMI), said that the steel output for the
six-month period was actually 280,000 tons less than the target
set early this year.
</P>
<P>
The SAMI has mapped out a plan to bring the country's annual
steel output down to 110 million tons for this year.
</P>
<P>
Pu said that 13 large steel enterprises, including the Capital
and Shanghai Baoshan iron and steel groups, took a good lead in
cutting down production and improving product quality.
</P>
<P>
Domestic steel prices have returned to a normal level, but the
balance of supply and demand is still fragile, Pu said.
</P>
<P>
The metallurgical enterprises should still stick to the aims
and measures set for reducing output in the next half of the year,
Pu noted.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Blasts DDP's ``Independence" Stance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, the leading
newspaper in China, condemns the obstinate pro-independence
position of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DDP) in
a commentary to be published tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
On July 16, DPP's first plenary session of its ninth congress
passed a declaration claiming that the DPP "has never changed its
stance on the future of Taiwan" and "will never change its
advocacy of the sovereignty, independence and autonomy of Taiwan",
the People's Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says the move has once again exposed the DPP's
die-hard adherence to its stance of "Taiwan independence" and
continuance of its attempts to promote separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
On October 13, 1991, the DPP's fifth congress passed a
resolution to add the "Taiwan independence clause" of "the
founding of a sovereign, independent and autonomous Republic of
Taiwan and the formulation of the new constitution should be
decided by all the residents of Taiwan through a referendum" into
its party constitution, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the DPP has degenerated into a "Taiwan independence
party", the paper comments.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's advocacy of "Taiwan independence" and adherence to
the statement that "Taiwan is a sovereign and independent nation"
in an attempt to separate Taiwan from the motherland goes against
the fundamental interests of all the Chinese people, including the
Taiwan compatriots, and is firmly opposed by the Chinese people as
a whole.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Blasts DPP's ``Independence" Stance (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It goes on to accuse the party of ignoring the call by some of
its members and masses of Taiwan people to abandon the "Taiwan
independence clause" in the DPP constitution and ignorance of the
demands by compatriots of both sides and the political reality of
the international community. This will only lead the party to a
dead end, it comments.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily holds the leader of the Taiwan authorities
responsible for the DPP's stubborn "Taiwan independence" stance.
The fact that the Taiwan leader has said nothing about the
revision of the "Taiwan independence clause" means that he agrees
to keep it, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, he pledged not to declare "Taiwan independence
" and press for a "referendum on reunification or independence".
But on the other hand he has insisted on making no revision of the
"Taiwan independence clause", which shows that he does not
practice what he preaches, the People's Daily comments.
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy of "Taiwan independence" is a severe crime in an
attempt to split the motherland, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Taiwan compatriots do not support "Taiwan
independence"; all the Chinese people will never allow the attempt
of "Taiwan independence" to succeed; and the international
community will never give any space for "Taiwan independence", the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence" could bring nothing but catastrophe to
the Taiwan people, it says, stressing that there will be no good
end for those who insist that "Taiwan is a sovereign and
independent nation" and promote so-called "Taiwan independence". (

<TEXT>
<P>
The People's Daily reiterates that the One-China Principle is
the basis and precondition for peaceful reunification, and it is
the mainland's unswerving stance to oppose all kinds of separatist
activities.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to make wide-ranging contacts and exchanges
with all Taiwan-based political parties, groups and individuals
who advocate the One-China Principle and the development of cross-
straits relations," the commentary says, pledging, "We will never
contact parties and individuals advocating 'Taiwan independence'."
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to set up "Taiwan independence" or "hold a
referendum on Taiwan independence" will definitely result in a new
crisis across the Taiwan Straits, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the cross-straits ties will never enjoy peace and
such actions may further threaten peace and stability in the Asian-
Pacific Region, with catastrophic consequences, it says.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily commentary points out that adherence to
reunification and opposing separatism is a historical trend,
saying that the DPP could only find a way out by recognizing and
following the trends of the time and abandoning its "Taiwan
independence" stance completely.

<HEADLINE> Barak Leaving Camp David, Summit Seems to Fail: Israeli Sources EDS: Updated with more details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is leaving Camp David in the United States and the summit with the
Palestinians there for reaching a peace deal seemed to fail,
Barak's One Israel coalition whip Ophir Pines-Paz confirmed here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, that's all the information I have for the
moment," Pines-Paz told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not believe Barak's leaving is a negotiation
maneuver, adding that according to his sources, the American
sponsors shared with Barak the judgement that the Palestinians
adopted too tough stands in the talks.
</P>
<P>
If Barak comes back, it will indicate the break-off of the
summit, which began eight days before at Camp David aiming to
resolve all the core issues between the two sides, such as the fate
of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, border,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton, the summit's
organizer, announced that he will postpone his planned departure
for the G-8 industrialized states summit in Japan from Wednesday to
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, it seemed that Barak even didn't want to use the extra
24
hours President Clinton had allocated to the summit, according to
Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The Radio quoted a "senior source" close to the talks as saying
that Barak had reached the conclusion that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat is just not acting as "a true peace partner."
</P>
<P>
Now it appears that the summit has failed, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Israel had warned the Palestinians not to take unilateral
actions,
such as declaring a independent state and deteriorating security
situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Bashar to Visit Lebanon in Few Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
will pay an official visit to Lebanon in the next few weeks as part
of an Arab tour that is expected to take him to Saudi Arabia,
Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain and other countries, An Nahar newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The tour is aimed at thanking the leaders of those countries for
the sympathy they expressed on the death of late Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, who passed away on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Bashar's visit to Lebanon would be the first of its kind by a
serving Syrian head of state since 1975, when the late Hafez al-
Assad met with late Lebanese President Suleiman Frangie in a city
on the Beirut-Damascus highway.
</P>
<P>
The visit will underscore Syria's final recognition of Lebanon's
independent statehood and further boost Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud's regime, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, along with Prime Minister Salim Hoss and Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri, will go to the northern Syrian town of Qardaha
to hold talks with Bashar on Thursday, Asharq newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Hafez al-Assad, whose country is the major power broker in
Lebanon, had held 83 summit meetings with Lebanese presidents
during his lifetime on Syrian soil and only once on the Beirut-
Damascus highway. But the deceased leader is the first post-
independence Syrian president to formally recognize Lebanon as an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Hafez al-Assad signed with former Lebanese President Elias
Hraoui in 1992 a Treaty of Brotherhood, Cooperation and
Coordination between the two neighboring republics.
</P>
<P>
Bashar, who was sworn in as Syria's 16th post-independence
president on Monday, had been put by his father in charge of
Syria's role in Lebanon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bashar's forthcoming visit, if it comes through, will serve as a
finalization of Syria's official recognition of Lebanon's
independence, An Nahar said.
</P>
<P>
Like Palestine and Jordan, Lebanon was part of Syria during the
500-year Ottoman occupation.
</P>
<P>
The visit will put an end to the contention that Syrian
presidents do not make official visits to Lebanon for fear that
they would be interpreted as a recognition of Lebanon's sovereignty
and independence from Syria.

DAMASCUS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
held a closed-door meeting here Wednesday noon with visiting
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein, the Syrian news agency

However, the report did not reveal details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Bashar and Abdullah had held talks on the
Middle East peace process and bilateral relations immediately after
Abdullah's arrival in Damascus.
</P>

The monarch is the second leader received by Bashar, who was
sworn in as president of Syria on Monday one month after his father
late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack on June
10.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Jordan maintain regular high-level consultations on
the developments of the Middle East peace process, especially on
the Syrian-Israeli track.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Securities Regulation Code Signed Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
signed into law Wednesday two economic bills designed to help the
country compete under the era of globalization and bring in more
investors into its capital market.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered during the ceremonial signing of the two
laws in the presidential palace, Estrada noted that the enactment
of the investor-friendly New Securities Regulation Code represents
"a historic and positive turning point for the economic
development of our country."
</P>
<P>
The law empowers the government to completely reorganize the
Securities and Exchange Commission to enable it to address
changing market conditions.
</P>
<P>
"This new code should be a major engine to fuel our economic
growth and enable the Philippines to effectively compete in the
new global securities market and attract new investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill seeking a new securities act was filed five years ago
during the Ramos administration, but was signed into law only
during the term of President Estrada, who urged Congress to give
priority to the measure "in recognition of the importance of the
capital market to sustainable economic growth."
</P>
<P>
The other measure signed into law, the Safeguard Measures
Against Import Surge Act, is expected to provide relief to
domestic industries as the country prepares for global competition.
</P>
<P>
Estrada explained that the Safeguard Measures Act allows the
government to impose additional tariffs on certain imports when
these increase in significant quantities and threaten domestic
industries.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from trade remedy measures which provide an adjustment
period for agriculture industries to become competitive, the law
also proposes adjustment plans for the affected sectors to adopt
in aid of enhancing competitiveness," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president lauded Congress for the early passage of the
measure, saying it is a welcome development for Filipino farmers "
growing sensitive agriculture products."
</P>
<P>
"The passage of this law is timely for the agriculture sector
as domestic producers are currently facing severe competition from
foreign imports which have been increasing over the last year or
so," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over the surge in imports of such
commodities as chicken parts, onion and garlic and other food
items, which has seriously threatened the local agriculture
industry.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the enactment of the Safeguard
Measures and the Securities Regulation Code provide a component
necessary to build a modernized framework for business "that
should enable our economy to surge ahead once they are fully
implemented."
</P>
<P>
The two economic measures were passed by Congress on Monday,
the first of its two-day special session.

BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China and Brazil signed an
agreement here today to jointly develop an earth resources
satellite, which is expected to be launched in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be assembled in Brazil by scientists from
the two nations, and launched at China's Taiyuan Satellite Launch
Center, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second earth resources satellite to be
developed by the two nations. The first one was launched by a
Chinese Long March rocket in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite, which is expected to be more reliable and
advanced, will replace the first one, which has a life span of two
years.
</P>
<P>
The earth resources satellite is designed to monitor geological,
oceanic and meteorological conditions.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the first Sino-Brazilian satellite has been
providing high-quality photos and data for the two countries,
playing a big role in disaster-prevention and other economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
Before the launch of the satellite, both China and Brazil had
to rely on foreign data.
</P>
<P>
The satellite project is considered to be a successful example

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen A Shares Edges Up at Wednesday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen composite index closed
at 615.01 points on Wednesday, slightly up 0.69 points or 0.11
percent compared with the last close. The sub-index closed at 4,
794.1 points, down 1.51 points or 0.03 percent from the last close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 10.17 billion yuan (1.23 billion U.S. dollars), 7.
2 percent less than Tuesday's 10.96 billion yuan, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory
company.
</P>
<P>
After the Shenzhen composites index hit another new high of
617.47 points this morning, the index fluctuated under the
pressure of profit taking.
</P>
<P>
Investors felt excited when the Shanghai composite index
climbed to 2000 points. However, they were still concerned and
wanted to take profits, as the index was on the historical high
level.
</P>
<P>
Some ST shares, mutual funds and the shares held by the mutual
funds performed actively. The good performance of H shares may be
related to positive news about H share development, said Homeway.
</P>
<P>
Three companies Neimengu Hongfeng Industry Co. Ltd, Hefei
Fengle Seed Co. Ltd. and Henan Star Electronic Instrument Co. Ltd.
were the top gainers with their prices up to the ceilings.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the market is likely to try
620 points tomorrow.

BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market index
fell 0.61 points, or 0.54 percent, to 112.65 at Wednesday close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 79.10 million HK dollars, which was 34.04 million
HK dollars or 75.54 percent less than Tuesday's total, according
to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities

</P>
<P>
Firmly negative bias was still intact but the market was in
the process of consolidating in its second straight losing streak,
said Homeway.
</P>
<P>
ST Jiangling Motor added 4.91 percent to 1.71 HK dollars,
while Sez Real Estate rose 3.75 percent to 2.49 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the market move has been far
from aggressive with activity on the lighter side. From a short
term perspective the pullback is an encouraging development, as
the moderate wave of profit taking is not considered serious
following the release of solid earnings.

"Unfortunately, that's all the information I have for the

He said he did not believe Barak's leaving is a negotiation
maneuver, adding that according to his sources, the American
sponsors shared with Barak the judgement that the Palestinians
adopted too tough stands in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's leaving will indicate the break-off of the summit, which
began eight days ago at Camp David aiming to resolve all the
core issues between the two sides, such as the fate of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, border, security and

<HEADLINE> Beijing Opera Sees Less Male Performers of Female Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- "Nan Dan," male performers taking
female parts in Beijing Opera, will soon be out of the stage,
according to Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily."
</P>
<P>
"Nan Dan" used to take the absolute advantage in Beijing Opera.
The four male performers of Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, Mei
Lanfang and Xun Huisheng were known almost by everyone in China
since the twenties.
</P>
<P>
In old times, the constant traveling of Chinese traditional
opera troupes made it hard for female performers to stay in the
troupe. Also, the inconvenience of men and women living together
made it difficult for women's participation in the opera
performance.
</P>
<P>
So "Dan", the female part in Beijing opera, was originally
designed for males to play, said Wen Ruhua, a performer with the
Beijing Opera Theater of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Renowned opera performers including Mei Baojiu, son of Mei
Lanfang, did not say too much of regret of no successors to "Nan
Dan." "Let the 'Nan Dan' run its course," Mei said.
</P>
<P>
"No repelling nor advocating" attitude now prevails the opera
circle. Performer Li Yufu did not consider "Nan Dan" a must by
saying that the all-female Yue Opera is now still accepted by
audience though it has taken male performers.
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old boy who successfully played the childhood of a
famous "Nan Dan" in a film refused to learn "Dan" and insisted
taking male parts.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Su Shijin with Fudan University's Psychology Consultation
Center told "Wenhui Daily," "The male performers apparently have
two split parts at the stage and in their daily lives. They wish
to see themselves as normal healthy men."

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Visits Syria to Congratulate Bashar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
left here Wednesday for Damascus on a good-will visit to Syria to
congratulate Bashar al-Assad after he was sworn in as President of
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The monarch is also expected to attend events on Thursday
marking the end of a 40-day mourning period for late Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father who died of a heart
attack on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan and Syria have been drastically improved
after King Abdullah acceded to the throne in February 1999 after
his father King Hussein Ibn Talal died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Assad and Hussein had been at odds over Jordan's 1994 peace
treaty with Israel, as Assad was against any unilateral Arab action
to reach a peace deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The king's visit will further boost ties between the two
countries as he has established close personal ties with Bashar.
</P>
<P>
The two new rulers, who marked a breed of young Arab leaders,
shared similar views on the Middle East peace process and a need to
develop national economy.
</P>
<P>
Bashar was sworn in on Monday to serve a seven-year term after
he won a landslide victory earlier this month in a national
referendum to succeed his father as president.

ANKARA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey convinced its NATO allies to support its stance over
the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI), the European
Union (EU) independent policy-making mechanism over defense.
</P>
<P>
Ankara proposed that every NATO ally, whether EU member or not,

following the EU's authorization and approval every time.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Government Forms Committee to Prevent Dengue Fever (By Pan Xiaozhu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Government formed a high-
powered committee Tuesday for preventing and monitoring the dengue
attacks, as residents of Dhaka city are scared of the spread of
dengue fever at an alarming rate and rise in dengue deaths during
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
An inter-ministerial meeting with Health Minister Sheikh Fazlul
Karim Selim in the chair decided Tuesday to destroy the breeding
abodes of mosquito in order to combat spread of dengue fever in
the city.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also asked the authorities concerned for
strengthening preventive measures and monitoring the situation
round the clock.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people have died and over 100 people with dengue
fever were admitted to hospitals in the city in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The scare aggravated as an expert last week said there was no
treatment of the dengue fever in the country.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Nazrul Islam, an expert on virology at the Bangabandhu
Sheikh Mujib Medical University, warned that unless spread of the
mosquito which carries the disease, was checked, the situation
could be worse soon.
</P>
<P>
Many panic stricken people in the capital, who usually do not
use mosquito nets and depended on anti-mosquito smokes and liquid
sprays, are now queuing in shops to buy nets to protect them from
the deadly virus fever.
</P>
<P>
The country's only government laboratory reportedly uses
reagents that have mostly expired, for tests to detect dengue
attacks. The equipment of the laboratory are also out-dated. The
laboratory relies on the kits from the World Health Organization (
WHO) to conduct tests. What is more appalling is that there are no
enough scientists to conduct emergency surveys if ever required.
</P>
<P>
The WHO informed the health ministry Tuesday that it has taken
an initiative to train about 90 doctors, both from public and
private sectors in the country. Moreover, it would provide 1000
more test kits to the Health Directorate for dengue tests while a
surveillance team to assess the dengue situation in Bangladesh is
due here shortly.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Garment Industry Prepares to Face Quota-Free Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's garment industry has
been urged to speed up their adjustments to face quota-free era
beginning from 2005 when quotas are completely phased out, an
official with the Textile Quota Board (TQB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said some garment manufacturers were exporting to the
European Union (EU) without a quota and were working towards a non-
quota era.
</P>
<P>
The garment industry has risen to be one of the most important
sectors in Sri Lanka's export economy in the last two decades and
is the largest industrial employment sector with over 350,000
employed directly.
</P>
<P>
However, the industry has for long enjoyed the security
provided by the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) for garment exports to
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
With the phasing out of the MFA in 2005, those manufacturers
who were dependent on quotas may face increased competition and
will require more aggressive marketing to win orders.
</P>
<P>
The TQB also informed garment exporters to stick to 2003 as the
target year to diversify markets worldwide to reduce the
dependence on the United States and the European Union (EU) which
together account for over 90 percent of the island's garment
exports.
</P>
<P>
Recently the European Commission proposed to liberalize textile
and clothing imports from January 2002, eliminating all remaining
restrictions on imports of 62 categories of textiles and clothing
products from other countries belonging to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The TQB is hopeful that Sri Lanka garment industry will benefit
from Europe's imports liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the second largest biggest market for Sri Lankan
garment exports after the United States. Just over 60 percent of
garment exports go to the United States and 34 percent to the EU,
mainly the United Kingdom and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Assets to be Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Attorney General
Office (AGO) has decided to seize assets of former president
Soeharto on Thursday, Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the AGO will seize the "Granadi Building", one of
Soeharto's assets which is located in Kuningan District, South
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the AGO Yushar Yahya confirmed the planned move,
saying that the seizure of "Granadi Building" is a follow up made
by the AGO in settling the corruption cases which allegedly were
committed by Soeharto during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the seizure will be the first move made by the
AGO against the former strong man in its bid to bring the 79-year
old man to court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the South Jakarta District Court has endorsed seizure
by the AGO of the assets belonging to seven charity foundations
set up and chaired by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is suspected of abusing of power and authority during
his 32-years in power. He has been put under house arrest and has
undergone several investigations by prosecutors from the AGO.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to appear before the court before August 10.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Fuel Oil Supply Reaches Alarming Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's fuel oil supply has
reached an alarming level as the present supplies are only enough
for 18 days instead of 23 days, while the government seems to
allow import premium oil to help neutralize the fuel shortage in
the domestic market, an official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Marketing Manager of the state-owned oil and gas company
Pertamina, Harry Purnomo said that the shortage of fuel oil is due
to the damage in the country's Balongan oil refinery in West Java
province, adding that the refinery will begin normal operations by
July 26.
</P>
<P>
"The Pertamina has been facing difficulties in seeking oil
supplies from abroad as it has to compete with other buyers,
especially those from the U.S. west coast," Purnomo said, adding
that the company is thus trying to seek fuel oil from Malaysia,
Singapore and China.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Mines and Energy Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
said that the government will import premium oil to help
neutralize the fuel shortage.
</P>
<P>
"I have issued an instruction for the import of premium oil if
domestic supplies are still running short," Yudhoyono said.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the need to meet the people's demand and
not profit should be taken into account in importing the premium
oil, citing that Singapore could not supply Indonesia with premium
oil.
</P>
<P>
"The neighboring countries used to supply us during the time of
crisis at home. But it has run out of stock as it has shipped its
stock to American western and eastern coastal countries," he said,
adding that Kuwait also could not be expected to supply as the
country's main oil refinery has recently caught fire.
</P>
<P>
In another development, East Java and Bali provinces have been
running short of oil supplies over the past few days. Some gas
stations have run dry, while others have limited their sales to 10
liters per customer.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Capital Goods Imports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's capital goods imports
during January-April this year reached 1.21 billion U.S. dollars,
or an increase of 6.41 percent against the same period last year,
according to data issued Wednesday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bureau also recorded an increase in import for
raw materials by 20.94 percent to 7.02 billion U.S. dollars in the
first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The increase of import for capital goods and raw materials
during that period showed that the production activities in the
country have begun to recover," the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also disclosed that import for consumption goods
during January-April this year only reached 650.8 million U.S.
dollars or down 11.42 percent compared to the same period last
year which reached 734.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The decline of import for consumption goods was mainly due to
the descent in the import of food and drinks processed for
households by 58.83 percent to 194.5 million U.S. dollars from 472.
4 million U.S. dollars previously," the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Launch Campaign on Trade in Human Beings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government is
planning a campaign in newspapers of some foreign countries to
voice its determination to fight against the trafficking in human
beings, local media said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Believing that Chechen traffickers have been operating in human
beings in Central Asia, bringing illegal immigrants through
Ukraine to Western countries, including Belgium, the federal
government will put advertisements on newspapers in a number of
former Soviet republics in Central Asia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Through the advertisements, Belgium is expected to convey a
message to those who want to come to Western countries for new
opportunities that Belgium is not a land of plenty where a bright
future is waiting, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government also has a plan to send officials to
those countries to cooperate with the local authorities to fight
against the trafficking of human beings.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Belgium is negotiating "return home" deals with
several countries in order to send illegals back to their home
more easily.

<HEADLINE> China To Enter New Century With Less Than 1.3 Billion Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xihuan) -- China will succeed in controlling
its population below 1.3 billion as planed by the end of this year,
according to a report by population experts here today.
</P>
<P>
The report by a group of experts from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences and the State Family Planning Commission said
China's total population was 1.258 billion by the end of last
September.
</P>
<P>
The current population growth rate in China is below 1 percent,
one of the lowest in the world's developing countries, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
China's population has been well under control since the family-
planning policy was adopted in 1970s, and the country has been
experiencing an ideal period characterized by "low birthrate, low
death rate low growth rate" since late 1990s, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of China's population to the world's total
figure has decreased from previously one-fourth to one-fifth.
</P>
<P>
The latest prediction by the State Statistics Bureau shows that
China's population will surpass 1.3 billion in 2003 and reach its
peak of about 1.5 billion 40 years later, and then achieve a zero
population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China will continue its population
control policies as a long-term strategy.

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Istanbul will host the 23rd International Shoe Fashion
Fair on July 20-23, reported Anatolia News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fair, organized by Turkey Shoe Industrialists Association,
is expected to bring together 206 shoe firms from Turkey, Greece,
Italy, Germany, Belgium, Tunisia, Sweden and Croatia as well as
China's Taiwan.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Thomas Cook Group, the British tour giant, is
ready to proceed with large investments in Cyprus, the Financial
Mirror newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Simon Vincent, chief operating officer of Thomas Cook Group, has
openly invited hotel groups and land developers to discuss the
possibility of cooperating with his group in new projects in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Vincent said his group is making efforts to convert Cyprus into
a 12-month tourist destination and therefore it is planning to
launch winter flights to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Thomas Cook Group is the largest British tour operator in
North America and has one of the largest retailers of money
exchange because it holds the exclusive rights to a number of
international airports in this area.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- U.S. power concern InterGen and Turkish company Enka
will lay the foundation of a gas-generated power plant in
Adapazari, northwest of Turkey, on Wednesday, reported Anatolia
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The InterGen-Enka consortium will build and operate the plant
which has an installed capacity of 770 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The build-own-operate (BOO) project will be financed by both
domestic and foreign private capital.
</P>
<P>
InterGen and Enka have also taken on contracts to build two
other gas-fired power plants in Gebze and Izmir in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Trade exchanges between Cyprus and Russia are
characterized by an imbalance to the benefit of Russia, the
Financial Mirror newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' total imports from Russia in 1999 amounted to almost 59
million Cyprus pounds (118 million U.S. dollars) whereas total
exports reached 35.3 million pounds (70.6 million dollars), out of
which only 1.4 million pounds (2.8 million dollars) were domestic
exports.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' domestic exports to Russia gradually decreased every
year during the period of 1997 to 1999, mainly due to the
deteriorating economic situation that prevailed in Russia during
1998-1999, but also to the fierce competition that Cyprus has to
face from other countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the economic crisis in Russia, tourist arrivals
in Cyprus declined by 32 percent in 1999 as only 134,000 tourists
visited Cyprus compared to 197,500 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Next Few Hours Critical for Camp David Summit: Israeli Delegate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The coming few hours will be
critical for reaching an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at Camp
David in the United States, a senior Israeli delegate to the summit
told Israel Radio Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Haifa Mayor Amnon Mitzne, who was summoned early this week by
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to join in the Israeli delegation
at Camp David, said that certain "understandings" have been reached
at the summit, which was attended by Barak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which entered into the 10th day Wednesday, aimed to
resolve core issues between the two sides, such as the fate of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlement, borders,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
Mitzne, who was former Israel Defense Forces' Central Commander,
confirmed that marathon talks between Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are continuing in the hope of reaching an agreement
prior to Clinton's departure for Japan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has announced early Wednesday that he will postpone his
planned departure from Wednesday to Thursday for the G-8 economic
summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Mitzne admitted that although he is a formal delegate, he could
not participate in the core summit directly. So he could only get
limited accurate information because of the media blackout
exercised by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
However, Mitzne stressed that as far as he knows, Barak still
maintains his famous five "red lines," namely:
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem will remain united and under Israeli sovereignty;
</P>
<P>
There will be no return to the pre-June 1967 borders;
</P>
<P>
No foreign army will be stationed west of the Jordan River;
</P>
<P>
Israel does not agree to a blanket "right of return" for
Palestinians displaced in 1948 and 1967 wars;
</P>
<P>
And a majority of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip will remain under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Mitzne also revealed that he believed an agreement reached at
Camp David might not be "black and white", but a partial deal or an
agreement to return to another summit session.

<HEADLINE> Camp David Summit to Produce Dramatic Results: UAE Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Camp David summit
will end with dramatic results as U.S. President Bill Clinton is
urging for a deal between the Palestinians and Israel, said a
leading newspaper in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The tense Camp David negotiations today entered a decisive
stage following U.S. President Bill Clinton's urging that a deal be
reached between the Palestinians and Israelis before his departure
to Japan, to attend the summit of group of eight industrialized
states (G-8)," the Dubai-based Al Bayan newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that the whole Arab and Islamic world is waiting for
his decision, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat rejected making any
concession regarding Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat went further by warning that there would be no deal
unless an agreement is reached on guaranteeing Palestinians'
control of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli sources said that Prime Minister Ehud Barak
was still in Camp David and that he did not decide to go back to
Israel as some reports had said previously.
</P>
<P>
All indications affirm that Wednesday will witness a dramatic
development in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli reports said that Barak had reached accords on all major
issues such as borders, refugees, Jewish settlements, on condition
that the Palestinians accept Israel's total sovereignty over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Any incomplete deal will harm the peace process and will
threaten the security and stability of the whole Middle East
region," it added.

PHNOM PENH, July 19(Xinhua)--At least nine provinces are facing
threat by flooding over the last few days where some hundred
hectares of rice farms are reportedly destroyed, said government
officials.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The flooding has touched parts of Takeo, Kampot, Kompong speu,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Thai Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jingtao said here Wednesday that China and Thailand have always
enjoyed sound cooperative relations in the international and
regional affairs and have jointly made positive contributions to
the regional peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai in the
morning, Hu said that the continued healthy and stable development
of Sino-Thai relations is based on the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, which helps bring about a good momentum of mutual
trust, mutual benefit and mutual assistance.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the sound development of bilateral ties to
the importance the two countries' leaders have long attached to
and the firm foundation of the Chinese-Thai friendship, saying
that the friendship between the two peoples are like relatives and
brothers.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts by the two governments and peoples,
Hu said, the relations between China and Thailand have grown
steadily with fruitful cooperation in all fields since the
establishment of diplomatic relations 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Thai relations are very close," said the Chinese Vice-
president.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, Hu said, the bilateral friendly
relations based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence are
displaying "ever-increasing vitality".
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a successful
visit to Thailand, Hu said, adding that in the same year the two
countries issued a joint statement on Sino-Thai cooperation for
the 21st century which mapped out the blueprint for the
development of bilateral and all-directional cooperation in the
new century.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Thai Queen Sirikit's visit to China this fall, Hu
said, it will be another event in the history of bilateral
relations which will facilitate the furtherance of the friendly
relations and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chuan welcomed Hu's visit to Thailand which
occurs when the two countries are celebrating the 25th anniversary
of the establishment of diplomatic relations, noting that the
visit will play an important role in promoting bilateral friendly
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Besides the brotherly relations between the Chinese and Thai
peoples, the Thai prime minister said, the two governments have
always been making joint efforts in strengthening and promoting
bilateral cooperation in the fields of politics, economy and
academics.
</P>
<P>
The constructive and significant achievements of bilateral
cooperation have already benefited the two peoples and contributed
to the regional peace, stability and security, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and
people for their careful preparation for Queen Sirikit's visit.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the Taiwan issue, Hu pointed out the Chinese
government never changed its basic policies of peaceful
reunification and "One Country, Two Systems".
</P>
<P>
Chuan reiterated that Thailand will firmly stick to the "One
China" principle and will never try to establish any official ties
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Chuan hosted a grand reception party for Hu'
s visit.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his meeting with Chuan, Hu met two former Thai prime
ministers, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, also head of opposition New
Aspiration Party, and Banharn Silpa-archa, also head of coalition
Chart Thai Party.
</P>
<P>
Both of the former premiers promised that their parties will
stick to "One China" policy and expressed support for an early
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the good-neighborliness and mutually
beneficiary cooperation between the two countries conform to the
common aspirations of the international community and future
development of the international situation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Vice-President arrived here Tuesday evening for a
five-day official visit to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> 547 East Timorese Refugees Die in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- As many as 547 East Timorese
refugees have died due to several reasons in their camps in
Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara Province from September 1999 until
May 2000, a report reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Data collected by local officials showed that 547 East
Timorese refugees have died, until second week of May this year,"
Antara news agency quoted Governor of East Nusa Tenggara province,
Piet A Tallo as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But through a joint cooperation with the UNHCR ( United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), we have succeeded in
repatriating some 103,201 East Timorese refugees," Tallo added.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of local health office, Agus Berek confirmed the
figure of the death, adding that the refugees died mostly due to
malaria and respiratory disease.
</P>
<P>
"But several refugees died due to flood disaster in May in Belu
regency and for other accidents," he said.
</P>
<P>
Berek said that there are still 134,155 East Timorese refugees
in East Nusa Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
East Timor is a former Indonesia's province. It separated from
Indonesia through a U.N.-sponsored direct ballot on August last
year, after a 23-years integration with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
At least 284,000 East Timorese have fled to the neighboring
provinces to take shelter after the territory voted in favor of
independence which was then followed by mass riots involving pro-
integration and pro-independence groups. Hundreds of civilians
died during the riot which took place last year.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Takes High Toll on Teachers in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 860,000 children in
black Africa lost their teachers to AIDS in 1999, says a report
released by the U.N. Children's Fund (Unicef).
</P>
<P>
The Unicef report, released here Tuesday, adds that children
in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are most affected by these
losses.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, for example, every 95,000 primary school children
lost a teacher to the scourge last year, the report says, adding
that "for reasons not entirely clear, HIV is very high among
teachers and school administrators".
</P>
<P>
Although HIV/AIDS affects all sectors, the report says, its
most profound effects are felt in education.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that hard-won gains in school enrollment
and return on investments in education are now being eroded by the
disease in all over black Africa.
</P>
<P>
Schooling is disrupted when teachers are absent from class due
to illness, death or the need to care for ill family members, and
HIV-positive teachers are leaving schools in remote areas lacking
health care facilities or asking for posting in locations near
hospitals.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Shooting Suspect Boy Gives Himself up to Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A 13-year-old boy, suspected
of pulling the trigger in his school cafeteria, turned himself in
to police, a spokesman for local Sheriff's Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The boy, Josh Warnock, was taken into custody at the home of
his grandparents, six blocks from his middle School near Seattle,
where police said he fired one shot from a .22-caliber handgun
into the ceiling of the cafeteria, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
The boy spent Monday night "in woods" near his grandparents'
home 10 miles south of Seattle, sheriff's spokesman John Urquhart
said. His mother notified authorities that her son wanted to give
himself up to the police, so that the boy was arrested peacefully
at his grandparents' house.
</P>
<P>
Warnock was booked into a juvenile detention in Seattle for
investigation of assault with a firearm and reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
The motive for the shooting remained unclear, and the gun,
which authorities say belonged to the boy's grandfather, had not
yet been recovered, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Warnock may be charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.
The boy's initial court hearing was scheduled for Wednesday, and
prosecutors were requesting that he be held until then.

<P>
Pyongyang, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin arrived at Pyongyang Sunan airport Wednesday afternoon for
his two-day official visit to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) at the invitation of the Korean top leader Kim Jong
Il.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Worker's Party of the DPRK, and chairman of DPRK's National
Defense Commission, hosted a red-carpet, 21-gun ceremony to
welcome Putin, the first Russian president who visited DPRK, at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
Putin reviewed a guard of honor from the three forces in the
company of Chairman Kim and then left for downtown Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Putin's entourage, including Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Defense Minister Igor
Dmitriyevich Sergeyev, First Deputy Director of the Presidential
Office Sergei Prikhodko, were also present at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Alert Issued Against Excessive Algae in South Korean River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul Municipality Wednesday
issued an alert against excessive algae in the Han River, the
second largest river of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The municipality said the alert covers all parts of the Han
River between the eastern Kangdong Bridge and far western Haengju
Bridge, as the water contains standard-exceeding amounts of algae.
</P>
<P>
The water in the river was found to contain 25 mg of type A
chlorophyll per cubic meters of water and 2,027 cells of blue
algae per milliliter.
</P>
<P>
An alert is usually issued when the density of type A
chlorophyll exceeds 15 mg per cubic meters of water and the cells
of blue algae number 500 or more per milliliter.
</P>
<P>
The density of algae in the river has recently risen to those
high levels due to the unusually dry rainy season, said the
municipality.
</P>
<P>
The city administration plans to destroy the algae by spraying
loess and to keep water-purifying facilities under close watch.

<HEADLINE> Corrupt Swiss Companies to Lose Government Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Economics Minister Pascal
Couchepin has warned that Swiss companies guilty of corrupt
dealings abroad may lose the export risk guarantees (ERG) they
receive from the government, media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the development aid group, the Berne Declaration,
Couchepin welcomed the tighter anti-corruption law introduced on
May 1. His statement, made public on Tuesday, came in response to
an accusation by the Berne Declaration in June that officials in
the department were trying to block Indonesia's corruption probe
into Switzerland's dealings with the former Suharto regime.
</P>
<P>
The minister supported the arguments advanced by the department
responsible for issuing ERGs that exporters had to ensure they
complied with the law. At the same time, officials should withdraw
or withhold payments if companies were found to be involved in
corruption, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Couchepin insisted that export companies were
responsible for their own dealings, and it was not the job of his
ministry to make sure they stayed within the law.

<HEADLINE> China Further Enlivens Real Estate Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is planning
to further enliven the country's real estate markets and stimulate
individuals' spending on housing by providing subsidies for home
buyers.
</P>
<P>
To date, the institutions directly under the central organs and
departments have transferred housing construction funds totaling 2
billion yuan into housing subsidies for home buyers, according to
Xie Jiajin, director of Housing and Real Estate Department under
the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
She called on various Chinese cities to lose no time in
implementing the housing subsiding policy.
</P>
<P>
The official said China's real estate markets have seen an
overall rise in housing sales, with slight rise in housing price.
</P>
<P>
She held that individuals' home buying spree in some places has
boosted the development of real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
So far, individual home buyers have accounted for 88 percent of
the commodity house buyers in general, and the figure even rose as
high as 90 percent in the cities of Shanghai, Tianjin and
Changchun.
</P>
<P>
The economically affordable houses with low price and good
quality are warmly welcome in the real estate markets. And the mid-
size apartment with floor space ranging between 70 and 90 square
meters are most marketable, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The western regions of China also gained headway in developing
real estate markets, with investment and housing sales even
increasing faster than that in the eastern and central parts of
the country, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Only 13.3 percent university
students in Shanghai feel they have benefit from job-hunting
instruction classes, though 83 percent have taken such classes,
according to a recently conducted sample survey.
</P>
<P>
Job-hunting instruction classes offered by universities have
attracted intense attention from university students since they
need to seek job by themselves, today's Shanghai-based "Wenhui
Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
About half students surveyed think that the classes helps them
to reconsider job-seeking plans, and even master skills useful to
applying jobs.
</P>
<P>
But quite a lot think that they benefit from job information
rather than instruction from the classes.
</P>
<P>
The survey reveals that students wish to get interview
instruction, information about employers, vocation analysis, job-
market prediction and analysis, and psychological instruction.
</P>
<P>
About 86 percent students think it necessary for the
universities to offer psychological instruction for them. And 66
percent students ask for simulative interview, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> Most Retirees Get Pensions From Social Security Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Along with the ongoing reform of
social security system, more and more Chinese retirees are
receiving their pensions from social security bodies via post
offices or banks, instead of being paid by their former working
units.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this June, 18.56 million Chinese retirees, or 64
percent of the total, got their pensions from social security
departments, 4,887,000 people more or 15.8 percentage points
higher than the figures of the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the
social security bodies deposit the money into the bank account of
each of the retirees monthly, so as to ensure timely payment of
their pensions.
</P>
<P>
In some areas including Shanghai Municipality, in east China,
and Shaanxi Province, in the northwest, 100 percent of the
retirees obtain their pensions from their accounts at local banks
or post offices.
</P>
<P>
However, the percentage is quite low in some places, such as
Beijing, the national capital, 30.7 percent; underdeveloped
southwestern Guizhou Province, 30.6 percent; southern Hunan
Province, 21.7 percent; and northeastern Jilin Province, where
there are lots of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has urged these areas to reach the goal set by the
State Council--to distribute 100 percent of pensions by social
security departments.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As the negotiations at Camp David entered a critical stage
Tuesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak indicated to
confidants that he believes a deal is possible, despite reports
that the talks were collapsing over the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Most media speculation Tuesday focused on Jerusalem, with
reports claiming that the compromise being discussed would involve
Jerusalem's borders being expanded to bring settlements Ma'aleh
Adumim, Givat Ze'ev, and Gush Etzion under full Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Palestinians would gain control over Arab
neighborhoods in and around east Jerusalem. They would also get
control over the Muslim and Christian holy sites in the Old City,
and would be allowed to fly their flag over Al-Aqsa Mosque, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In withering talks described by one Israeli as a "war of
attrition," Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have reached a
range of understandings on a new, American-mediated package of
proposals on the core issues of borders, refugees and Jerusalem,
but they still await the approval of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is prepared to delay his planned
departure for the G-8 summit in Japan until Thursday morning in
order to give a final push toward an accord.
</P>
<P>
If Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak reach an
agreement, a framework deal outlining the principles of a final
peace treaty will be signed Thursday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Two early-election bills will be brought to Israel's Knesset
(Parliament) for a preliminary reading on August 2. In an
unexpected move, Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg Tuesday arranged for
action on this bill for the dissolution of the Knesset and early
elections in advance of the Knesset's summer recess.
</P>
<P>
Burg's move is surprising as Knesset regulations stipulate that
resumed action on such bills cannot be taken for at least six
months after it fails in a Knesset vote. However, Burg said Tuesday
that "there has been a real change in circumstances, and so there
is no need to wait six months before discussing dissolution
proposals."
</P>
<P>
Burg said that he notified Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp
David of his decision, and that Minister in Prime Minister's Office
Haim Ramon and other One Israel ruling coalition leaders do not
oppose the schedule.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Knesset (Parliament) Labor and Welfare Committee decided
Tuesday to bring a bill calling for an increase in state funding
for large families to its second and third readings.
</P>
<P>
The bill would raise the grant for each child from the fifth
onward to NIS 2,400 (about 587 U.S. dollars). A family with five
children would also receive an additional five points on the scale
of aid given to large families, which would translate into an
increase of NIS 850 (about 208 dollars) for each child.
</P>
<P>
Secular legislators vehemently blasted the bill, as the secular
families carry the major burden of the child allowance, but the
ultra-Orthodox families, which usually have more than five
children, just benefit from the state funding.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Qatar to Enhance Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Qatar have decided to
upgrade their present relations to the highest possible level, said
a joint communique issued here late Tuesday at the end of a two-day
visit to Iran by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two countries expressed their support for
investment cooperation, particularly in the private sector, and
stressed that promoting such cooperation would contribute to the
development of the Iranian-Qatari ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also underscored the need for cooperation among
all countries in the Persian Gulf to safeguard peace and security
in the region, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad, the first Qatari head of state that has visited
Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, spoke highly of President
Mohammad Khatami's policy to broaden relations with Gulf states,
and expressed hope that exchange of state visits between Gulf
countries would promote mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, Iran and Qatar also clarified their stands on
such issues as the Middle East peace, Iraq, Afghanistan and oil
price.
</P>
<P>
They expressed support for the Palestinian people, and condemned
the oppressive policies of Israel, which they described as being in
contravention of international diplomatic norms.
</P>
<P>
They condemned the further expansion of Jewish settlements on
the occupied territories, and voiced their opposition to any "
scheme" for transforming the "Islamic and Arab identity" of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two countries stressed the need to put an end to Israel's
occupation of all Palestinian territories, and underscored the
rights of Palestinians, including their rights for self-
determination and for establishing an independent government.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their full support for the stance of Syria
on the issue of Golan Heights that are currently under Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
They voiced their concern about Israel's production of weapons
of mass destruction, and called on all countries in the region to
abide by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two countries expressed their sympathy
with the Iraqi people, and stressed that the time has come for
lifting the U.N. sanctions on Iraq in keeping with the resolutions
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Afghanistan, the communique stressed the urgency
for returning peace and security to that country through dialogs
among different factions.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Qatar condemned all forms of terrorism, but called for
discriminating between terrorist groups and national resistance
movements that fight occupiers of their homelands, the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also reviewed the current situation of the oil
market, and underscored the need for all member states of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cooperate
in stabilizing oil market so that the interests of producers and
consumers are equally considered.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir started his visit on Monday accompanied by
several high-ranking officials, including Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad Bin Jabir Al-Thani and Minister of Finance, Economy and Trade
Yousef Hussein Kamal.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Sheikh Hamad held separate meetings with
President Khatami, the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as well as Iranian Defense
Minister Ali Shamkhani on broadening cooperation in various fields.
Several cooperation agreements were also signed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
After years of mutual suspicion caused by the 1979 Islamic
revolution, Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors have improved ties in
recent years, especially since President Khatami took office in
1997. Khatami paid landmark visits to Saudi Arabia and Qatar in
April 1999, which opened a new chapter for their ties.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Police Release Fireworks Staff After Probe in May Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch law enforcement
department released seven of the staff of the Enschede fireworks
company late on Tuesday, two months after police detained them for
a May 13 explosion that claimed 18 lives in the eastern Dutch town
of Enschede, the Belgium television reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seven people admitted having illegally sold fireworks to
individuals in the Netherlands and two of them declared that the
two directors of the fireworks firm were spotted irregularities
with the storage of the fireworks, according to television reports.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks company, located right in the middle of a
residential area of Enschede, exploded in the late afternoon of
May 13. A fire was suspected to have caused a smaller blast which
coaxed local residents to gather around the fireworks with the
belief that a fireworks show was on.
</P>
<P>
A second bigger explosion soon ensued only to kill and wound
onlookers and passers-by, burn cars and destroy houses close to
the fireworks company.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch and neighboring German firefighters had to come to
the rescue of Enschede residents.
</P>
<P>
A long list of people listed as missing puzzled the rescuers
who dug through the rubbles for days to try to find out anyone
still buried in the aftermath of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Some critics said that those listed as missing from the
explosion could well be illegal immigrants from elsewhere and they
had to move away in a fear that they would otherwise be spotted
with a national limelight turned on the town.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok went to inspect the disaster area
the next day after the explosion and the Dutch government has
released a special aid fund for the town.

LOS ANGELES, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The week-long heat wave has
been blamed for the deaths of 12 Texas residents, according to
reports reaching late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Heat-related deaths were reported in Houston, Dallas, Austin of
Texas state and Shreveport of Louisiana state. Several of the
victims were elderly shut-ins who had no air conditioners or could
not afford the electricity to keep the units running, officials
were quoted as saying.
</P>

Worth area, where 100 degree plus temperatures have lingered for a
week.
</P>
<P>
The emergency declaration also prohibits utility companies from
cutting off service to late-paying customers.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 towns and cities in Texas have water restrictions
because of drought. Residents in the north-central town of
Throckmorton are racing to get a 25-kilometer water pipeline in
place before the town's sole water supply dries up, likely in
about two months.
</P>
<P>
No relief was expected anytime soon from the heat wave which is
also baking states like Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Open New Nuclear Test Monitoring Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
announced in a Wednesday's press release that it will open a new
nuclear monitoring station on Friday at Kaitaia in the
Northernmost part of New Zealand's North Island.
</P>
<P>
The state-of-the-art station, which costs 400,000 U.S. dollars,
monitors radionuclide activity or the minute particles of
radioactive dust released into the atmosphere by nuclear
explosions.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the three monitoring stations operated by New
Zealand and will eventually have the ability to detect radioactive
gases and very longwave infrasound waves throughout the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The station, which was officially connected to the
international network in March, is part of the international
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty which will see more than 300
international monitoring stations set up world-wide to prevent
nuclear testing being performed in secret and in breach of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Four technologies (radionuclide, infrasound, seismic and
hydroacoustic) will be used in a chain of monitoring stations
around the world to detect explosions regardless of whether the
blasts are underground, under the sea or in the air.
</P>
<P>
The Kaitaia station is strategically important for the treaty
because it can monitor large parts of the Pacific Ocean, according
to the press release.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Imposes Sanctions on Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Fijian military personnel in
New Zealand are being sent home and a ban on sporting contacts
with Fiji has been extended, according to a New Zealand government
announcement.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark announced the measures
here Wednesday afternoon and promised there would be more to come
unless "there are firm signs of a return to democracy" in the
troubled island nation.
</P>
<P>
The measures came after the announcement Tuesday night of the
line-up of a new Fijian government, which contains a number of
supporters of coup leader George Speight.
</P>
<P>
"The ministerial line-up announced last night not only
contained Speight supporters, but also was clearly
unrepresentative of Fiji. It was to replace a government which did
have mandate derived from general elections held under the Fiji
constitution," the New Zealand prime minister said in the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
While that administration has yet to be sworn in, the further
delays in the formation of a government are yet more evidence that
Fiji will be "in a state of uncertainty" for some time to come,
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
The measures announced Wednesday will see 41 Fijian military
personnel currently with the New Zealand Army and Navy sent home
within a week, as well as the recall of two New Zealand defense
force personnel from Fiji.
</P>
<P>
And a ban on sporting contacts covering individuals, national
and club sides deemed to be representing Fiji has been extended to
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the New Zealand government announced that it was
recalling the New Zealand High Commissioner in Suva for
consultations in response to the inclusion of Speight supporters
in the new government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the government cut defense ties and halved
aid to Fiji,but held off on further measures till the new Fijian
government was revealed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Farmers Withdraw Offer of 180 farms for Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's commercial farmers have
withdrawn their offer of 180 farms for the country's resettlement
program in protest against the compulsory acquisition of farms by
the government without paying compensation, The Herald newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU) had offered the farms,
outside the 804 targeted for compulsory acquisition, for the
implementation of the fast-track approach to land reform and
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Of the 804 that had been earmarked for acquisition, 445 had
been contested, 71 had been appealed for while there was no
response from the owners of 59 others.
</P>
<P>
"We contested the compulsory acquisition of the 445 farms
because we do not believe farms can just be taken away without
paying compensation," CFU President Tim Henwood said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Launching the fast-track resettlement program last week to
start resettling landless blacks on 200 of 804 white-owned farms,
Vice-President Joseph Msika said the CFU had provided a summary
table of 180 farms with no names or an indication of their precise
location.
</P>
<P>
With the government having amended the constitution to allow
acquiring land without paying compensation, owners of the 804
farms can only appeal against the move.
</P>
<P>
Contesting the acquisition of the properties would not produce
the desired results as the government would still go ahead and
take the farms.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Military Begins to Investigate Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Defense Ministry
Wednesday started its probe into a scandal on excessive payments
for plane fuel over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae ordered an
investigation team to thoroughly probe into the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection ordered the
ministry early this month to retrieve some 120 billion won (about
100 million U.S. dollars) in excessive payments for oil that it
purchased from refineries in 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
The amount is about 45 percent of the 271 billion won (about
225.8 million dollars) that the ministry should have paid for the
gasoline and diesel for military use in 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the board said the ministry paid 261.4 billion won
(about 217.8 million dollars) for 931.4 million liters of gasoline
for airplanes in 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
The ministry paid 280.65 won (about 25 cents) per liter, 92.23
won (about eight cents) higher than the price Korean Air and other
airlines paid for their gasoline.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team will call in military procurement
officials in charge of purchasing plane fuel and diesel from five
domestic refineries for questioning, said the Defense Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Stun Brazil in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay stunned Brazil in a
soccer World Cup qualifier on Tuesday by beating the four-times
champions 2-1.
</P>
<P>
It was Brazil's second ever defeat in a World Cup qualifier --
their first bitter experience was against Bolivia in 1993 -- and
the win gave Paraguay nine points, while Brazil had only eight.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's first goal came in sixth minute from Carlos Paredes.
Substitute Jorge Campos scored a decisive goal in the 83rd minute,
nine minutes after Rivaldo's goal which seemed to save the world
champion's face.
</P>
<P>
Brazil made five changes to the team which drew 1-1 with
Uruguay last month. At the early stage of the game, Edmilson and
Roque Junior seemed comfortable at the heart of Brazil's
reorganized defense, but both were responsible for Paredes's
header.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 1-0 behind, Brazil continued to lack confidence and
were unable to find any rhythm. Brazil's situations even worsened
shortly before the break, when Cafu was dismissed for a second
yellow card offense after pole-axing Paredes.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Wanderley Luxemburgo, still searching for an
effective attacking formula to fill the gap left by Ronaldo who is
suffering from long-term knee injury, sent on Guilherme for Franca
at half-time but the change didn't work.
</P>
<P>
But the 1999 World Player Rivaldo stooped to head a Roberto
Carlos cross past Chilavert in the 74th minute.
</P>
<P>
Brazil were seemingly in a better position when Paraguay
substitute Victor Quintana was also sent off for a dangerous
tackle on Roberto Carlos in the 79th minute, having been on the
field for only 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, Campos drove the home fans crazy when he wrapped up
the victory by sweeping the ball past Brazilian goalkeeper Dida.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's result could lead to speculation about the future of
coach Luxemburgo.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will meet arch-rivals Argentina next week, and the four-
time world champions now are in desperate need of winning the game
to restore confidence in the team.

<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China encourages foreign banks to
set up branches in its central and western areas, said Dai
Xianglong, Governor of the People's Bank of China, at a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
To support economic development in the western part, Dai said,
PBOC will lower the requirements for foreign banks when they set
up branches in these area.
</P>
<P>
The governor also noted that the central bank is considering
setting up a bank with Chinese and foreign joint investment to
specially serve the development of the western part.
</P>
<P>
"If there is viable proposal, we will further study it," said
Dai.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied the possibility of setting up a solely state-
owned bank to this end, saying that China has already had State
Development Bank, which can set up a department to serve the
purpose.

<HEADLINE> China to Liberalize Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China will liberalize the interest
rates system in about three years, said Dai Xianglong, Governor
the People's Bank of China, at a press conference held today.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the country does plan to liberalize the interest
rates. So far, the interest rates for foreign currencies and those
for inter-bank lending have been opened.
</P>
<P>
The next move will be liberalizing the lending interest rates
in rural areas. "For the urban areas, we will first widen the
floating extent of loans."
</P>
<P>
As for the deposits, interest rates of wholesale deposits will
first be opened and other kinds of deposits will follow.
</P>
<P>
After liberalization of the interest rates, bank associations
will play a more important role in supervision and management. The
PBOC will strengthen management through refinancing and open
market.
</P>
<P>
"All these can be fulfilled in three years, and liberalization
of interest rates for deposits should be cautious," said Dai.

<HEADLINE> Sharp U.S. Economic Slowdown in 2001 Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 18 (Xinhua) -- An American business
membership and research organization, for the first time in
several years, Tuesday forecast a sharp decline in U.S. economic
growth beginning during the summer of next year.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a report that real GDP is expected
to fall to an annual rate of two percent by mid-2001, down from an
anticipated five percent and 4.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The organization's Leading Economic Indicators and various
measures of business profitability clearly point to further
Federal Reserve Board action and future economic weakness, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"While higher interest rates have forced down many stock
valuations, they have had little impact on the total liquidity
available in the marketplace," the report said. "The Federal
Reserve Board's efforts to contain the economy will tend to be
offset by this additional liquidity that is financing ventures
that would have been subject to Fed restraints in the past."
</P>
<P>
Although signs of slowing in the U.S. economy have become more
pronounced since the beginning of June, the Conference Board said,
further Fed interest rate hikes are still likely. The heightened
volatility in financial markets reflects an ambivalence about
whether the Fed can accomplish its anti-inflation objectives and
bring better balance to the economy without something harmful
happening.
</P>
<P>
According to the research organization, the current slowdown is
unlikely to convince the Fed to reverse policy. The U.S. economy
has tremendous forward momentum and even though current trends are
cautionary, the economy is likely to re-accelerate by year-end,
prompting another series of Fed interest rate increases.

"The president regrets that he will have to delay his departure

Clinton was originally scheduled to depart for Japan at 9:10 a.

industrialized countries in Okinawa on July 21-13.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that Clinton now will leave on Thursday and
arrive in Japan in time for the opening of the Okinawa summit on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drastic move will give Clinton an extra day to try to
broker a peace agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders have met in Camp David, a U.S. presidential
retreat in northern Maryland, since July 11 in a bid to break a
deadlock on final status issues between Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Despite Clinton's hectic mediation over the past eight days,
Israelis and Palestinians have so far failed to strike a deal due
to differences on the core final status issues, especially the
status of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Port Inefficiencies Cost Bangladesh 1.25 Billion Dollars Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Inefficiencies at Chittagong, the
largest port of Bangladesh, cost the country 1.25 billion U.S.
dollars per year, more than the net inflow of all foreign
assistance, The Daily Star reported here Wednesday, quoting
statistics of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Identifying the port situation as a big problem for Bangladesh,
Forrest Cookson, President of the AmCham, said that delays and
rising costs of using the port are now serious threats to the
country's garment trade with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that Bangladesh could gain 125 percent increase in
foreign exchange from garment exports if the port functions
smoothly," said Cookson.
</P>
<P>
Urging the Bangladeshi government to take immediate steps to
improve the port situation, the AmCham recommended for declaring
the port operations as essential services and stopping illegal
strikes.
</P>
<P>
The chamber also suggested keeping the port operative 24 hours
a day, seven days a week over the next six months and stopping the
illegal toll collection at the entry point of the port as well as
inside it.
</P>
<P>
Cookson urged the government to endorse the construction of the
proposed new container terminal to expand the country's capacity
of handling international trade.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Optimistic of Ending Maluku Conflicts Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
optimistic that the communal bloodshed in the country's Maluku and
North Maluku provinces could be ended soon, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to control the situation. Hopefully, within next
one and a half month, the situation (in Maluku and North Maluku)
could be controlled. But to block the entering of outsiders and
prevent gun smuggling will take time," Minister of Defense Juwono
Sudarsono was quoted Wednesday by the Kompas daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated the government's position of opposing
any foreign intervention in settling communal conflict in Maluku,
saying that the central government is effectively handling the
situation there.
</P>
<P>
Previously, some religious leaders in the two provinces have
asked the government to invite international forces to help
restore security and order in the conflict area.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Churches Association (PGI) voiced its demands
for foreign intervention in Maluku and North Maluku conflicts "for
the sake of humanity." It also asked the United Nations, the
United States and the European community to urge the Indonesian
government to end what it called "a humanitarian tragedy in Maluku
and North Maluku provinces soon."
</P>
<P>
But President Abdurrahman Wahid reaffirmed that the government
opposed possible military intervention from foreign countries to
put an end to the bloodshed in the provinces, saying that as a
sovereign state, Indonesia is fully responsible for its domestic
affairs and it had taken several measures to end the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Only when we are overwhelmed, maybe we will scream for
logistics and equipment. It is the maximum that we can accept,"
Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed a more than 18-
month communal bloodshed involving Muslims and Christians. The
bloodshed claimed thousands of lives and forced thousands of
others to take shelter in the neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
In its bid to stop the violence, the Indonesian government has
imposed a state of civil emergency and a curfew in the two
provinces last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition against foreign interventions in the
conflicts also came from Indonesian Police (Polri) and military (
TNI).
</P>
<P>
"We are very serious. You see several reactions from the two
warring camps (in Maluku). And we don't want to see the presence
of international troops (in Maluku) which in fact cannot solve the
problem, but create new problem. This is what we don't want (to
see)," spokesman of the TNI Rear Marshal Graito Usodo was quoted
as saying.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's national crime rate fell
five percent last year to 7,733 incidents for every 100,000 people,
the lowest level in the past two decades, Statistics Canada
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics based on police data also show an eighth
consecutive annual drop in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among Canada's 13 provinces and territories, Newfoundland had
the lowest rate of 5,921 crime incidents for every 100,000 people,
while Saskatchewan had the highest with 12,155 incidents reported
for every 100,000.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the country saw a drop of 7.2 percent in youth
crime in 1999, compared with the previous year, and a decline of
21 percent since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The national drop of youth crime was significantly contributed
by the country's three largest provinces, of which, Quebec
reported 7.8 percent off the previous year's figure, Ontario saw a
decline of 7.4 percent and British Columbia recorded a drop of 4.9
percent from the level one year ago.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Admits Troops Taking Sides in Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Defense Forces (TNI)
has admitted that certain troops have taken sides in the long-
running Christian-Muslim war in the Maluku islands, but it flatly
denies involvement as an institution.
</P>
<P>
TNI Spokesman Rear Air Marshall Graito Usodo said Tuesday that
some soldiers have become emotionally involved in the sectarian
conflicts, but he denied involvement of the military as an
institution in the conflicts, the Indonesian Observer daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Some members of the military have reacted emotionally, either
because of their family names or where they come from," he said. "
This is inevitable and we admit the existence of these cases."
</P>
<P>
Usodo said that it was not the defense forces' policy to favor
one side over the other.
</P>
<P>
The TNI spokesman regretted calls by some circles here for
foreign intervention in the sectarian conflicts in Maluku, adding
that the TNI believed the conflict could be settled by Indonesians
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono called on TNI
Commander Admiral Widodo to punish army troops involved in
disturbances on Ambon and to put an end to the religious violence.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono said the warring factions have become tired of the
continuing fighting and would like to patch up their troubles and
establish peace. However, it would be necessary that positive
actions should be taken against those troublemakers so that they
could no longer be able to fan the members of religious conflict.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to halt the bloodshed, the government imposed a
state of civil emergency last month. But the move did little to
diffuse fierce street battles over the weekend that left almost 30
people dead.
</P>
<P>
Usodo said the military intends to send another infantry
battalion to the region, which would boost troops numbers to more
than 11,000.
</P>
<P>
In a fresh conflict Tuesday, two people were shot and killed by
snipers in Ambon, capital of Maluku province.
</P>
<P>
About 3000 people have been killed in Maluku and North Maluku
provinces since the fighting began in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lanka's Tourism Earns Some 1 Billion U.S. Dollars in Six Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tourism sector has
earned 79 billion rupees (some 1 billion U.S. dollars) in foreign
exchange during the past six years, the official Daily News said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism and Civil Aviation Dharmasiri Senanayake
was quoted as saying that the industry had also generated 87,600
direct and indirect employment opportunities during this period.
</P>
<P>
He said that this was no small feat given the constraints the
government and industry had faced especially with the ongoing
conflict and the false propaganda carried out by the Tamil Tiger
rebels who are waging a 17-year separatist war in Sri Lanka's
north and east.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that timely and effective development
policies along with incentives provided by the state were
instrumental in promoting the tourism.
</P>
<P>
Senanayake's appointment as Chairman of the World Tourism
Organization's Executive Council is also considered to have
fortified the focus of world attention on Sri Lanka's tourism
potential.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, is blessed
with resource base for ecotourism as well as historic and cultural
sites. Tourism is the island country's fourth largest foreign
exchange earner, next to garment, foreign remittances and tea.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Sri Lanka's tourist arrivals hit an all-time high of
436,440, an increase of 14.5 percent over the previous year. The
arrival target for the year 2000 is 535,00 but arrival figures
during the first five months showed a slight decline of 1.5
percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
To increase tourist arrivals, the government is launching a 10
million dollars tourism campaign to sell and promote the country's
varied attractions in the world tourism market.

JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Dannish shuttler Peter Gade
Christensen wants to improve on his past performance in the Sanyo
Indonesia Open here.
</P>
<P>
He said competing in the Indonesia Open was difficult because
Indonesian players always did well at home.
</P>
<P>
"But I want to prove that I can go further, into the semifinals
and final this year. With a tough draw in the tournament, I just
want to take one step at a time," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gade, currently ranked No.1 in the world, is scheduled to face
Indonesian second-stringer Ronny Agustinus in the first round of
the tournament on Wednesday. The tournament will end on July 23.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that I'm going to win this year, as I have to
meet Ronny and it's a very hard first round. But I'm quite
satisfied with my performance in the last four years in the
tournament. I won the Malaysian Open last year so I think I can
also win here. Now I have a chance to become the first Dannish
player to win the tournament." he said.
</P>
<P>
Gade, who aims to win gold at the Olympics, sees world champion
Sun Jun of China as a tough rival in the tournament, besides the
local shuttlers, including the defending champion Taufik Hidayat
and second-seeded Hendrawan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mia Audina, who now competes for the Netherlands, said
she was confident of going into the event.
</P>
<P>
"I want to win the women's singles title here. I think the draw
is good enough for me." she said.
</P>

Mia said her toughest competition in the tournament would be
Camilla Martin of Denmark, who is currently ranked first in the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Index at the
Shanghai Stock Exchange hit a new record at 9:30 Wednesday morning,
crossing over the psychological threshold of 2,000 points.
</P>
<P>
Pushed by new listings, the market opened at 2,000:33 points,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line securities
information provider.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Xiangxue, an analyst with Homeway, said this is an
important landmark for China's stock market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that when the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges
were established in 1990, there were only eight firms listed on
the Shanghai bourse and five on Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Composite Index broke 1,000 points in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Today, there are more than 1,000 listed firms nationwide, and
the market capitalization, totaling 4.4089 trillion yuan,
accounted for 40 percent of China's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said the point of 2,000 is also an important psychological
point for investors, which will further boost investors'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, reminded that the markets are also faced
with many challenges such as the opening of a second board and the
opening-up of the markets.
</P>
<P>
They warned that investors should be aware of the shortcomings
of China's fledging stock markets, such as poor qualify of listed
firms and the complex structure of equity rights.

up 348.7 billion yuan from the beginning of this year, according
to an official source.
</P>
<P>
The increase was 231.8 billion yuan smaller than that of the
same period in 1999, said Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's
Bank of China, at a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that slowdown in household deposit growth was mainly
attributable to the interest rate cuts, the attractiveness of
government securities, the robust stock market and the recovery in
consumption as well as the application of income tax to interest
earnings and the introduction of the real depositor name
requirement.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, he said, the reasonable diversion of household
deposits has been a result of macroeconomic adjustment and is
conducive to expanding consumer and capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Financing from stock market totaled 82.3 billion yuan in the
first half of this year, representing an increase of 48 billion
yuan over the same period of 1999, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A working office on the selection
of reserved army officers has been opened at Sichuan University,
in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The working office was set up by the Chengdu Military Area
Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), following
the recent decision by the State Council and the Central Military
Commission to reform the way to foster army officers.
</P>
<P>
Army officers used to be graduates of military schools.
</P>
<P>
The office signed last week an agreement with the university on
the education of 60 reserve officers, who will join the PLA after
their graduation.
</P>
<P>
The 60 were selected from among 300 first- and second-year
students, mostly majoring in electronics, computer science and
mechanics, expertise which is badly needed by the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, each of the students will receive a
subsidy of 5,000 yuan a year. Besides the normal courses at the
school, they will be trained at barracks during vacations.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Chengdu Military Area Command will also cooperate with
other universities in the southwest. In the future, graduates of
senior middle schools could also be selected for the purpose,
according to PLA sources.

<P>
YANGON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar held an annual state
ceremony here Wednesday to pay tributes to fallen heroes who
sacrificed their lives in 1947 in the struggle for the country's
independence.
</P>
<P>
The 53rd Myanmar Martyrs' Day ceremony took place at the
Martyrs' Mausoleum in commemoration of the passing away of the

General Aung San was known as the founder of the Myanmar Armed
Forces and was also Chairman of the All Burma Students' Union in
the 1940s during the struggle for Myanmar's independence.

BELGRADE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav people have made
great progress in rebuilding their homeland after NATO ended its
air strikes against the nation one year ago, said a report from
the Yugoslav general headquarters of rebuilding homeland on
Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Rebound after New OPEC Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Crude Prices on major world markets
bounced back Tuesday after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries decided to shelf the plan of increasing oil production.
</P>
<P>
OPEC President Ali Rodriquez announced a new decision in
Caracas Tuesday to hold back the OPEC plan of putting extra 500,
000 barrels of oil per day on the market, which was announced just
one day ago.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the announcement, the crude price for August
delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange soared 1.37 U.S.
dollars to 33.20 dollars a barrel. Meanwhile, the oil price for
September delivery on the London market also jumped 1.19 dollars
to 29.75 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Quite differently, oil prices went down Monday when the Vienna-
based OPEC Secretariat released a statement on a possible increase
of oil production. The statement says that the OPEC countries
would produce additional 500,000 barrels a day if the OPEC oil
price remains higher than 28 dollars a barrel by July 28.
</P>
<P>
In response, the price of the so-called OPEC basket of seven
different crudes fell 1.38 dollars to 27.46 dollars a barrel from
last Friday's 28.84 dollars.
</P>
<P>
OPEC believes a price between 22-28 dollars a barrel as a
desirable and sustainable price for the market. Therefore, it
decided last March to fluctuate its production along with the
movement of the price band.
</P>
<P>
The oil price had been hanging continuously above 28 dollars a
barrel for 19 trading days from June 20 to last Friday, which
became a serious concern of the world market as well as of the
OPEC.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Came From Behind to Beat Venezuela Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay survived from a 1-0
down to beat Venezuela 3-1 on Tuesday in a dramatic and bad-
tempered World Cup qualifier which saw two players sent off.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, who have lost every away World Cup qualifier since
1965, stunned the two-time former world champions by taking a 23rd-
minute lead through Daniel Noriega.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay hit back seven minutes later with a goal by Spanish-
based striker Nicolas Olivera. A header by defender Dario
Rodriguez in the 53rd minute and a second goal by Olivera in
injury time lift Uruguay to a victory.
</P>
<P>
The win gave Uruguay 10 points from five games in the South
American World Cup group and left Venezuela with four.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay striker Dario Silva was sent off midway through the
second half for a horrible late challenge on Leopoldo Jimenez, who
was also dismissed for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The home side wasted an chance to go 1-0 ahead early in the game
when Alvaro Recoba missed a penalty.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelans silenced the 62,000 spectators when Gabriel
Urdaneta sent a bouncing ball into the Uruguay penalty and
Noriega slipped between three defenders to poke the ball into the
net.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 1-0 behind, Uruguay found their rhythm soon and put
the Venezuela goalkeeper under intense pressure.
</P>
<P>
They made it 1-all in the 30th minute with a goal from Gianni
Guigou in the penalty area, where Olivera controlled it on his
chest and then volleyed into the goal on the turn.

BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China, the

MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5.5 on the
Richter scale jolted the northwest Philippine province of Ilocos
Norte early Wednesday morning, the Philippine Institute of

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The planned swearing-in of Fiji's
new cabinet was deferred, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
(ABC) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was due to take place Wednesday morning, but the interim
prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, said President Ratu Josefa Iloilo,
was unwell and could not preside over the ceremony, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Qarase told cabinet ministers who arrived to take the oath that
the swearing-in had been deferred to a date to be fixed at a later
stage.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the ceremony's going-ahead arose Wednesday
morning when Fiji's coup leader George Speight said the president
had told him it had been called off. Speight had complained that
he was not given the opportunity to review the list of the
prospective ministers and that the cabinet does not include enough
members that are supportive of his May 19 coup.
</P>
<P>
While Speight implied the factors behind the postponement of
the swearing-in ceremony were political, but the official line was
that the president's ill-health was the reason for the delay.

<HEADLINE> No Intention to Attack Any Republics: Yugoslav Army Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav army (VJ) has no
intention to attack any republics (in Yugoslavia) because its
mission is to defend them instead of confronting its own people,
an army spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Svetozar Radisic told a press conference that the VJ's
mission is to safeguard Yugoslavia's sovereignty, territorial
integrity and constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
"The army has always been with the people, not against them and
will prevent civil war at any price," said Radisic.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the republic of Montenegro and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia have been rising after the Federal Assembly
voted on July 6 for constitutional changes that provide for direct
presidential elections for a four-year mandate, and would allow
the same candidate to stand twice.
</P>
<P>
Currently the president is elected by the chamber of republics
and chamber of citizens in the Federal Assembly for a non-
renewable four-year term.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional changes also allow a direct vote for members
of the chamber of republics. Currently the deputies of the chamber
of republics are voted by each republic's parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Montenegrin parliament rejected the constitutional changes
on the mid-night of July 7, saying that the changes will damage
the interests of the republic of Montenegro.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes WTO Ruling on Banana Row with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) believed
it won a victory Tuesday in banana trade war over the United
States after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that U.S.
sanctions worth 191 million U.S. dollars were imposed prematurely.
</P>
<P>
"It shows the United States cannot act as judge, jury and
executioners," EU trade spokesman Anthony Gooch said. "That's the
job of the WTO," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States effectively imposed 100 percent duties on EU
goods in March 1999, about six weeks before the WTO empowered it
to do so.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade officials said Monday that a WTO panel had backed
the EU, concluding that Washington had no right to act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
The WTO had several times ruled the EU's import policy violate
global trade regulations by favoring banana exporters of its
former colonies in the Caribbean, which is mostly marketed by U.S.
giants Chiquita and Dole Foods.
</P>
<P>
Gooch said the European Commission, the EU executive body,
would take no further action itself as a result of the new ruling,
but companies hit by sanctions before the WTO authorization were
now free to take the matter up in U.S. courts to claim damages.

<HEADLINE> China's Most Typical Ancient City Remains Unfrequented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGQIU (Henan province) July 19 (Xinhua) -- It is regarded as
China's most typical and one of the best preserved ancient cities,
but so far it has seen very few visitors.
</P>
<P>
This is Shangqiu, in central China's Henan Province, rebuilt in
the year 1511 and well preserved since then.
</P>
<P>
"It was built strictly in accordance with the traditional Eight
Diagrams Theory. The whole city is round on the outside and square
inside, meaning harmony and luck," said Shang Qixing, an expert on
traditional Chinese philosophy.
</P>
<P>
According to Shang, Shangqiu is unique in the world for still
keeping its city walls, moat, circumvallation, ancient streets and
old residential courtyards. There are also well-preserved ancient
sites, including the 4,000-year-old site of China's first
observatory.
</P>
<P>
"It is a typical traditional ancient Chinese city, with at
least 20 well preserved courtyards build hundreds of years ago, "
Shang said.
</P>
<P>
The city has altogether 93 streets -- 93 is a lucky number in
the Eight Diagrams Theory -- and all the streets are strictly
oriented in the south-north or east-west directions.
</P>
<P>
From the sky the city looks like a turtle shell, Shang said,
adding that this makes it convenient for the city to drain during
the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
However, one can see very few visitors either at its primitive
city gates or in its age-old alleys.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the lack of publicity, few people either in China
or abroad know such a marvelous ancient city," said Ma Jizhong, a
local official.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to introduce the ancient city to the world
and make it an attractive tourism site," he said.
</P>
<P>
The city currently has about 40,000 residents. The local
government has decided to move out most of the residents and all
the industrial facilities to restore the ancient city's original
look.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The tomb of China's first prime
minister of slave origin, Yi Yin, will be refitted to attract more
tourists, an official source said.
</P>
<P>
The city government of Shangqiu in central China's Henan
Province has decided to make the tomb an attractive tourism site.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, Yi Yin was born some 3,600 years
ago. Despite being of slave origin, he was intelligent and brave,
and finally appointed the prime minister of the Shang Dynasty (
21st-16th century BC).
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that Yi Yin was also the earliest decoctor of
herbal medicines, and died at the age of 100.
</P>
<P>
His tomb is located in Yucheng County, near Shangqiu, where
ancient cypresses still flourish and a temple to him is located.

<HEADLINE> Stamp-collecting Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Stamp-collecting is gaining
popularity in China, with the number of collectors reaching 18
million, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The widely practiced hobby has "not only promoted the expansion
of China's postal service but also contributed to socialist,
cultural and ethical progress of the country", a senior official
of the All-China Philatelic Federation ACPF) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day national congress of the federation, Luo
Shuzhen, president of ACPF, said that the congress plans to
further advance the stamp-collecting.

exchange views and their collections, the daily said.

<P>
Kund Mohr, president of the Federation of International
Philately, said in a letter to the congress that the enthusiasm

<HEADLINE> Int'l Companies Praised for Helping China's Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of university students
from this capital of southwestern China's Sichuan Province
launched on July 14 a tree-planting activity in the Aba Tibetan
and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
This is merely a small part of a major environmental program
titled the "Unilever Living Environment Initiative: Clean Water
and Green Mountains for China" recently initiated by Unilever, a
transnational supplier of daily commodities.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Unilever plans to spend 35 million yuan to
plant millions of trees across the country, mostly in desert areas,
in five years. This has made the company the largest foreign donor
for tree-planting in China.
</P>
<P>
"All the money must be used for planting trees," said Qu Geping,
a former director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration and now chairman of the Environmental and Resources
Protection Committee of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Qu, who is also president of the Chinese Environmental
Foundation (CEF), spoke highly of transnational companies'
donations for the country's environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Unilever's donation, Qu said it shows that some
foreign companies which have invested in China have begun seeing
the country as their own home. Their activities can be examples
for domestic enterprises and individuals, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qu also repeatedly mentioned the names of some other foreign
firms that have contributed to China's environmental programs.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people are grateful to those who have helped China
's environmental protection, and the Chinese government also
appreciates it very much, " he said.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, many foreign companies contacted
the Chinese authorities or the CEF after they learned about
Unilever's donations.
</P>
<P>
Qu urged local companies and individuals to pay greater
attention to environmental protection. "It is far from enough to
rely on government allocations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, local experts and scholars have urged the
promulgation of relevant laws encouraging companies and
individuals to make donations for environmental purposes. In some
foreign countries, enterprises or individuals enjoy favorable tax
policies if they donate to charitable programs, they noted.
</P>
<P>
With appropriate policies, domestic companies and individuals
may invest more money in environmental protection, Qu said.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's New Cabinet Not to Be Sworn In: Coup Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's coup leader George Speight
has claimed that the country's new cabinet will not be sworn in on
Wednesday as planned following an agreement with President Ratu
Josefa Iloilo to reconsider, Australian TV reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speight said he had not been given the opportunity to have an
input on the make-up of the new cabinet despite an earlier promise
from Iloilo that he would be included in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He told Australia's Channel Nine the president has agreed to
allow him to review the list of prospective ministers on Wednesday
and the planned swearing-in would not proceed.
</P>
<P>
"I have been in touch with the president through a high-ranking
chief of mine to express my disappointment in the fact that that
meeting has not taken place," Speight said.
</P>
<P>
"So in the next hour or so the president will be announcing a
cancellation of the swearing-in ceremony due for 11 a.m. this
morning to enable (us) to speak as he had directed on Monday,"
Speight said.
</P>
<P>
Speight said the proposed administration of 20 ministers and 12
assistant ministers contained only four people supportive of his
May 19 coup against the country's first ethnic Indian prime
minister, Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
It also contains one minister from the large Indian minority
and is headed by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, whom Speight had
bitterly opposed when he was appointed interim head of government
by the military earlier this month.

<P>
HANGZHOU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A former customs official in east
China's Zhejiang Province was sentenced to death recently for
taking bribes worth 1.8 million yuan (about 216,867 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou Intermediate Court handed down the death sentence

return for which he pocketed 40,000 US dollars and 150,000 RMB
yuan in bribes, two diamond rings and two diamond necklaces.
</P>
<P>
Geng's sentence was suspended in view of his cooperative
attitude in confessing his crimes. His illegal income and jewelry

<HEADLINE> BOT Helps Inner Mongolia with Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer), a
means of raising funds, has helped north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region out of the problem of capital shortage for
highway construction.
</P>
<P>
It enables public or private companies to invest and make
profits on local government resources during a set period of time.
This is the way Inner Mongolia has been able to raise some three
billion yuan (about 360 million U.S. dollars) every year for
highway construction. The local annual budget for this sector is
only about 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, the autonomous region has been able to
build 20,000 km of highways and 40,000 km of ordinary roads in
towns and villages at a cost of 9.7 billion yuan. Less than one
billion yuan came from the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yongliang, general manager of a local cashmere products
company, said his enterprise has invested more than 200 million
yuan in local highway construction since 1998. The annual profit
in this sector is around 30 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
En He, an economist at Inner Mongolia University, said BOT will
be a great help as well for the Western China development project.
</P>
<P>
BOT was first carried out in Turkey in 1984, and China started
using BOT in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Abnormal Climate May Continue in China: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese meteorologists predict
that the abnormal climate may linger in China in the coming years
as a result of the alternating effect of El Nino and La Nina.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of China's most authoritative news weekly
Outlook quoted Lu Juntian, an expert from the State Climatic
Center, as saying that "China is no earthly paradise in the global
climatic change."
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1997, north China suffered from scarce
rainfall and north, northeast and northwest China were plagued by
high temperatures. In 1998, devastating floods occurred in the
Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua rivers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, serious droughts hit north China, and summer storms
brought floods to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino phenomenon, which appears roughly every four years,
refers to the abnormal temperature rises in tropical waters which
normally lead to global anomalies in weather and climate.
</P>
<P>
La Nina is the name given to another weather phenomenon in
which unusually cool water from the Pacific Ocean affects weather
conditions nearly the world over.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the frequent and alternate occurrences of El Nino and
La Nina may continue to affect China in the future.

<HEADLINE> Liberian President Denounces Threat From U.S. Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
declared Wednesday that his country will not respond to threats
from any country, "no matter how big or how powerful" the country
is.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Monrovia, capital of Liberia, quoted
the president as saying that "we refuse to accept and (we) reject
efforts on the part of any nation to muffle this country".
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department delegation, led by Undersecretary for
Political Affairs Thomas Pickering, Monday met with Taylor in
Monrovia, and expressed displeasure over Liberia's alleged
negative role in the war in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Pickering said the U.S. was "satisfied with the evidence it has
seen" regarding Liberia's involvement in Sierra Leone and that if
Liberia failed to act positively it would mean "severe
consequences" for bilateral relations between Monrovia and
Washington, and possibly the entire international community.
</P>
<P>
"We want to ask those that purport to have evidence (of Liberia
's involvement in Sierra Leone) to please bring them forward...
They have told us they are satisfied with what evidence they have,
but 1 have said what you have is a diabolical 1ie," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration "will not condone anyone speaking
down at us as a government".
</P>
<P>
"We don't intend to challenge any world power, but we will
stand for what is right. We are entitled to fight for our rights
and we don't intend to surrender an inch of it," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Liberia was open to bilateral discussion on the
Sierra Leone crisis and welcomed the country's "traditional friend,
the U.S., in this process because Liberia respects the U.S. as a
great, powerful nation."
</P>
<P>
Taylor reiterated that Monrovia would not act unilaterally in
any form or shape on matters regarding Sierra Leone as requested
by some countries.
</P>
<P>
Taylor admitted having contacts with the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF), which, he said, were constructive and should
be used in a positive way as in the case of the release of over
500 U.N. personnel taken hostage by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He restated Liberia's condemnation of the rebels taking the U.N.
personnel hostage. "I have always told the RUF that next to God is
the United Nations. It is terribly stupid to take U.N. personnel
hostages," he added.

<HEADLINE> Fish Prices Drop Sharply in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Fish prices in Rwanda have gone
down by 61.5 percent since the ban on fishing products from East
African countries was lifted in May this year, the Rwanda News
Agency quoted an agricultural official as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the lift has boosted
the country's economy because the tax base has widened due to an
increase in fish importers.
</P>
<P>
Customers, on the other hand, have had low prices at the local
market due to increased supply.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda imposed a ban on fish from Uganda in March last year
following reports that fishermen used poison in fishing on Lake
Victoria, shared by the three East African countries -- Uganda,
Kenya and Tanzania.

<P>
The U.S. Army had been scheduled to try for a fourth straight
successful intercept of a target with its advanced Patriot PAC-3
missile on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, the test at White Sands Missile Test Range in New
Mexico State was postponed because of the problem. It might be
rescheduled later in the week, according to defense officials.
</P>
<P>
The PAC-3, an improved version of the Patriots used against
Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf War in 1991, tracked and
collided with Hera target rockets three times in a row prior to
Wednesday's delay.
</P>
<P>
Unlike a planned U.S. national missile defense (NMD) effort to
protect the whole country from long-range attack, the theater
program is designed to protect U.S. troops and bases from short-
and medium-range "theater" missiles.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. TMD and NMD, opposed by the
international community, will not only spark a new arms race, but
also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Budget Deficit Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Argentine budget deficit
amounted to 2.238 billion dollars during the first semester of the
year, 451.4 million less than those agreed with the International
Monetary Fund, said the authorities.
</P>
<P>
June was the month with the best budget results, because it
recorded an 874.4 million dollar surplus, a 700 million dollar
improvement compared to the same month of 1999, said the sources
in statements quoted Wednesday by the press.
</P>
<P>
The positive balance compensated the three billion dollar
deficit accumulated in the first five months of the year, and it
was attributed to a 685.5 million dollar increase in tax revenue
and a 14.4 million dollar reduction in expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The expenditures reduction was some 100 million dollars,
distributed among reduction in payments (36.8 million dollars),
real investment (34.9 million dollars), and goods and services (28
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The reduction was compensated by a 75.4 million dollar increase
in interest. The Argentine government expects to achieve this year
the goal of a 4.7 billion dollar deficit agreed with the IMF.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Relief Agencies Warn of Drought Crisis in Central, South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Humanitarian
agencies Wednesday warned that more than 60 million people in
central and south Asia are currently affected by a severe drought,
which has led to rapid deterioration of health conditions,
population displacement and loss of livestock and crops.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday in New York, the U.N. Inter-
Agency Standing Committee (IASC), bringing together the
organizations with children, refugees, health, food security,
agriculture and relief coordination, said that the drought was
particularly acute in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Iran and
India.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press about the IASC's response to the crisis, the
head of the U.N. World Food Program, Cathrine Bertini, said that a
Drought Task Force had been formed to coordinate relief efforts in
the region, and called on the international community to respond
as rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The IASC is also deploying several assessment missions to
evaluate the immediate needs and start planning aid interventions.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's warning follows a previous appeal launched by the U.
N. system in response to the drought crisis in the Middle East, of
which Syria and Jordan were the worst affected.

<HEADLINE> Birthday Pageant for Queen Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Queen Mother was honored
in a special 100th birthday pageant, attended by members of the
Royal Family, military regiments and scores of civilian
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Cheers went up as a carriage brought Her Majesty, escorted by
her eldest grandson Prince Charles, into the Horse Guards Parade
in London at 16:00 GMT.
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mother, who was colonel in chief of 19 British and
Commonwealth regiments, insisted on standing for the royal salute
of 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the colorful hour-long pageant, dubbed a "people'
s tribute," the Queen Mother thanked all those who had attended,
saying the parade had been "a great joy" to her.
</P>
<P>
The pageant featured an eclectic mix of marching bands,
carnival floats, choirs, race horses, the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra, camels, dancers, Aberdeen Angus bulls, sheep and
chickens -- at times taking on the atmosphere of a country show.
</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 participants and spectators were at the parade,
which was blessed with bright sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Princess Ann, Princess Margaret, the Duke of York and his two
daughters were among the royals watching the lively festival from
the royal box. But the Queen did not attend, apparently for fear
of taking attention away from her mother.
</P>
<P>
A controlled explosion took place in Ealing, west London, after
a coded warning, while police blew up a suspect bag in Whitehall
just hours before the pageant along the Horse Guards Parade.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they were in no doubt the earlier bomb scares
in London were an attempt to disrupt the day's pageant.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Struggles to Save Middle East Peace Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday continued his shuttle mediations between Israelis and
Palestinians, struggling to help them strike a deal at the final
hours of Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was originally scheduled to leave Wednesday
morning for a summit of industrialized countries in Japan, decided
to postpone his departure by one day for a last ditch effort to
broker a framework agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The president on Wednesday first held bilateral talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and then met with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The mediation continued amid widespread reports that Barak had
threatened to walk out of the peace talks because the Palestinians
were unwilling to make historic decisions for peace.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley confirmed Clinton had
received a letter from Barak but refused to comment its contents.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly said in the letter that "To my sorrow, I have
reached the conclusion that the Palestinian side is not conducting
negotiation in good faith and is not prepared to discuss in a
serious fashion achieving a permanent peace between us."
</P>
<P>
Barring last minute developments, he said, "the Palestinians
will witness the tragic consequences of squandering an opportunity.
"
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that Israeli delegates have received
orders to leave Camp David for home sometime Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources have refuted Israeli charges, saying that
the talks have come to a crisis because Israel insists on an
undivided sovereignty over Jerusalem, a city both sides claim to
be their capital.

<HEADLINE> Gore Vows to Increase 10,000 More Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Wednesday proposed to hire 10,000 new prosecutors in communities
nationwide in a bid to boost his image as "a law enforcement
president."
</P>
<P>
"We need more police. We need more crime-fighting prosecutors.
And then we have to give them all the tools and resources they
need to make even the toughest crime 'hot spots' safe and secure,"
Gore said in a speech to law enforcement personnel in Kansas City,
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1996 Bureau of Justice Statistics survey, one
quarter of prosecutor offices do not employ a full-time prosecutor
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic presidential candidate also proposed a fund to
target investments in crime "hot spots," communities where crimes
rates have gone up.
</P>
<P>
The two proposals are part of a previously announced package of
1.1 billion dollars in additional crime-fighting spending by the
federal government over 10 years. Gore said the money would come
from projected budget surpluses.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reiterates Firm Support for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday repeated its full
support for Cyprus and hoped for a permanent and viable solution
to the island's division problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece was always by the side of Cyprus, Greek President
Costis Stephanopoulos said in a statement on the 26th anniversary
of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which has been divided since
1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third
of the eastern Mediterranean island in the wake of a failed coup
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his dissatisfaction over little progress made on the
Cyprus issue, Stephanopoulos said that 26 years after the Turkish
invasion, the Cyprus problem remained unsolved and the illegality
of military occupation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that there would be a positive and viable solution to
the Cyprus problem based on the rules of international law and the
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said in a
message Wednesday that Greece continued to expect Turkey's
cooperation for a final settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Cyprus issue as being at a stage of possible
developments, Simitis said that Greece was moving ahead with
determination and optimism for its solution.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that it was in the interest of both
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots to show appropriate disposition
and to dare those necessary steps for a substantive breakthrough
in talks which had been dragging on for years.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the island, the Greek Cypriot side led President
Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot side led by Rauf Denktash
have held two rounds of the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks in New
York and Geneva respectively, and the third round of such talks,
which started in Geneva on July 5 and adjourned for 12 days from
July 12, will be resumed early in August.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which signed a joint defense pact with Nicosia, and
Cyprus have insisted that the island must be reunited in a
federation formula in line with the U.N. resolutions while Turkey
and northern Cyprus demand that a confederation formed by two
sovereign states be set up on the island.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Appeal Hearing Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Supreme Court
concluded Wednesday the first session in the appeal hearing
against the deprivation of immunity requested by former military
ruler and now lifelong senator Augusto Pinochet's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The judges of the highest Chilean court listened to the
background of the Pinochet case during the session that lasted
almost three hours.
</P>
<P>
No significant incidents were recorded during the first session
as a result of the stringent security measures implemented by the
authorities, and only a true shouting contest was heard between
demonstrators for and against the privileges deprivation, who were
evenly distributed on the two streets that flank the Supreme Court
building.
</P>
<P>
The top Chilean court resolved in a decision that only after
the allegations completion and before the resolution of the
situation of Pinochet's immunity, it will dictate whether the
defense petition about the medical examinations will be served.
</P>
<P>
It was the first of three days of hearings on whether former
strongman Augusto Pinochet can be tried on charges arising from
the thousands of deaths and disappearances blamed on his 17-year
rule.
</P>
<P>
The three-day hearing was called after the 84-year-old retired
general appealed against a June 5 ruling by the Santiago Court of
Appeals to strip him of the immunity he enjoys as a senator for
life.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet himself remained ensconced in his sprawling residence
in a Santiago suburb, and was not requested to attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, an 84-year-old retired general, ruled Chile with an
iron fist in 1973-1990 and was granted immunity because of his
seat in the senate, which was given him under a 1980 constitution.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, human rights lawyers will have their turn, and
Pinochet's legal team will wrap up the proceedings Friday. A date
for a verdict has not been set.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet returned to Chile in March after 503 days under arrest
in Britain, where he escaped extradition to Spain on the grounds
that he was too ill for a trial. A Spanish judge wanted to try him
on torture charges.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army not Responsible for Loss of Salaries for Peacekeepers: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for Defense
Stephen Kavuma told Parliament that the army is not responsible
for the loss of the 1.6 billion Uganda shillings (about 1 million
U.S. dollars) due to pay Ugandan peacekeepers in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Radio Uganda reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Army officer Dan Byakutaga reportedly obtained the money from
the army headquarters and was expected to fly to the DRC to pay
the country's peacekeepers there. But so far the army has not
established his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Members of Parliament (MPs) not to
exaggerate the issue as a committee has already been instituted to
look into the matter, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
It said the MPs rejected Kavuma's statement, urging the
commission of inquiry to probe mismanagement of public funds in
the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The MPs further sought the adjournment of the House until the
matter was addressed, said the radio report.
</P>
<P>
But Speaker of Parliament Francis Ayume ruled out the request,
saying it required a substantive motion acceptable to all parties.

prisoners from prisons countrywide and the commuting of death
sentences of 16 others to life imprisonment.

The act of President Yoweri Museveni and the government will

The UHRC has for the past three years advocated for better

JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
Youth Commission (NYC) said on Thursday that it has identified the
fight against HIV/AIDS, unemployment and skills development as
their key challenges.
</P>
<P>
NYC chairman Jabu Mbalula said in Pretoria that the NYC would
do its utmost to protect the rights and interests of young people
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function to introduce five new commissioners to
the media, Mbalula said he believed the previous commissioners had
laid a solid foundation and they had to build on it.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore look forward to providing South Africa with
three years of hard work," said Mbalula.
</P>
<P>
Essop Pahad, Minister in the Office of the Presidency,
introduced the five new commissioners to the media -- Mbalula, his
deputy Yoliswa Makhasi, Nketu Matima, Daniel van Vuuren and
Ngwanakopi Rasmushu.
</P>
<P>
The five are the first members of the new-look NYC which was
cut down from 19 commissioners to five in terms of the NYC

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency to Cooperate With Nairobi to Ease Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Center for
Human Settlement (Habitat) will help the city council of Kenya's
capital Nairobi to find out the exact amount of water used in the
industrial and public sectors in a bid to better manage the water
resources, a senior U.N. official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi city council currently can provide 70 percent of
the water demand, but if the current water crisis persists, the
council will be able to supply only 60 percent to 50 percent of
the demand.
</P>
<P>
The survey on the supply and demand of water resources will
enable the city council to make a reasonable policy for water
management, acting executive director Klaus Toepfer told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government and the Habitat have been discussing the
way to solve and further avoid the present water crisis, according
to Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based Habitat is not moving out of Nairobi because
the U.N. agency has chosen to deal with the problem instead of
shirking it, said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
Last February, the Habitat and the Kenyan government signed a
memorandum of understanding on management of water resources,
which suggests the privatization of water supply as a means to
improve the management of the resource.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Lesotho Mountain
Police Service members who participated in a mutiny in February
1997 were found guilty on Thursday in the Lesotho High Court of
sedition.
</P>
<P>
Judge Baptista Molai found that the junior officers seized
control of the police headquarters in Maseru and the Maseru
central police station, the South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
They dismissed the commissioner of police and his deputy and
replaced them with their own men.
</P>
<P>
Twenty three of the accused were found guilty of sedition and
two were convicted of contravening the Internal Security Act,
while three others were discharged.
</P>
<P>
All the accused were cleared of the main charge of high
treason on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove
there was any hostile intent among the accused to overthrow the
government or endanger the existence, independence or security of
the state.
</P>
<P>
The court, however, found that the accused found guilty had
participated in unlawful activities against police management over
a period of 10 days, from February 6 until when the mutiny was
crushed by the Lesotho Defense Force on February 16.
</P>
<P>
It was found that the guilty men were in a large group of
junior officers who barricaded themselves in the police
Headquarters and the Maseru central police station and other
police stations.
</P>
<P>
They were armed with rifles and chased away senior officers,"
dismissing" them from the service.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the mutiny, Second Lieutenant Phakiso Molise,
fled to South Africa where he sought political asylum through the
office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, but he was later
returned to Lesotho by South African authorities.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Speaker to Implement Parliamentary Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's newly elected Speaker of
Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa Thursday said he has set his
priorities on implementing reforms recommended by the
Parliamentary Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
Mnangagwa told the Zimbabwe News Agency that there are still a
number of reforms to be implemented for the Parliament to operate
more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
"I was part of the last Parliament when some of the reforms
were introduced, so I know where we left," he said. " I will go
through the reforms and implement them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said people should be allowed to interact more with the
legislative body when the reforms are implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament started to implement the recommendations by its
reform committee last year when it discarded the dress code for
officers inherited from the colonial era.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians have been complaining for some time for the
House to uphold the country's culture by phasing out 17th century
wigs and long robes worn by the Speaker's procession.
</P>
<P>
The other recommendations include the publication of the
Hansard, which is in the English language version only, in local
Shona and Ndebele languages.
</P>
<P>
Journalists would be allowed to attend parliamentary committee
meetings which are currently closed to them.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Reform Committee was established in 1997 and
held nationwide consultations to produce its report in May last
year.

<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
working out, and in some cases has already implemented, strategies
to boost agricultural productivity and diversification, President
Robert Mugabe said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To further increase small holder farmer productivity, various
measures, including increasing access to land, irrigation
development, input supply and the provision of tillage services
would be put in place and expanded, said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He told the first session of Zimbabwe's fifth Parliament that
the land resettlement program was being accelerated and it was
envisaged that at least five million hectares of land would be
acquired and developed for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's fiscal deficit has been revised upward to
five percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) because of the
effects of Cyclone Eline.
</P>
<P>
"When the Budget was presented in October last year, the fiscal
deficit was set at 3.8 percent of GDP," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in the past year the economy has been characterized by
high inflation and interest rates, low foreign currency reserves
and a high budget deficit, among other constraints.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zimbabwe Millennium Economic Recovery Program was
designed to remove the prime causes of inflation and to restore
macro-economic stability so as to create conditions essential for
economic growth and development.

JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amre Moussa on Thursday called for an international
conference on Africa's external debt crisis to solve this problem.

"(It) should deal with the fundamentals of the problem once and

he said in a speech at the University of Pretoria, according to a

"It has become clear to most observers that only a substantial
cancellation in the bulk of African debt can lead to real progress
in African economic performance," he said.

<P>
Moussa also urged African countries to work together with the
international community to overcome the challenges the continent
faces, saying failure to do this meant that all attempts to eschew
the fate of alienation would be futile.
</P>

Moussa arrived in South Africa on Wednesday to co-chair, with

</P>
<P>
He said since the launching of a new offensive against the ADF
in November last year, 282 rebels have been killed, 24 captured
alive, 58 surrendered and a total of 253 automatic rifles
recovered.
</P>
<P>
"If they can not use the President's amnesty and surrender, we
shall defeat them on the battle field," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has given an amnesty to all
rebel groups fighting the government. The Amnesty Act, which

<HEADLINE> Kenya Attracts 900,000 Visitors Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya attracted 900,000 foreign
visitors last year with its unique national parks and good hotels,
the East African Standard newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is not losing tourists to Central Africa because we are
not faced with the kind of land crisis currently facing Zimbabwe,"
Tourism, Trade and Industry Minister Nicholas Biwott was quoted as
saying here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million tourists will have visited Kenya by the
end of this year, he said during the inauguration of the board of
Kenya Tourist Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a total of 240 million shillings (
about 3.1 million U.S. dollars) has been set aside for the
promotion of tourist-related activities and the income from
tourism is expected to grow by 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has introduced the concept of mountain climbing,
sports and cultural entertainment to allure more visitors, Biwott
said, noting that the government would invest heavily towards
rehabilitation of the country's infrastructure, especially in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
He urged Kenyans to change their attitude and speak well of
their country abroad, noting that the country has some of the best
tourist facilities in the world.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the third foreign currency earner after coffee and
tea for Kenya. Wild animals like elephants, leopards and
hippopotamus have made the country a popular destination in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala, U.S. Sign Anti-Drug Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The governments of the United
States and Guatemala signed Wednesday a new agreement for their
joint war against drug trafficking and related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Guatemalan Foreign Minister
Guillermo Ruiz and U.S. Ambassador in Guatemala Prudence Bushnell,
as reported from Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
"Our governments (the United States and Guatemala) commit
themselves today to continue supporting the anti-drug programs,"
said the U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan Legislative Assembly approved in May a bill of
law that permits the entrance of equipment and a limited number of
U.S. military personnel for the war against drug trafficking in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States has intensified this year the anti-drug
cooperation with Guatemala, a country considered as a territory of
transit for the drugs targeted to the U.S. market, the most avid
for drugs in the world.
</P>
<P>
Cocaine seized in Guatemala this year amounted to three tons,
while it was 10 tons in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Fischer: European Federation, Decade-Long Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said that the building of The European Union into a more
tightly-knit European Federation should be put in a "decade
perspective."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to German media recently, Fischer said that the
widening of the EU, the strengthening of euro and the trend of
globalization call for such a federation, the German news agency
DPA reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Without a political union, which consists of a full parliament,
an executive branch and a "clear constitutional relationship," the
EU members would fall in "self-blockade" and a "deep crisis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he explained that the so-called European Federation is not
the United States of Europe, but a "union of nation-states, which
exercise part of their sovereignty in joint institutions" and "at
the same time with a strong role also for the nation-states."
</P>
<P>
Fischer stirred a strong reaction both at home and abroad two
months ago, when he called in a speech at Berlin's Humboldt
University for the establishment of a European Federation with a
two-chamber parliament and a directly-elected president.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Police repressed with rubber
bullets and tear gas sugar industry workers who demonstrated
Wednesday in front of the Savings Bank in the Argentine city of
Tucuman to demand credits.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that the incident that lasted 15 minutes
started when the demonstrators, led by Anibal Ibarra, general
secretary of the Sugar Industry Workers Federation, entered the
Independencia Plaza in the city. There were no victims.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief of the Tucuman province Alberto Alcaraz said that
they will not listen to the protests if projectiles are thrown
with slingshots, sticks are used to cause damage and car tires are
burned to disrupt the public order.
</P>
<P>
The workers denied having carried firearms to enter the plaza
to stage their demonstration against the government, and accused
police of setting up a trap, and that they expect to talk with the
provincial authorities.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton was
still mediating between Israelis and Palestinians in Camp David
although no agreement had been reached yet in the final hours of
the three-way summit, the White House said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The priority for the president right now is to continue to
work as hard as he can to make sure that every possible avenue
toward an agreement is explored," spokesman Joe Lockhart said to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"That is the work that's going on now and will continue until
he (Clinton) can make the judgment that there is no way to get
there," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Clinton had a series of
phone calls Wednesday afternoon to leaders in the Middle East to
give them some sense of on-going peace talks, Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Facing Challenge: OECD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said Wednesday that Mexico
faces the challenge of a strong sustainable growth in the long
term after the upcoming change of government.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's economic development will be favorable in the short
term, with an average annual expansion of 5 percent, said the OECD
in a report on the Latin American country, according to a report
reaching here from Paris.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Mexico's foreign trade was made last year
with the United States, its biggest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
The OECD, of which Mexico is one of its 29 members, said that
the Latin American country's finances are nearly balanced, its
inflation is diminishing, and its current account deficit is
moderate.
</P>
<P>
The OECD recommended a bigger tax revenue because "the relative
lack of tax income and the strong dependence on oil profits are
important obstacles for the development of essential public
programs."
</P>
<P>
The organization forecast a 4.5 to 5 percent growth for Mexico
this year and the next, and an inflation drop to 7.5 percent in
2000 if there are no rate of exchange unexpected shocks.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox, who will take office on
December 1, said his government will promote a 7 percent annual
growth and that it will try to expand the taxable mass by
promoting micro and small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Mexico (central bank) said that the country will
close 2000 with a 9.2 percent inflation that will reduce to 3
percent in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall In Second Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell in the
second straight session Wednesday as investors were disappointed
with lower-than-expected earnings reports from a number of the
tech companies.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 43.84 at 10,696.08,
extending its loss of 64.35 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 121.54 at 4,
055.63. The composite lost 97.50 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 11.78 at 1,481.96.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell as Commence One, an e-commerce software company,
and Veritas Software Corp., maker of data storage-management
software, reported separately that their second quarter losses
were greater than a year ago. The shares of the two Internet
companies fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
Investors also dumped Microsoft's shares after the software
giant reported later Tuesday that the company's earnings in the
second quarter were better than expected but sales in the quarter
were stagnant, about equal to the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The selloff in the tech sector spread to the whole market
despite the positive earnings report from Citigroup. The financial
company said that its earnings in the second quarter rose 23
percent over the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Investors' uncertainty about interest rates also had an effect
on the market before Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan makes
testimony before a Senate committee Thursday. Investors expected
Greenspan to tell the lawmakers about the slowdown in the U.S.
economy after six hikes in rates but they did not know whether the
slowdown will end the year-long cycle of monetary tightening.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.26 at 656.95 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 6.59 at 937.16. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 8.42 at 537.86.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,699 down, 1,114 up and 555
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 902.76 million shares from 905.33
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sprayed Defoliating Fungus in Ecuador: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Guayaquil College of Agronomist
Engineers said Wednesday that the United States has used spores of
the Fusarium oxysporum fungus in Ecuador in spite of the denial of
the two governments.
</P>
<P>
College president Roboan Gavilanes said that its members are
certain that this fungus has been used in the Ecuadoran Amazon
region.
</P>
<P>
Gavilanes said that this substance has been applied in the east
of Ecuador under the pretext of destroying coca plant cultivations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Guayaquil agronomist engineers are willing to
determine, together with the press, the site where the spores of
the fungus were applied, as an experimental dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
One of the characteristics of the fungus is to migrate easily
and that there will be no way to reduce the affected zones since,
according to the direction of the wind and the strength of the
lethal fungus, it could affect the agriculture sectors of the
Costa and Sierra of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The New Herald Miami newspaper said Monday that U.S.
technicians sprayed the Fusarium Oxysporum fungus spores in the
eastern Ecuadoran province of Sucumbios to eradicate coca cultives.
However, Ecuador and the United States denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that the use of that fungus would produce
serious damage to the environment and people because the
microtoxins produced by this agent are toxic, and so the Fusarium
oxysporum can be considered a biological weapon.

demand, originated in the competition for the oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Burundi's Major Rebel Group Committed to Rebuilding Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's major armed rebel
group said on Thursday it is committed to the restoration of peace
in Burundi, but fell short to state clearly whether they will sign
the rescheduled peace agreement on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye, leader of the National Council
for the Defense of Democracy -- Forces for the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD-FDD), said his movement wants to see peace arrive
in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the group will only stop the armed
struggle if there is full restoration of human rights and
democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ndayikengurukiye made these remarks at his maiden press
conference in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha where another
round of Burundi peace talks is being held under the mediation of
former South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He said he came to demonstrate that they want peace, adding
that they had a lot to contribute in the draft peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first time for the leader of the majority
Hutu rebel group to attend the talks since they started two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft accord, the Tutsi minority, which has dominated
Burundi's political and economic life since independence, will
have to hand over power to a democratically elected government
within three years.
</P>
<P>
Ndayikengurukiye reiterated that at present main concern of his
group is the immediate dismantling of the resettlement camps for
Hutus, which were set up by the Burundian government to cut them
off from anti-government rebels, and the release of all political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya has agreed to close the camps
by the end of this month, but many parties doubt his good faith.

ADDIS ABABA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has expressed its
hope to have Addis Ababa as the capital of a future African Union,
similar to the European Union, local Press Digest reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi raised the issue at the
end of the 36th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
held in Lome, Togo not long ago, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Presently, OAU's headquarters is in Addis Ababa, capital of
Ethiopia, which is also home to the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa, and the African offices of the
International Francophone Organization.
</P>
<P>
OAU spokesman Desmond Orjiako said last week that all African
countries had accepted the idea of establishing the African Union.
However, the act of the African Union would have to be ratified by
the parliaments of at least two-thirds of the 53 member states of
the OAU.
</P>
<P>
It was predicted that ratification of such a text could lead to
the disappearance of the OAU within one year.
</P>
