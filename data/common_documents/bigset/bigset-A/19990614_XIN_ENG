<HEADLINE> Vigilance Urged at Attempts to Foil Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Tayeb Abdul Rahim urged for vigilance at
attempts to foil the Palestinian statehood cause.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made in a keynote address Abdul Rahim delivered
on behalf of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the occasion
of commissioning the cadets of the "security, defense and
preventive security course."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the declaration of an independent
Palestinian state will be made by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Such attempts necessitate that we keep vigilant and cautious
to achieve our legitimate goals and establish the independent
state of Palestine with Holy Jerusalem as its capital," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are alien parties that are still plotting against our
Palestinian people, its institutions and symbols," said the
Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
However, "such plots will further our determination and
steadfastness to reach our aspired aim - to establish the
independent state of Palestine," Abdul Rahim said.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on the plots nor name the alien parties.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time Abdul Rahim spoke of the declaration of
the Palestinian statehood by the end of this year since Israel
held the general elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
In the address, he stressed the importance of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat for the Palestinian cause, saying that "he
was elected to set up the state."

AMMAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Bahrain Sunday stressed
the need to pressure Israel to join The Nuclear Non-Proliferation

Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a joint communique issued after two days

</P>
<P>
The two leaders called for the world community to help make
the region free of weapons of mass destruction and to bring
Israeli nuclear establishments under international inspection

</P>
<P>
The Jewish state has long been suspected by Arab countries of
developing its nuclear arsenal while still refusing to open its
nuclear facilities to international inspection.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, Abdullah and Sheikh Hamad also stressed the
need to continue Arab consultation and coordinations on regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini emir arrived in Jordan Saturday for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also stressed the comprehensiveness of the
Middle East peace process and called on Israel to resume
the peace talks "on all tracks."
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon
remained virtually deadlocked after the Israeli Likud Party

<HEADLINE> Iraq Terms Sanctions as "Form of Genocide" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi official said here on
Sunday the international trade embargo imposed on his country is
"another form of genocide."
</P>
<P>
The sanctions "are more destructive than the traditional wars
and the use of weapons of mass destruction," Sallam Khattab,
Director General of the Information Department of Iraq's Culture
and Information Ministry, told the Permanent Committee of the Arab
Information Ministers Council.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed the trade embargo
on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait, banning oil export,
Iraq's main revenue earner.
</P>
<P>
The embargo "constitutes a flagrant violation" of the
international human rights conventions and relevant international
treaties, said the Iraqi official.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian tragedy caused by the sanctions "is still kept
in the dark" due to the media blackout imposed by the United
States and its allies, and also through distortions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq "is unable to publicize the true picture of the calamity"
due to the destruction of its media installations by the U.S. and
Baghdad's voice "is therefore swamped by the clamor of distorted
information," he added.
</P>
<P>
Warplanes of the U.S. and its ally Britain, which patrol the
two no-fly zones in Iraq's north and south imposed after the 1991
Gulf War, have been bombing Iraqi military and civilian targets
since December.
</P>
<P>
Khattab called for defending Arab rights through media, urging
the Arab Information Ministers Council to launch a drive to secure
Iraq's cause and mirror the dreadful and tragic sufferings of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The permanent committee of the Arab council started the meeting
in the day to discuss issues related to joint Arab media action,
which will be referred to the council's meetings on Wednesday and
Thursday.

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed on Sunday to let NATO and
Russian generals try to resolve the standoff over the presence of
Russian troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Mike Hammer, a U.S. National Security Council spokesman, said
Clinton and Yeltsin agreed Russian and NATO generals should meet
to discuss the problem "military to military and general to
general."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reached the agreement in a long telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
There was no timetable on how long to give the generals to find
a solution, said Hammer, adding that Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to
talk about the situation again on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"What the president (Clinton) said is that we need to preserve
unity of command and the effectiveness of KFOR (Kosovo security
force) and we welcome and should work to resolve how Russia can
participate," Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed ways to get Russia involved in the
peace process "as quickly as possible" but did not talk about the
specifics of implementing Russian forces into the overall plan,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. is looking to have Russia's participation
in the peacekeeping and the deployment of Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
"We would welcome and would like to see a meaningful deployment
(of Russian troops) provided that it is within....the chain of
command that had been established," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia refused to put its troops under the NATO's command and
wants ot have a separate sector of Kosovo, however the alliance
rejected the demand.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A draft agreement was reached
this week for the South African Defense Ministry to purchase three
class 209 submarines from the German Submarine Consortium (GSC).
</P>
<P>
The purchase, which was announced by Defense Minister Joe
Modise here Sunday, would cost 4.5 billion rand (726 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The industrial participation benefits which will accrue to the
South African economy as a whole from this acquisition will amount
to 19 billion rand (3.06 billion dollars)," said Modise.
</P>
<P>
The deal was part of an arms acquisition program of about 30
billion rand (4.8 billion dollars) designed to upgrade the
equipment of the South African National Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
South African chief negotiator Jayendra Naidoo said it was
hoped a final agreement would be reached with the consortium by
the end of July.
</P>
<P>
This would come after the draft contract spelling out supplier
commitments and an affordability assessment conducted by the South
African Finance Ministry had been presented to a ministers'
committee headed by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The first submarine is set to be commissioned five years after
the final agreement, the second the following year and the third

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission of Ethiopia is now distributing 46,000
tons of relief food to places in short of food due to rain
failures during this year's small rainy season.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Sunday quoted Samuel Tumero, general
manager of the National Food Reserve Administration, as saying
that the administration has lent the stated amount of grains to
the commission for dispatch to the food needy.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the commission appealed donors for 358,950 tons of
emergency food grain aid from June to December, this year in order
to alleviate 4.6 million people who faced food shortage after
small rainy season from February to May failed.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said the grains would be apportioned among
the needy, adding that the administration has put aside an
additional 86,000 tons of grain from its reserve to be lent to the
commission to save time until donors and the commission purchase
the relief food.
</P>
<P>
He said the amount of food in store at the national food
reserve at present stands at 290,000 tons and the administration
is authorized to reserve 307,000 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian chief negotiator left here
on Sunday for Brussels, Belgium, for a new round of talks aimed at
reaching a trade agreement with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Foreign Minister for European Affairs Gamal Bayoumi
will discuss with EU officials the closure of the last three files
in a proposed Egyptian-EU partnership agreement, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The files are issues related to the trade of agricultural
products, rules of competition and rules of origin, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU began talks on the agreement more than three
years ago. The agreement would grant Egyptian products duty-free
access to EU markets, and require Egypt to phase out customs
duties on EU imports over a period of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the agreement have long been stalled over the
sensitive issue of the level of access to be granted to Egypt's
agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
But officials of the two sides have expressed optimism that the
agreement may be reached by the end of the month. Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said on Wednesday the agreement "will be
reached in the near future" when some technical problems are
solved and the two sides agree on its wording.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was offered "an exceptional amount of advantage" in the
talks, making both Egypt and the EU "comfortable for the
framework," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, acting vice president of the European Commission,
said on Monday during a visit in Cairo taht the agreement may be
reached by the end of June after "important further concessions
are made (by the EU) in the agricultural area."
</P>
<P>
Brittan said Egyptian officials appeared to be encouraged by
the concessions made by the EU at a meeting early this month. "I
understand that these improvements are regarded as very positive
by Egypt," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Egypt's largest trade partner, accounting for 638
million U.S. dollars of Egypt's exports and 3.6 billion dollars of
its imports in the first half of 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pollution levels in Zimbabwe have
reached alarming levels because people are not taking adequate
preventive measures, an environment officer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Environment 2000 Communications officer Brian Mutimbanyoka told
Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana that industry and smaller companies
were continuing to cause pollution of the cities and towns in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We have many small back door companies with improper ways of
disposing their waste which is causing pollution," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The officer said people were ignoring the importance of
disposing waste and this was costing councils a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
Motorists were playing a greeter role in the pollution of he
environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Environment and Management Bill, he said, would
possibly reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes a maximum line of 50,000 Zimbabwean dollars
(1,315 U.S. dollars) for first offenders or one year imprisonment
or both for non- compliance with the environment protection order.
</P>
<P>
For second or subsequent convictions, the offender would be
fined a maximum of 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars (13,150 U.S.
dollars) or serve four years in prison or both.

<HEADLINE> Empowerment of Consumers Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Consumers should be empowered to
determine economic policies for economic reforms to succeed, the
Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CCZ said in a statement that the situation where policies were
decided by a few was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"Under such conditions, economic structural reforms are bound
to fail. In most instances, monopolies determine price policies
and other policies without consulting consumers," CCZ said.
</P>
<P>
The consumer council sited lack of consultations with consumers
during the recent fuel price increase as a major blow to the
relationship between consumers and business people.
</P>
<P>
Last week the government announced that petrol prices had risen
by 27 percent while diesel rose by 32 percent. Other fuels also
rose by different percentages.
</P>
<P>
It said the business people should realize that they had a
social obligation to consult consumers when decisions that
affected them were made.
</P>
<P>
CCZ said business should find ways to solve their problems and
stop passing the burden on to the already struggling consumers.
</P>
<P>
It warned that consumers were likely to react violently if the
trend continued.

LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair believe that the deadlock over
Russian soldiers being at Pristina airport can be solved, Blair's
office said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Blair spoke twice by telephone on Sunday to discuss
the Kosovo situation, before and after Clinton had spoken by phone
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a spokesman for the British
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The president and the prime minister are both confident that
(British) General (Michael) Jackson and the head of the Russian
troops in Kosovo will resolve the situation," the spokesman was
quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Russian troops who moved into Kosovo ahead of NATO
over the weekend were refusing on Sunday to allow NATO
peacekeeping troops to enter Pristina airport.
</P>
<P>
Their action reportedly enraged one British commander, Army
Brigadier Adrian Freer, who shouted at the Russians at one
roadblock to get out of the way, but to no avail.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Welcomes Gaddafi's Role in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Sunday welcomed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's
role as a facilitator in the conflict of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC), South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward with joy and anticipation to the full re-entry
of Libya into the affairs of our continent and the world," Mandela
said at a luncheon hosted in honor of Gaddafi in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"We have already seen Libya take up its role as an important
actor on the African continent to help advance the peace process
in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is proud to acknowledge the coincidence between
its own position and the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) on the one hand, and that of Libya on the other.
</P>
<P>
"We share the view that peace in the DRC can only be achieved
through the withdrawal of all foreign forces and an inclusive
political process of Congolese groups."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said South Africa appreciated Libya's indication that
its own efforts in resolving the conflict would be coordinated
with those of SADC.
</P>
<P>
"This approach confounds those who suggest that Libya is less
than fully committed to multilateralism."
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who repeatedly referred to Gaddafi as "my brother
leader" throughout his speech, said the Libyan leader was involved
in the Congolese peace process as a facilitator of the SADC
process, "just as we were involved in the Lockerbie issue as
facilitators for the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He said, "In such ways we advance the ideals of multilateral
cooperation and discipline. And for that we thank our Brother
Leader and the Libyan people."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Gaddafi arrived at Cape Town International
Airport to an open arm embrace by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela brought Gaddafi to meet waiting journalists,
introducing him as "the big man."
</P>
<P>
"I have said that I would never desert my friends who were with
us when we were all alone," Mandela said, adding that those who
disapproved of his friendship with Gaddafi could "go jump in a
pool."
</P>
<P>
Mandela was obviously referring to the disapproval by the
United States of Pretoria's relations with such countries as
Libya, Cuba and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The South African visit is Gaddafi's first overseas tour since
sanctions against his country were suspended in April following
the resolution of the Lockerbie bombing impasse.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who is in South Africa for a three-day visit, will
attend the inauguration ceremony of Thabo Mbeki as the new state
president on Wednesday.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Libya have called for
the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in a communique released here Sunday at the
end of libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's two-day official visit to
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
It was observed that both Zambia and Libya share common views
on international and regional affairs and called for stronger
bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that the recent visit by Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba to Libya last month had greatly
contributed to strengthening the bilateral relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
It said Zambia and libya shared similar views on issues
bordering on international and regional relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries expressed the hope that the warm relations
existing between Zambia and Libya would continue to grow,
especially after the reciprocal visit by Libyan leader Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
It said the Libya leader had expressed appreciation to the
government of Zambia for the cooperation he had received during
his stay in Zambia, adding that Libya was committed to ensuring
that the existing relations were strengthened.

<TEXT>
<P>
Qaddafi was speaking at a luncheon hosted in his honor by South
African President Nelson Mandela, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
Qaddafi said this was why solutions to the conflicts in the
Great Lakes region had to be expedited, and added that he was
relying on Mandela to help solve these problems.
</P>
<P>
It was an historical moment to visit South Africa and a dream
come true to be at the Cape of Good Hope, and an honor to be the
last foreign head of state to be hosted by Mandela in South Africa
before he stepped down as president, Qaddafi said.
</P>
<P>
After his wide-ranging speech of well over 30 minutes, Qaddafi
bestowed the Libyan Decoration of Steadfastness on Mandela in
appreciation of his " unlimited courage and prolonged
steadfastness".
</P>
<P>
Mandela was not only a symbol to his own people, but also to
all those people who were persecuted and oppressed because of
their color, race or religion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the struggle against apartheid, Qaddafi said the
victory of the South African people over oppression was a victory
for all races, ethnic groups and religions throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech Mandela welcomed Qaddafi's role as a facilitator
in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward with joy and anticipation to the full re-entry
of Libya into the affairs of our continent and the world," Mandela
said at a luncheon hosted in honor of Qaddafi in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Leads in World Bribery List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news agency quoted a survey by a Berlin-based institute the
 Transparency International as saying that the prevalence of
corruption appears to deter the foreign investment in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kenya ranks fifth among 23 most bribery-taking countries in the
survey while Denmark is at the end of the list.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "1998 corruption perception index", says
that in 1996 and 1997, the World Bank and IMF set precedents in
delaying loans to Afghanistan, Kenya, Nigeria, Cambodia, Papua
New Guinea, Congo and Sudan over concerns that corruption was
diverting funds and subverting the purpose of the loans.
</P>
<P>
Contained in the 1999 London and New York based World Watch
Institute Index, the report added that many bribes taken by
officials in developing countries are given to companies based in
industrial countries, according to Transparency International.
</P>
<P>
It notes that corruption is also implicated in government moves
that harm the environment and violate human rights.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that one technique of fighting corruption
was to ensure government officials were paid well in order to
reduce the appeal for bribes.
</P>
<P>
"In Philippines Department of the Environment and Natural
Resources, low pay has contributed to rampant corruption among
logging concession administrators," the report cited.
</P>
<P>
Adoption and enforcement of anti-corruption laws, periodic
auditing of officials, and an independent judiciary are also
essential for curtailing corruption and increasing risks for
bribe takers, it recommended.
</P>
<P>
But it concluded by suggesting the passing of
freedom-of-information laws that give citizens access to most
government documents, as the most effective tool against
corruption.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Eight big powers'
finance ministers will meet on Monday in Cologne, Germany, to
start preparations for a summit on urgent political and economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers from Germany, Canada, the United States,
France, Britain, Italy, Japan and Russia are due to spend time
with World Bank President James Wolfensohn to take stock of the
situation in Kosovo, European Union (EU) sources said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Kosovo reconstruction will be priority for G-8
countries. The World Bank and European Commission, the EU's
executive branch, are jointly responsible for coordinating the
Kosovo reconstruction issue and aid to neighboring countries of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 summit is due to be held from June 18 to 20. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin said in Moscow on Sunday that he will join
the meeting only on the final day. He will meet U.S. president
Bill Clinton for improving Russia-U.S. relations after the NATO's
air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The summit discussions are expected to be dominated by Kosovo.
Usually, agenda of the G-8 summit focuses on world economic issues
in general. Some analysts said the Cologne summit is likely to be
yet another missed opportunity to tackle the deep problems exposed
by the globalized economy.

SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- For China, what counts most is to
win the game while goal difference is very much the second factor,
head coach Englishman Bobby Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Olympic side will start their second match of Asian
Group Seven second leg Olympic qualifiers here on Tuesday, under
pressure from the home fans who are crying out for a one-sided
victory.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, china's opponents on Tuesday, were given a convincing
6-0 drubbing by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPR
Korea) two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The home crowd, irritated by DPR Korean manager's remarks that
China are hardly impressive and no better than them, are demanding
more.
</P>
<P>
But Houghton won't predict or promise.
</P>
<P>
"You can't start the game saying you can score six goals. That
's not realistic," said the 52-year-old former Nottingham Forest
coach.
</P>
<P>
"You start every game trying to win it. It's foolish to
consider goal difference in the first place. You can't predicate
that. We have to do is just to plan to win every game. We're
trying to win tomorrow, we're trying to win Friday night."
</P>

China slipped four past Myanmar in their first leg match in
Hanoi two weeks ago, despite playing at a 10-man disadvantage.

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
honorary chairman of the Chinese Red Cross Society (CRCS), today
awarded Nightingale medals to three Chinese nurses -- Zeng Xiyuan,
Wang Guiying and Qin Lijun.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing attended the award presenting
conference sponsored by the CRSC and congratulated the winners on

the dedicated work of nurses throughout the nation.
</P>

He noted that 21 people from 12 countries, including the three

</P>
<P>
Li praised nurses and Red Cross organizations who have played
an exemplary humanitarian role in helping people in need,
especially those involved in natural disaster and accidents. He
cited the important role local Red Cross chapters at all levels
played in assisting Chinese flood victim during last summer's
serious flooding.
</P>
<P>
Li also noted the important role nurses played in returning
diplomats injured during last month's US-led NATO attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.

few months to recover from a backpain caused by workloads and
years-long traveling to visit his subjects in rural areas, the

<HEADLINE> France Regards Russian Entry into Kosovo as Political Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- France said on Monday that the
surprise entry of Russian troops into Kosovo was a political
action.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard told reporters that the
Pristina airport, which has been under the control of Russian
troops since Friday night, was not a strategically key place for
NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
Richard said that he does not believe the Russians had changed
their policy a few days after the Group of Eight foreign ministers
' meeting in Bonn, which decided on the Kosovo peace plan.
</P>
<P>
He expected NATO and Russia to reach agreement "very soon" on a
zone to be controlled by the Russians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The movement of French troops in Kosovo has been slowed down by
land mines and "a slow exchange of information with the Yugoslav
command" since last Saturday, according to Richard.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 1,200 out of a total 7,000 French troops due
to be deployed have entered Kosovo so far, and they will not get
to Mirovica, northern Kosovo, until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richard said that it will take a dozen days for all the French
troops to settle in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Rise 0.2 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Inventories at U.S. businesses
rose 0.2 percent in April while sales dropped 0.1 percent, the
Commerce Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Even with the modest increase last month, current inventory
levels are lean in relation to sales as confident U.S. consumers
continue spending freely.
</P>
<P>
The Department said April's decline in business sales was
small, as compared to a big 1.1 percent rise in March, But that
meant there were enough goods on shelves and backlots in April to
last just 1.36 months at current levels of demand -- a good sign
that U.S. manufacturers will have work to do in coming months,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
The April inventory increase, to a seasonally adjusted 1.1
trillion dollars, added to a 0.5 percent increase in March.
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers' inventories rose 0.2 percent and retailers'
inventories grew 0.7 percent in April. In the meantime,
manufacturers' stockpiles fell 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Retailers' sales increased 0.4 percent while demand from
wholesalers was unchanged. Sales by manufacturers dropped 0.4
percent.

<HEADLINE> China's English Coach Shrugs off Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Beleagued Chinese coach
Englishman Bobby Houghton said he would be the last person to know
what the soccer-crazy country are talking about him.
</P>
<P>
And that would be a better thing, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I don't know about it (criticism). I can't know,
I don't know. And I don't know because I don't want to know," the
52-year-old Englishman said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Houghton's under-23 Olympic side won all of their four games so
far and chalked up 12 goals against none. But their unglamorous
way of victory was widely criticised by the exacting domestic
media.
</P>
<P>
It would be very strange if the national manager didn't receive
any criticism, and that could mean people lost interest in the
team, Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
"It (criticism) becomes part of the job itself and it doesn't
concern me," he said.
</P>
<P>
In their latest Asian Group Seven Olympic qualifier, Houghton's
army needed 50 minutes to score the first of their three goals
against minnows Vietnam here last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Houghton has been blamed for being "excessively defensive" and"
too narrow-minded" since their first leg qualifiers in Hanoi two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Houghton refused to include the stylish, attacking midfielder
Zhang Xiaorui in his starting line-up for all of their four
matches including a 1-0 lackluster win over DPR Korea.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang is a good player," Houghton said. "But when we come to
pick a team, the only criterion is which team is most likely to
win the game. That's the only consideration. There is no other
consideration."
</P>
<P>
Houghton had earlier said the introduction of attacking-
obsessed Zhang would destroy the balance of the team.

<HEADLINE> United Nations Begins Daunting Tasking Under Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
begun what is widely seen as the monumental and daunting task of
implementing the peace plan for the devastated Yugoslav province,
U.N. officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The world body kicked off the work on Friday, one day after the
Security Council adopted a resolution on the Kosovo crisis, which
broke out in February last year after ethnic Albanians have been
fighting with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
Moving quickly after the Security Council's decision to
authorize an international civilian administration in Kosovo under
U.N. auspices, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered the
immediate dispatch of an advance team to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Team members from U.N. Headquarters in New York, as well as
those already in the region, would assemble in Skopje, capital of
Macedonia, and they are expected to travel throughout Yugoslavia,
including Kosovo, on May 16-27, a U.N. spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
The advance team will set up coordination with military
government personnel and other international actors and advise on
the implementation of the non-military tasks, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations is also spending
a forward logistics and communications team to begin planning for
the U.N. Mission.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian agencies were forging ahead with plans to bring
relief to hundreds of thousands of people who had been stranded in
grim conditions inside Kosovo since NATO air strikes began on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
Senior liaison officers from several U.N. agencies, including
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the U.N. World
Food Program (WFP) and the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), will
accompany personnel from the NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR), which is
being deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first U.N. convoy of 32 trucks has arrived in
Kosovo, carrying humanitarian daily rations, or Meals Ready to
Eat, bottled water, blankets, tents, plastic sheeting and hygienic
kits.
</P>
<P>
Two convoys a day will travel to Kosovo from Skopje -- the
logistical hub for the massive relief operations -- once security
is assured. The operation is part of the monumental task of
providing humanitarian aid to people living in desperate
conditions inside Kosovo and later to the more than 750,000
refugees eager to go home.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Face Flank Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China's coach Bobby Houghton said
here on Monday he will treat next opponents Myanmar the same way
as their Southeast Asian neighbors Vietnam in Tuesday's Olympic
qualifier.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Olympic side tore apart a thick Vietnamese defense
by attacking from both flanks for a 3-0 win in the Asian Group
Seven second leg match last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Houghton, the Englishman also at the helm of China's national
team, assumes Myanmar will revert to a total defense after a
disastrous 6-0 thrashing by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPR Korea) two days ago.
</P>
<P>
"They are quite optimistic in their game against (DPR) Korea,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar won their last game 2-1 over Vietnam in Hanoi two weeks
ago and lost only one goal to DPR Korea in the first leg matches.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps they thought they had the chance of winning that one,"
Houghton said. "From the 20th to 40th minute, they in fact had the
upper hands and looked like that they can score a goal.
</P>
<P>
"But they conceded two goals just before the half time, and
just as I said before, goals change matches fundamentally."
</P>
<P>
It'll be difficult to break through Myanmar in the middle
because they play so deep, so the Chinese eleven would go around
to the back of them, Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to announce the starting line-up for Tuesday's
match.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 14 (Xinhua) - The number of foreign-owned companies
in Britain jumped by 2,500, or 10 percent last year, according to
a leading business consultancy.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey of corporate ownership by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet
showed that 25,800 companies in Britain are owned by overseas
businesses, about a third of them based in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Much of last year's growth, however, was a result of German
companies increasing their holdings by 9.6 percent. German
businesses now own about 2,500 British units, putting them second
to the U.S. in overseas holdings.
</P>
<P>
Philip Mellor, senior analyst at Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, said the
advent of the euro had increased the incentive for overseas
companies to invest in Britain, the main financial services center
for the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this increase was in the financial service sector,"
he added.

poor quality and oversupplied grain varieties next year, such as
the spring wheat in northeast China, early long-grained rice in
south China and wheat in the areas south of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
State protected purchasine prices for related grain will be
lowered this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yaobang, Minister of Agriculture, said at a meeting held
recently that it is necessary to make appropriate readjustment as
China's storage for grain and cotton has become a financial burden
to some extent.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the country still faces grain supply pressure
from the long-term view and should never loosen up the grain
production.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged local agricultural departments to actively spread
the use of high-quality grain and cotton strains and accessory
planting technology.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the country will decrease the
acreage planted with early rice in south China and that with wheat
in the areas south of the Yangtze River. For spring wheat in
northeast China, the importance will be placed on improvement of
strains.
</P>
<P>
Chen also suggested the state-owned farms and grain and cotton
production bases to take a lead in the readjustment of grain
production mix, noting that they have better production conditions
and experience in grain strain improvement.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Emerges as New Form of Infrastructure (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Electronic commerce not only
offers a highly efficient trade mechanism, but is also a new type
of infrastructure, according to Michael Yap, chief executive
officer of the National Computer Board (NCB) of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Yap, recently named as on the 50 most
influential policy-makers in Asia, is currently visiting Shanghai
where he will address a forum on information technology.
</P>
<P>
"My topic will focus on the impact of E-commerce which will not
only reduce costs and expand markets, but will also spark
revolutionary changes is ways of doing business," said Yap.
</P>
<P>
He cited Dell Computer Co. as an excellent example. He noted
the Dell sells computers directly to consumers via the Internet
and thereby reduces overheads in terms of manpower, inventory and
retailing costs. The company also produces customized products.
</P>
<P>
Singaporean businesses can benefit greatly from E-commerce and
significantly restructure their operations, said Yap, adding that
"E-commerce will totally redefine some companies. Other companies
will be forced to consider their productivity potential without E-
commerce."
</P>
<P>
The goal of NCB's IT 2000 Plan is to transform Singapore in an
E-commerce center, with projections calling the country to handle
transactions worth over four billion dollars by the year 2003. (

<HEADLINE> Blair Rules out Possibility of Kosovo Partition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Monday dismissed any attempt to partition Kosovo, saying, "
there is no question of a defacto partition of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"There is no room in my mind at all for separate sectors that
fall outside the unified chain of command. I understand Russian
sensitivities," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made after about 200 Russian troops took NATO
by surprise over the weekend by taking control of the airport in
Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
The occupation fueled fears that Moscow might take control of
part of the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Moscow are still trying to reach agreement on
Moscow's demand that it have control of a zone in Kosovo. Russia
refused to let its troops in Kosovo serve under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
"I know there is a lot of focus on the 200 Russians who are
there -- I think it's probably more important to focus on the big
picture of NATO troops coming in and the Serbs carrying on
withdrawing," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister has repeatedly declared that NATO would not
allow a separated Kosovo. Britain used to be the hawkish
government in NATO countries on the question of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Indian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said today that stable, normal and friendly Sino-Indian
relations are not only in the fundamental interests of people of
the two countries but will also be conducive to promoting peace,
stability and development in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remark during talks with Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Indian relations have entered a process of
improvement and added that Singh's ongoing visit to China is an
important step in the process.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said the prerequisite for the
growth of Sino-Indian relations is that both countries do not
regard each other as a threat. He said that the development of
bilateral relations should be based on the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence initiated by the older generation of leaders
in the two nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that China and India have reached a common
understanding in this regard," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He described India as an important neighbor and said developing
good-neighborly relations of friendly cooperation with India is
one of China's basic national policies.
</P>
<P>
China and India both face the profound changes taking place in
the international situation. The two countries share a vast common
understanding of the need to safeguard the legitimate rights and
interests of developing countries and establishing a just and
reasonable international order in terms of both politics and
economics.
</P>
<P>
Singh reiterated that the Indian Government does not view China
as a threat. He said that the Indian Government's basic policy is
to develop good-neighborly relations of friendship with China.
</P>
<P>
He said Indian leaders and the government have high
expectations for the visit and hope that the process for improving
bilateral relations will continue.
</P>
<P>
Singh expressed hope that the two countries will strengthen
consultations and cooperation in regional and international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on international and
regional issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Official on Rumors Concerning Falun Gong Practitioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Falun Gong practitioners have been
advised to make a clear distinction between right and wrong in
order to avoid being used as pawns by unfriendly factions bent on
disrupting social stability in China.
</P>
<P>
 The remarks were made by an official in the Letters and Calls
Department in the general offices of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and the State Council. The official made
the remarks during a meeting with Falun Gong practitioners who
lodged complaints with the central authorities concerning rumors
circulating in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The rumors included claims that the public security
departments are preparing to crack down on Falun Gong
practitioners, officials practicing Falun Gong will be expelled
from their positions, and CPC and Chinese Communist Youth League
members engaged in related activities will also be expelled.
</P>
<P>
Another rumor claimed that China plans to request the
extradition of an unidentified individual by spending 500 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The rumors are completely baseless and were made to confuse
people," said the official. "The purpose for spreading the rumors
was to incite large gatherings, create chaos and disrupt social
stability."
</P>
<P>
He said most Falun Gong practitioners cited their disbelief in
and refrained from spreading the rumors. Numerous people, in fact,
exposed and refuted the rumors. However, a few blindly believed
the rumors and were cheated.
</P>
<P>
The official urged Falun Gong practitioners to be on guard
against the ulterior motives of the rumormongers and steadfastly
resist being used as tools to do harm to the interests of the
country and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that governments at all levels have never
prohibited physical fitness activities. The Chinese people are
totally free in selecting any form of exercises, adding that
different opinions are normal in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's attitude concerning physical fitness
activities was clearly delineated during an April 25 gathering of
Falun Gong practitioners outside the Zhongnanhai compound. "
Individuals can participate in various kinds of physical fitness
activities, with the exception of activities designed to spread
superstition or incite large gatherings to disturb social order
and disrupt social stability."
</P>
<P>
 He expressed confidence that the vast majority of Falun Gong
practitioners disbelieved the rumors and will continue to make
efforts to maintain normal social order.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can be done without a stable environment," he pointed
out, adding that consolidating a stable and unified political
situation and guaranteeing the smooth progress of China's reform,
opening and modernization drives are in line with the essential
interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed the hope that people will cherish the
current stable and unified political situation just as they
cherish their eyes. He called on them to extend great effort to
safeguard social stability, and promote reform, development and
revitalization of the Chinese nation.

<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Drugs charges against French cycling
chiefs Daniel Baal and Roger Legeay, relating to the 1998 Tour de
France doping scandal have been dropped, the French Cycling
Federaton (FFC) announced here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Baal is the president of the FFC and Legeay is the president of
the professional cycling league.
</P>
<P>
The charges were dropped according to the instruction of Judge
Patrick Kiel, who headed the inquiry started after former Festina
team masseur Willy Voet was found with a car load of drugs en
route to the 1998 Tour de France start.
</P>
<P>
Baal and Legeay were charged by Judge Keil in March and April
this year for allegedly encouraging and allowing the use of
performance-enhancing drugs within the-then number one team in
world. The court in Lille however requested on Monday that the
case be dropped because of lack of evidence against the two.
</P>
<P>
Eleven other people were also charged over the affair.
</P>
<P>
The injury which was later extended to include three other
teams Casino, La Francaise des Jeux and ONCE should be concluded
before the start of this year's Tour de France on July 3,
according to Judge Keil.

<HEADLINE> Japan Continues Winning Streak in Olympic Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan stamped their supremacy by
outpowering Nepal 5-0 here on Monday at the six-team Asian Group
Six football qualifying tournament for the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, China, blew a 2-0 lead and was leveled by Malaysia
at 2-2 in the day's other match.
</P>
<P>
"The next match against Malaysia is the toughest one to us in
the group," said Japan's French head coach Philippe Troussier.
</P>
<P>
Seeded Japan, including six players who took part in the last
World Youth Cup in Nigeria in April and finished runners-up to
Spain, turned the first half into a one-side match which saw Nepal
manage only one attempt.
</P>
<P>
Nozomi Hiroyama opened the scoring for Japan just one minute
into the match and then his teammates Shinji Ono and Tomoyuki
Hirase added two for the Japanese in the 17th and 44th minutes
respectively.
</P>
<P>
But resilient Nepal, though not stronger in teamwork and skills,
dug out what they could to attempt three times and only let
Japanese Kota Yoshihara fired home twice on the 60th and 85th
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, China, who was upset by Nepal 2-1 in the first match
on Saturday, came off a good start when Yiu Hok Man headed home
after catching a freekick from Chu Siu Kei one minutes into the
match.
</P>
<P>
Tam Wai Kwok added another by slamming home with a free-kick at
64 minutes. But then the hosts lost their rhythm when their
defenders, pressed by the attacking-minded Malaysians, was caught
up and conceded two goals.
</P>
<P>
All six teams play each other in a round-robin format before
the tournament moves to Tokyo this month for the second round.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Receive ADB Agriculture Loan in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is expected to
receive the first disbursement of a new loan of 600 million U.S.
dollars from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the
country's agricultural sector reform in October, Thai Agriculture
and Agricultural Cooperatives Pongpol Adireksarn confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
When attending a ministerial meeting held by the United
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional Office
for Asia and the Pacific, Pongpol said the fund was expected to
begin at the start of next fiscal year in October.
</P>
<P>
The loan, 300 million dollars each from Manila-based ADB and
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, will substantially
support restructuring of the agriculture sector in Thailand, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It will help the sector ensure more effective use of resources
and facilities, including water resources, water distribution
systems, post harvest management and product quality improvement,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
About 200 million dollars will be used to improve the quality
of Thai farm products, while the rest of 400 million dollars will
be for production restructuring, land zoning and research and
development projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between ADB and the Thai
government after the Thai minister's talks with ADB president in
Manila last week, users of irrigation facilities would have to pay
appropriate prices, the so-called water fee, except small-scaled
farmers and the poor.
</P>
<P>
The agreement prohibits the Thai authorities from paying
indirect subsidies to farmers, including selling utilizer to them
at prices lower than market levels, in a way to prevent the
government from competing with the private sector.

ADDIS ABABA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced here Monday that it would promote peace
education when commemorating the Day of the African Child in
Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme of the Day of the African Child is "peace
education" , according to an OAU press released issued here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Peace education will be the subject of intensive discussion
between invited school children from a number of selected
education institutions, and panelists from ministries of
education, labor and social affairs and Speaker of the House of
the Ethiopian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The press release said diplomats in Addis Ababa and other
dignitaries from various local and international organizations
will also participate in the discussion.
</P>
<P>
June 16 was named by the 26th session of the OAU summit in 1990

<HEADLINE> Cost Saving Boosts Multi-generational Canadian Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Cost-saving considerations are
bringing an increasing number of Canadians to live as multi-
generational families, the country's leading Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from the country's statistical office (Statscan)
, the paper said that the number of three-generational households
rose 39 percent in a decade, climbing from 150,000 in 1986 to 208,
000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This rate of increase is more than twice that of all family
households, it said.
</P>
<P>
Economic considerations constitute a major cause behind the
growing tendency. "The younger generation goes to school longer
and entry-level jobs don't pay enough; and on the other end, you
have seniors who may be living on a pension," said Ben Schlesinger,
a professor in the faculty of social work at the University of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"In scarce economic times, they live together to ease the
strain," he added.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the family extension largely to the
influence of high levels of immigration.
</P>
<P>
Roughly half of the three-generational households are those of
immigrants, most of whom were born in Asia, where it is more
common to live with extended family.
</P>
<P>
In a general picture, however, multi-generational homes are
still rare in Canada, accounting for only 3 percent of all
households, the newspaper said. But to live this way is just
becoming more popular as this type of cost-cutting arrangement
helps raise a family's standard of living, according to the
newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday expressed concern
over "inactivity of the NATO KFOR contingent towards armed units
of Kosovo Albanians."
</P>
<P>
"Both the (Russian) military and diplomats are concerned over
the situation in Kosovo where Kosovo militants of Albanian descent
have been entering Kosovo practically on the shoulders of the NATO
KFOR contingent," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted a Defense
Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation does not change in the near future, Russia
will be compelled to put forward an initiative to discuss this
problem in the U.N. Security Council," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Ensuring the disarmament of the so-called Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) is one of the main tasks of the KFOR determined by the
U.N. Security Council resolution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian media reports said that KLA militants are arriving from
abroad along with NATO KFOR contingents or returning from hiding
to Kosovo in a bid to bring Kosovo settlements under KLA control.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Albanian refugees who arrived simultaneously with
a German KFOR battalion have nearly lynched Kosovo border guards,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, KLA militants killed two Yugoslav servicemen, a
policeman and a local Serb civilian in the suburbs of Pristina,
capital of the Yugoslav province, Tass reported.

<HEADLINE> BMW May not Return to Defend Title for Le Mans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- BMW may not return to defend their
title next year after winning their first Le Mans 24 Hours race on
Sunday on only their second visit, BMW motorsports director
Gerhard Berger said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As BMW had decided to focus their resources almost exclusively
on a return to Formula One next season, Berger said that even an
impressive Le Mans victory would not guarantee the sports car
operation's survival.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue this program right away and will go to the
United States for races next week," said Berger, a former Formula
One racer. "Then over the next four to six weeks we're going to
discuss very carefully what will be our program outside of Formula
One.
</P>
<P>
"Sports cars is one choice but honestly we don't know yet what
our decision will be -- but the result of this race will not
affect that decision at all."
</P>
<P>
BMW road tested their new V10 Formula One engine for the first
time in April, which was part of their efforts to return to grand
prix racing next year.
</P>
<P>
BMW quit Formula One at the end of 1987 after supplying engines
for the Benetton team, with whom Berger spent a large part of his
racing career.
</P>
<P>
"The team did an unbelievable job," said Berger. "We were
pushing this project in the last few months and we tried very hard
to get the right people together. We will now have to wait and
see where we go from here," he added.

<HEADLINE> Estrada, Thai PM Vow Closer Economic Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine President Joseph
Estrada and visiting Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai cited
Monday the "economic synergy" of their two countries as the
partnership that will help the Philippines and Thailand carve
their niche in the globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
In separate speeches at the luncheon hosted by the
Philippines-Thailand Business Council, the two leaders said that
while they will strengthen economic cooperation, their respective
countries have also taken steps to make their economies more
investor-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders hailed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
forged between their business councils as the accord has given
them the tool to hack a path for their two countries to a secured
place in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The MOU aims to encourage further mutual investments between
the two economies.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said his pro-poor administration is building
on the gains of sound economic reforms by further fine-tuning
government policies to assure investors that their business and
money are safe in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Citing positive indicators that the economy is truly on the way
out of the Asian financial crisis such as export growth, declining
interest rates and a strengthening peso, Mr. Estrada said the
government is committed to add more dynamo to the economic takeoff
"to make the Philippines an ideal business destination."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Leekpai, for his part, underscored the urgent
need to realize fullest potential of the economic synergy between
Thailand and the Philippines, which are marking this year 50 years
of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He also commended President Estrada for instituting much-needed
reforms in the economy, enabling the Philippines to recover from
the crisis ahead of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Leekpai shared Mr. Estrada's view that the Asian financial
upheaval taught economists a very important lesson that "we cannot
survive alone in an increasingly independent world."
</P>
<P>
Like the Philippines, he said, Thailand is also in the process
of amending laws and declarations regarding the conduct of
businesses by foreigners to make the kingdom "an easier place to
do business with."
</P>
<P>
His country is also on the road to recovery, he added, pointing
out that the worse now seems to be over as the currency has
stabilized and interest rates have fallen steadily.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, our economic ties offer tremendous opportunities and
potentials for closer cooperation," the prime minister said,
stressing the need to remove obstacles like tariff and non-tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the crisis, the prime minister said Southeast Asia
remains one of the most dynamic economic regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was the Philippines' 12th trading partner in 1998,
accounting for 2.41 per cent of total trade with the world but
President Estrada said there is still room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
"We have to intensify efforts to expand our trade volumes. We
can accomplish this through more aggressive marketing programs and
initiatives that should include outbound and inbound trade and
investment missions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister arrived Manila on Sunday for a
three-day state visit to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the two leaders held a 35-minute meeting at
the Presidential Palace, discussing ways and means to intensify
bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, tourism,
human resource development, civil aviation and science and
technology.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia bars Entry of Diary Products From Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Monday
decided to ban the importation, distribution and sale in the
country of any meat, chicken eggs, chickens, feed and food
products from Belgium on the ground that those products carried
dioxin, a chemical hazardous to human health.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry's Director General for Drugs and Food
Monitoring (POM), Sampurno said the ban, which started from June
14, also applied to food products made in Germany, France and
Netherlands with meat, eggs and chicken from Belgium as
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
Research had shown that meat, chickens, eggs and feed from
Belgium have since January 19, 1999, been contaminated with
dioxin, a pesticide residue that can cause skin and eye
inflammation, and drug addiction, Sampurno said.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries such as Malaysia and China had forbidden the
importation of the Belgian poultry products from Belgium and other
European countries since early June because exposure to dioxin in
the long run could cause cancer, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said producers who have imported food products such as milk,
cheese and crackers from Europe, especially from Germany, France
and the Netherlands, are requested to hand the goods over to the
ministry which would examine them further for possible
contamination with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
POM branches throughout Indonesia would also conduct an
operation to take samples of imported food in all stores for the
same research.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would also issue dioxin-free certificates on food
and beverage products as well as imported fruits, Sampurno said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Blames India for Closing All Doors for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government Monday
blamed the Indian side of closing all doors for peace talks and
reiterated Pakistan's commitment to dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Foreign Office spokesman
Tariq Altaf said that the Indian side had "completely rejected"
any dialogue or peaceful process for solution of the latest crisis
facing the two countries in the disputed Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
Altaf noted that India was focusing on military solution of the
problem but Pakistan remained committed to dialogue for defusing
the situation along the Line of Control (LoC).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is for "peace making," while the Indian approach is
"war-mongering," Altaf told reporters at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the talks between Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz and his Indian counterpart Jaswant Singh in New Delhi
last Saturday, Altaf said that "India is absolutely not ready for
any dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"They have shut the door on dialogue but we do not want
diplomacy to fail because the cost of the failure of diplomacy is
huge," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Altaf, who accompanied Aziz to New Delhi, said that India gave
the Pakistani delegation a "frosty reception" and rejected "our
proposals totally stone-walling on the prospects on any talk at
all."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, during the talks, had proposed to India to halt air
actions on the LoC and stop artillery dual.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's proposals were to "defuse the situation but Indians
were not ready to give considerations to any of the suggestions,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Aziz went to New Delhi for talks with all sincerity
because Pakistan did not want to allow the situation to get out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan continued to hold that solution to the core issue of
Kashmir was central to establishing a durable peace in the region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Indian side was told during the talks that
the crisis in the Kargil sector on the LoC would continue to
surface as long as the two countries did not address the larger
dimension of the issue.

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here today that China is ready to work together with Ghana to
build a long-term, stable and cooperative Sino-Ghanaian
relationship geared to the next century.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation from the
National Democratic Congress (NDC) of Ghana led by NDC General
Secretary Huudu Yahaya.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
recalled his visit to Ghana early this year, saying that Sino-
Ghanaian friendly ties, fostered by the leaders of the two
countries over a long period, have been rooted in the hearts of
peoples of both countries.
</P>
<P>
It is the common aspiration of the two countries and peoples to
consolidate and develop Sino-Ghanaian traditional friendship and
boost bilateral friendly cooperation, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the CPC values its ties with the
political parties in African countries including the NDC and hopes
to increase the friendly cooperation with these parties on the
basis of independence, equality, mutual respect and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The present China tour by the delegation would surely increase
the mutual understanding and friendship between the CPC and NDC,
Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
Yahaya told Hu that he was much impressed by China's great
achievements in reform and opening up. The delegation is quite
inspired by China's rapid development, he said, adding that the
NDC hopes to reinforce its ties with CPC to further advance the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yahaya said that African countries and China are facing the
same task of development. The two sides should overcome the
geographic distance and strengthen cooperation to work for the
establishment of a new international order.
</P>
<P>
The NDC delegation is here on a visit at the invitation of the
CPC.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President: Pan-Arab Summit Inevitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
reiterated that a pan-Arab summit is "an inevitable necessity at
the present time in particular," the country's Middle East News
Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Egyptian reporters on his way back home Sunday
night from a two-day tour to Algeria and Morocco, Mubarak said the
situation and challenges facing the Arab nation "necessitate a
meeting among Arab leaders as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Arabs are talking about a summit aimed at coordinating and
forming a united position on peace talks with Israel's new
government under Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The moderate leader of Israel's Labor Party defeated hardline
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the May 17 elections. He has
pledged to push the talks with Palestinians forward and resume
negotiations with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said contacts and consultations which have already
taken place showed some Arab leaders have endorsed the idea. But
he did not mention who they are.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed the issue in detail with Moroccan King
Hassan II during his visit, adding that the king shared views with
him in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak dismissed as baseless that a possible pan-Arab summit
would be an alternative to a proposed five-way meeting among
Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"All Arab states need this pan-Arab summit at this particular
time to discuss an Arab stance and Arab causes, while coordination
among the five parties could be held at various levels," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and
the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) announced the
resumption of treasury fund allocations to east China's Jiangxi
Province today following a disruption due to the misuse of related
funds.
</P>
<P>
A recent MOF investigation revealed that a number of localities
in Jiangxi were defrauding the central government by establishing
projects in name only.
</P>
<P>
The investigation further revealed that some localities
diverted funds earmarked for special projects without central
government permission.
</P>
<P>
The MOF and SDPC halted allocations for various projects and
approval of new projects pending resolutions for related problems.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangxi provincial government attached great importance to
the issued and organized a special group to conduct an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Diverted funds have since been recovered and individuals
responsible for discrepancies have been subject to harsh
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The MOF and SDPC reviewed the provincial government report and
decided to resume treasury fund allocations, in addition to
resuming examinations and approvals for other projects.
</P>
<P>
The two agencies have instructed regions throughout the country
to learn a lesson from the Jiangxi cases and strengthen their
management and supervision of state funds.

</P>
<P>
He said the lack of violence in the run-up to and during the
polling day last Monday showed that the people of Indonesia had
realized that violence and unrest would not solve the problems
faced by the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is a clear indication that the majority of the people have
come to term with the fact that their duty is to elect a strong
and stable government that will lead Indonesia into the next
millennium," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said whatever the outcome, the new government would
be the one chosen by the people of Indonesia and therefore all
parties concerned would have to accept it.
</P>
<P>
On the republic's role in ASEAN, Syed Hamid said
post-elections Indonesia would continue its contribution in the
10-member grouping and that countries in the region, including
Indonesia, would continue to cooperate among themselves.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the future direction of bilateral relations
would remain cordial, cooperative and constructive.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia looks forward to continuing good relations with
Indonesia as this has always been our objective," he added.

per sq.m., down 287 yuan (35 US dollars) or 8.7 percent on the

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Petroleum Sector Promises Quick Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Newly-named managing director of the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Jackson
Gaius-Obaseki, promised at the weekend a regular supply of
petroleum products henceforth and a reform of the corporation
within four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Gaius-Obaseki made the promise against the background that
President Olusegun Obasanjo may have granted full autonomy to the
corporation, but with a proviso that the new management should
justify the status within three months, the Guardian newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hinting at the new autonomy in his talk with officials,
Gaius-Obaseki said: "The present government under the leadership
of Olusegun Obasanjo has given us the guarantee that you have the
right environment to prove yourself."
</P>
<P>
"There is no excuse anymore that we are being forced to do what
we will normally not have done, or what is not professional," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with officials of the corporation in Lagos area,
Gaius-Obaseki hinged prospects of regular fuel supplies on
continued importation of products by major marketers, importation
of fresh fuel cargoes by the Pipelines and Products Marketing
Company Limited (PPMC) and continued improvement in local refining
activities.
</P>
<P>
However, he didn't rule out possible hiccups that may result
from vandalization of pipeline or failure of equipment and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
He also unfolded a four-pronged strategy to reform the
petroleum corporation, namely the nurturing of professionalism and
competence among officials, optimal utilization of existing
equipment and facilities, elimination of areas of waste, and
fundamental corporate re-organization.
</P>
<P>
Gaius-Obaseki said President Obasanjo has given the management
three months to turn the corporation around.
</P>
<P>
"But I have told the president we do not need three months and
that within the first month, he will see a different and refocused
NNPC," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said in spite of the over-estimated national fuel
consumption level, the corporation "will at any point in time have
enough stock to meet the national demand."
</P>
<P>
The corporation has been under sharp criticism in periods
before the Obasanjo Administration for the severe shortage of
petroleum in the largest oil-producing country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Due to mismanagement and shortage of funds, many refineries
have run down over the recent years.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has to rely on imported oil now and high petroleum
price has posed a threat to its economy.

<HEADLINE> Heated Debate Expected Over Nigerian Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Senate is expected to have
a hot debate over President Olusegun Obasanjo's cabinet nominees
early this week, The Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opinions which are being expressed by senators with respect to
President Obasanjo's ministerial list are strong enough to suggest
that the list might be returned to the president, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the senators may request for the curriculum
vitae (CV) of the nominees.
</P>
<P>
Some of them may even ask the presidency to indicate the
portfolio being assigned to nominees. This is likely to be
rejected by other senators, some of whom have described it as an
"unnecessary demand."
</P>
<P>
Senators are preferring anonymity for now on the matter but
Senate Majority Whip Chief Roland Stephen Owie said screening of
nominees will be thorough and preferably open on the floor of the
Senate and under the eyes of the press and public.
</P>
<P>
He said President Obasanjo's anti-corruption campaign, being
laudable and one of the planks on which he (Obasanjo) sought
election, implies that the cabinet cannot admit person whose past
records cannot stand the test of purity and integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, according to him, would like to help the president
to fight corruption by approving only persons who can lead by
example.
</P>
<P>
"Obasanjo should be supported to fight corruption and be
transparent," Owie said. "We have to be sure that those who are
going to be members of the cabinet must be transparently honest. "
</P>
<P>
"They must be consistent in their political behavior from day
one. They must not have betrayed this nation at any point in
time," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mainland to Boost Economic Cooperation with Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese economic official said
here Monday that government departments and enterprises in the
mainland areas of China will continue to take effective measures
to support and boost economic cooperation with Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Macao has played an active and vital role in the cause of
reform and opening in the mainland areas of the motherland," said
Wang Hui, who is in charge of economic affairs related to Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macao at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Wang made these remarks at a seminar at the Macao Chamber of
Commerce while talking about investment policies in the mainland
and preparations for the Third China Fair for International
Investment and Trade to be held in east China's Xiamen city.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that trade between the mainland and Macao
reached 870 million U.S. dollars in 1998, an increase of 13.8
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, Macao business people had invested in 6,614
projects in the mainland, involving a total of 8.9 billion U.S.
dollars of contracted funds from Macao investors.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Wang noted that trade and investment between
the two areas decreased considerably during the first several
months of this year as a result of the adverse economic
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Along with Macao's upcoming return to the motherland on
December 20 this year, economic conditions in Macao will get
better, and sustained and rapid economic growth in the mainland
will ensure lasting prosperity in Macao, Wang Hui said.
</P>
<P>
Research institutions and enterprises on the mainland are
encouraged to step up technology transfer to Macao and start
appropriate projects on the basis of Macao's advantages in free
port, financing and information, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Macao business people are welcome to visit
the trade fair in Xiamen city and invest more in the mainland,
Wang said.

<P>
XI'AN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have been
excavating for the past 3 months at Shizuitou, a 6,000-year-old
site in the city of Baoji in Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Part of the site was damaged by the road construction in March
so the province immediately sent an archaeology team to protect a
2,300-sq.m. area.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have unearthed 104 ash pits, 13 tombs, a
porcelain kiln, two kitchen areas, and over 1,000 relics,
including New Stone Age tools, pottery, jade, and bone ornaments.
</P>
<P>
One archaeologist says that the relics date back to a long
period of Chinese history from the 6,000-year-old Yangshao Culture
to the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
They represent diverse cultural forms, the scholar says,
indicating that the area contains a wide range of ancient Chinese
culture and art.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 of the 104 ash pits were used as caches by ancient
tribes, demonstrating the site's importance as a storage area and
the site is expected to provide valuable clues for the study of
the area's history, development, and culture.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle May Coach Sporting Lisbon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Sacked England coach Glenn Hoddle
might return to the pitch as the manager of Portuguese side
Sporting Lisbon, according to local reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle's manager Dennis Roche told BBC's Five Live today that
Sporting Lisbon's club president Jose Roquette had approached
Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
Roche said he would discuss terms with the Portuguese club in
Lisbon on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Roquette was reported in the British press to have offered the
former England coach a two-year contract worth 600,000 pounds (968,
900 U.S. dollars), as well as a budget of 20 million pounds (32.30
million U.S. dollars) to recruit new players.
</P>
<P>
"He (Hoddle) is a man with the experience we want. We want to
bring in a good manager whose teams play the football that we want
at this club. He has a great football reputation," Roquette told
the Daily Mirror newspaper on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle, 41, was sacked as England coach in February after an
interview in which he claimed disabled people were paying for the
sins of an earlier life.
</P>
<P>
The former Tottenham Hotspur and England midfielder had coached
the national side for two and a half years before becoming the
first England manager to be sacked from the position since Sir Alf
Ramsey in 1974.
</P>
<P>
If Hoddle signs terms with Sporting Lisbon, he would follow in
the footsteps of fellow Britons Bobby Robson, John Toshack, Keith
Burkinshaw and Malcom Allison as coach of the Portuguese club.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Urges World Attention to Persistent Organic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Klaus Toepfer, has reminded
the world community of the risks from dioxin and other persistent
organic pollutants, known as POPs, to less developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the concern over dioxin-stained food in Europe,
Toepfer said here recently that "action to deal with
dioxin-contaminated food in Europe is necessary."
</P>
<P>
"But we should also be aware that dioxins in the ambient
environment are a danger to humans and other living species
throughout our planet, and global action is the best defense,"
Toepfer said in a new UNEP report on the releases of POPs like
dioxins and furans.
</P>
<P>
Dioxins and other POPs are particularly troubling because they
are passed from one generation to another in breast milk, Toepfer
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening the ability of developing countries to identify
and reduce sources of dioxins and furans is strategically
important to reducing ambient levels of dioxins in the air, water
and soil and so safeguarding public health and the environment
everywhere," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new UNEP report gives a snapshot of 15 national
inventories, mostly in Western Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
A legally binding international treaty is currently under
discussion to reduce or eliminate emissions of 12 specified POPs
including dioxins and furans, and to establish scientific criteria
and a procedure for adding POPs to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks on POPs will take place in Geneva,
Switzerland from September 6 to 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
An expert group meeting on adding POPs to the future treaty is
being held in Vienna, Austria from Monday to Friday.

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, lauded the
Sino-Zambian bilateral ties here today during his meeting with
Somon Mwila, deputy speaker of the Zambian National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since the two countries forged diplomatic
relations 35 years ago, the bilateral cooperation has advanced
consistently in various fields.
</P>
<P>
As Zambia is rich in mineral resources, the two countries can
further cooperate in the mining industry, Li said, adding that the
two sides should complete the ongoing projects in high quality.
</P>
<P>
Li also recalled the hospitality he received during his visit
to Zambia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mwila hailed the bilateral ties, saying that the Chinese
government has positively participated in the development of
Zambia by carrying out a variety of cooperative projects with his
country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his thanks for China's support and help to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Mwila also praised the great achievements China has scored in
the last 50 years since the People's Republic of China was founded.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Maintain Oil Price Through End of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is expected to maintain
the price of crude oil at 16.4 U.S. dollars a barrel at least
until the end of 1999, a senior official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the price can be maintained until the end of the
year," Mine and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said after
meeting with President B.J. Habibie to report on the latest
developments in the price of oil and its supply in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The world oil price, including oil produced by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has
increased after most OPEC members obeyed the production quota set
by the organization recently, valid until the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
To date, the level of member obedience has reached 88 percent,
Kuntoro said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC has set the production quota for OPEC member countries
including Indonesia at 22.97 million barrels per day. With the
world's oil production reaching 74 to 75 million barrels per day,
OPEC's share in world production amounts to some 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian minister said the increase in the world oil
price is also caused by the closure of many oil fields including
those located in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Specialists Say China Needs Specific Wine Production Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Specialists say that China needs a
specific wine production technical code and regulations for the
naming of the place of origin if Chinese wines are to gain any
status on the global wine market, according to Science and
Technology Daily.
</P>
<P>
Without the identity cards, the quality and production
standards of Chinese wine will never be completely recognized
internationally, it says, and because of a lack of them wine
exports meet with severe restrictions. Annual wine exports have
been only 3,000-4,000 tons in recent years, less than 2 percent of
the total output.
</P>
<P>
Chinese wine can not label wine types, date of production,
brand, and other indicators of quality because of lack of
management regulations in grape-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
There are 6-7 million tons of wine sold on the world market
annually, but China accounts for less than 0.1 percent, but annual
imports amounted to nearly 50,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Winemaking Industry Association said that
the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision has started
drafting regulations on naming places of origin.

<HEADLINE> 5,200 Arsenic Victims in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- There are 5,200 arsenic victims in
Bangladesh, according to the latest figure up to May this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure might increase after the results begin to come from
the second phase of the urgent field-level survey now being
conducted, Health and Family Welfare Minister Salahuddin Yusuf
said while replying to a question in this regard in the parliament
on Sunday, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under several projects to treat the victims in every village of
arsenic-prone area, one team is working for the treatment of
arsenic victims in each village in the several contaminated areas
while another team in each village there is working to identify
the patients affected by the arsenic contamination, Yusuf told the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The teams conduct survey in every household of the village, and
the results have been preserved in data-based computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
The arsenic affected people were treated and further treatment
is still being given, he stated, adding that to follow up the
patients, the lists of victims have been supplied to the health
and family planning officials.
</P>
<P>
He also listed other steps taken to treat the victims and
ensure arsenic-free water to the arsenic-prone areas, which
include training of 2,280 field level health workers.
</P>
<P>
Besides the government efforts, the World Bank has assured to
give 0.4 million U.S. dollars to impart training for treating the
arsenic patients, he said.
</P>
<P>
The arsenic-free project and the training program would be
implemented by Bangladesh Medical Association, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic, a deadly mineral in water, has so far attacked as many
as 59 out of the 64 districts of this South Asian country, which
suffers most seriously from arsenic pollution in the world. The
government has already taken a series of measures to control
arsenic contamination.

<HEADLINE> Labor EU Election Collapse Boosts Tories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Labor suffered a serious slump in
the European election held Thursday, its worst result for 16 years
and its first big electoral setback since it came to power,
reports said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
As Labor failed to get out its vote, in a record low turnout
for a national election, the Tories cashed in to overtake Labor as
the biggest British party in the Strasbourg Parliament.
</P>
<P>
After all the results in England and Wales were declared, the
Conservatives won 34 seats, Labor 26 and the Liberal Democrats 9.
</P>
<P>
In the appalling result for Labor, its share of vote collapsed
from its high mark of 44 percent in the general election in 1997
to 28 percent, while the Conservatives were up from 32 percent to
38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Evidence of a strong strain of Euro-scepticism in the
electorate was underlined by a powerful performance by the UK
Independence party, which had secured three seats.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Conservative Euro MPs, Edward McMillan Scott,
said, "It's important to realize that in a European Parliament
that actually does have a great deal of power we're going to have
a center right government."

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage to Deteriorate in Pakistani Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Water shortage in the Pakistani
capital of Islamabad is expected to deteriorate as water reservoir
can meet demand of the consumers just for 12 days.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Simli dam, the only water supply source of
Islamabad, has receded to alarming level and water there will be
used up if no major precipitation takes place in the next 12 days,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Simli dam has been declining over the past
four months due to lack of rainfall, which has caused concern and
panic among the residents in the capital who have experienced
similar situation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Failing to cope with the water shortage, the Capital
Development Authority has resorted to further reduction in water
supply to the residents who are already complaining of
non-availability of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the authority said that they have further reduced
water supply in a bid to use the reservoir for as many days as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authority has repeatedly called on the people to
use water carefully and not to waste it.
</P>
<P>
Some residents are complaining that those people who installed
moter pumps directly on main water pipeline are depriving their
neighbors to get ample water supply.
</P>
<P>
If the crisis is allowed to continue, many residents will
prefer to migrate from the capital as they cannot afford to live
without water during scorching summer, said one resident.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Attorney General to Be Temporarily Relieved of Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Monday agreed to the request of Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to
be temporarily relieved of his duties until he is cleared of
allegations of accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
"The president has agreed with (Ghalib's) request,"
Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision and State
Administrative Reform Hartarto told reporters after meeting with
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib is currently under fire for an alleged bribe of 1.8
billion rupiah (225,000 U.S. dollars) and his failure to probe the
suspected wealth of former president Soeharto and his family.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Corruption Watch (ICW) members said that Ghalib
received billions of rupiah in bribes from several businessmen
facing corruption investigations at his office.
</P>
<P>
ICW coordinator Teten Masduki expressed surprise at the huge
amount of Ghalib's personal savings -- 13 billion rupiah as of
February this year -- which he considered disproportionate to the
attorney general's salary of 7.5 million rupiah a month.
</P>
<P>
More suspect dealings were reported by other media
publications, including the news magazine Tempo, which quoted
senior officials at Ghalib's office as saying that the attorney
general kept other "official funds", such as money for the
construction of a mosque on the office grounds, in his private
bank account.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib initially reacted to the ICW's reports by issuing a
lawsuit against the independent group, accusing it of slander.
</P>
<P>
However, the attorney general himself has admitted to receiving
money transfers totaling 450 million rupiah from tycoons The Nin
King and Prajogo Pangestu at a time when the two businessmen were
being questioned by Ghalib's office for suspected financial
misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
But he defended that the money was donations allocated for the
Indonesian Wrestling Association, which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib has not explained why the money was transferred to his
private account.
</P>
<P>
The ICW has strongly recommended that Habibie dismiss Ghalib
from his post.

<HEADLINE> IOC to Open Its General Assembly to Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 14 (XInhua) -- The International Olympic Committee
(IOC) announced here on Monday that it has decided to open the
proceedings of its general assembly to the media for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
As part of a commitment to openness in the wake of its worst
scandal caused by vote-buying bid of the Salt Lake city for the
2002 Winter Games, the IOC took the move on Monday that its four-
day session here would be beamed live to reporters via closed-
circuit television system.
</P>
<P>
The executive board said it decided to open the meetings on the
recommendation of its new IOC 2000 reform commission, which was
set up following the disastrous scandal.
</P>
<P>
IOC director general Francois Carrard said the IOC was
satisfied with open meetings of the world anti-doping conference
in February and of the reform panel earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
But the meetings of the executive board will continue to remain
behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
The 109th IOC session opens Thursday and members will hear
reports from organizing committees of the 2000 Sydney Games and
2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. On Saturday, the IOC will
select the host city for the 2006 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Under a new system, the assembly will elect a 16-strong special
panel that will choose two finalists from a field of six European
candidate cities. The full IOC membership will then choose the
winner city by secret ballot.

<P>
HANGZHOU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- After two years of work, Chinese
scientists and technicians have developed the world's first
digitally-controlled refrigerator, a state-of-the-art combination

</P>
<P>
The Huari Group, a household appliance producer in Hangzhou,
the capital of Zhejiang Province, managed the experimental use of
computerized technology for refrigerators.
</P>

The Huari Group can now produce 100,000 of the new generation
of refrigerators annually, and expects to meet the fast-growing
demand of domestic and overseas customers.

SHENYANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction work on a part of
an imperial palace of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in Shenyang,
capital of China's Liaoning Province, has been completed.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, workers lowered the Dazheng (Major
Affairs) Hall by 0.5 meters and redid the floor of the hall and
the outside walkways so that the cornerstones and steps can be

</P>
<P>
In 1625, the first emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Nurhachi, moved
the capital to Shenyang and it served as a political center when
the Qing would go to Shanhai Pass.
</P>
<P>
Dazheng Hall was built between 1621 and 1628 and was used for
state ceremonies. The Imperial Palace of Shenyang is the best
preserved example of palace architecture after Beijing's Forbidden
City.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President-elect
Thabo Mbeki has brokered a provisional peace settlement in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Newsweek magazine said in its
latest international edition.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki is expected to announce the peace plan at his
inauguration in Pretoria on June 16, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Under a "framework agreement" developed in months of intensive
S. Africa- led diplomacy, the process would begin with a
"comprehensive cease-fire" that would lead to "on-going political
negotiations", it said.
</P>
<P>
S. African forces would "supervise" the administration of the
territory in the east DRC, held by the rebels, whose competing
factions have been convinced by their alleged sponsors, Uganda and
Rwanda, to form a common front for the purpose, said the magazine.
</P>
<P>
The report implied that the foreign forces fighting on both
sides of the conflict would be withdrawn, with S. African troops
acting as peace- keepers and guaranteeing the security of Rwanda
and Uganda from attack by insurgents operating from DRC's soil.

PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Parliament election held on Sunday showed an
unprecedented number of divisions among France's voters. Except
the Socialist Party, no party won more than 13 percent of the
votes. The abstention rate in the voting was also a 54 percent
record high. The Greens and the list led by former Interior
Minister Charles Pasqua came out the winners from the vote.
</P>
<P>
-- British, French, German, Italian and U.S. soldiers were
deployed last weekend in Kosovo with a number of incidents
occurring between them and the Serbs. The NATO forces will have to
be made up with the Russians, who are now controlling the airport
of Pristina after sending by surprise 500 parachutists last Friday
to Kosovo from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The abstainers were the winner of the European Parliament
election held last weekend and on Sunday in the 15 European Union
(EU) countries, as fewer than one in every two voters went to the
poll. This weak mobilization of voters was seen in most of the EU
countries which have elected 626 new deputies to their parliament
in Strasbourg.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's regular police, who are
responsible for law enforcement among civilian, will have 196.5
million shillings (around 2.6 million U.S. dollars) for their new
budget spending, doubling the figure of the previous year.
</P>

percent to 4.4 billion shillings (about 60.2 million dollars), the

<P>
Kenya has seen a resurgence in violent crime and civil
agitation in recent years, while the security force is facing a
lack of housing, inadequate equipment and shortage of basic
supplies such as petrol.
</P>
<P>
The increased allocation will go into the repair of offices and
 residential houses for police men, the purchase of communication
equipment and the establishment of police points in at least two
bandit-prone areas, Wagalla and Hadado in North Eastern Province.

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications (BT)
and China Telecom today announced a co-operative agreement that
will allow the two companies to provide a new global
telecommunications service.
</P>
<P>
BT and China Telecom will offer a flexible, cost-effective, end-
to-end service to meet the data communications needs of
multinationals with offices in China. China Telecom will be
responsible for promoting the service within China and BT and its
distributors will promote the business outside China.
</P>
<P>
The joint service will make use of the extensive frame relay
network and technical expertise of China Telecom and Concert, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of BT. The new service has many advantages
like simplified management, global coverage, and competitive
pricing.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to be the first step of cooperative
relations between BT and China Telecom, which will explore new
services to meet the growing communication needs of multinationals
in China.
</P>
<P>
In the next 90 days, the two companies will hold further
discussions to refine the details for the operational model,
network connections, and service implementation.
</P>
<P>
The service is scheduled for commercial availability in the
last quarter of 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea claimed Monday that its
forces shot down two Ethiopian Mig-23 fighter planes Sunday
morning and one Mi-35 helicopter gun ship last Friday in the
latest fighting between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued in Asmara Monday by the Eritrean Foreign
Ministry said that heavy fighting continued for the fourth
successive day on the central flank of the Mereb-Setit front and
the Ethiopian side had sent five divisions to the battle front.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that "Ethiopian cumulative losses for
Thursday, Friday and Saturday amounted to over 12,210 soldiers
killed or wounded. Over 80 Ethiopian soldiers were taken
prisoners Thursday alone."
</P>
<P>
The Burie and Alitiena-Mereb fronts were relatively quiet apart
from diversionary shelling and small-scale Ethiopian attacks that
were quickly crushed, the released said, adding that fighting on
the central flank of the Mereb-Setit front resumed early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of African neighbors began their border conflicts
in May 1998. It is reported that tens of thousands of soldiers
from both sides have been killed in the conflicts since then.
</P>
<P>
Although two nations both agreed to the peace framework put
forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), there is in
sight no immediate resolution to the one-year-long conflict.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Enterprises Playing Major Role In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned enterprises
are playing a major role in the development of the Pudong New Area,
an emerging industrial and financial zone in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the area's administration committee say that more
than 200 medium-sized and large state-owned enterprises from
across the country have successfully established joint ventures
with multinationals like Germany's BASF and Japan's Hitachi.
</P>
<P>
Among Pudong's 300-some large industrial joint ventures each
with overseas investment above 10 million U.S. dollars, more than
70 percent are state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
These joint ventures have laid a foundation for the area's 6
pillar industries: automobiles, information technology, iron and
steel, household appliances, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals.
Last year, their combined output topped 80 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the cooperation between China' state-owned
enterprises and overseas companies mainly to the improved business
environment in the area, which was set up in 1990. Since then, it
has completed 10 major infrastructure projects, and has another 10
under construction, including an international airport, a subway,
and a pedestrian passage across the Huangpu River that separates
the area from downtown Shanghai. At least 200 billion yuan has
been used for infrastructure construction to date.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is now focusing on becoming an international finance,
trade, tourism, conference, and exhibition center in the next
century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Forecasting Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences' Institute of Atmospheric Physics are working on an
atmospheric pollution forecast system that they plan to use in
large Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The research project was begun in the second half of 1997 and
has already been successful with an air pollution forecast system
which has been used experimentally in the cities of Tianjin and
Shenyang, according to Prof. Hu Fei, one of the scientists on the
project.
</P>
<P>
He says that the system will help people avoid air pollution
hazards and can help prevent major air pollution events and
provide environmental program references for government
departments and enterprises. Its final goal is to create a
pollution control system with Chinese characteristics that can
help prevent and control air pollution in China, Hu says.
</P>
<P>
The serious air pollution from industry, vehicles, and other
sources poses a major challenge to government and society. In 1997,
Beijing had more than 90 days of seriously polluted air. The
weekly air quality report of major Chinese cities in 1998 also
showed that the air quality of Beijing was getting worse, and the
air quality in large cities like Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing was
not very promising.

<HEADLINE> Slovenia Hails Developing Ties with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Terming the Slovenian-Egyptian ties
as time-honored, Slovenian Ambassador in Cairo Andrej Zlebnik said
on Monday that the bilateral relations "are steadily developing."
</P>
<P>
Zlebnik made the remarks in an interview with Egypt's official
Middle East News Agency prior to Slovenian Prime Minister Janez
Drnovsek's visit to Egypt on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian ambassador said the visit comes out of his
country's keenness and desire to boost cooperation with Egypt in
all domains, especially in the economic, trade and industrial
areas.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Drnovsek will hold talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Kamal El-Ganzouri and other officials on new
and diverse prospects for cooperation, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also dwell on joint ventures and ways of
promoting trade, Zlebnik added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Slovenia signed two agreements last year respectively
on protecting reciprocal investments and enhancing cooperation in
the fields of industry, science and technology. The two countries
are considering setting up a joint ministerial committee aimed at
seeking ways of boosting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The visit also mirrors the interest of Slovenia, one of the 10
United Nations Security Council non-permanent members, in
consulting with Egypt on regional and international issues of
mutual concern, Zlebnik said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Cairo as a key party in the Middle East, the Arab
world and Africa, he said Egypt has been "playing a positive and
effective role in" helping realize regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, plays a key role in mediating the peace talks between Arab
countries and the Jewish state. It is also keen on helping resolve
disputes in Africa.

LUSAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High

in Zambia for this year's Africa Refugee Day next Sunday, the
Times of Zambia newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted UNHCR spokesman Dominik Bartsch as saying here

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Farmers Urged to Develop Horticulture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Agricultural Minister
Musalia Mudavadi has urged the country's coffee farmers to
diversify into other cash crops and cited horticulture as an
attractive investment.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi said that recent coffee talks overseas had collapsed
and heavy reliance on coffee earning was risky and unpredictable,
the weekly East African Standard reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call recently at the official opening of
a 10- hectare modern greenhouse project launched by the Sulmac
Company in Naivasha, central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture has become a major foreign exchange earner,
ranking third after coffee and tea in Kenya, Mudavadi said, adding
that the horticultural sector earned over 9.7 billion shillings
(161 million U.S. dollars) for the east African country last year.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged the company to work closely with other
supportive organizations and closely monitor changes in the global
scene on matters related to horticulture.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) is directly
involved in the greenhouse project with an injection of 355
million shillings for planting new varieties of roses, special
flowers and building the 10- hectare high-tech green houses.
</P>
<P>
The new project will produce 80 million stems of flowers for
export in 1999 and the production will increase to 136 million
stems, according to CDC Chief Executive Officer Roy Donalds.

Netherlands, Germany and France, according to today's Beijing
Daily.
</P>
<P>
All the goods suspected of dioxin contamination have been
pulled from shelves and sealed in accordance with the Ministry of
Health's June 9 warning, the paper said. Municipal Bureau of
Health officials say the action is a positive preventative move
even though none of the products has been specifically identified
as being contaminated by the chemical.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quotes medical professionals as asking the
public to avoid unnecessary panics over food safety because dioxin
in foodstuff does not harm human health immediately, and domestic
products are entirely safe.

<HEADLINE> Barak Gets Closer to Forming Minority Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak has almost completed the formation of a minority
government, local newspaper Ha'aretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior One Israel sources as saying that
significant progress was achieved in a series of secret
negotiations between Barak's negotiation team and representatives
of Meretz, Shinui, the Center Party and Yisrael Ba'aliya.
</P>
<P>
A uniform coalition agreement between Barak's One Israel and
these parties has been drafted, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But the negotiations with United Torah Judaism (UTJ), which
won five Knesset (parliament) seats in the May elections, are
deadlocked over the issue regarding drafting religious students
into the army.
</P>
<P>
Barak will keep a cabinet portfolio for the UTJ, assuming it
will subsequently join the coalition when the enlistment issue has
been resolved, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
UTJ, an ultra-orthodox party, rejects Barak's intention to
draft religious students into the army. Barak has proposed to
form a committee to discuss this issue in the future, but his
meeting Sunday night with UTJ leaders has made no progress.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Barak hopes to complete the
distribution of cabinet posts with his coalition partners by
Wednesday and will then allocate the other cabinet seats among his
own party.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that if Barak forms the minority government,
he will allocate 12 of the 18 cabinet portfolios among his One
Israel and the remaining six will be divided among the coalition
partners.
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of the Likud joining the coalition is getting
dimmer day by day, as the former governing party gears up for its
leadership battle.
</P>
<P>
Likud's central committee is scheduled to vote Monday night on
the motion tabled by party-leader contenders Ehud Olmert and Meri
Sheetrit to hold primary for the party leadership right now.
</P>
<P>
Olmert is Likud's Jerusalem Mayor and Sheetrit is the outgoing
finance minister. Both of them want to contest the party
leadership with Ariel Sharon, the acting party chairman and
outgoing foreign minister who intends to join Barak's coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Religious Party (NRP), another likely
coalition partner of Barak, is also facing some internal problems.
</P>
<P>
NRP leader Yitzhak Levey is facing increasing calls from party
activists to step down and is likely to face a challenge to his
leadership in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
There is growing frustration in the party following its poor
showing in the elections. It won only five Knesset seats compared
to nine in the 1996 elections.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Power Station Bringing Big Changes To Tibetan Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The 20-kw hydro-electric power
station in the village of Nie in the Tibet Autonomous Region of
China just may be the smallest in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the villagers of Nie in Nangxian County held a
historic meeting to decide about building a hydro-electric power
station on their own. They wanted to join their neighbors in being
able to read under electric lamps and watch exciting TV programs.
</P>
<P>
They first built three temporary huts on the mountainside and
manufactured a wooden waterwheel three meters in diameter, and
ultimately put together a generator by using parts taken from two
old generators that they bought from a local power plant.
</P>
<P>
The final touch to the mini-power station was a pipeline that
brought water down from a small mountain stream, and everything
was ready. The world's "smallest" power plant came into being.
</P>
<P>
After that, all 43 households in the village could get electric
lights, TVs, and tape-recorders and some even bought video players.
Next, they set up a mill to process edible oils and to make wooden
plates.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the villagers reported an average annual per-capita
income of above 2,000 yuan, about the same as the national average,
and the village leader, Pingcuojiebu was selected as a national
model worker for his successful efforts to bring villagers out of
poverty.

<HEADLINE> UAE-Thailand Trade Down in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- After a successful 1998,
bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and
Thailand fell by 27.7 percent in the first quarter of this year,
with exports and imports both dipping by an average 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's exports to Thailand in the first quarter of 1999
were put at 197.5 million U.S. dollars, down 23.6 percent from
the same period of last year. Imports stood at 163.2 million
dollars, a fall of 32.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dubai-based Thai Trade Center, the decrease
is mainly attributed to the plunge in oil prices as well as
the recession in global economy.
</P>
<P>
Some of the major export items from the UAE to Thailand which
saw a fall were crude oil, textile fabric and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The major decline in UAE imports from Thailand were
air-conditioners, woven fabrics, garments, footwear, radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
Last year, trade volume between the two nations saw a 18.5
percent growth - from 1.2 billion dollars to 1.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is Thailand's biggest importer in the Middle
East.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Find Medical Value in Toxic Balloonfish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 80,000 balloonfish have
been bred by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Hydrobiology.
</P>
<P>
The fish are a centimeter in length on average, according to a
researcher, who says that, in addition to the artificial
propagation and breeding technology, the institute will also
develop a balloonfish toxicity detector and do research on
balloonfish toxin and its medical applications.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30 types of balloonfish in the coastal
waters from Liaoning Province up in the northeast down to
Guangdong Province in the south.
</P>
<P>
The balloonfish has a spindle-shaped body and a lethal poison
in its liver, blood and ovary. However, their meat is considered
quite tasty by most Asians.
</P>
<P>
The toxin can be used as an anesthetic and can help relieve the
pain of cancer patients in an advanced state. It also has been
used to treat hypertension, asthma, paralysis, and cardiovascular
diseases.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Meets Thai Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai congratulated Philippine President Joseph Estrada in
bringing the Philippine economy back on the right track during
their 35-minute meeting at the Presidential Palace here Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Fernando Barican said in a statement
that Chuan said in the meeting that the recovery of the Philippine
economy from the Asian regional financial crisis would have great
effect in alleviating the plight of poor Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to intensify cooperation in the areas of
trade, investment, tourism, human resource development, civil
aviation and science and technology to further strengthen the two
countries' 50-year-old bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders gave their respective foreign ministers the
go-ahead signal to draft a treaty between Thailand and the
Philippines on the exchange of convicted nationals to let them
serve their prison terms in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Thailand ranked as the 12th largest trading partner of
the Philippines, with total trade amounting to 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total bilateral trade over the last five years grew at an
annual average of 26.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1998, investments in the Philippines from Thailand
increased by 53.1 percent to 701.6 million pesos (17.54 million
dollars), making Thailand the top ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) investor in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the possibility of a counter
trade arrangement on Thai rice and other Thai products in exchange
for Philippine-made products to be identified later by the Thai
government.
</P>
<P>
In the area of environmental protection, they also mulled
cooperation in oil spill responses.
</P>
<P>
Estrada brought to Chuan's attention the request of Philippine
Airlines to have more flights to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Estrada and Chuan discussed the
recently-concluded Indonesian polls.
</P>
<P>
Both of them also expressed the hope that the plebiscite in
Indonesia's East Timor will likewise be peaceful and successful.
</P>
<P>
Chuan, who is serving his second term as prime minister,
arrived in the country on Sunday for a three-day state visit. He
will leave Manila for Bangkok on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day working visit to Thailand in December last
year, Estrada invited Chuan to visit the Philippines for the
celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of
bilateral relations between the two countries on June 14, 1949.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are members of several international fora such
as ASEAN, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum,
Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEAN Regional Forum and the United Nations.

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- United States beat Argentina 1-
0 in an international soccer friendly here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The winner was scored by substitute Joe-Max Moore in the 88th
minute of the match played at RFK Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine team was without a number of first-team players
but coach Marcelo Bielsa admitted his team had shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
"There were some very obvious missed opportunities out there
today," Bielsa said. "We know what we have to work on, because we
failed to capitalize when we could. The United States is a good,
challenging team, but they did not surprise us."

<HEADLINE> China's "Plant And Animal Kingdom" Reporting Environmental Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province,
which is home to 25 ethnic groups and is known as the "Animal and
plant kingdom" because of its vast biological resources, is
reporting improvement in its environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
The recently released annual environmental report says that in
1998, the province's environmental situation was stable on the
whole and showed signs of improving in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoqing, director of the provincial environmental
protection bureau, attributes the improvements to priority given
by the government of Yunnan, which in 1998 spent more than 1.5
billion yuan on the environment, or nearly 1 percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Three out of 16 of Yunnan's cities reported improved
environment and drinking water conditions in 1998 from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Local people have made an effort to deal with the soil-erosion
and water pollution suituation, to increase the forest acreage,
and to protect wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the World Horticulture Exposition which is in
progress in Kunming through October 31 is a good opportunity for
local and foreign environmental specialists to discuss
environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Middle School Principal Wants End to Race for Grade Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- From May to June, the telephone in
the office of the principal of Beijing's No. 8 Middle School never
stops ringing, invariably because parents are trying to get their
children into this school out of the belief it will help them
enter famous universities.
</P>
<P>
Principal Gong Zhengxing's job is tricky because he cannot
possibly satisfy all these parents and the entrance exam scores
for his school are too high for many students, he says. But, he
explains, if it were possible, he would like to give the
opportunity to all applicants.
</P>
<P>
Gong was one of the first middle school principals to push for
quality education in Beijing and he has his complaints about the
current middle school education situation: "The middle school
education system is not balanced and has resulted in a kind of '
arms race' in the fight for better scores on the national college
entrance exam."
</P>
<P>
Some schools keep adding courses on subjects that make up the
bulk of the test contents and they fill up students' weekends and
winter and summer holidays with additional courses. In this way,
students arrive at an advanced position, but only temporarily,
Gong says, and the final result will be disappointing because it
doesn't help provide a quality education that targets at students'
development in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly suggest that schools put a stop to this 'arm race'
and concentrate on education to improve student quality," Gong
says, but balancing the number of students entering colleges with
a quality education is not easy.
</P>
<P>
The China Youth and Children's Research Center did a survey in
1997 that found that over 95 percent of the parents in urban areas
wanted their children to pursue further study at college or
university but that only five percent of the students were lucky
enough to receive a college education.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing once pointed out that almost all
Chinese primary and middle schools are competing for that five
percent. For decades, satisfactory scores have been the major goal
of middle and primary school students and teachers and education
and study methods were geared to this "education for tests".
</P>
<P>
Gong points out that "education for tests" does not help
improve student quality and says that what is important is
reforming test content and emphasizing testing student quality.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has an "Education Reform and Development
Compendium" that says that the ultimate goal of education is to
improve student quality, signifying a basic education shift from "
education for tests" to "quality education".
</P>
<P>
However, Gong says, just having a compendium is not enough and
he hopes that government departments will come out with a specific
regulation that will make the education system more standardized.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Directorate of Military
Intelligence of Uganda has joined the police in investigating the
Friday night killing of three university students, a police
spokesman told Xinhua in a telephone interview Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Eric Naigambi, deputy spokesman of the police force, said that
"there is some progress in the investigation work, but it is not
for publication."
</P>
<P>
"The military intelligence helps us in the murder hunt, but so
far there has been no arrest yet," he added.
</P>
<P>
Monday's New Vision newspaper quoted some security sources as
saying that a student suspect had been arrested in connection with
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Three students of Makerere University were shot dead after
getting out of a taxi near one of the gates of the university at
about 10:30 p.m. Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The suspected assailant was said to be following the trio in
another vehicle from the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
The killing set off a big student demonstration in the capital
city Saturday morning and wide condemnation from students,
politicians and city residents.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni expressed his deepest condolences for
the dead and demanded speedy investigations into the cold-blooded
killing.
</P>
<P>
Students of the university organized a vigil for the dead
Saturday evening and blamed the incident on the laxity of security
agencies. They demanded that security be strengthened in the
fenceless university.

<HEADLINE> 1,800-Year-Old Tombs Discovered In Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered four tombs dating back 1,800 years at a reconstruction
site in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, more than 30 funeral items from the
Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) were found in two well-preserved
tombs that belong to the middle and later period of Eastern Han
Dynasty (25-220).
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists say they also found a skeleton of a female
in one tomb and believe that the find will be significant for
studying life during the Han Dynasty and the history of Shenyang,
which was an industrial center built during the early years of
New China and an important historical city in northeastern China.
There are records of human activities there as far back as 7,200
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some tombs from the Han Dynasty had already been found in other
partts of the city. To protect the relics below ground, the city
government gave 21 plots of ground on a 32-sq.km. area special
protection and started drafting an urban construction plan in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Scientists on How Solar Activities Affects Global Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The world characteristically
becoming cool and then warm in cycles, according to Chinese
scientists who have studied a 309-meter ice-core.
</P>
<P>
The world has experienced five major changes in temperature
over the past 2,000 years and almost all the changes were closely
related to solar activity, said Yao Tandong, a research fellow at
the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Lanzhou Glacier Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists had given a specific name to each cycle of a
sunspot, solar storm and solar radiation and had discovered that
the periodic changes affect other things, but lacked specific
evidence to decide how great the influence was.
</P>
<P>
But, data collected at Guliya Glacier on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau is one way of making up for this deficiency, Yao said.
</P>
<P>
The North and South poles and the glacier on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, which is the highest in the world, are generally
considered the best areas for finding ancient meteorological
information.

<HEADLINE> Unidentified Group Attacks Human Rights Center in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified group of
heavily-armed men attacked a local human rights organization in
Shingani district in North Mogadishu Sunday night, an official of
the organization confirmed Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness, the gunmen numbering about ten were
well- equipped with assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and
the Russian- made long-range automatic machine gun.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after receiving a phone call from the human rights
 officials, armed militiamen on battle wagons arrived at the
center from the headquarters of Ali Mahdi Mohamed whose forces
control the district.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of the ensuing heavy fire between the two sides
has forced the attackers to flee for their lives.
</P>
<P>
There were no casualties reported from either side, but a
passer-by civilian in the area has suffered slight injuries as a
result of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors in the area have all gathered in the scene after the
shooting began and some of them have even taken their guns out to
defend the center.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that civic defense was seen in
Mogadishu, Somalia' s capital.
</P>
<P>
Only 15 days ago, a hand grenade attack was launched against
the center, but no one was hurt and the perpetrators escaped.
</P>
<P>
Co-chair of Dr. Ismail Jumale Human Rights Center, Hassan
Shireh Sheikh, declined to point his finger of blame onto anyone.
But he said the attack was not something of a big surprise for
them since serious intimidation against their operations had been
continuing in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The official said that his center accommodates secret records
about almost all of the serious human rights violations committed
against the Somalis during the civil war or even during the late
regime.
</P>
<P>
He added that the documents would be of vital use for the
people once the rule of law returns to Somalia, hinting that the
attacks might have acted for the documents.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Using New Kind Of Cooking Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Piped gas made of old straw is
growing in popularity in China's small towns, which are developing
many primary planning functions just like cities.
</P>
<P>
And just like city dwellers using natural gas, Luan Fuying, a
farmer in a town near the city of Xiangfan, cooks with a stove
fueled by straw gas, which is much more convenient and cheaper
than coal. It costs around 18 to 20 yuan a month.
</P>
<P>
The gas piped into her kitchen comes from a straw gasification
facility that transforms 150 kg of straw into 400 cu.m. of gas an
hour and can provide gas for 400 families simultaneously,
</P>
<P>
The fuel is clean and cheaper than liquefied petroleum gas and
coal briquettes. A family on averages uses 5 cu.m. of the gas
daily, costing 0.6 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Chinese farmers burned straw and coal for
cooking and both fuels produced pollution in rural areas. China
produces 600 million tons of straw a year, only a small portion of
which is used as fodder and manure or burnt directly for cooking.
The rest is just waste in the fields.
</P>
<P>
In many rural areas, farmers still burn that waste straw but
this was banned by the government earlier this year because of the
heavy pollution it produces. The Ministry of Science and
Technology has decided to popularize the gasification process
which is already popular in Hebei and eastern Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
But, the piped gas only became possible after farmers move into
towns from their scattered residences. Scientists from the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences say that the building of rural
towns in China has made comprehensive planning for cooking fuel,
heating, water, and electricity possible, as well as for roads and
sewage treatment and the living standards of China's 900 million
farmers could have a dramatic change.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Build Largest Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The final agreement on the 450
megawatt Meghnaghat power plant, Bangladesh's single largest
power plant to be built by a private developer, is likely to be
signed soon, the Financial Express newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The AES Corporation of the United States has been selected for
the project, the report said, adding that the Power Development
Board (PDB), Bangladesh's power management organization, and the
U.S. company earlier initialed all the related agreements.
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost of the project to be implemented on the
Meghna river would be around 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Agreements dealing with such matters as power purchase, fuel
supply and implementation have already been vested in the Ministry
of Law.
</P>
<P>
The land-lease agreement, which was initialed last Thursday, is
now under examination by the Energy Ministry and will be sent to
the Law Ministry for its concurrence.
</P>
<P>
As per the provision of the implementation agreement, the
private developer needs to complete its financial closure within

on which the plant will be installed, is now under development.
The PDB will hand over the developed site to the private developer
by next August.
</P>
<P>
At present, only about 15 percent of the total population in
the country have access to electricity, and the present capacity
of the PDB with 52 generation units under 18 power stations is
between 2,000 and 2,100 megawatts, whereas the country's total
need is about 2,300 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted the policy of privatizing the power
sector, and being attracted by the policy, many local and foreign
entrepreneurs have come forward to invest in the power sector.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Bangladeshi government is also encouraging both
local and foreign private companies to take part in the
development of power sector in a bid to solve the country's acute
power shortage.

BANGKOK, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand won four gold medals in
the finals of the 23rd King's Cup Amateur Boxing tournament on
Sunday while the mighty Cubans clinched the Cup with 43 points,
nine points more than Thai A team.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's victory came from Olympic hero Somluck Khamsing of
featherweight class, Sontaya Wongprates of bantamweight class,
Jakkrit Suwannalird of light-welterweight class and Pakpoom
Jangponak of welterweight class.
</P>
<P>
Although the Cubans captured only two titles, they have won
more matches, therefore automatically gaining the right to the
trophy.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's two golds came from world champion Maikro Romero of the
light-flyweight category, who beat Thailand's Asaid Suban Pannon,
and Maikro Kindelan of the lightweight class.
</P>
<P>
The last gold went to Ukraine's Volodymyr Sydorenko of the
flyweight class.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Cuban head coach Juan Fontanial was delighted with
the haul of four gold medals which he said the Thai boxers had
worked very hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
"Beating Cuban fighters will give the Thais a lot of confidence
when they fight them again in the World Cup and the Olympics," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"My overall assessment is that the boys have learned to box
with their brains while their physical condition and tactics have
shown a marked improvement," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Railway And Highway Construction in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China is increasing work on
railways and highways in the south central part of the country to
improve the backward situation there and to stimulate economic
development.
</P>
<P>
From 1998 to 2002, the Chinese government plans to spend 250
billion yuan on railways, with 68 billion yuan being used for this
south central area, according to a report at an economic
coordination conference that ended here recently. The targeted
area covers Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, Tibet and
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions, and Chongqing, a municipality
rich in natural resources and one of the most populous parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
A highway construction project linking these areas that started
in 1984 is under way to develop inter-provincial highways, and
since that time 1,500 kilometers of highways have been built.
</P>
<P>
The railway and highway networks in the South and Southwest is
expected to promote economic links with coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Catalyzer To Degrade Plastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Plastic products that normally
wouldn't disappear in a hundred years on a rubbish heap or in soil
can now be eaten away in several months when a newly developed
catalyzer is added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists consider it the best method to tackle the "
white pollution" caused mainly by non-biodegradable matereials
like styrofoam or plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Engineering
say that the new technology could be a major global development.
</P>
<P>
China says it will get rid of white pollution before the end of
this year. The biodegradable substance developed by the Beijing
Plastic Institute has proven to be an effective way to solve the
problem and is now being used across the country.
</P>
<P>
The researchers added portions of the material to plastic
products and found that plastic molecules can be dissolved after
being exposed to sunlight, then "Bacteria consume the decomposed
plastic mega-molecules as if they were eating crumbs," according
to Professor Han Changtai, one of the people involved in
developing the technology.
</P>
<P>
There is still a problem with non-degradable plastic in the
world, and people from Germany, Belgium, Singapore, and elsewhere
have shown an interest in this new technology, which Han and his
colleagues applied first to plastic sheeting for agricultural use.
The plastic sheeting previously used could not be recycled and
could only be buried in the ground, causing a hardening of the
soil and environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
But when the catalyzer was added to plastic sheeting it could
be completely dissolved within four months, thus solving the
pollution problem. And, because the new sheeting is thinner, it
weighs more than 30 kg less per hectare of farmland and on 66,000
hectares of farmland, it saved farmers 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
If the sheeting is applied to China's 6.67 million hectares of
farmland, it could save more than a billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The technology has also been applied to boxes and bags,
producing items that can be completely dissolved into non-
polluting particles within two months.
</P>
<P>
China's Railway Ministry is now encouraging its use for the 250
million boxes used for food on trains.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Han says that China discards more than a million tons of
plastic products annually, but that it will only cost 230 million
yuan to add the catalytic element to all the plastic sheeting,
food boxes, and bags in China and could easily help solve the
white pollution problem.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Opens Club to Help Children with Psycho Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A club for children with
psychological problems in the Chinese city of Tianjin, which was
set up in 1997, now has more than 1,100 members who come from
single-parent families or families with financial problems or who
have disabilities.
</P>
<P>
It has invited psychologists from Nankai University to talk
about psychological health and has encouraged college students
from the Tianjin Institute of Finance and Economics to make
friends with the children to help them overcome their self-
consciousness, loneliness, and indifference.
</P>
<P>
One of the children, nine-year-old Zhang Mingzhe, has been
living with her mother since her parents divorced five years ago
and has been living in rather miserable conditions since her
mother lost her job. She was becoming more and more self-conscious
and reluctant to play with other children but the club has helped
make her happier and more willing to take part in school
activities.
</P>
<P>
One of the people who benefited from the club, Ma Qing, has in
turn offered financial help to five children who dropped out of
school in the earthquake-damaged area in Zhangbei in Hebei
province.
</P>
<P>
The club's emblem has a baby eagle, a shield, and a sun
depicted on it to inspire these children with misfortunes to fight
against their trouble courageously all their lives.

JINAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
moved 150,000 people from low-lying lands along the Yellow River
as part of a massive effort to protect them from possible flooding.
</P>
<P>
They will be moved to other parts of the province permanently
which are away from the river's path, according to a provincial
government official.
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 people are living in low-lying land along the
river in Shandong and for generations their villages have been
under water during flood seasons, even though various flood-
control measures were taken.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the province set the goal of permanently moving 160,
000 people who were most vulnerable to flooding and reinforcing
dikes around villages in low-lying areas.
</P>
<P>
To date, about 400 million yuan has been spent on this effort
and the other 10,000 people are to be relocated by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
No great floods have occurred on the river in the past 16 years,

<HEADLINE> FAO Meeting Highlights Sustainable Growth, Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Close cooperation among Asian
nations will enhance the development of both Asian and global
sustainable agriculture and alleviate poverty in the next
millennium, Thai Agriculture Minister Pongpol Adireksarn said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the "Ministerial
Roundtable on Beyond the Asian Crisis: Sustainable Agricultural
Development and Poverty Alleviation in the Next Millennium," which
was held by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol said as a result of the Asian financial crisis,
population under the poverty line and unemployment have been
drastically increasing.
</P>
<P>
It is of great expectation that agriculture is the main
instrument in solving problems since food is the basic of life,
beside air and water, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that sustainable agriculture will make us
achieve poverty alleviation in the next millennium by utilizing
the limited natural resources and causing no negative impacts on
the environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prem Nath, deputy director-general of FAO and
regional representative for Asia and the Pacific, said as this
century comes to an end, it is very important to take stock of the
state of agricultural and rural development in the region, assess
the implications of the crisis on agriculture and rural sector and
to confront head-on the challenges facing the sector in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol as well as agricultural ministers or high-level
agricultural officials from Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Pakistan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, India and Laos are
expected to introduce at the one-day meeting the state of
agriculture in their respective countries in the wake of the Asian
crisis.

<HEADLINE> 43 Killed in Philippines' Plantation War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 43 people were killed in a
five-day gunbattle between some 200 armed raiders and cultists
serving as plantation guards in a coconut farmland in the Southern
Philippines, a Philippine newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Standard reported that the fighting broke out between
members of Ilagas, a cult group in the Philippines, and suspected
members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) last Monday in
Inudaran, Lanao del Norte Province in Northern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF said that the armed men are not its regular
members, but merely its supporters.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that 33 cadavers were recovered from the
vicinity of the Oliverio Estate last Friday, three days after 10
bodies of slain cult members were retrieved by government troops.
</P>
<P>
The armed members who attacked the cultists were natives of the
area, and they took up arms against the wealthy clan who took
their ancestral land, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Left Parties Suffer Setback in European Parliament Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- In the polls on Sunday to elect
the country's 16 deputies to the European Parliament, Finland's
left-wing parties suffered setbacks while the bourgeois parties
emerged stronger, according to the official final results
announced at midnight.
</P>
<P>
The National Coalition Party and the Center Party, on the
bourgeois side, each won four seats in the European Parliament,
the same as in the last elections five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party and the Left-Wing Union seized
three and one respectively, each with one seat less compared with
the last elections.
</P>
<P>
The Christian Union grabbed one seat, entering the European
Parliament for the first time, while the Green League obtained one
more seat to take two.
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner was the National Coalition Party, which
gained 25.3 percent of the votes, up 5.1 percentage points, while
the Green League's votes more than doubled, amounting to 13.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Like elections in other EU countries, the turnout was poor,
with only 30.1 percent of Finnish voters showing up, down by 27.5
percentage points from 57.6 percent in the elections five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The political analysts attributed the low turnout rate to the
fact that voters do not care much for the European Parliament,
which, in the absence of a common agenda, has little influence on
individual EU states.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Finnish parties fielded 140 candidates in the elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's ruling Social
Democratic Party (SDP) was leading in the primary results of the
European parliamentary elections, winning 26.1 percent of all the
votes counted.
</P>
<P>
The initial results, unveiled early Monday morning, showed that
the SDP had bagged two percentage point less than it did in the EU
's last parliamentary elections five years ago. The results could
reduce the number of its seats in the regional parliament from
seven to six.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has 22 seats in the European parliament, the legislative
and supervisory branch of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Moderate Coalition Party (MSP), the biggest opposition
party in the country, netted 20.6 percent of the polls, down 2.6
percentage points compared with five yeas ago. But the MSP's seats
in the parliament would remain five.
</P>
<P>
The Green Party, the biggest loser in the elections, got only 9.
4 percent of the votes, dipping 7.8 percentage points from the 17.
2 percent it obtained in 1994. Its seats would diminish from four
to two.
</P>
<P>
Six percent of all the voters voted for the Center Party, 1.1
percentage points down from 1994. And it would lose one of its two
seats in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish People's Party, the biggest winner in the elections,
collected 13.3 percent of the polls, nearly tripling that in 1994,
raising its seats from one to three.
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democratic Party and the Left Party Communists
got 7.7 and 15.8 percent of the votes respectively, both up
considerably compared with the last elections.
</P>
<P>
Quite out of Prime Minister Goran Persson's expectations, only
38.3 percent of the Swedish population nationwide had participated
in the polls since Thursday, compared with 41.6 percent five years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Gives Foreigners 20 Percent of Local Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign individuals and
organizations in Vietnam will be allowed to hold as much as 20
percent of local enterprise stock shares, Vietnam's English daily
Vietnam News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rules covering foreign participation in the imminent
establishment of Vietnam's first stock exchange were approved last
week by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
Certain form of stock exchange trading is expected to begin in
Ho Chi Minh City by the end of this year, according to Vietnam's
State Securities Commission.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules approved by the prime minister, an individual
foreigner is limited to 3 percent of the 20 percent of shares for
foreigners and an foreign organization can own 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the case of a joint-venture stock company, the maximum
capital contribution of the foreign partner is limited to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Talking about selling shares of businesses to foreign
investors, Equitization Steering Board Deputy Director Nguyen Van
Nghia said that "we target two goals in equitizing businesses, one
is to mobilize foreign investment capital into Vietnam and the
other is to gain management experience from foreign investors."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam gave nine sectors priority to sell shares to
foreigners. They include textiles and garments, agricultural and
aqua-product production and processing, consumer goods production,
construction materials, school aid, toys, domestic land and water
transportation, trade and hotel services.

<HEADLINE> Donor Countries to Review Cambodia's Reform Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of 16 donor
countries and several international agencies met Monday at the
Council of Ministers with Cambodian officials to review the
country's first quarter reform process.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen presided over the one-day meeting
attended by more than 200 of participants including
representatives of the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other diplomats.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Hun Sen reiterated that "Cambodia has
no other choice than to implement scrupulously and rigorously the
reform programs or will remain bogged down in poverty,
underdevelopment and instability."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said, "We believe that only implementing these programs
will make our dream a reality. Our performance so far has been
very favorably commented upon and appreciated," but he added that
"there is so much still to be done and we should not be complacent
about our recent achievements."
</P>
<P>
At February's Consultative Group meeting in Tokyo, donor
countries agreed to provide more than 470 million U.S. dollars to
Cambodia this year.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Cambodia government pledged to carry out a
series of reforms including military demobilization, forestry and
environmental programs, fiscal reform, and administrative reform
and also agreed to check on the progress of reforms every three
months.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting, the Royal Government of Cambodia will
present several reports about the reform progress such as the
paper on security and public order to be delivered by Deputy Prime
Minister and Co-Minister for Interior Sar Kheng, fiscal reform
paper by Minister of Economy and Finance Keat Chhon, forest
management paper by Secretary of State for Agriculture Chan Tong
Yves and the paper focusing on demobilization and civil service
reform by Minister of the Council of Ministers Sok An.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how the donors will measure the progress of
reforms. But it is said that in some areas, donor countries will
set some goals at the meeting Monday and then evaluate whether
they have been met.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Cuts Interest Rates for 17th Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank cut
Monday its overnight borrowing and lending rates by another 0.125
percentage points to 9.5 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
It is the 17th time that the Central Bank reduced its overnight
rates this year, bringing the cumulative reduction in the
overnight borrowing and lending rates to 3.875 percentage points
from 13.375 and 15.375 percent, respectively, at the start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Acting Governor Edgardo Zialcita of the Central Bank said
earlier that the reduction in the interest rates should send a
strong market signal that monetary authorities were determined to
sustain the easing of monetary conditions to stimulate credit
growth.
</P>
<P>
Zialcita said the sustained reduction in the rates was made
possible by the sharp drop in the inflation rate as well as the
institution's continuing overperformance with respect to monetary
ceilings set under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank's overnight borrowing rate or one-day reverse
repurchase agreement is its most potent tool for mopping up
liquidity in the system and highly influences the movement of
Treasury bill yields.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 91-day T-bill rate, in turn, is used by banks as
reference in pricing their loans.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank agreed to cut its overnight borrowing and
lending rates following the drop in the inflation rate to 6.7
percent in May from the 7.9 percent inflation in April.
</P>
<P>
Last month's inflation rate stood way below the 8.1-percent
ceiling under the IMF program.

<HEADLINE> Government to Assist Building Materials Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China will try to help its debt-
ridden state-owned large and medium-sized building materials
enterprises make profits in 1999, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the negative effects of the Asian financial crisis and
last summer's floods, China's building materials industry has
developed steadily in 1998," Hao Zhenhua of the State
Administration of Building Materials Industry (SABMI) said, quoted
by the English-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, many large and medium-sized state-owned building
materials firms trapped in debts hamper the development of the
building materials industry.
</P>
<P>
China had 1,209 large and medium-sized state-owned building
materials firms at the end of 1997. More than 530 were in the red.
The total loss of these debt-ridden firms has reached 4.55 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The net loss of China's building materials firms was 1.81
billion yuan," Hao said, adding that the SABMI will help one-third
of these loss-making firms earn profits in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to reduce the number of loss-making large and
medium-sized state-owned building materials firms to 20 percent by
the end of 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
China will not allow construction of new cement and glass
projects in 1999 and 2000, and meanwhile, will close down small
cement plants and glass factories, the closure of which will help
reduce the production capacity by 100 million tons of cement and
30 million boxes of glass.
</P>
<P>
New building materials will also be developed to optimize the
product mix of the industry, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Unfair competition is one of the factors responsible for the
efficiency drop in enterprises. "China will curb the dumping of
building materials," he said.

Of the total, opium addicts account for 50.01 percent, heroin
addicts 37.4 percent, marijuana addicts 7.7 percent, stimulant
addicts 1.2 percent, tranquilizer addicts 0.99 percent and other

Up to now, Myanmar has established six major drug treatment

<HEADLINE> Report: Chinese Acupuncture Seen As New Anti-Drug Remedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The tiny Chinese needle may be a
new-found magic weapon in the difficult war against drug as latest
tests in Sweden showed encouraging signs of abstinence after the
ancient acupuncture treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Dagens Nyheder daily said Sunday that 145 drug addicts in
three of the prisons that began the needle therapy in 1996 all
reported reduced amount in drug-taking and ease of tension or
other side-effects in kicking off the deadly addiction.
</P>
<P>
All of them said they wanted to continue the therapy.
</P>
<P>
The report said the treatment involved sticking a needle to the
ear of the patient for 30 to 45 minutes every day, with the time
doubled in two periods for very heavy addicts. The frequency
would be cut down to twice or three times a week with the patient'
s improvement.
</P>
<P>
Swedish anti-drug authorities have asked the government health
department to officially approve the use of acupuncture in curing
drug addiction, citing the effectiveness and low cost of the
therapy.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar-China Bilateral Trade Increases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar-China bilateral trade,
including the border trade, reached 78.21 million U.S. dollars in
the first two months of this year, sharply increasing by 123.7
percent over the 34.95 million dollars registered in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures published by Myanmar's Central
Statistical Organization, China exported to Myanmar 57.38 million
dollars of goods during the two-month period, while importing from
Myanmar commodities valued at 20.83 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar mainly imports from China electrical and machinery
equipment and accessories, and consumers goods, while exporting to
China timber and marine products.
</P>
<P>
Border trade between the two countries plays an important role
in their bilateral trade. So far, Myanmar has, on its side, opened
six border trade points, namely Muse, Kyuhkok, Lwejei, Namhkam,
Kunlong and Mongla.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to expand its foreign trade, Myanmar has lowered
border trade service charges to 8 percent from 10 percent and
raised the income tax rate on imported commodities from 1.5
percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Myanmar official statistics, Myanmar-China
bilateral trade amounted to 381.1 million dollars in 1998, 21.56
percent up from 1997's 313.5 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Athletes' Hopes For Medals Still High Despite Fund Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia athletes preparing for
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei in August expressed
confidence that they would win golds despite the country's
financial turmoil, which stopped them from warming up in overseas
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Women's long-distance runner Supriati Sutono said that she
aimed to retain the supremacy she enjoyed in the SEA Games in
Jakarta two years ago, in which she won three golds and improved
the records in the 1,500 meters, 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters
events.
</P>
<P>
Supriati, a 26-year-old Army sergeant first class, said she
would not underestimate her rivals despite her victory in the
women's 5,000 meters gold in the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok. She
came only fifth in the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
"Long-distance running needs good physical stamina, endurance
and speed. I must be wary of my rivals, especially Myanmar which
has potential medal winners. The SEA Games are no longer as easy
as they used to be," she was quoted by The Jakarta Post Monday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Antonius Fallo, Indonesia's young hopeful who competes in the
men's 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, said his target was only to
win medals.
</P>
<P>
"Any medal will be fine," said Antonius, who earned a bronze in
the 10,000 meters in the 19th SEA Games.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Amateur Athletics Association (PASI) is grooming
its middle and long-distance runners at the Pengalengan tea
plantation near Bandung, West Java, which is 1,500 meters above
sea level.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Herry Setiyono complained that his athletes could
not warm up in overseas tournaments due to lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
PASI plans to select 12 of 18 middle and long-distance runners
to team up for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Rowing Association (PODSI) also faced the same
problem in sending its athletes abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, coach Asrul Sani expressed optimism that his athletes
would still win medals in the men's and women's 400 meters and 800
meters events even without warming up in a tournament.
</P>
<P>
Unlike those two sports bodies, the Indonesian Cycling
Association plans to send nine mountain bikers, including 1997 SEA
Games gold medalists Rissa Suseanty and Fery Sonic, to a
championship in Australia in the second week of July.
</P>
<P>
"They will have tough opponents who don't only come from Asia.
If they only practice here, they won't develop a competitive
spirit," coach Chandra Ariavijaya said.

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Parties Suffer Defeat in European Parliament Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's ruling Social Democrat
Party (SPD) won only 31 percent of the vote in the European
Parliament election Sunday, while the opposition union of the
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (
CSU) won 49 percent of it, according to television estimates here.
</P>
<P>
The other ruling ally, the Greens, won a mere 5.6 percent. The
opposition Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) grabbed 6 percent.
They both will enter the European Parliament as their votes have
exceeded the required 5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Together the four parties will take 99 seats in the 626-member
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The final results will not be expected out until Monday.
</P>
<P>
The votes for the SPD may have fallen 1.2 percentage points
from the last election in 1994, and those for the Greens 4.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Local media said the estimated results of the election
indicated that a large portion of the more than 60 million German
voters were not happy with the government's policies on employment,
taxes and the war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, EU's only directly elected body, was
initially a consultative assembly, but its powers have gradually
expanded, with the authority to amend or veto much of the
legislation agreed by the 15 EU governments.
</P>
<P>
The EU assembly's 626 members (MEPs), who serve a five-year
term, can also reject EU budgets, set up committees of inquiries,
sack the European Commission, the EU's executive body, and veto
international agreements or block EU expansions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the voting systems vary among the 15 EU
member states, this is the first EU parliamentary election held
under proportional representation across the whole of the European
Union.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia will grant 230 million
rupees (3.25 million U.S. dollars) to fund an environment project
at Hikkaduwa in south Sri Lanka, official sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three-year project will provide solid and liquid waste
management systems in an environmental friendly way, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
It will also help reduce the environmental impact of sewage and
solid waste disposal at resort area around Hikkaduwa town, about
100 kilometers south of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Australia's contribution will be provided through technical
personnel, training and study tours, equipment and civil works for
the solid waste facility and community programs, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The project will also focus on community assistance, providing
an opportunity for income generation and health benefits to the
poorer sections of the community.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the project is expected to form an integral
part of Sri Lanka's national plans for environmental improvement
and protection with specific emphasis on coastal zones.
</P>
<P>
It will address four priority sectors in Australia's overseas
aid program: environment, natural resource management,
institutional strengthening and community assistance.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Measure Covers Dismissal of Unqualified Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Municipal Government of
Tianjin in north China recently issued a new measure to dismiss
managers unable to reverse the money-losing status of state-owned
businesses over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the related government departments said the
measure is based on their belief that the qualifications and
performance of a manager play an important role in the enterprise
development.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to ensure the city's money-losing medium-sized to
large state businesses reverse deficits over a three-year period
beginning initially in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The municipality, an major industrial city in north China,
plans to reverse the deficit conditions for 17 of 52 related
enterprises by the end of this year, as well as an additional 14
enterprises by the end of next year.

enterprises to the prescribed government level of 15 percent or
below.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Signs Malchiot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Chelsea has completed their first pre-season signing by taking
advantage of the Bosman ruling yet again.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Sunday, Mario Malchiot of the
Netherlands, a 22-year-old defender, will join Gianluca Vialli's
side on July 1 from Ajax on a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
Malchiot, who has won 13 Under-21 caps for his country, will
cost Chelsea nothing in terms of a transfer fee as he is out of
contract -- just as previous signings such as Brian Laudrup and
Gustavo Poyet have been.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea have been frustrated in their attempts to strengthen
their squad over recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, the capture of Malchiot, who has made about 100
appearances for Amsterdam Ajax, has at least set the ball rolling,
with a number of further signings still expected before the start
of next season.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Wins London Grasscourt Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras of the United States
defeated Tim Henman of England 6-7, 6-4, 7-6 to win the 750,000 U.
S. dollar London grasscourt championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first victory for the American second seed since last
October.
</P>
<P>
For Henman, despite losing the final, he will move up to world
number five, a career high.
</P>
<P>
Both players started the final in near perfect form on a sun-
drenched centre court at Queen's Club.
</P>
<P>
It was the second visit for Henman of the day to the court --
the third seed took 11 minutes in the morning to complete his rain-
delayed semifinal with a 6-1, 6-3 win over Armenia's Sargis
Sargsian.
</P>
<P>
But Sampras was a different proposition altogether.
</P>
<P>
The opening set was classic grasscourt fare, with both men
holding serve comfortably, and it went to a tie-break.
</P>
<P>
Sampras won the first point with a volley into an open court
but then Henman took control.
</P>
<P>
Two clean winners, a Sampras double fault, an exquisite
backhand passing shot, a service winner and a wild backhand lashed
wide by Sampras gave Henman six set points at 6-1.
</P>
<P>
He needed only one as Sampras dumped a backhand drop shot into
the net.
</P>
<P>
But a characteristic lapse in concentration by Henman in the
third game of the second set allowed Sampras to break and that was
the only chance he needed as he levelled the match 6-4 after an
hour and 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Henman, who had not beaten Sampras in their four previous
meetings, spurned a host of break points in the decider.
</P>
<P>
Sampras saved three in the fourth game and one in the fifth as
Henman failed to capitalise on his supremacy.
</P>
<P>
The set, almost inevitably, slid into a tie-break and this time
Sampras would make no mistake.
</P>
<P>
A dramatic backhand lob off a chased smash landed right on the
baseline and gave Sampras match point which he duly converted with
a service winner.
</P>
<P>
"That was really tough. He (Henman) is so strong and so
talented. I really see him winning Wimbledon one day," Sampras,
who has won Wimbledon five times himself, said afterwards.

<HEADLINE> India Shells Deep Inside Pakistan Territory: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Army resorted to
heavy artillery bombardment deep inside Pakistan's territory in
the disputed region of Kashmir during the last 24 hours, a
Pakistani military spokesman said here Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The Indians also fired chemical shells," the spokesman said,
adding that "the type and details of contents of the shells are
being ascertained."
</P>
<P>
After continuous artillery shelling for the entire night, the
Indians attacked a Pakistani army position located on the Line of
Control (LoC), stated the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The attack was repulsed with very heavy casualties inflicted
upon the enemy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman admitted that one of Pakistan's patrols, which
moved out at night, is missing. "Efforts are on to trace their
whereabouts."
</P>
<P>
He said that it seems obvious that the Indian Army has embarked
on an offensive to capture posts on the LoC under the garb of
anti-Mujahideen (holy war fighters) operations.
</P>
<P>
"The recent attack by the Indians on the Line of Control is
totally unacceptable and should be stopped forthwith," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, Pakistan Armed Forces reserve the right to
respond," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Center-right Gains In EU Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union's center-right
parties claimed victory on Sunday in the EU parliamentary
elections with polls suggesting they could take lead as a dominate
group in the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Early counting showed that voter turnout may have hit a record
low Europe-wide as voters in 15 EU member states have gone polls
since Thursday to elect for a new European Parliament, the EU's
legislative and supervisory branch.
</P>
<P>
However, initial polls suggested the European People's Party
(EPP) could end up the largest group in Brussels. Currently the
Socialist group dominates with 214 of the 626-seat assembly.
</P>
<P>
EPP, the center-right bloc in the EU parliament, was claiming a
hisoric victory with counting still at an early stage today. "For
the first time in 20 years, the EPP will have 30 seats more than
the Socialists," the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 countries voting on Sunday, Greece was first to
open the polling booths, followed by Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, luxemburg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The other four EU member states held the voting earlier as
voters in Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands went to polls on
Thursday, and in Ireland on Friday, which brings together
parliamentarians from all 15 EU countries.
</P>
<P>
EU official reports said 10,527 candidates, distributed amongst
299 lists, are in the running to win the hearts of 297.9 million
voters.
</P>
<P>
The turnout is already reported to be average everywhere, even
very low in Britain, but may be higher in countries where general
elections are being held at the same time, such as Luxemburg and
Belgium, an official EU report said earlier.
</P>
<P>
EU sources predict that such mood of apathy for voting could
undermine the European Parliament's resolve to act as a channel to
allow European citizens to have a bigger say in European affairs.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, EU's only directly elected body, was
originally set up as a consultative assembly, but its powers have
gradually expanded. Now it has the right amend or veto much of the
legislation agreed by 15 EU governments.
</P>
<P>
The EU assembly's 626 members (MEPs), who serve a five-year
term, also can reject the EU budget, set up committees of inquiry,
sack the European Commission, the EU's executive body, and veto
international agreements or block EU expansions.
</P>
<P>
The number of MEPs and precise voting systems vary from country
to country among the 15 EU member states, but this is the first EU
parliamentary election held under proportional representation
across the whole of the European Union.
