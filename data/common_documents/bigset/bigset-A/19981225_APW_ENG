Singapore crime rate seen rising for first time in 10 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ For the first time in a decade, Singapore's
crime rate is expected to show an increase when 1998 figures become
available, a newspaper quoted officials as saying.
	   Snatch theft and murder have seen the biggest percentage
increases, The Straits Times reported Friday. Crimes for which
police do not need a warrant to make an arrest were up 4 percent
from January through September over the same period the year
before.
	   If the trend continues, the overall crime rate for 1998 will be
5 percent higher than 1997, the newspaper said.
	   It quoted several officials as estimating that 1999 would be
about the same as this year.
	   Former Criminal Investigation Department chief Chua Chin Kiat
told the paper that the reversal in the crime rate should be seen
in the context of the economic downturn and as a normal adjustment
after many years of sharp cuts in crime.
	   ``It is time we got to some steady state and my guess is that
next year will not be too different from this year,'' he was quoted
as saying.
	   Complete crime rate figures are available only for the first six
months of this year. The 1998 totals will not be available until
January or February, police said.
	   But the six-month figures show a 66.7 percent increase in
murder, up to 30 cases this year, compared to 18 cases in 1997.
	   Snatch thefts, in which mostly old people are victimized leaving
banks or money changers' stalls, increased 55 percent, up to 241
cases.
	   Motor vehicle theft increased 42 percent, up to 1,433 stolen
during the first six months of the year.
	   Rape was up 29 percent, with the 58 cases reported in the first
half of the year the highest figure in seven years. Almost 40
percent of the victims were 10 to 15 years old, the paper reported.
	   Housebreaking was up 15 percent and robbery up 12 percent.

Chinese dissident faces possible death penalty in trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A dissident charged with endangering state
security could face a death sentence for allegedly telling U.S.
government-funded Radio Free Asia about farmers' protests.
	   Zhang Shanguang, who earlier spent seven years in jail for labor
rights campaigning, will go on trial Sunday in Huaihua city in the
southern province of Hunan, an official of the court confirmed
Friday.
	   The official refused to detail the charges or give his name. But
Human Rights in China, a New York-based group, said Friday that
Zhang was accused of ``illegally providing intelligence to overseas
enemy organizations and people.''
	   According to China's criminal code, conviction generally is
punished with a jail term but the court can apply the death penalty
if it deems that national interests were seriously endangered.
	   Human Rights in China said the charge was related to interviews
Zhang allegedly gave to Radio Free Asia, which has irked Chinese
officials with reports on human rights abuses and other issues.
	   The group said Zhang had told the network about a demonstration
by 70 to 80 farmers in Hunan province's Xupu county and about
another protest by farmers angered by excessive taxes that turned
violent and resulted in deaths.
	   Human Rights in China said it got its information from
``reliable sources'' but its claim about Radio Free Asia could not
immediately be verified.
	   The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
in China, a Hong Kong-based group which also reported Zhang's
impending trial, said the 45-year-old told overseas media and human
rights groups about protests by unemployed workers. But the group
did not mention Radio Free Asia.
	   Zhang's wife, Hou Xuezhu, could not immediately be reached for
comment and his lawyer, Chen Hanwen, refused to answer questions.
	   Human Rights in China said the lawyer would enter a not guilty
plea for Zhang. Prosecutors, on the other hand, maintain that Zhang
is a repeat offender who should be severely punished, it said.
	   Zhang spent seven years in prison in the nationwide crackdown
that followed the crushing of democracy demonstrations in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   Zhang's case follows the trials of Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and
Wang Youcai, three of China's most prominent dissidents. They were
charged with endangering state security, under different clauses of
the law, and sentenced this week to 13, 12 and 11 years
respectively for trying to organize the China Democracy Party.
	   Amid the arrests and trials, Chinese leaders have declared they
will destroy challengers to Communist Party rule. President Jiang
Zemin ordered law enforcement officials Wednesday to eliminate any
threats to ``social stability.''
	   Zhang, who had been preparing to set up an association to
protect laid-off workers' rights, has been detained since July,
following U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China.
	   The Huaihua court decided to try him on Sunday to clear a
backlog of cases before the year's end. The court official said
staff members at the tribunal were working overtime for the trial.

McGrath fit for 4th test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian strike bowler Glenn
McGrath passed a fitness test Friday and will play in Saturday's
fourth test against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
	   McGrath was in doubt after missing the Thursday practice session
with a virus but will lead an attack minus injured Jason Gillespie.
	   England, 2-0 down after three of the five tests, did not name
its team Friday, delaying a decision until it gets a look at the
pitch on Saturday.
	   The grassy state of the MCG wicket might prompt Australia to
include new paceman Matthew Nicholson for his first test alongside
McGrath and Damien Fleming.
	   Nicholson has played just seven first-class games and captain
Mark Taylor said a decision on his inclusion would be made Saturday
morning.
	   Versatile seamer-spinner Colin Miller is Australia's other
option as 12th man.
	   While England is hedging on its selection, captain Alec Stewart
has given strong indications that he will abandon the failed
seven-batsman policy.
	   Surrey fast bowler Alex Tudor is tipped to win a recall and may
bat as high as number seven, while Stewart is expected to move
himself down the order to five and allow in-form Mark Ramprakash in
at four.
	   Although Taylor has retained the Ashes, he said it was important
to keep on beating the English.
	   ``The next two weeks for them is a chance to retain some pride
and give us a bit of a run for our money and try and shock us into
a test loss,'' Taylor said Friday.
	   ``We have got to make sure we are on our guard against that.
They haven't been playing well so they have got nothing to lose.''
	   Taylor starts the match two catches behind his predecessor Allan
Border's record of 156 in tests. Border set his mark in 156 matches
while this game is Taylor's 103rd test.
	   ``It's probably one of the few stats that I keep on myself,''
Taylor, an expert first slip, said.
	   ``It's one thing I do keep a bit of a record of, that and how
many tests I have captained - which is 48.''

Police say three bodies may be from sunken North Korean ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three bodies in green military uniforms were found
Friday morning on a beach in western Japan and police said they may
have been crewmen from a North Korean speedboat sunk by South Korea
last week.
	   The three bodies were found floating by a passer-by on the beach
fronting the Sea of Japan in the town of Takahama at around 7:40
a.m. (2340 GMT Thursday), said a spokesman for the Fukui
prefectural, or state, police.
	   Takahama is about 430 kilometers (267 miles), west of Tokyo.
	   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police
were investigating whether the bodies were those of the crewmen.
	   Autopsies were planned later to determine the cause of death,
the spokesman said.
	   Kyodo News agency said the bodies were tied with rope to a small
wooden raft. The green military uniforms had star-like badges on
them, Kyodo said.
	   On Dec. 18, South Korean navy ships sank a North Korean spy
vessel in a gun battle off South Korea's south coast. South Korean
troops later found the body of one of the ship's crew.
	   South Korean officials have said the vessel, described as a
low-slung, high-speed boat used to land or pick up spies, was
believed to be on an espionage mission. Officials said four men had
been spotted on the boat before it sank.

Report: Akebono to miss upcoming sumo tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Akebono will sit out next
month's Grand Sumo tournament to recover from a lower back injury,
a Japanese news agency reported Friday.
	   Akebono returned Thursday from Hawaii, where he was diagnosed
with a herniated disk and told it needs another four to six weeks
to heal, Kyodo News Agency reported.
	   Both the Japan Sumo Association and an official at Akebono's
stable could not confirm the report.
	   The New Year's Grand Sumo bout in Tokyo would be Akebono's
second missed tournament in a row. He sat out the Kyushu Grand Sumo
Tournament in November because of the same injury.
	   Akebono, formerly Chad Rowan of Hawaii, is the first foreign
sumo wrestler to reach the rank of yokozuna, sumo's top position.

Balloonists halfway around the world elude Pacific weather

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three balloonists streaking across the Pacific
Ocean were caught in a dangerous weather system early Friday that
threatened their attempt at the first nonstop balloon trip around
the world.
	   British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden soared past the halfway mark
around midday Thursday and were about 300 miles (500 kilometers)
north of Hawaii at 0530 GMT Friday.
	   But spokeswoman Lori Levin said early Friday that the balloon
was caught in a low pressure system that could cause the flight to
end.
	   She said that instead of moving east toward the United States,
the system was bringing them south toward Hawaii.
	   ``Unless they can correct that, they will have to make a sea
landing near Hawaii,'' she said.
	   But she said there were still ``plenty of chances'' to catch a
favorable wind. ``It's not an emergency but there's a 50-50 chance
that they might have to end the flight,'' Levin told The Associated
Press.
	   Levin said emergency rescue teams in Hawaii have been alerted to
the problem but the flight group has not yet asked for help.
	   Late Thursday, spokesman David Partridge said the crew had
entered a weather depression over the ocean that threatened to pull
their balloon out of the jet stream.
	   ``The jetstream gives us the best possible speed. If we fly low
it would take too long to get around. We would run out of fuel,''
he said.
	   The crew, planning to fly at 28,000 feet (8,500 meters) to
31,000 feet (9,500 meters) in a pressurized capsule, had expected
to reach North America sometime Christmas Day, most likely in the
evening over southern Canada or Washington State.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, however, and cannot
plan their courses and speeds precisely.
	   The 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot-air and helium balloon is
flying at about 145 mph (235 kph) at the same altitude as a jumbo
jet and could be visible from the ground if the weather is clear.
	   The eastward voyage began in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18,
and, if successful, would finish in Western Europe.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   China had said the balloonists could cross their territory below
26 degrees north latitude, but the balloon strayed from its path
Monday after navigating around storms and closed airspace over
Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   The Chinese asked the balloonists to land at an airfield, but
the balloon overshot the site and could not come down anywhere
else. With the help of British diplomats, the balloonists won
Chinese permission to continue.
	   However, Swiss-based challengers to the ICO Global balloon said
Thursday that the Chinese government had asked them to postpone
their attempt, scheduled to begin as early as Sunday from a Swiss
Alpine resort.

Olympic question: When is a gift a bribe?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There are gifts, favors and possibly bribes
among Olympic perks.
	   And then, there are bulldogs.
	   As the International Olympic Committee wrestles with its
greatest ethics scandal and three panels investigate alleged
bribery in Salt Lake City's bid for the Winter Games, IOC members
and potential host cities face the issue of where friendliness ends
and corruption begins.
	   Atlanta, like most bid cities, handed out gifts to visiting IOC
members, and at least one had four legs and a wet nose _ a bulldog
for a Cuban delegate.
	   ``You get caught up in the entertainment mode and you may do
things that stretch the rules,'' said Charlie Battle, who was in
charge of international relations in Atlanta's winning bid for the
1996 Olympics. ``You go over the top.''
	   In what may have been one of the most creative acts of
gift-giving, Atlanta boss Billy Payne gave a bulldog to IOC member
Manuel Gonzalez Guerra after he admired Uga, the mascot of Payne's
alma mater, the University of Georgia.
	   ``The biggest problem we had was getting Customs to let him take
the dog back,'' Battle said. ``They don't like people taking things
to Havana from the United States. Maybe they were afraid we were
hiding spy gear in his collar.''
	   There's no way of knowing if Guerra voted for Atlanta in the
secret balloting in Tokyo in 1990, and IOC rules now limit gifts to
a total of dlrs 150 a member - meaning any current canine giveaways
would probably involve a mutt.
	   In the two weeks since the Salt Lake Organizing Committee said
families of six IOC members received dlrs 400,000 in college
scholarships during its successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games,
Olympic organizers past, present and future have defended their
work amid allegations that the scandal extends far beyond Utah.
	   Marc Hodler, the IOC's senior member and one of its most
respected, said 5 to 7 percent of the committee's 115 members were
open to bribes and that vote buying occurred in the campaigns for
the 1996, 1998 and 2000 Olympics.
	   Olympic organizers and IOC members say they have done nothing
wrong and played by the rules, but they also acknowledged that
those rules are now being drastically tightened by the Salt Lake
case.
	   ``I would think that after what has happened, any U.S. city
bidding for the Olympics in the next 30 years is going to be so
squeaky clean they'll have Ivory soap for a sponsor,'' said Sue
Loder, coordinator of San Francisco's bid for the 2012 Summer
Games.
	   Loder's committee and seven other cities in the early stages of
the race to be America's choice for 2012 operate under 23 pages of
ethics guidelines set down by the U.S. Olympic Committee.
	   Among other things, the bidders are barred from any contact with
the IOC until the USOC picks its candidate in 2002, three years
before the international panel votes, and must keep gifts to a
total of dlrs 50 a person during the preliminary phase and dlrs 150
if they reach the finals.
	   ``The USOC has made it clear to us what we can and cannot do,''
said Nick Vehr, the head of Cincinnati's bid. ``We have their
entire undertaking on limits of gifts and such.''
	   The USOC had no rules on bidding when Salt Lake City finally won
the Olympics on its fifth try in 1995, according to committee
president Bill Hybl.
	   The IOC imposed its first limits in 1986, after the volume of
gifts and favors in the campaigns for the 1992 Games became
embarrassing. Those ``tokens'' included fur coats, diamond jewelry
and unlimited first-class travel for members who wanted one more
peek at cities like Paris, Barcelona and Brisbane.
	   ``There was a great deal of concern, because there were no
rules,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from the United
States.
	   Racks of minks and expensive porcelain are no longer wheeled
through the lobby of hotels housing IOC members _ a practice that
was blatant in Seoul _ but bidders still know how to catch a
member's attention.
	   Paul Henderson, who ran Toronto's 1996 bid, told The Toronto
Star that Atlanta ``set the standards'' that triggered the current
scandal. He said he suspected that Salt Lake City got the
scholarship idea from its U.S. predecessor.
	   Henderson offered no evidence to support his suspicions and
Battle denied any wrongdoing, saying a personal touch helped
Atlanta win, while staying within the rules.
	   He said organizers made sure a visiting IOC member received
proper care when he complained of chest pain during a 1990 visit.
The member, David Sikhulumi Sibandze of Swaziland, has been linked
to unusual gifts or favors in Salt Lake City, Sydney and Falun,
Sweden, which bid for the 1998 Winter Games.
	   Doctors in Salt Lake have confirmed providing free medical care
_ including plastic surgery _ for IOC members at the request of bid
organizers.
	   But Battle said Sibandze's hospitalization in Atlanta was an

Anwar urges Malaysians to rally for justice in Christmas message
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a Christmas message to
Malaysians, jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and
his wife have called on citizens to rally for justice.
	   ``Today more than ever before, there is a crying need for all
Malaysians to reaffirm their commitment to the struggle for
justice,'' Azizah Ismail, Anwar's wife, said in a statement.
	   Anwar's politically charged trial was in recess Friday and
scheduled to resume Monday after the holiday weekend. He is charged
with 10 counts of corruption and sodomy, but says the charges were
politically motivated.
	   ``Like Muslims, Christians and people of other faiths know that
there can be no peace without justice,'' Azizah said.
	   ``We are confident that with the prayers and support of men and
women of peace and goodwill everywhere, truth and justice will
triumph over lies and oppression,'' she added.
	   Azizah said Anwar was appreciative of the moral support that
Malaysians of all faiths have given him. He was sacked from the
government on Sept. 2.
	   Azizah heads a new pro-reform group and is the defacto leader of
her husband's political reform movement. She has pleaded to the
government for Anwar's release on bail during the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan, which began Sunday in predominantly Muslim Malaysia.
	   In a separate case, an appeal's court is expected to rule soon
on Anwar's formal request for bail.
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20, hours after organizing an
anti-government rally in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar Sept. 2 as deputy
prime minister and finance minister after deciding his one-time
protege was morally unfit to lead the Southeast Asian country.

Two December storms killed 41 in already-battered region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Two tropical storms earlier this month
killed about 41 people and caused damage estimated at 280 billion
dong (dlrs 20 million), an official at the central flood and storm
control committee said Friday.
	   ``These figures are preliminary statistics sent to us by the
localities,'' the official said in a telephone interview. ``The
death toll may be more or less. We are working out the final
figures.''
	   The storms, which hit Dec. 10-14, were the seventh and eighth to
batter Vietnam's central provinces this year, and also hit the
southern Mekong Delta, the country's rice basket.
	   The most seriously damaged provinces included Binh Dinh, Khanh
Hoa, Phu Yen, Quang Nam, Ninh Thuan, Quang Ngai in the center and
Ben Tre in the Mekong Delta, the official said.
	   The Youth newspaper said Friday that 728 houses were destroyed,
27,206 were submerged or damaged and 90,709 hectares (224,000
acres) of rice were inundated, including 8,456 hectares (21,000
acres) that were wiped out. Tens of thousands of hectares (acres)
of other crops also were damaged.
	   The storms also damaged 190 bridges and 202 kilometers (125
miles) of roads and sank 191 fishing boats, the paper reported.
	   Three floods last month killed 267 people and caused damage of
some dlrs 90 million to the 12 central provinces, a huge amount for
one of the country's poorest regions.
	   Until mid-August, the region was suffering from its worst
drought in at least half a century.

Indonesian worshippers hold Christmas mass in gutted church

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of Protestant worshippers
gathered for a Christmas Day service in a church gutted by fire in
a riot, praying and singing hymns within mottled and blackened
walls.
	   But the congregation stood under a new metal roof that replaced
the one that collapsed in flames last month, when a Muslim mob
attacked and ransacked the church hours after a Sunday service.
	   For weeks afterward, shaken but determined women had cooked and
brought food from home while their husbands, brothers and sons
installed wooden pews, metal folding chairs and a borrowed sound
system.
	   ``We have tried to renovate it by our own efforts,'' said Pang
Pak Im, a deacon at the Taman Sari Protestant church in Jakarta,
the sprawling capital of predominately Muslim Indonesia.
	   Built in 1990, the church was among more than a dozen that were
burned or ransacked on Nov. 22 after religious and ethnic tensions
triggered rioting that killed 14 people. Muslim rioters shouted
``God is great'' as they smashed stained glass windows and statues
of Jesus Christ.
	   A week later, Christians in the city of Kupang in eastern
Indonesia retaliated by setting fire to four mosques as well as a
Muslim school and hostel for Islamic pilgrims.
	   Beset by political uncertainty and a lingering economic crisis,
Indonesia has endured sporadic riots since the turbulent ouster of
former President Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian
rule.
	   Many people fear more violence ahead of parliamentary elections
set for June as newly formed political parties jostle for
influence. Student protests against Suharto's successor, President
B.J. Habibie, are expected to resume next year.
	   ``All of us are aware the situation in Indonesia is still
unpredictable,'' said Pang, who works as a manager of the
Indonesian subsidiary of EMI records. ``People advised us to
rebuild but we think it is unwise.''
	   Wary of the threat of more religious unrest, parishioners will
hold off on renovating the church for at least two years. Much of
the money they collect will be used to dispatch missionaries to
villages around the archipelago nation of 200 million people.
	   At a Christmas Eve mass, an odor of charred timbers lingered and
several policemen stood guard outside. Worshippers, most of them
ethnic Chinese, lit candles and sang ``O, Holy Night''
	   Ninety percent of Indonesians are Muslim, and the rest are
mostly Christian or Buddhist. Religious tolerance is enshrined in
the state philosophy, Pancasila, and Christmas is a national
holiday.
	   Many Christians are members of the Chinese minority, which has
often been targeted in times of social unrest because of its
relative wealth and perceived links to corrupt government
officials.
	   ``You have to be grateful for what you have,'' said parishioner
Mary Lengkong, a health lecturer at the state University of
Indonesia. ``But maybe deep down, there's a little fear.''

China's official media acknowledges electricity output dropping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Acknowledging one of the most tangible signs of
economic slowdown, an official Chinese newspaper reported Friday
that electricity output and consumption are declining for the first
time in two decades.
	   In the first 11 months of this year, electricity generation and
consumption in Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces, Chongqing and
Shanghai municipalities, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region dropped
markably, by 10 percent in the worst case, the Economic Information
Daily reported.
	   In northeastern China, Northeast Electric Power Group reported
it generated 87.6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in the
first ten months this year, 2.4 billion kwh less than the same
period last year, and its sales fell by three billion kwh to 83
billion kwh.
	   Experts attributed the shrinking electricity market in northeast
China to the declining industrial production, the report said.
	   Flooding in some areas was another major factor. Electricity
consumption by farmers in two northeastern provinces, Jilin and
Liaoning, dropped by 28 percent and 18.4 percent, respectively, in
the first 11 months of 1998.
	   Some economists have said declining electricity consumption was
evidence that China's economic growth was slowing more than
government officials would admit.
	   Officials questioned about the trend have usually attributed the
declines in power output and use to improved efficiency.

Initial test results show Taiwanese waste highly toxic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Initial test results of 3,000 tons
of mercury-tainted waste dumped recently in Cambodia shows the
material is highly toxic, a Taiwanese environmental group said
Friday.
	   Five deaths have been blamed on the waste, sent to Cambodia last
month by Taiwan's giant Formosa Plastics Corp., and the
panic-stricken exodus from the area where it was discovered two
weeks ago.
	   Environment Minister Mok Mareth said Friday that the first of
three analyses of the waste shows a mercury content of 675 parts
per million, a level environmentalists say far exceeds safety
standards.
	   ``I think that is definitely toxic. The regulation here in our
country is that it should be under 0.2 parts per million,'' Joyce
Wu, a member of the Green Formosa Front, said by telephone from
Taiwan.
	   The waste, believed to be compressed industrial ash, was quietly
dumped 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the seaport of Sihanoukville.
	   Villagers living near the site have complained of exhaustion and
diarrhea since the waste was discovered by environment officials.
	   A dock worker died a few days after cleaning the hold of the
ship that transported the waste from Taiwan, sparking riots and
hysteria in normally tranquil Sihanoukville, 185 km (115 miles)
southwest of Phnom Penh.
	   Thousands have fled the town in fear of the waste and violent
protests. Police said four people were killed in traffic accidents
on the road to the capital during the exodus.
	   Lee Chin-chun, general manager of Formosa Plastics, said
Thursday in Taipei that the waste has been treated and is not
hazardous to humans. He said the company would take the waste back
if asked by the Cambodian government.
	   Lee denied Cambodian government reports that dlrs 3 million in
bribes had been paid to get the shipment past corrupt officials but
acknowledged that the Cambodian agent who handled the transport and
disposal received dlrs 300,000.
	   Mok Mareth said tests from samples sent to a foreign laboratory
show the waste has a mercury content of 675 parts per million, but
cautioned that he would wait for results from two other labs before
drawing a final conclusion.
	   ``I think it is toxic but I cannot say for sure today,'' Mok
Mareth said. ``I need to see what the other laboratories say to
have a clear confirmation.''
	   Wu initially claimed disbelief when hearing of the test results,
but after checking with chemical experts said the mercury level was
possible if the waste was not treated properly.
	   The Cambodian government has suspended 29 port and customs
officials over the scandal and has arrested the president of the
local company that helped bring the waste into Cambodia.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen has demanded that waste be sent back to
Taiwan, and the government on Wednesday announced plans to sue
Formosa Plastics for environmental damages.
	   Taiwan's Environmental Protection Bureau has said it will send a
team to Cambodia along with officials from a third country to
examine the waste. The bureau said it will order Formosa Plastics
to take back the waste if it is proved toxic.
	   Hundreds of Cambodian soldiers wearing special protective
clothing imported from Thailand have been packing the waste into
metal barrels and shipping containers since Wednesday.
	   The operation is expected to take 10 days.

North Korea says it plans another satellite launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ North Korea is preparing to launch another
satellite despite international opposition, the country's official
media reported Friday.
	   North Korea fired a three-stage rocket on Aug. 31 that flew over
Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. North Korea said the rocket
launched a satellite. Japan has dismissed that claim, saying it was
a ballistic missile.
	   The North Korean report by its state-run Korean Central News
Agency and by the government newspaper Rodong Sinmun, confirmed
earlier reports in Russia and Europe suggesting another launch was
imminent.
	   The newspaper, cited in a report from the North Korean capital
by China's state-run Xinhua News Agency, said the next satellite
would be launched ``at a proper timing,'' and despite strong
opposition from the United States.
	   North Korea would not change its position on the issue, it said,
reiterating denials that the previous launch was a missile test.
	   ``It is foolish for the United States to expect any change in
our attitude,'' the KCNA report said. ``We are fully ready to
launch an artificial satellite again when we think it is
necessary.''
	   The Aug. 31 launch sharpened international fears over the
reclusive communist country's suspected missile and nuclear weapons
development programs.
	   Future launches could add further strain to tensions with Tokyo
and Washington over a 1994 accord under which Pyongyang promised to
abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program in return for
promises of aid in the form of oil shipments and a pair of civilian
nuclear power plants.

Russia launches military satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's strategic rocket forces successfully
launched a Kosmos-series military satellite from a northern
launching pad, officials said on Friday.
	   The satellite was launched atop a Kosmos-3M booster rocket at
11:02 pm Moscow time (2002 GMT) Thursday from the Plesetsk
cosmodrome, the strategic missile forces command said, according to
Russian news agencies.
	   The terse statement said the Kosmos-2361 satellite would be used
``in the interests of Russia's defense ministry'' and contained no
further details about its mission.
	   Russia now has some 130 military and civilian satellites in
orbit, about one fourth of the world's total. More than 80 percent
of the satellites have passed their service lifetime, but are still
used because the cash-strapped government cannot afford
replacements, officials said recently.
	   The Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 kilometers (312 miles) below
the Arctic Circle in northwestern Russia, is used mostly for
military satellite launches.

Tokyo high court dismisses appeal against U.S. military noise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An appeals court on Friday dismissed a lawsuit by
residents living near a U.S. Air Force base in Tokyo demanding
compensation from the U.S. government for past years of jet noise
and a reduction in flights, a court official said.
	   Upholding a 1997 lower court ruling, the Tokyo High Court said
that it does not have jurisdiction over the U.S. military, the
official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity and would provide
no further details.
	   Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who live near the Yokota Air Base in
western Tokyo, said they plan to appeal Friday's ruling.
	   Previous similar suits have demanded compensation only from
Japan's government, which provides land for the bases under a
mutual security treaty with Washington. The United States controls
the bases.
	   In the suit, filed in April 1996 on behalf of 3,100 residents,
demanded a ban on military flights between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. and
compensation payments of 600,000 yen to 800,000 yen (dlrs 5,100 to
dlrs 6,800) each. The total sum demanded from the U.S. government
was 3.3 billion yen (dlrs 28.4 million).
	   The group also wanted the Japanese and U.S. governments to
acknowledge an obligation to negotiate future compensation claims.
	   In an earlier similar suit, Japan's Supreme Court ruled in 1993
that the Japanese government should compensate residents near
Yokota for past noise, but it rejected the residents' demand for a
ban on night flights.
	   The United States maintains 47,000 military personnel in Japan.

Dollar falls slightly against yen, Japanese stocks finish higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar,
bond prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar dropped marginally against the yen
Friday on a day of sluggish trading due to the Christmas holiday
abroad. Japanese stocks finished higher.
	   The dollar bought 116.08 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down just
0.04 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 116.29 yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 91.22 points, or 0.67
percent, to close the week's trading at 13,797.95. On Thursday, the
average finished down 72.72 points, or 0.53 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar was traded in a
narrow range as many foreign players were absent for Christmas.
	   Traders shrugged off a slew of negative economic data released
earlier in the day, including the announcement of a new record-high
jobless rate. They said the unemployment gain came as no surprise
with the economy mired in the worst recession since World War II.
	   Japan's unemployment rate hit 4.4 percent in November, the
highest level since the current system of calculation was
introduced in the 1950s, the Management and Coordination Agency
announced.
	   Separately, the Japanese trade ministry said industrial output
fell 2.0 percent in November compared to the previous month, while
large store retail sales last month fell 1.5 percent on the year.
	   ``We all know very well that the Japanese economy is still in a
severe slump without having to see those numbers. And traders
aren't really in a mood for serious trading because of the holiday
season,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto of Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   On the stock market, rising share prices were led higher by a
rally in the banking sector, which had declined sharply in recent
sessions on worries that plunging bond prices would hurt industry
profits.
	   ``Bank shares, after facing massive selling pressure during
recent sessions, rebounded as fears on the bond market subsided,''
said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities Co.
	   But trading was conducted mostly by dealers closing out
positions as Friday was the last day to trade stocks for delivery
during 1998, traders said. Activity also remained sparse because of
the Christmas holiday in many foreign countries, they said.
	   ``There is no reason to trade shares,'' said Masaaki Higashida,
a deputy general manager at Nomura Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 8.78 points, or 0.82
percent, to 1,086.28. The TOPIX closed down 8.28 points, or 0.76
percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 227.20 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from 320.80 million shares Thursday. Advances
outnumbered declines 820 to 302, while 184 issues were unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.750 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.885 percent,
driving its price up to 100.40 yen from 99.31 yen.

Embattled Thai deputy minister resigns, cites poor health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Under fire for falling rubber prices,
Thailand's deputy agriculture minister has submitted his
resignation to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, citing failing health.
	   Thai media reported Friday that Somchai Sunthornwat, a member of
Chuan's Democrat Party, had cardiovascular problems that would
force him to quit the government after just three months in the
job.
	   Somchai, who is hospitalized, was cited by the Bangkok Post as
saying that Chuan originally asked him to stay on but then decided
to accept the resignation since it was based on health concerns.
	   Both Somchai and Chuan said the resignation had nothing to do
with the deputy minister's inability to shore up rubber prices,
which have remained low after slumping long before the current
government took office a year ago.
	   Rubber prices are currently about half of what they were in
1995. The Cabinet this week approved 4 billion baht (dlrs 110
million) to shore up rubber prices.
	   Somchai will not be replaced until after the submission of a
no-confidence motion next month over the opposition's contentions
that Chuan's government is corrupt and has mismanaged an economic
recovery.
	   Chuan has won wide praise internationally and remains respected
by most Thais for trying to reverse the economic crisis that
engulfed the Southeast Asian country in mid-1997 under the previous
administration.
	   The leaders of the former government, headed by Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, now head the opposition.

Report: Head of orthodox church criticizes priest's lavish
</HEADLINE>
lifestyles &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has
rebuked some priests for their love of expensive cars and mobile
phones at a time when many parishioners are struggling to live, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Patriarch Alexy II told a church meeting on Wednesday that some
priests had assumed the lifestyle of ``new Russians'' - newly-rich
people notorious for ostentatious displays of wealth. The remarks
were unusually blunt since the church rarely exhibits its internal
problems.
	   Some priests were out of touch with ordinary Russians, who are
struggling to make ends meet as the economy goes through its worst
crisis since the Soviet collapse, the report quoted Alexy as
saying.
	   ``One has to realize that a mass transformation of consciousness
is taking place among simple impoverished people,'' he said. ``They
see that they are not needed by anybody: Neither the state nor the
society is taking care of them, and now the Church too shows that
the rich and not the poor are closer to her.''
	   The patriarch also complained that some priests were forming
ties with dubious, possibly illegal businesses to obtain money.
	   Some parishes had ``business contacts with representatives of
private companies, banks and the shadow economy, who are interested
in legalizing their business through the Church. Should one say how
much this does not correspond with Christian ethics?'' he said.
	   He also said some priests were not doing enough to help the
poor.

Dominican hurricane victims brace for bleak Christmas

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Rosario Ramos never
bothered with Christmas trees before. But this year, living in
government housing after Hurricane Georges destroyed her home, she
figured some holiday cheer couldn't hurt.
	   So she and her son decorated a tree, then carried it outside her
shack for the neighbors to enjoy. The blinking lights did little to
lift her spirits.
	   ``I can't go on like this'' Ramos, 41, said, staring into the
shadows cluttered with other hastily built shelters. ``This coming
year I have to do something.''
	   For a month, Ramos lived in an elementary school-turned-shelter.
Then the government moved her to temporary housing built in the
Perla Antillana area of eastern Santo Domingo.
	   Here, nearly 1,600 families _ some of whom lost children,
fathers or mothers in the storm _ live in cramped buildings while
they try to rebuild their homes and lives. Some 100,000 people are
doing the same around the country.
	   The site is loud, dusty and depressing. ``We have one bathroom
for every six people, and not everybody knows how to live together
as a community,'' Ramos said.
	   Georges killed 283 people, caused dlrs 1.7 billion in damage and
left more than 300,000 homeless when it raked this Caribbean
country on Sept. 22. It smashed bridges and swelled rivers, washing
away entire neighborhoods and leaving villages incommunicado for
days.
	   As the government moves to consolidate the remaining refugees,
people like 52-year-old Ignacio Contreras have had to leave their
home towns for clusters of temporary housing near the cities.
	   Contreras, who did odd jobs to support himself and eight
children, had to leave his customers behind in Sabana Perdida, 20
miles (30 kilometers) away. He has been unable to find work.
	   ``If God doesn't give us a hand, it's going to be ugly next
year,'' he said.
	   Adalgiza Santiago, 32, sat next to him outside the government
aid center set up in the housing area. She's still living in one
room she managed to repair in her shanty near the Ozama River, but
has applied for one of the temporary homes because she is terrified
another hurricane will devastate it.
	   She's caring for four children and trying to fight off a case of
bronchitis, which she blames on the dampness by the river bank.
	   Officials say they intend to build another 10,000 temporary
homes. They sell meals to residents at 5 pesos (dlrs 35 cents)
each.
	   Ramos said the house is better constructed than her ramshackle
home in La Cienaga, a poor riverside neighborhood in Santo Domingo
that was devastated by the hurricane's floods.
	   But it's not home. The six shacks that make up each housing
block are crowded and loud, and their unpainted plywood walls and
metal walls rattle with the noise from a nearby construction site.
	   The waits to use communal bathrooms are long. And when it rains,
the housing area turns to a sea of yellow mud.
	   As she stood by the tree, a song played in the darkness beyond
the lights: ``What a sad Christmas it is without the Savior in your
heart.''
	   Ramos took a hand and wiped it wearily across her face.

China's legislature expected to pass securities law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After years of delay, a top committee of
legislators is expected to approve China's first national
securities law by Tuesday, the official newspaper China Daily
reported Friday.
	   The Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress
has discussed the latest draft of the law, and most members want it
passed before its current six-day session ends on Tuesday, the
report said.
	   The law would fill a regulatory vacuum that has left China's
nascent financial markets prone to illegal trading and bouts of
volatility.
	   Dwindling investor interest in the securities markets and
frequent scandals have led legislatures to push for the passage of
a national law that provides more-centralized regulation and legal
transparency.
	   The national legislature has considered at least four different
drafts of the law during the past six years. Previous versions were
not approved due to conflicts between various government ministries
involved in policing the stock market.
	   The latest draft of the law bans banks and state enterprises
from the stock markets, a point that is reportedly still being
debated.
	   Stock trading by state companies and banks ``will seriously
jeopardize the safety of state assets, fuel market speculation,
possibly manipulate the market and harm the interests of
medium-sized or small investors,'' said Qiao Xiaoyang, vice
chairman of the NPC's Law Committee, told the newspaper.
	   Another legislator, Standing Committee member Chi Haibin,
maintained that restricting one type of corporation's investments
wasn't consistent with China's free-market reforms.
	   ``If we do not allow state enterprises to enter the stock
market, but only allow collectively owned or private enterprises to
do so, it is unfair,'' the China Daily quoted Chi as saying.
	   Chi argued, however, that controls should be kept in place to
prevent bank loans from being used for illegal stock trading.
	   China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets were set up in the
early 1990s. But they, along with a clutch of futures exchanges and
bond markets, have been regulated mainly by a patchwork of rules
enforced sometimes from the national level, more often loosely from
the local level.
	   There are now about 827 companies listed on China's exchanges,
with total market capitalization of over 2 trillion yuan (dlrs
242.1 billion), the newspaper said.

In a generals' race, a beauty queen throws in her chapeau
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ This political outsider kept her uniform on
when she jumped into Israel's political fray.
	   In an election campaign increasingly dominated by former
generals, former beauty queen Pnina Rosenblum provided a fresh
face.
	   Well, a heavily made-up face. The former Miss Israel markets a
popular line of cosmetics in Israel, and the dyed blond didn't lack
for her creations when she ventured into the Jerusalem streets on
Thursday. Facial pancake gleamed on an unseasonably warm day.
	   ``What a beauty,'' exclaimed one fan, hugging Rosenblum at a
mall. ``I washed my hair with your shampoo this morning.''
	   Israel's parliament voted to go to early elections, largely out
of bipartisan unhappiness with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
security policies.
	   Tension with the Palestinians and trouble with Lebanon have
prompted a bevy of generals to name themselves candidates. Their
emergence has been attributed to a search for outsiders to replace
a political establishment that has worn thin for many in Israel.
	   The latest was the most recently-retired chief-of-staff, Lt.
Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who doffed his uniform for civilian
clothes Thursday.
	   Rosenblum, by contrast, was in full battle dress Thursday: form
fitting Penina Rosenblum black suit, mini skirt hovering over sheer
black Penina Rosenblum stockings.
	   She started her day by stopping at the Interior Ministry and
registering ... the Penina Rosenblum Party.
	   She'll head a list that will attempt to break the 1.5 percent _
or 45,000-vote _ threshold needed to get at least one seat
parliament.
	   That system has always encouraged marginal parties to run; also
registering Thursday were the ``Pensioners Power'' party, the
``Men's Rights in Marriage'' party and a new Romanian immigrants
party that has a simple platform: a Romanian-language television
channel.
	   For Rosenblum, the first order of business after registering the
party was calling Mom.
	   ``Hello, Mom,'' she said. ``I'm registered as a party!''
	   ``Mazal Tov!'' Mom said over the car phone speaker. ``Who's
running with you?''
	   ``Don't worry,'' she assured her. ``Good people.''
	   Later, Rosenberg would not say who was running with her, but she
quipped: ``My number two won't be a general.''
	   ``I am one of the people,'' Rosenblum told reporters, not long
after she was swamped by a crowd of autograph-hunting schoolgirls.
``I've worked very hard in my life. Now I want to use my experience
to help the simple people.''
	   Extracting a platform from the other-side-of-40 model wasn't
easy. She volunteered that she would crack down on bad checks.
	   What about Lebanon? Does she support withdrawal?
	   ``In an orderly fashion.''
	   Rabbinical students _ should they be forced into conscription?
	   ``In an orderly fashion.''

Initial test results in Cambodia show Taiwanese waste highly toxic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Initial test results of 3,000 tons
of mercury-tainted waste dumped recently in Cambodia show the
material to be highly toxic, a Taiwanese environmental group said
Friday.
	   Five deaths have been blamed on the waste, sent to Cambodia last
month by Taiwan's giant Formosa Plastics Corp., triggering a
panic-stricken exodus from the area where it was dumped.
	   Cambodian Environment Minister Mok Mareth said Friday that the
first of three analyses of the waste shows a mercury content of 675
parts per million, a level environmentalists say far exceeds safety
standards.
	   ``I think that is definitely toxic. The regulation here in our
country is that it should be under 0.2 parts per million,'' Joyce
Fu, a member of the Green Formosa Front, said by telephone from
Taipei.
	   The waste, believed to be compressed industrial ash, was quietly
dumped 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the seaport of Sihanoukville
last month and was discovered by environmental officials two weeks
ago.
	   Hundreds of soldiers wearing protective clothing imported from
Thailand have been packing the waste into metal barrels and
shipping containers since Wednesday.
	   The deputy governor of Sihanoukville, Khim Bo, said that the
operation is moving more slowly than expected and could take three
to four weeks.
	   Villagers living near the site have complained of exhaustion and
diarrhea since the waste was discovered.
	   A dock worker died a few days after cleaning the hold of the
ship that transported the waste from Taiwan, sparking riots and
hysteria in normally tranquil Sihanoukville, 185 km (115 miles)
southwest of Phnom Penh.
	   Thousands have fled in fear of the waste and violent protests.
Police said four people were killed in traffic accidents on the
road to the capital as people fled the area in a panic.
	   A second dump was discovered this week. Mok Mareth said that
samples were being taken for analysis from the 800 tons of refuse,
described in a May invoice as waste from processing oil, plastic
and steel powder.
	   Local newspapers say that the waste resembles video tape and
that bags holding it bear Korean writing. Investigators say the
dump is on the land of the local company that imported it, which
plans to use the refuse to make nylon rope.
	   Lee Chin-chun, general manager of Formosa Plastics, said
Thursday in Taipei that his firm's waste has been treated and is
not hazardous to humans. He said the company would take the waste
back if asked to do so by the Cambodian government.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen has demanded that waste be sent back to
Taiwan, and the government on Wednesday announced plans to sue
Formosa Plastics for environmental damages.
	   Taiwan's Environmental Protection Bureau has said it will order
Formosa Plastics to take back the waste if it is proved toxic.
	   Formosa Plastics' Lee denied Cambodian government reports that
dlrs 3 million in bribes had been paid to get the shipment past
corrupt officials, but acknowledged that the Cambodian agent who
handled the transport and disposal received dlrs 300,000.
	   Mok Mareth said tests from samples sent to a foreign laboratory
show the Taiwanese waste had 675 parts of mercury per million, but
cautioned that he would wait for results from two other labs before
drawing a final conclusion.
	   ``I think it is toxic but I cannot say for sure today,'' Mok
Mareth said. ``I need to see what the other laboratories say to
have a clear confirmation.''
	   Fu initially claimed disbelief when hearing of the test results,
but after checking with chemical experts said the mercury level was
possible if the waste was not treated properly.
	   The Cambodian government has suspended 29 port and customs
officials and arrested the president of the local company that
helped bring the waste into Cambodia.

Carrier anchors in strike mode as tensions persist in the Gulf

	   ABOARD THE USS CARL VINSON (AP) _ U.S. naval forces in the Gulf
were on high alert on Christmas Day as ``a lot of uncertainties and
tension'' remained following the airstrikes on Iraq, the commander
of a carrier battlegroup said Friday.
	   ``The mission is very difficult. We have a very confused state
of affairs right now following the strike that occurred on Iraq,''
Rear Adm. Alfred Harms said, referring to the attacks of Dec. 16-19
that aimed to punish the Baghdad government for its alleged
obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Some 20 warplanes, mainly F-14s and F-18s, from USS Carl Vinson
took part in the final night's strikes on Iraqi military and
communications sites. The carrier arrived in the Gulf on Dec. 19 to
relieve the battlegroup of the USS Enterprise, which sailed out of
the region Wednesday.
	   The admiral told reporters he did not think anybody knew how the
situation was going to develop.
	   ``That puts a huge responsibility on the Carl Vinson
battlegroup, and all of the forces here in the 6th Fleet, to be
ready for any eventuality,'' Harms said.
	   ``There's a lot of tension and a lot of uncertainties (in the
region) ... That is why we are here, to provide some stability ...
so peace will have the opportunity to flourish.''
	   The Carl Vinson was at anchor Friday as the Christmas season
took over the group of eight warships. Harms would not disclose
their location but said: ``We are in the Gulf region, and anywhere
here is within easy striking range of Iraq.''
	   Most of the crew aboard the 97,000 ton carrier are receiving a
half-day holiday, staggered at intervals since the ship dropped
anchor late Thursday.
	   Christmas Day began with the chaplain holding mass in the hangar
bay. Some 70 sailors sang carols among a dozen F-14 and F-18
fighters, which had been rolled to the sides to make room.
	   The service was scheduled to be repeated regularly for other
off-duty crew, as was the screening of the movies ``It's a
Wonderful Life,'' ``Scrooge'' and ``Home Alone.''
	   A Christmas tree, decorated with lights and tinsel, stood in
almost every mess on the ship.
	   Santa Claus arrived Thursday, stepping on to the flight deck
from an F-18 fighter. So too did about 57,000 pounds (25,900
kilograms) of mail from friends and families.
	   Some 2,000 sailors and pilots saw a 10-minute video Thursday of
the ship's departure from its home port of Bremerton, Washington.
The crew also saw pictures of the carrier's fighter bombers
dropping laser-guided bombs and firing anti-radiation missiles at
Iraqi targets.
	   A Christmas Day dinner for the 5,000 crew was scheduled to start
later Friday. Some of the Alaskan King Crab leg, turkey, prime
ribs, and Christmas pudding will be kept for late arrivals.
	   No flights were scheduled for Friday. Aerial missions, which
include patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq, were due to
resume Saturday.

Taiwan opposition politician wants to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian said
Friday that he would like to visit China to promote peace and help
reopen stalled dialogue between Taiwan and the mainland government.
	   ``I would like to begin a tour of dialogue if it could help
foster mutual respect and peace'' across the Taiwan Straits, Chen
said at the inauguration of Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who defeated Chen
earlier this month in the mayoral elections.
	   Chen is a member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
and is widely expected to be the party's candidate in a
presidential race in 2000.
	   The DPP's election setback was seen as having reflected voter
concern that the party, with its call for formal independence from
China, is incapable of dealing seriously with mainland relations.
	   ``We are willing to better understand China's sufferings, and
hope China can also understand ours,'' Chen said.
	   ``Only through mutual understanding and long-term dialogue can
we walk out of the darkness of the times,'' he said.
	   But Chen also urged Chinese leaders to face the reality that
Taiwan and China are two ``Chinese nations'' and neither one comes
under the other's sovereignty.
	   ``It would be difficult for us to break the stalemate if China
sticks to its one China policy and denies Taiwan's position,'' he
said.
	   Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan and froze dialogue with
the island in 1995 in anger over President Lee Teng-hui's visit to
the United States, which it viewed as a covert effort to push for
Taiwan's independence.
	   Taiwan and China split politically in 1949 after Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists lost a civil war to the Communist forces.

Taiwan unveils stimulus plan but economists remain skeptical
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan has unveiled another stimulus
package to help companies facing financial troubles, but economists
warned Friday that the short-term measures may not bring about an
economic recovery.
	   On Thursday, the government announced a plan to provide up to
120 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.8 billion) in state-backed
loans to companies having temporary cash-flow problems.
	   It followed the setup of an intervention fund of 283 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 8.7 billion) in November to prop up share
prices, which had plunged in the aftermath of a string of corporate
failures _ due in part to tighter bank credit policies.
	   ``The government is losing its credibility because ... it seems
to be more concerned with short-term relief for the stock market
than longer-term support for the economy,'' economist Kuo Wen-jeng
told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Several bankers said the latest measures fail to address
problems with credit-worthiness afflicting Taiwan's banking system.
	   ``The measures are aimed at increasing fund availability, but
the problem is not liquidity because there is plenty of liquidity
in the banking system,'' said Calvin Tseng, a vice president at
state-run First Commercial Bank.
	   ``The reason our loan portfolio is not growing very fast is
because of the increased risk in the market and concerns that the
loans will be used for speculation on the stock market,'' Tseng
said.
	   Justin Leverenz, the head of research at Credit Suisse First
Boston based in Taipei, urged the Central Bank to cut interest
rates to avoid the danger of property prices collapsing.
	   Some 40 percent of bank loans are collateralized with real
estate, so if property prices fell there would be far more problems
for the economy, Leverenz said. CSFB has lowered its growth
forecast for Taiwan to between 3.5 percent and 4 percent from the
previous forecast of 4.1 percent.
	   Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said on Thursday the bank
will maintain its current loose monetary policy into 1999, and
urged commercial banks to extend credit to financially healthy
companies.
	   The bank also said economic growth is expected to reach 5.1
percent next year, compared with 5.07 percent projected for this
year.

Thai Film Board again rejects remake of ``King and I'' with Jodie
</HEADLINE>
Foster
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Persistence failed to pay off on Friday
for filmmakers seeking permission from Thai authorities to shoot a
remake of the Hollywood classic ``The King and I'' on location in
Thailand.
	   The Thai Film Board, which had already rejected five revised
scripts as inaccurately reflecting the life of 19th century monarch
King Mongkut, did not even bother reading the latest draft in what
amounted to a final verdict against boosters who hoped to change
the minds of board members.
	   ``The answer is definitely no permission,'' said board official
Thipawadee Maenyard.
	   The board noted that the filmmaker, 20th Century Fox, announced
in November that it was moving shooting for the movie to Malaysia
and had made no promise to return to Thailand if the script was
accepted.
	   Shooting for ``Anna and The King,'' starring Oscar-winner Jodie
Foster and Hong Kong action hero Chow Yun Fat in the title roles,
is scheduled to begin in January.
	   Thailand has long been upset by the portrayal of Mongkut, a
revered Buddhist scholar and linguist, as a despot and buffoon in
``The King and I,'' for which Yul Brynner won an Oscar, and the
non-musical ``Anna and the King of Siam.''
	   Both are based on the much-criticized memoirs of Anna Leonowens,
the Victorian governess who Mongkut brought to Siam, as Thailand
was then known, to teach his children English.
	   Critics say she frequently repeated unproven gossip and
exaggerated her own importance in the Siamese court.
	   Defenders consider her a brave adventuress who defied the
conventions of her time and traveled alone to a country that few
Western contemporaries, especially women, had ever seen.
	   Thais still revere their monarchy and insulting the king is a
crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The law is almost
never enforced, but few Thais ever flaunt convention with insults
directed at the king.
	   Fox was keen to film the remake in Thailand, but officially gave
up last month, citing red tape and bureaucracy after several
revised scripts were rejected by the board.
	   The studio's local coordinator, Supinda Chakraband, fought on,
hoping to convince the highly conservative board that the new film
would be a chance to rectify past inaccuracies.
	   The board said Friday that there was little point in considering
the changes because Fox had failed to submit a letter promising to
film according to the latest script revisions.

Eight killed on Christmas Eve in KwaZulu-Natal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARGATE, South Africa (AP) _ Eight people were killed on
Thursday in a Christmas Eve raid by apparent gate-crashers to a
party, police said.
	   The victims that included two injured were celebrating Christmas
Eve with friends at their home when a group of men opened fire on
them, police spokesman Bala Naidoo said Friday.
	   It was not clear if the attack was connected to ongoing
political clashes in the area.
	   The alleged gunmen ``apparently wanted to gate crash the party
but were refused entry,'' Naidoo said. The attack occurred about 11
p.m. on the southeastern coast of South Africa. Seven people
survived the attack.
	   The attackers took the family's music system and fled, Naidoo
said.
	   President Nelson Mandela on Friday expressed shock over the
Christmas Eve attack.
	   ``I appeal to members of the public not to take the law into
their own hands and resort to any revenge attacks,'' Mandela said
in a statement from his home at Qunu, near Umtata in the Eastern
Cape.

Japanese stocks close higher on banking rally, dollar up against
</HEADLINE>
yen
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond prices and other
details.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A rally in the banking sector pushed up Japanese
stock prices Friday during an otherwise quiet session of
holiday-thinned trading. The dollar finished marginally higher
against the yen.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 91.22 points,
or 0.67 percent, to close the week's trading at 13,797.95. On
Thursday, the average finished down 72.72 points, or 0.53 percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.18 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.06
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level
of 116.29 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, bank shares rebounded from a recent
slump after rising bond prices eased investor concerns over turmoil
in the credit market. Bond prices tumbled last week following a
government decision to issue new bonds to cover massive fiscal
spending.
	   ``Bank shares, after facing massive selling pressure during
recent sessions, rebounded as fears on the bond market subsided,''
said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities Co.
	   But trading was conducted mostly by dealers closing out
positions as Friday was the last day to trade stocks for delivery
during 1998, traders said. Activity also remained sparse because of
the Christmas holiday in many foreign countries, they said.
	   ``There is no reason to trade shares,'' said Masaaki Higashida,
a deputy general manager at Nomura Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 8.78 points, or 0.82
percent, to 1,086.28. The TOPIX closed down 8.28 points, or 0.76
percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 227.20 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from 320.80 million shares Thursday. Advances
outnumbered declines 820 to 302, while 184 issues were unchanged.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar traded in a
narrow range as many foreign players were absent for Christmas. It
fell as low as 115.73 yen and rose as high as 116.34 yen.
	   Traders shrugged off a slew of negative economic data released
earlier in the day, including the announcement of a new record-high
jobless rate. They said the unemployment gain came as no surprise
with the economy mired in the worst recession since World War II.
	   Japan's unemployment rate hit 4.4 percent in November, the
highest level since the current system of calculation was
introduced in the 1950s, the Management and Coordination Agency
announced.
	   Separately, the Japanese trade ministry said industrial output
fell 2.0 percent in November compared to the previous month, while
large store retail sales last month fell 1.5 percent on the year.
	   ``We all know very well that the Japanese economy is still in a
severe slump without having to see those numbers. And traders
aren't really in a mood for serious trading because of the holiday
season,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto of Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.750 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.885 percent,
pushing its price up to 100.40 yen from 99.31 yen.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Acknowledging one of the most tangible signs of
economic slowdown, an official Chinese newspaper reported Friday
that electricity output and consumption are declining for the first
time in two decades.
	   In the first 11 months of this year, electricity generation and
consumption in Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces, Chongqing and
Shanghai municipalities, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region dropped
markedly, by 10 percent in the worst case, the Economic Information
Daily reported.
	   In northeastern China, Northeast Electric Power Group reported
it generated 87.6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in the
first ten months this year, 2.4 billion kWh less than the same
period last year, and its sales fell by three billion kWh to 83
billion kWh.
	   Experts attributed the shrinking electricity market in northeast
China to the declining industrial production, the report said.
	   Flooding in some areas was another major factor. Electricity
consumption by farmers in two northeastern provinces, Jilin and
Liaoning, dropped by 28 percent and 18.4 percent, respectively, in
the first 11 months of 1998.
	   Some economists have said declining electricity consumption was
evidence that China's economic growth was slowing more than
government officials would admit.
	   Officials questioned about the trend have usually attributed the
declines in power output and use to improved efficiency.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ After years of delay, a top committee of China's
legislators is expected to approve the country's first national
securities law by Tuesday, the official newspaper China Daily
reported Friday.
	   The Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress
has discussed the latest draft of the law, and most members want it
passed before its current six-day session ends on Tuesday, the
report said.
	   The law would fill a regulatory vacuum that has left China's
nascent financial markets prone to illegal trading and bouts of
volatility.
	   Dwindling investor interest in the securities markets and
frequent scandals have led legislatures to push for the passage of
a national law that could provide more-centralized regulation and
legal transparency.
	   The national legislature has considered at least four different
drafts of the law during the past six years. Previous versions were
not approved due to conflicts between various government ministries
involved in policing the stock market.
	   The latest draft of the law bans banks and state enterprises
from the stock markets, a point that is reportedly still being
debated.
	   Stock trading by state companies and banks ``will seriously
jeopardize the safety of state assets, fuel market speculation,
possibly manipulate the market and harm the interests of
medium-sized or small investors,'' said Qiao Xiaoyang, vice
chairman of the NPC's Law Committee, told the newspaper.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate hit a record high of 4.4
percent in November as companies struggling in the country's worst
recession in decades trimmed their work forces and suffered from a
wave of bankruptcies, the government said Friday.
	   The total number of workers shrank by 480,000 from a year ago to
64.81 million, marking the 10th straight month of on-year declines,
said the statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination
Agency. The total number of jobless stood at 2.91 million.
	   The November rate tops the previous record of 4.3 percent, set
in recent months. Worst hit were workers at medium-sized companies,
where employment fell by 1.4 percent from levels a year earlier.
	   The jobless rate _ the highest since the government started
measuring it in the 1950s _ also set another record: it was the
first time Japan's unemployment rate equaled that of the United
States, where the jobless rate also stood at 4.4 percent in
November, an agency official said.
	   The new unemployment figure comes as Japan is grappling with its
deepest recession since the end of World War II. Bankruptcy debts
have hit record highs, domestic consumption is stagnant and the
financial system is weighed down by massive bad debts.
	   The government does not expect a quick recovery. Taichi Sakaiya,
the head of the Economic Planning Agency, said Friday that the
employment situation would probably worsen before it gets better.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Industrial output at Japan's factories and mines in
November fell a larger-than-expected 2 percent compared to the
previous month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
said Friday.
	   With production down for the second month in a row, MITI
characterized the situation as remaining ``stagnant.''
	   ``Despite progress in inventory adjustment, the inventory to
shipments ratio is still at a high level, mainly due to weakness in
shipments,'' a ministry official told reporters.
	   The fall was considerably larger than the average forecast in a
survey of economists, who projected a 1.1 percent decline in
seasonally-adjusted production. The survey was conducted by Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   The government had predicted a 1.5 percent drop.
	   In October, the fall in output had been less than expected,
coming in at 1.2 percent.
	   Dragging down production in November was a plunge in the
manufacture of transportation equipment and general machinery, MITI
said.
	   Despite the drop, the ministry said output would rebound in
coming months, predicting a rise of 0.3 percent in December from
November, followed by a 1.3 percent rise in January.
	   ``Production will pick up on the back of higher output in
certain industries,'' the official said. ``But there still isn't
enough data to indicate that the economy has hit bottom.''
	   The ministry also announced Friday that retail sales fell for
the seventh month in a row.
	   Sales at Japan's major department stores and supermarkets in
November dropped 1.5 percent to 1.960 trillion yen (dlrs 16.9
billion) on the year, MITI announced, predicting another decline
next month.
	    &UR; ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Debt-strapped Philippine Airlines is
still holding talks to revive the national carrier with foreign
investors, including Cathay Pacific Airlines and Northwest
Airlines, a senior official said Friday.
	   ``In order not to disturb the talks, they are not disclosing
this to the public,'' presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora in a radio interview. ``They are talking in private.''
	   Zamora also said that the government is prepared to help the
airline ``under commercial terms'' but it will not to take over
PAL.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks in September following labor
disputes and mounting losses worsened by Asia's financial crisis.
Its problems worsened with a pilots' strike last June.
	   It then opened negotiations with Cathay Pacific, but the Hong
Kong carrier announced early December it was pulling out of the
talks.
	   Zamora did not say how Cathay Pacific officials agreed to resume
talks, although President Joseph Estrada has pledged to bring the
two sides back to the negotiating table.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu has said the airlines
disagreed over management control of PAL and the timing of Cathay
Pacific's capital infusion into the Philippine carrier.
	   Cathay Pacific also refused to put its money into PAL until
after a PAL rehabilitation plan has been approved by creditors and
Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission, Espiritu said.
	    &UR; ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ More than 30,000 Singaporeans will be out of
work by the end of the year, exceeding the government's
projections, the head of the city-state's largest union was quoted
Friday as saying.
	   ``In the fourth quarter, retrenchment has gone up compared to''
the previous three months, Cyrille Tan, head of the United Workers
of Electronic and Electrical Industries, was quoted as telling The
Business Times.
	   ``We estimate that it will exceed 30,000 for the year, which
means some 10,000 were laid off this quarter.''
	   The Ministry of Manpower had projected the year's total layoffs
would not exceed 30,000 in the country of 3.1 million people. The
unemployment rate for September was 4.5 percent, almost double
June's 2.3 percent, according to government figures.
	   Singapore is in the midst of one of the worst economic downturns
in its 33-year history. During the last recession in 1985, the
number of jobless totaled 19,529.
	    &UR; ___
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan has unveiled another stimulus
package to help companies facing financial troubles, but economists
warned Friday that the short-term measures may not bring about an
economic recovery.
	   On Thursday, the government announced a plan to provide up to
120 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.8 billion) in state-backed
loans to companies having temporary cash-flow problems.
	   It followed the setup of an intervention fund of 283 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 8.7 billion) in November to prop up share
prices, which had plunged in the aftermath of a string of corporate
failures _ due in part to tighter bank credit policies.
	   ``The government is losing its credibility because ... it seems
to be more concerned with short-term relief for the stock market
than longer-term support for the economy,'' economist Kuo Wen-jeng
told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Several bankers said the latest measures fail to address
problems with creditworthiness afflicting Taiwan's banking system.
	   ``The measures are aimed at increasing fund availability, but
the problem is not liquidity because there is plenty of liquidity
in the banking system,'' said Calvin Tseng, a vice president at
state-run First Commercial Bank.
	   ``The reason our loan portfolio is not growing very fast is
because of the increased risk in the market and concerns that the
loans will be used for speculation on the stock market,'' Tseng
said.
	   Justin Leverenz, the head of research at Credit Suisse First
Boston based in Taipei, urged the Central Bank to cut interest
rates to avoid the danger of property prices collapsing.
	   Some 40 percent of bank loans are collateralized with real
estate, so if property prices fell there would be far more problems
for the economy, Leverenz said. CSFB has lowered its growth
forecast for Taiwan to between 3.5 percent and 4 percent from the
previous forecast of 4.1 percent.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government generated a cash
deficit of 1.99 billion baht (dlrs 55 million) at the end of
November, the second month of the current fiscal year, the Finance
Ministry said Friday.
	   The ministry said that the government had a budget deficit of
4.25 billion baht (dlrs 118 million) but had an off-budget surplus
of 2.25 billion baht( dlrs 62 million).
	   The government's cash balance is the difference between the
budget balance and off-budget balance. The latter includes offshore
loans, special-purpose funds and deposits in commercial banks.
	   The Finance Ministry said that in November, the government
recorded a net income of 65.89 billion baht (dlrs 1.8 billion), an
increase of 22.2 percent from the same period a year ago.
	   There was an outstanding domestic debt of 676.58 billion baht
(dlrs 18.5 billion), up 0.8 percent from October, and an
outstanding foreign debt of dlrs 17.6 billion baht (dlrs 488
million), down 0.3 percent.
	   The domestic debt includes the multiple-year 400 billion baht
(dlrs 11.1 billion) in bonds allocated to Thailand's bank rescue
fund, which last year spent about 1 trillion baht (dlrs 27.7
billion) to shore up ailing commercial banks and finance companies.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Three balloonists streaking across the Pacific
Ocean were caught into a dangerous weather system early Friday that
threatened their attempt at the first nonstop balloon trip around
the world.
	   ``It's in the lap of the gods,'' the team's project director
Mike Kendrick, said Friday.
	   British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden got sucked into a low pressure
system overnight that brought the balloon down close to the surface
of the water about 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Honolulu,
Hawaii.
	   At 0830 GMT the balloon was stalled above the sea, traveling at
only 14 knots (16 mph or 26 kph), leaving the adventurers with two
choices, Kendrick told SKY News from the balloon's ground control
headquarters in England.
	   ``We can either land the balloon around the Hawaiian Islands,
where helicopters can get to them,'' he said, ``or we can try and
find an easterly wind _ somehow _ and have a crack at getting to
the American mainland.''
	   ``It's not looking great at the moment, I must admit,'' he said.
``But they are determined to find the wind. They are fighting for
it anyway.''
	   He said the bid is not in an emergency situation yet and that
the team have already found a wind, albeit a weak one.
	   ``It 's going to be a long, slow crawl back in the next few
hours to see if they can get the other side of this trough and
accelerate,'' he said. ``We want to fight this, we want to get in
that wind, we want to bring this back.''
	   A C-130 Hercules plane is airborne and measuring wind speeds and
helping to find a faster wind, said spokeswoman Lori Levin.
	   Levin said emergency rescue teams in Hawaii have been alerted to
the problem but the flight group has not yet asked for help.
	   The crew, planning to fly at 28,000 feet (8,500 meters) to
31,000 feet (9,500 meters) in a pressurized capsule, had expected
to reach North America sometime Christmas Day, most likely in the
evening over southern Canada or Washington State.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, but cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   The voyage of the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot-air and
helium balloon began in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18, and, if
successful, would end in Western Europe.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   China had said the balloonists could cross their territory below
26 degrees north latitude, but the balloon strayed from its path
Monday after navigating around storms and closed airspace over
Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   The Chinese asked the balloonists to land at an airfield, but
the balloon overshot the site and could not come down anywhere
else. With the help of British diplomats, the balloonists won
Chinese permission to continue.
	   However, Swiss-based challengers to the ICO Global balloon said
Thursday that the Chinese government had asked them to postpone
their attempt, scheduled to begin as early as Sunday from a Swiss
Alpine resort.

Dutch, British officials seize 19 tons of cannabis at sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In one of the largest North Sea
drug interceptions ever, Dutch and British customs authorities
seized 19 tons of marijuana from a vessel off the Netherlands
coast.
	   The joint operation took place Thursday about 200 kilometers
(120 miles) off the Dutch seacoast, Dutch television reported
Friday. Officials arrested 12 people including the two ringleaders,
a Dutchman and an Englishman from Sussex.
	   Their identities were not released in line with Dutch police
practice.
	   The cannabis shipment, with an estimated street value of 190
million guilders (dlrs 85 million), was intercepted as it was being
loaded from the vessel onto a smaller fishing boat, reports said.
	   Authorities said there were indications the drugs came from
North Africa for sale in the Netherlands, Britain and other
European countries. The seizure came after a long period of
surveillance.

Indonesian steel workers go on rampage to protest bonus cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of Indonesian workers at a
steel plant in East Java went on a rampage to protest cuts in their
bonuses, burning a car and damaging facilities owned by the
steelmaker, a company guard said Friday.
	   The PT Alma Surya Steel workers in Surabaya, the capital of East
Java, staged the protest on Wednesday after reading an announcement
saying annual bonus payments would be cut by 50 percent from the
amount they received last year.
	   The guard, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the angry
workers burned one car, damaged another and battered a security
post on company grounds.
	   Contacted by phone Friday, the guard said the situation had
returned to normal and that no one had been arrested for causing
the disturbance.
	   According to the daily Media Indonesia, the company usually paid
an annual bonus in December worth between one and 2 1/2 times a
worker's average monthly salary.
	   The management cited the current economic crisis affecting the
Southeast Asian nation for this years cuts, the newspaper reported.
	   The rampage was believed to be the first violent protest in the
country since Saturday, the start of the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan.

	   MARGATE, South Africa (AP) _ Eight people were killed on
Thursday in a Christmas Eve raid by apparent gate-crashers to a
party, police said.
	   The victims that included two injured were celebrating Christmas
Eve with
	   friends at their home when a group of men opened fire on them,
police spokesman Bala Naidoo said Friday.
	   It was not clear if the attack was connected to ongoing
political clashes
	   in the area.
	   The alleged gunmen ``apparently wanted to gate crash the party
but were refused entry,'' Naidoo said. The attack occurred about 11
p.m. on the southeastern coast of South Africa. Seven people
survived the attack.
	   The attackers took the family's music system and fled, Naidoo
said.
	   President Nelson Mandela on Friday expressed shock over the
Christmas Eve
	   attack.
	   ``I appeal to members of the public not to take the law into
their own hands and resort to any revenge attacks,'' Mandela said
in a statement from his home at Qunu, near Umtata in the Eastern
Cape.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to state bodies were badly decomposed,
unlikely to be from spy vessel sunk last week.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three bodies in green military uniforms found near
the coast of Japan early Friday appear to have been at sea too long
to be crewmen from a North Korean spy boat sunk by South Korea last
week, police said.
	   The bodies were spotted floating near a beach in the town of
Takahama at around 7:40 a.m. Friday (2340 GMT Thursday), said a
spokesman for the Fukui prefectural police.
	   All three were badly decomposed, which indicated they had been
in the Sea of Japan for much longer than one week, said the
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   That appeared to make it unlikely the bodies were from a North
Korean vessel sunk by South Korean ships on Dec. 18 in waters
between the Korean peninsula and Japan, he said.
	   The bodies were tied with rope to a small wooden raft. One had
what appeared to be a star-shaped North Korean insignia of rank
attached to a shirt collar, he said.
	   Autopsies were planned to determine the cause of death, the
officer said.
	   Takahama, located about 430 kilometers (267 miles) west of
Tokyo, is a fishing town facing the Sea of Japan near where the
North Korean vessel was sunk.
	   South Korean navy ships have been scouring the area since the
sinking, looking for debris and other North Korean vessels.
	   They have found the body of one of the vessel's crew but said
three more people were sighted on the boat before it went down.
	   South Korean officials have said the vessel, described as a
fast, low-profile boat used to land or pick up spies, was believed
to be on an espionage mission.

Ocean were caught into a dangerous weather system early Friday that
threatened their attempt at the first nonstop balloon trip around
the world.
	   ``It's in the lap of the gods,'' the team's project director
Mike Kendrick, said Friday.
	   British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden got sucked into a low pressure
system overnight that prompted them to bring the balloon down to
6,000 feet (1,830 meters) above to the surface of the water to look
for a stronger wind.
	   At 0930 GMT the balloonists, traveling at only 14 knots (16 mph
or 26 kph), were 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Honolulu,
Hawaii. With the balloon stalled at 24,000 feet (7,315 meters)
above the sea, they faced two choices.

Iraqi official press lashes out at France for lack of support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's official press lashed out at France
on Friday, accusing it of failing to support Baghdad during the
airstrikes and saying its latest proposals were hostile.
	   Al-Thawra, the official newspaper of the ruling Baath Party,
said France knew that the United States and Britain were going to
attack Iraq several weeks before the Dec. 16-19 attacks, ``and they
did not object to it.''
	   ``France is not totally innocent of the aggression, and its
latest recommendations are no less than part of the aggression. It
is the French way out of the Anglo-American problem,'' Al-Thawra
said in a front-page editorial.
	   France objected to the airstrikes that were undertaken to punish
Iraq for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors. The
French Foreign Ministry criticized the report of the chief weapons
inspector _ whose findings prompted the United States and Britain
to attack _ for a lack of clarity.
	   The inspectors were charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a process Iraq must complete
before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sanctions imposed
after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Earlier this week, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
proposed a restructuring of the weapons inspectorate to put the
emphasis on ``continuous control'' of Iraq's manufacturing of arms.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has rejected Vedrine's
suggestion, saying the issue was to lift the sanctions.
	   Al-Thawra ended its editorial by reminding France of ``what it
would lose if it lost Iraq.''
	   Before the 1991 Gulf War, in which French forces helped drive
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, France enjoyed close relations with
Iraq. Baghdad still has enormous debts to France and French oil
companies are known to want to reinvest in Iraq once sanctions are
lifted.

Chinese computer hackers who robbed bank sentenced to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Two brothers have been sentenced to death
for stealing 260,000 yuan (dlrs 31,000) from a state-owned bank in
China by manipulating its computer, a Chinese newspaper said
Friday.
	   Hao Jinlong and Hao Jingwen were sentenced Thursday in the
central city of Zhenjiang for robbing a branch of the Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China where Jinlong worked, the People's
Daily newspaper said.
	   The two men stole the money by opening 16 bank accounts in
September under false names, then breaking into the branch computer
and transferring money into the accounts, the newspaper said.
	   They tried to move the money to another bank, but could not
produce appropriate identification to retrieve the funds, it said.
The report did not specify how the brothers were caught, but said
they had repaid all the money.
	   The newspaper did not give any other details about the men or
say whether an execution date had been set.

Netanayhu's office denies report of Lebanon pullout plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the government under mounting pressure to
find a way to get Israeli troops out of Lebanon, a newspaper
reported Friday that the Cabinet would be presented this weekend
with a plan for a phased withdrawal. Government officials denied
the report.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said the prime minister had no intention to go forward
with any withdrawal from south Lebanon until security guarantees
are in hand.
	   The report came two days after Lebanese guerrillas launched a
hail of rockets across Israel's northern border in retaliation for
an Israeli airstrike that killed a Lebanese woman and her six
children. Israel called the civilian deaths an accident.
	   Israel and Shiite Muslim guerrillas have been engaged in a
guerrilla war in Lebanon since 1985. Guerrillas from Hezbollah,
along with the Lebanese government and Syria, demand that Israel
pull about 2,000 soldiers out of the Israeli-declared security zone
in south Lebanon.
	   Bar-Illan denied the report in the daily Maariv newspaper saying
that Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon, his foreign minister, were
intending to bring a plan for a gradual withdrawal from the enclave
Israel occupies in south Lebanon for discussion in the cabinet on
Sunday.
	   According to the report, Israel would begin such a phased
pullout before elections are held, probably in the next four
months.
	   Opposition lawmaker Efraim Sneh called the reported plan an
election ploy for the beleaguered Netanyahu. Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shia Segal issued a flat denial of the Maariv story and
called Sneh's comments as ``plain evil.''
	   For the last two years Sharon has publicly stated his support of
a gradual pullout of troops from Lebanon, but Segal said that
Sharon had no intention of making any new Lebanon proposal on
Sunday.
	   The Cabinet has been holding ongoing discussions on Lebanon. The
daily Haaretz reported Friday that Netanyahu and opposition leader
Ehud Barak had held a round of meetings over the summer at which
they agreed to make restarting negotiations with Syria a priority.
	   Bar-Illan confirmed that discussions took place between the two,
but he denied reports that the topic of land concessions on the
Golan Heights ever arose.
	   The public pressure for a pullout from Lebanon has been mounting
along with a steady increase in the death toll among young soldiers
serving there. On Friday, 1st Sgt. Doron Benzigri, 26, a border
policeman who suffered head injuries in a clash with Hezbollah
forces more than three years ago, died without having ever regained
consciousness, Israel Radio said.

Former U.N. chief visits Cambodia to pledge aid, boost French
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Five years after the United Nations
organized landmark elections in Cambodia, former U.N. chief Boutros
Boutros-Ghali pledged Friday to push for more aid to the struggling
nation.
	   Arriving in Phnom Penh on a tour of former French colonies in
Indochina, Boutros-Ghali was expected to promote the use of the
French language as secretary general of the International
Francophone Organization.
	   ``There is now a new reconciliation between the different
leaders of the country and I hope to be able to offer more
cooperation through the International Francophone Organization,''
Boutros-Ghali said.
	   Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian diplomat, was U.N. secretary general
when the United Nations dispatched 20,000 peacekeepers and spent
dlrs 2 billion to hold elections in Cambodia in 1993.
	   The elections resulted in an awkward joint premiership by
longtime rivals Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh that collapsed
in July 1997 when the prince was toppled in a bloody coup.
	   On Friday, Boutros-Ghali praised the recent formation of a new
government _ formed following months of wrangling after new
elections in July _ and said he would work to provide more
assistance for Cambodia.
	   The new agreement, under which Hun Sen is prime minister and the
prince is president of the National Assembly, has paved the way for
a resumption of aid sharply curtailed after last year's coup.
	   Boutros-Ghali, who spent the past several days in Laos, another
former French colony, is scheduled to meet both Hun Sen and
Ranariddh during his five-day visit.
	   French remains more widely spoken in Cambodia than in Laos or
Vietnam and is the preferred language of King Norodom Sihanouk, the
prince's father.
	   French-language education is slipping among younger Cambodians,
however, who generally prefer to learn English.

Turkish Cypriots demand increased security at buffer zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriots have demanded increased
security measures at a U.N. buffer zone after shots were fired
across the line separating the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sectors,
news reports said Friday.
	   Assailants fired 10 shots at Turkish Cypriot guards late
Thursday at Aheridu (known as Guvercinlik in Turkish), near the
port of Famagusta, the Turkish Cypriot news agency, said. The
guards fired two shots in retaliation.
	   There were no injuries.
	   Thursday's shooting was the fourth in a string of similar
shooting incidents over the past few months at the U.N.-patrolled
buffer zone that separates the Turkish and Greek communities.
	   ``Such attacks and provocation, which are beginning to test the
limits of our patience and tolerance, could lead to sad results,''
said a statement issued by Turkish Cypriot security forces.
	   The statement said officials had formally complained to U.N. and
British forces, demanding ``more efficient'' security measures at
the 180-kilometer (113-mile) zone.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in forces
following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in the north, some of which are
positioned only yards away from Greek Cypriot troops.

France, Laos sign rural development project agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ France has signed a three-year
agreement with Laos to provide 30 million francs (dlrs 5.6 million)
for rural development in the Southeast Asian nation, the official
Laotian news agency, KPL, reported Friday.
	   The aid will be used for development projects in four southern
districts of Sayaboury province and to help promote market-oriented
production, KPL reported.
	   The agreement was signed Wednesday by Thonphachanh Sonnasinh,
director of the Laotian foreign economic cooperation department,
and Gerard Larose, director of the French agency for development
for Laos.
	   The landlocked, mountainous country of 4.7 million people, a
former French colony, is one of the world's poorest nations. France
is a major aid provider.
	   The agreement was signed during the recent visit of Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, the former U.N. secretary general who now heads the
International Francophone Organization promoting the French
language.

Report: Eleven people executed in China for drug trafficking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Authorities have executed 11 people for drug
trafficking in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen near Hong
Kong, a Shenzhen newspaper reported.
	   The Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court sentenced a total of 17
people for trafficking drugs in seven different cases, the Shenzhen
Special Zone Daily reported Thursday. The six who escaped death
sentences were given life prison terms, the paper said.
	   One of those executed, 20-year-old Zhuang Jianyong, had arranged
with a dealer for the sale of 400 grams (14 ounces) of heroin at a
travel agency, it said.
	   Police arrested Zhuang and an accomplice at the scene and
confiscated 390 (13.6 ounces) grams of heroin, the newspaper
reported.
	   Zhuang and 10 others were executed by gunshot immediately after
their sentencing on Wednesday, it added.
	   The severe sentences are seen as evidence of the Chinese
government's determination to curb the fast-growing trade in
illegal drugs.
	   China uses the death penalty more liberally than any other
nation. London-based Amnesty International recorded 1,876
court-ordered executions last year, more than the combined total
for the rest of the world.

Serb attack deals new setback to shaky Kosovo peace accord

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a Serb offensive against
an ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold in Kosovo, both sides are
vowing to keep fighting, dealing a new blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the region.
	   International peace verifiers said an ethnic Albanian girl was
killed in the town of Podujevo by a sniper in the Christmas Eve
offensive. They had no other details.
	   A statement from the Yugoslav army corps in Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, said two soldiers were wounded in a ``terrorist attack''
Thursday on a military convoy in northern Kosovo.
	   The army said its convoy was on ``regular practice activities''
when it came under automatic fire and hand grenade attacks.
	   ``The Yugoslav army returned fire and destroyed the terrorist
group,'' the statement concluded. Police also reported they
captured a 24-year-old ethnic Albanian, Daut Rahmani, accused of
killing two pro-Serb ethnic Albanians this week at a cafe in the
town of Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of Pristina has sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills. An
Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by an artillery shell in the village of Glavnik, and ethnic
Albanians said several others were injured.
	   A complete casualty count, however, was unavailable.
	   The attack came after U.S. and NATO officials warned both sides
against violence, which could threaten a fragile Oct. 12
cease-fire. That deal ended most of the fighting between government
forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for Kosovo
from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice premier, Vojislav
Seselj, said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the
terrorists.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for the province's
independence, stopped short of abrogating a separate cease-fire it
proclaimed unilaterally just before the October deal was reached.
	   In a statement issued in Pristina, however, the rebels said they
would ``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means
available.''
	   Yugoslav army soldiers backed by tanks and artillery struck at
rebel-occupied villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles)
north of Pristina, purportedly searching for gunmen who killed a
Serb policeman three days before.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and in vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   ``Both sides have been looking for trouble and found it,'' said
William Walker, the American head of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe's verification force monitoring the
October accord. He expressed frustration at the apparent lack of
will for a peaceful settlement.
	   The OSCE reported heavy gunfire in the Podujevo area.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC television that
the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments''
undertaken in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' Solana said.
	   In neighboring Albania, the Foreign Ministry called for NATO to
intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the overwhelming
majority.
	   Serb police said they encountered ``fierce fire'' but
``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel stronghold
Lapastica, in a statement distributed Thursday night by the
Yugoslav government's Tanjug news agency.
	   In London, a KLA political representative, Pleurat Sejdru, told
BBC-TV that the cease-fire ``doesn't have any sense to be in
place.''
	   The U.S. and French governments condemned the Serb attack. The
State Department also condemned all breaches of the cease-fire,
including provocative attacks committed by elements of the KLA.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   That phase ended with an agreement between Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, which averted threatened NATO airstrikes.
But diplomatic efforts to forge a long-term formula for Kosovo's
future have stalled, with both sides rejecting U.S. proposals.

Chechnya's Islamic court suspends parliament, fires officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a blow to Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov,
the top Islamic court in the breakaway republic suspended the
parliament and fired several senior officials for ``collaboration''
with Russians, news reports said on Friday.
	   The Supreme Shariah Court also found Maskhadov guilty of
appointing the officials, whom it said assisted Russia's
``occupation regime'' during the 1994-96 independence war, and
warned him against such actions in the future.
	   In a ruling announced late Thursday, the court also dismissed
Maskhadov's wife Kusama as head of a charity, citing
``inadmissibility of women holding top posts in an Islamic state,''
the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported.
	   The court ruled to suspend the pro-president Chechen parliament,
saying its activities contradicted Islamic norms, and ordered it be
replaced with a council of top military commanders. It was not
clear what the court meant by suspending parliament or if the order
would be obeyed.
	   The court also dismissed Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur
Tagirov along with the local airline chief, tax boss and Chechnya's
envoy to Russia.
	   The court's verdict came after an appeal from a group of
prominent Chechen warlords, who accused Maskhadov of breaking
Chechen law by maintaining close relations with Russia and had
demanded his ouster.
	   Chechnya has run its own affairs since defeated Russian troops
withdrew in 1996, but no country has recognized its independence
bid and Moscow continues to consider the southern republic a part
of Russia.
	   Maskhadov won presidential elections almost two years ago by an
overwhelming margin, and retains widespread support despite his
failure to restore stability and combat kidnapping and other crime.
	   Hundreds of people have been abducted for ransom in Chechnya in
recent years. In an unusually gruesome display of lawlessness, four
Western captives were beheaded earlier this month.

Two killed in clash between gangs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A clash between two rival gangs in
the Tajik capital left two people dead and one wounded, officials
said Friday.
	   The clash highlighted the continuing instability in the former
Soviet republic in Central Asia, reeling from a five-year civil
war.
	   Government officials did not identify the groups or explain what
the clash was about.
	   Despite a peace treaty between the hardline government of
President Emomali Rakhmonov and the opposition last year, periodic
clashes have continued. Officials have failed to rein in numerous
warlords.
	   The clash Thursday ended after opposition leaders intervened.
The opposition headquarters refused to give any further details.
	   Shootings, abductions and other violence have remained
widespread in the impoverished mountainous nation.
	   Last month, more than 200 people were killed in several days of
fighting between government troops and a group of rebels.

Chinese dissident faces possible death penalty in trial

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident charged with endangering
state security could face a death sentence for allegedly telling
U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia about farmers' protests.
	   Zhang Shanguang, who already has served a seven-year-long jail
sentence for labor rights campaigning, will go on trial Sunday in
Huaihua city in the southern province of Hunan, a official of the
court confirmed Friday.
	   The official refused to detail the charges or give his name.
	   But Human Rights in China, a New York-based group, said Friday
that Zhang was accused of ``illegally providing intelligence to
overseas enemy organizations and people.''
	   According to China's criminal code, conviction generally is
punished with a jail term but the court can apply the death penalty
if it deems that national interests were seriously endangered.
	   Zhang's wife, Hou Xuezhu, said he was interviewed by Radio Free
Asia in March and discussed excessive fees and taxes charged to
Chinese farmers by local officials. She said he did nothing to
break the law and should be released.
	   Human Rights in China said Zhang had told the network about a
demonstration by 70 to 80 farmers in Hunan province's Xupu county
and about another protest by farmers angered by excessive taxes
that turned violent and resulted in deaths.
	   Radio Free Asia has angered Chinese officials with reports on
human rights and other issues.
	   The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
in China, a Hong Kong-based group which also reported Zhang's
impending trial, said the 45-year-old told overseas media and human
rights groups about protests by unemployed workers. But the group
did not mention Radio Free Asia.
	   Human Rights in China said Zhang would plead innocent.
Prosecutors maintain that Zhang is a repeat offender who should be
severely punished, it said.
	   Zhang was initially jailed after a nationwide crackdown that
followed the crushing of democracy demonstrations in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   His latest legal case follows the trials of Xu Wenli, Qin
Yongmin and Wang Youcai, three of China's most prominent
dissidents. They were charged with endangering state security under
different clauses of the law and sentenced this week to 13, 12 and
11 years respectively for trying to organize the China Democracy
Party.
	   Amid the arrests and trials, Chinese leaders have declared they
will destroy challengers to Communist Party rule. President Jiang
Zemin ordered law enforcement officials Wednesday to eliminate any
threats to ``social stability.''
	   Zhang, who had been preparing to set up an association to
protect laid-off workers' rights, has been detained since July,
following U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China.
	   The Huaihua court decided to try him on Sunday to clear a
backlog of cases before the year's end. The court official said
staff at the tribunal were working overtime for the trial.
	   In another development, authorities in Beijing on Wednesday
ordered the China Development Union to stop holding Saturday
discussion groups about democracy and economic reforms. The Hong
Kong monitoring center said the group's director, Peng Ming, agreed
there would be no more discussions effective this week.
	   The Hong Kong center also reported two Chinese democracy
activists who had residency permits in the United States, Zhang Lin
and Wei Yongbin, slipped into China in early November and have been
missing since mid-November, possibly because of detention.
	   China has refused to let many democracy activists in exile
return legally. Zhang and Wei were not members of the China
Democracy Party and had announced they were breaking ties with
exile groups advocating democracy, the center said.
	   In the recent trials, links to Chinese democracy campaigners in
exile were viewed as a crime.

Russian parliament ratifies friendship treaty with Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers ratified Friday a long-delayed
friendship treaty with Ukraine after the Russian government warned
that rejection would push Kiev toward closer links with NATO.
	   The parliament's lower house, the State Duma, voted 244-30 to
ratify the treaty signed by Russia's Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma in May 1997.
	   Ukraine's legislature overwhelmingly ratified the treaty last
January, but the Communist-dominated Duma had balked at approval,
demanding that Ukraine stop cooperation with NATO. The treaty
commits the two nations to peaceful relations and resolves some
territorial issues.
	   Ukraine has been participating in NATO's Partnership for Peace
program, angering Russian nationalists who oppose NATO plans to
expand into Central and Eastern Europe.
	   Many Russian politicians, including powerful Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, claim that Sevastopol, a port on Ukraine's Crimean
Peninsula, belongs to Russia.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who addressed the Duma
before the vote on Friday, urged the lawmakers to forego their
claims on the Crimea and other demands and ratify the treaty.
	   ``Putting territorial demands to Ukraine would not only derange
bilateral relations for a long time, but also violate the
international norms and seriously complicate the situation in
Europe,'' he said.
	   Refusal to ratify the treaty would strengthen those forces in
Ukraine who ``favor even closer relations with NATO,'' Ivanov said.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and most other faction leaders
supported the treaty during the debate. The only voice of dissent
was that of ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who opposed the
ratification, calling the treaty a ``product of anti-Russian
forces.''
	   ``Pro-western forces dominate the Ukrainian politics, and they
need this treaty to legalize the existing situation,'' he said.
	   The Duma also passed Friday a resolution, calling on the
Ukrainian parliament to say that Kiev wasn't going to join NATO.
	   ``We hope that the Ukrainian parliament would take the right
stance on this issue important for our mutual security,'' the
resolution read.

Cypriot archbishop slams the West over Turkish occupation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: single name Chrysostomos is correct &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The head of the Cyprus Orthodox Church
criticized the Christian world on Christmas day for tolerating the
25-year Turkish occupation of the northern third of Cyprus.
	   ``The joyful message of Christmas is not being heard throughout
our island today. Our churches in the occupied towns and villages
are silent, desecrated and profaned by the Turkish invader,''
Archbishop Chrysostomos said in a message read in all churches in
the southern part of the island during the Christmas Day mass.
	   ``Our agony over the continuing occupation grows as we view the
apathy and indifference of humanity, and even the so-called
Christian nations, before the suffering and injustice committed
against our people,'' the archbishop said.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   It is unusual for the archbishop to speak out against the
Christian world.
	   His message appears to reflect the feelings of frustration and
tension on the island, which have been risen recently with the
Cypriot government's decision to import Russian anti-aircraft
missiles. Turkey has vowed to prevent the missiles' deployment,
expected in the coming weeks, saying they threaten its air
supremacy in the region.
	   The archbishop appealed to the world to press for the
implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions that call
for the reunification of Cyprus and the withdrawal of the 35,000
Turkish troops.

Japanese and Thai markets rise; other Asian bourses closed for
</HEADLINE>
holiday

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Japanese and Thai share prices rose Friday, but
most other Asian stock markets were closed for the Christmas
holiday.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average picked up 91.22
points, or 0.67 percent, to close the week's trading at 13,797.95.
On Thursday, the average finished down 72.72 points, or 0.53
percent.
	   Bank shares rebounded from a recent slump after rising bond
prices eased investor concerns over turmoil in the credit market.
Bond prices tumbled last week following a government decision to
issue new bonds to cover massive fiscal spending.
	   Traders shrugged off negative economic data released earlier in
the day, including the announcement of a new record-high jobless
rate. They said the unemployment gain came as no surprise with the
economy mired in the worst recession since World War II.
	   Japan's unemployment rate hit 4.4 percent in November, the
highest level since the current system of calculation was
introduced in the 1950s, the Management and Coordination Agency
announced.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 116.18 yen in late
afternoon trading, up 0.06 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but
below its late New York level of 116.29 yen overnight.
	   In Bangkok, the key Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index rose
9.23 points, or 2.7 percent, to 356.16 in thin trading.
	   Dealers said attributed the surge to investors _ mostly
short-term retail players _ who bought shares in the finance and
banking sectors.
	   Traders said Thai retail investors were betting on financial
stocks because should the index surge next year as expected,
financial stocks would likely be the first to rise.
	   Financial markets were closed in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, New Zealand, and
Taiwan for the Christmas holiday.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a Serb offensive against
an ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold in Kosovo, both sides are
vowing to keep fighting, dealing a new blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the region.
	   International peace verifiers said an ethnic Albanian girl was
killed in the town of Podujevo by a sniper in the Christmas Eve
offensive. They had no other details.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said at least
nine people, including a woman and a 6-year-old girl, were killed
in the Christmas Eve offensive and a large, unspecified number were
wounded.
	   The government action was ``revenge aimed at killing 10 ethnic
Albanians for one killed Serb,'' the ethnic Albanian center said in
a statement.
	   There are no fresh reports of fighting Friday. But the ethnic
Albanians claimed Yugoslav army tanks were headed Friday for the
rebel stronghold of Lapastica and that the area was under strict
control of Serb forces.
	   A statement from the Yugoslav army corps in Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, said two soldiers were wounded in a ``terrorist attack''
Thursday on a military convoy in northern Kosovo.
	   The army said its convoy was on ``regular practice activities''
when it came under automatic fire and hand grenade attacks.
	   ``The Yugoslav army returned fire and destroyed the terrorist
group,'' the statement concluded. Police also reported they
captured a 24-year-old ethnic Albanian, Daut Rahmani, accused of
killing a pro-Serb ethnic Albanian this week at a cafe in the town
of Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of Pristina has sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills. An
Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by an artillery shell in the village of Glavnik, and ethnic
Albanians said several others were injured.
	   The attack came after U.S. and NATO officials warned both sides
against violence, which could threaten a fragile Oct. 12
cease-fire. That deal ended most of the fighting between government
forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for Kosovo
from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice premier, Vojislav
Seselj, said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the
terrorists.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for the province's
independence, stopped short of abrogating a separate cease-fire it
proclaimed unilaterally just before the October deal was reached.
	   In a statement issued in Pristina, however, the rebels said they
would ``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means
available.''
	   Yugoslav army soldiers backed by tanks and artillery struck at
rebel-occupied villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles)
north of Pristina, purportedly searching for gunmen who killed a
Serb policeman three days before.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and in vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   ``Both sides have been looking for trouble and found it,'' said
William Walker, the American head of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe's verification force monitoring the
October accord. He expressed frustration at the apparent lack of
will for a peaceful settlement.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC television that
the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments''
undertaken in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' Solana said.
	   In neighboring Albania, the Foreign Ministry called for NATO to
intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the overwhelming
majority.
	   Serb police said they encountered ``fierce fire'' but
``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel stronghold
Lapastica, in a statement distributed Thursday night by the
Yugoslav government's Tanjug news agency.
	   In London, a KLA political representative, Pleurat Sejdru, told
BBC-TV that the cease-fire ``doesn't have any sense to be in
place.''
	   The U.S. and French governments condemned the Serb attack. The
State Department also condemned all breaches of the cease-fire,
including provocative attacks committed by elements of the KLA.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   That phase ended with an agreement between Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, which averted threatened NATO airstrikes.
But diplomatic efforts to forge a long-term formula for Kosovo's
future have stalled, with both sides rejecting U.S. proposals.

	   LURIN, Peru (AP) _ Walking through a tough part of Lima one day,
Father Joe saw something tiny rustling under a pile of dirty
newspapers in an alley. It was a boy and a girl preparing a place
to sleep.
	   The sight made Joseph Walijewski, a Polish American Catholic
priest from Grand Rapids, Mich., decide to fulfill his lifelong
dream and open a home for abandoned children. His vision was
inspired by the 1937 Hollywood movie ``Boys Town,'' which told the
true story of Father Flanagan and the City of Little Men.
	   ``I'd dreamed of opening an orphanage run by children ever since
I saw the film as a boy,'' says the outgoing Walijewski, 74, known
as ``Father Joe'' or ``Joe the Pole'' to his friends.
	   Twelve years ago Walijewski founded the Casa Hogar Juan Pablo II
_ Pope John Paul II's Home _ an orphanage tucked amid desert hills
an hour's drive outside Lima, the capital of this Andean nation of
25 million people.
	   The five-acre (two-hectare) compound grew and now provides a
home for 110 children, ages three to 18, who live in 11
``families'' headed by volunteers who serve as surrogate parents.
	   The children are not up for adoption. ``This is their home,''
Walijewski says emphatically.
	   Looking more like a Polish meat packer than a priest in his work
clothes and heavy shoes, the burly Walijewski is swarmed by
smiling, squealing children, who seem to genuinely love him and be
happy in the orphanage.
	   His mouth twists off to one side and his green eyes bulge when
he talks, like Popeye the sailor.
	   ``Many of the children have never known a home and we are trying
to give them the feeling they have a family,'' he said.
	   From a chapel atop a hill inside the compound, Walijewski can
see the rows of straw and cardboard hovels perched on barren sand
dunes that form Lurin, the surrounding shantytown. It reminds him
of the abject poverty from which the orphans come.
	   Inside the orphanage, the children tend a vegetable garden and
raise chickens and ducks. They go to school in Lurin and sleep in a
large, two-story dormitory at the orphanage.
	   Daniel ``No Name,'' 9, smiles in greeting. Daniel can hear, but
cannot speak, making only guttural sounds. Large almond eyes look
out from an oval face framed by spiky black hair.
	   Police brought Daniel to the orphanage four years ago after they
found him wandering Lurin's streets. No one knows his name or where
he comes from. He cannot tell his story. The only hint to his past
are small scars that cover his face.
	   He has blossomed at the orphanage, losing his fear of adults.
When asked if he misses life outside the orphanage, Daniel shakes
his head no and clutches tightly to Walijewski's leg.
	   ``Without Father Joe most of these children would be dead,''
says San Francisco-native Kathy Cundiff, the head of the Friends of
Casa Hogar, whose members donate their time and effort to the
orphanage.
	   The orphanage is financed by private donations, mainly from the
United States. It opened in 1986 with dlrs 50,000 donated by Pope
John Paul II during his visit to Peru.
	   There is no shortage of orphans for Walijewski. War and poverty
have created swarms of homeless children in Peru. Called
``piranhas,'' they often beg, steal or sell items at street corners
to survive.
	   One in two Peruvians lives in poverty and some 30,000 have been
killed since 1980 in a war against leftist rebels that has waned
since the capture of top rebel leaders in the early 1990s. But the
orphans remain.
	   Siblings Juan, Maria and Roberto were brought to the orphanage
10 years ago by police who found them on the side of the road on
Lima's outskirts, clutching each other's hands.
	   The story they told chilled Walijewski.
	   Ten hooded men broke into their home while the family was eating
and hacked their parents and grandparents to death with machetes.
	   The children, then ages four to seven, hid under a bed. Later
they crawled out and hitchhiked from their mountain village to
Lima.
	   During their first nights at the orphanage, they screamed for
their mother.
	   ``But they found a place where they could forget their past,''
says Walijewski.
	   Juan, the youngest, is now a talented artist and Walijewski is
trying to get him accepted at an art school.
	   Walijewski says his love for the children is rooted in his own
childhood. His parents were poor Polish immigrants. In the winter,
he recalls, his mother wrapped his feet in rags against the cold.
	   He came to South America 38 years ago as a priest. He worked in
Bolivia and Ecuador before arriving in Peru, where he served for 17
years as a pastor in the shantytown of Villa El Salvador, near
Lurin.
	   His boyhood dream is not completely realized. He plans to expand
the orphanage to provide a home for more abandoned kids.
	   He wants the children to elect their own mayor and have their
own police to teach them responsibility, much like in Boys Town.
	   ``I want it to be a city of children _ happy children,'' he
says.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Plane and train operators brag when
they can make riders' travel times shorter, but the companies that
run the giant ferries between Sweden and Finland think making their
trips slower is the key to staying alive.
	   In a move to save one of the Nordic region's most colorful and
beloved institutions, the Silja and Viking lines next year will
make their journeys between Stockholm and Helsinki about two hours
longer.
	   The strategy defies conventional wisdom, but these boats aren't
conventional ferries: they're an eccentric amalgam of luxury liner
and drunken party.
	   For many of the nearly 10 million people who ride them every
year, getting from here to there is a secondary concern, or even
irrelevant. About half the passengers _ locals and tourists alike _
spend about eight hours in port and then head back to their
starting-point on the same boat, according to the ferry companies.
	   Of more interest to many is duty-free fun, a chance to escape
the head-smackingly high taxes that Sweden and Finland impose on
alcohol, tobacco and other indulgences. But both countries are
European Union members and duty-free sales for intra-EU travellers
are to be abolished on July 1.
	   That would be a crushing blow to the ferry companies; the Silja
line alone racked up dlrs 390 million in duty-free sales last year,
more than almost all international airports.
	   That potential whopping loss of income raised fears that the
ferries would be forced out of business. That would be a loss not
only to motorists who use the ferries to avoid a 1,500-kilometer
trek around the Gulf of Bothnia, but to the region's aesthetic and
emotional fabric.
	   The ferries, the biggest of which have 13 decks and sleep more
than 3,000 people, are so beloved that the Helsinki City Planning
Office describes them as ``irresistible architectural phenomena ...
giving flavor to a whole range of ideas and metaphors.''
	   Facing demise, the ferry companies looked to the Aland islands,
a semi-autonomous scrap of Finland that aren't part of the EU. By
detouring to put in at the Aland port of Mariehamn, the boats will
be allowed to continue duty-free sales.
	   Although it means the overnight trip will be extended from 15
hours to 17, ``we hope the passengers won't mind,'' said Hakan
Stenberg, a Silja spokesman. There seems little likelihood of
complaint.
	   A group of Russian businessmen on a recent run to Stockholm said
the boats are so much fun they wouldn't care if the trip took a
whole day more.
	   ``It is like living in a fairy tale. It is hard to believe you
are on a ferry. It is more like a five-star hotel,'' said one of
them, Dmitri Bazhenov.
	   It's a better simile than Bazhenov may have intended.
	   He was extolling the boats' elegant aspects, which are
considerable: first-rate French and Italian restaurants with good
wine lists, a myriad of twinkly little lights, capacious suite
cabins on the upper decks and, on Silja's biggest vessels,
six-deck-high atriums running the length of the boat.
	   But every proper fairy tale also has an ogre _ and the ferries
have many of these. While some passengers drift off to sleep in
wide beds, others sack out in tiny warrens in steerage _ or
face-down on whatever surface they happened to find at the end of a
long night of duty-free carousing.
	   It's this mix that gives the ferries their special charm, as
floating embodiments of the Nordic world's cherished
egalitarianism. In their nightclubs, senior-citizen couples in
their Sunday best dance shy ballroom steps shoulder-to-shoulder
with hip-hop-garbed youngsters.
	   And the ferries are used by people of all budgets. A
top-of-the-line suite sets one back more than 4,000 kronor (dlrs
500), but a round-trip ticket on some off-season runs is as little
as 125 kronor (15) _ for the same price as a movie and a beer in
Stockholm, one can go to another country, and get in some major
shopping to boot.
	   Foreigners may look askance at the locals as they trudge off the
ferries with loads of wine and beer that would challenge a
pack-mule, but some quick calculations show that they're being
prudent as well as indulgent. For example, a classy brand of scotch
costs 290 kronor (dlrs 35) a liter on the ferries against about 510
kronor (dlrs 64) on land in Stockholm.
	   Even for those who drink nothing stronger than mineral water,
the ferries are popular because they give a view of some of the
region's loveliest terrain over their 400-kilometer (250-mile)
voyage.
	   Beginning in Stockholm, the ferries wend for about three hours
through a seemingly endless archipelago of small rocky islands
dotted with red wooden houses. At the end of the archipelago come
the austere and lonely barrier islands, where one half expects to
see an Ingmar Bergman movie being filmed.
	   After some sleep _ or a couple of nightcap drinks _ comes
Finland, concluding with the impressive entry into Helsinki's
harbor, where the leviathan boats carefully squeeze through a
narrow channel guarded by the island fortress Suomenlinna.
	   There, the passengers can haul off their duty-free booty or
spend a few hours touring the city or _ not uncommonly _ stay on
the boat for some sleep to replenish their energy for the revels
that start when the boat heads out again.

Yeltsin and Lukashenko agree to hold referendum on merging their

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko on Friday agreed to take moves to merge the two former
Soviet republics into a single state as early as next year.
	   Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed to hold a plebiscite on the
proposed merger by the middle of next year. Without waiting for
popular approval, they would also move early next year to introduce
a single currency and harmonize taxes.
	   ``We are now calling for merging our nations in one union
state,'' Yeltsin said at a news conference after the signing. ``We
can be proud of such work.''
	   ``God help us to enter the next millennium as a single state,''
Lukashenko said.
	   Yeltsin, plagued by poor health in recent years, appeared tired
at the meeting, although he spoke clearly and strongly. At one
point, he struggled to get up from a chair and had to be helped by
an aide.
	   The authoritarian Lukashenko, a admirer of the Soviet Union, has
long pushed for uniting his nation of 10 million people with
Russia's 147 million people. In 1996, he and Yeltsin signed a union
agreement, boosting political, economic and military ties between
the two nations, but stopping short of creating one state.
	   The two leaders have long pledged to take further integration
steps, but had done little. It remains unclear whether today's
agreements would be implemented, as many Russian politicians oppose
a merger.
	   Lukashenko wants a merger to solve Belarus' economic problems
that have already led to food rationing in some regions. The
Belarusian economy is one of the most unreformed in the former
Soviet Union, with virtually all assets and markets under
government control.
	   In an immediate step to ease Belarusian economic woes, Yeltsin
and Lukashenko signed a document to allow Russian and Belarusian
companies to import goods from each other at domestic prices. The
agreement is crucial for Belarus, which relies on Russia's energy
resources and has run up a huge debt.
	   Domestic prices for Russia's oil and natural gas are still far
lower than the world market price.
	   Apart from the economic interests, many politicians in both
nations believe that the main motive behind Lukashenko's drive for
union is his ambition to run for the Russian presidency. Lukashenko
has dodged questions about his possible ambitions.
	   ``Some believe that Lukashenko wouldn't mind becoming the
Russian leader, and many Russians wouldn't like that,'' Yegor
Stroyev, the speaker of the Russian parliament's upper house said
in an interview published Friday in the daily Novye Izvestia.
	   Russian liberals and the West assail Lukashenko for his
crackdown on the opposition and the independent media. Russian
Communists and other hardliners publicly hail the proposed merger,
but tacitly oppose it, fearing that the assertive Belarusian
president would push them to the sidelines if he joins Russia's
presidential race.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government, struggling with the worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse, has been lukewarm on the
merger with even poorer Belarus.

Effort to get Ethiopia's treasure back from Italy stalls again

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Not long ago, it seemed the prize was within
Ethiopia's reach. After more than a half century of stalling, Italy
appeared ready to give back the 1,000-year-old Obelisk of Axum.
	   But months of a simmering border dispute between Ethiopia and
Eritrea that has threatened to break out in war have plans to
return the slender granite tower on hold again.
	   Axum, the capital of a great empire in the Horn of Africa that
disappeared 800 years ago, is near Ethiopia's border with Eritrea _
and within range of Eritrean artillery. Sending it home could mean
sending it to its doom, the Italians say.
	   ``It's right to honor our international accords, but returning
the obelisk wouldn't be justified if the war between Ethiopia and
Eritrea begins again,'' Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli said recently.
	   The obelisk is a treasured relic of Ethiopia's past grandeur
that Italy's Fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, hauled off to Rome
in 1937 after he invaded the African country, using poison gas on
people and massacring thousands.
	   In its heyday, the Axumite empire traded gold, ivory, incense,
obsidian and rhinoceros horn with Rome, Arabia and India for silk,
glass, iron, olive oil and wine. Legend has it that the Queen of
Sheba took the Ark of the Covenant to Axum.
	   The Axumites left behind written records in two languages,
including Greek. They built stone palaces, and the obelisks they
erected at Axum are some of the ancient world's largest.
	   Mussolini chose the best for his booty, the only Axumite obelisk
carved on all four sides. It represents a tower soaring into the
sky, with a false door carved into the base and windows on the
sides.
	   The obelisk stands in front of the hulking building that was
Mussolini's ministry for African colonies and today is home to the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
	   Two years after World War II, during which the Ethiopians drove
out the Italians with British help, Italy and Ethiopia signed a
peace treaty. Among other things, it said Italy would return the
obelisk.
	   Italy never did.
	   The Ethiopian government asked Italy several times to return the
obelisk, but was ignored. Later, ravaged by wars and famine,
Ethiopia was in no position to press its demands.
	   After Eritrea's 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia ended
in 1991, a popular campaign for the obelisk's return was born. It
drummed up support from other African nations, from scholars, from
diplomats, even from the Ethiopian Soccer Federation, which raised
money for the transportation costs.
	   The patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church wrote the pope
and, in Axum, more than 13,000 people signed a petition in 1996
asking Italy to return ``our priceless historical heritage.''
	   In November 1997, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro became the
first Italian head of state to visit Ethiopia since Mussolini. He
apologized for the invasion and said Ethiopia's half-century wait
was over: The obelisk would go home in 1998.
	   The president's apology _ and his promise _ outraged the Italian
right.
	   ``Scalfaro was mistaken when he promised the restitution as
reparation for the war in Ethiopia,'' fumed the conservative
newspaper Il Tempo.
	   But Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini recently reaffirmed Italy's
intention to return the obelisk, even if he didn't say when.
	   Taking it was like ``stealing the soul'' of the Ethiopian
people, he said. ``A promise is a promise. The obelisk will be
returned.''

Panama sees canal as ticket to first world _ Is it ready?

	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ The Americans gouged a trench across
this lush country and nurtured it during nine decades as U.S. soil
into a vital link in the ever-expanding global market.
	   All that will change in just a year, when at noon on Dec. 31,
1999, the world's most powerful nation turns over control of the
Panama Canal to this poor nation.
	   There is no lack of skeptics, however, even among Panamanians,
who question whether Panama is ready. In a CID-Gallup poll in
November, half the Panamanians surveyed said their country isn't
prepared to run the canal.
	   But after decades of asserting defensively that the canal won't
slip TOO far into ruin after the Americans leave, Panamanian
officials and analysts are now showing more confidence and setting
their sights higher.
	   ``I am in general terms very optimistic that we will administer
the canal not only as well, but much better, because our vision
goes far beyond moving ships from one ocean to another,'' said
Roberto Eisenmann, a newspaper publisher who usually is a sharp
government critic.
	   While taking on the canal's management, Panama's government also
has big plans for developing the sophisticated infrastructure and
vast acreage of the Panama Canal Zone _ an area valued at dlrs 2
billion to dlrs 4 billion.
	   The loss of the U.S. troops based in the zone will cost Panama's
economy up to dlrs 300 million a year, but officials say they will
more than make up for that.
	   ``In the beginning there will be a negative effect from the loss
of U.S. military spending, but gradually that will be overcome by
the new investments, new exports and new economic activity,'' said
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, administrator of the agency that
coordinates investment in the areas turned over by the Americans.
	   The government wants to create a web of activities around the
canal, creating a tourism industry to take advantage of the
biodiversity of the canal's banks while at the same time developing
ports at each end of the waterway.
	   Officials hope the ports in Balboa on the Pacific side and
Cristobal on the Caribbean side will develop into maintenance
centers for ships traversing the canal and also become key transfer
points for shipping containers.
	   Of course, the doubts are strong.
	   ``The transfer of an asset of the greatest potential to a Third
World country has zero credibility,'' said Eisenmann, the
publisher. ``The whole world is waiting for this to turn out
badly.''
	   Panama is working hard to prove the doubters wrong.
	   Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong has invested millions of
dollars in modernizing the two ports, while Kansas City Southern
Industries is restoring a rusted railroad that runs along the canal
and could move up to 900 containers across the isthmus each day.
	   Cruise ships also have begun to make stops on the lake that
feeds the canal, and Taiwanese businessmen have set up an
industrial park at Fort Davis, a former U.S. military base where
Panamanian workers make plastic bags, blue jeans and bicycle parts
for export.
	   Barletta, whose dream is to build Panama into a regional
manufacturing and banking center, said investors have committed to
more than dlrs 1 billion in projects over the next five years in
the canal zone.
	   Officials are even looking to the canal itself for economic
opportunity. They want to sell the surplus electricity that the
canal produces _ and drinking water from the lake.
	   The United States has long run the canal as a break-even agency,
investing all the profit into canal maintenance and expansion.
Panamanians say that has stifled economic growth.
	   ``All the areas around the canal open the opportunity for
enormous business, which the Americans haven't cared about,'' said
Hernan Bern, who is building an ecotourism resort on the canal's
banks.
	   Some critics say the desire for business opportunities will
cause officials to sacrifice canal maintenance and prevent them
from expanding the canal, endangering the waterway's place in world
trade.
	   A widening project currently under way is designed to increase
the canal's shipping capacity 20 percent by 2005 _ if Panama
continues the work.
	   ``There is a definite need to expand the canal,'' said Peter
Wild, head of a shipping company. ``It's already entering into
obsolescence.''

Mother, three children slain and burned on Christmas morn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WAGENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Christmas morning brought a scene
of horror in this central Dutch town: the charred bodies of a
mother and her three young children. Police said all four were
slain.
	   Firefighters responding to a blaze in the family home found the
burned bodies of the mother and the youngsters, who ranged in ages
from three to 11, Dutch television reported Friday.
	   Authorities said the unknown killer apparently set fire to the
house to cover his tracks. The home was completely destroyed by the
blaze, which started in the lower levels of the house at around
7:30 a.m.
	   The victims' identities were not released in line with Dutch
privacy laws.
	   Wageningen is a university town in the central Netherlands,
about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. Last New
Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a private party there.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a Serb offensive against
an ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold in Kosovo, both sides are
vowing to keep fighting, dealing a new blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the region.
	   International peace verifiers said an ethnic Albanian girl was
killed in the town of Podujevo by a sniper in the Christmas Eve
offensive. They had no other details.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said at least
nine people, including a woman and a 6-year-old girl, were killed
in the Christmas Eve offensive and a large, unspecified number were
wounded.
	   The government action was ``revenge aimed at killing 10 ethnic
Albanians for one killed Serb,'' the ethnic Albanian center said in
a statement.
	   There are no fresh reports of fighting Friday. But the ethnic
Albanians claimed Yugoslav army tanks were headed Friday for the
rebel stronghold of Lapastica and that the area was under strict
control of Serb forces.
	   The United States, France and the European Union warned both
sides against further violence. In an interview with the Serbian
independent newspaper Danas, the EU envoy for Kosovo, Wolfgang
Petritsch, said the international community ``will not tolerate an
excessive use of force by the Yugoslav army'' in the province.
	   ``Dozens of armored vehicles and tanks have been observed
deployed in the region,'' Petritsch, Austria's ambassador to
Belgrade, said. ``Villages close to Podujevo are attacked by heavy
artillery and automatic fire.''
	   A statement from the Yugoslav army corps in Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, said two soldiers were wounded in a ``terrorist attack''
Thursday on a military convoy in northern Kosovo.
	   The army said its convoy was on ``regular practice activities''
when it came under automatic fire and hand grenade attacks.
	   ``The Yugoslav army returned fire and destroyed the terrorist
group,'' the statement concluded. Police also reported they
captured a 24-year-old ethnic Albanian, Daut Rahmani, accused of
killing a pro-Serb ethnic Albanian this week at a cafe in the town
of Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of Pristina has sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills. An
Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by an artillery shell in the village of Glavnik, and ethnic
Albanians said several others were injured.
	   The attack came after U.S. and NATO officials warned both sides
against violence, which could threaten a fragile Oct. 12
cease-fire. That deal ended most of the fighting between government
forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for Kosovo
from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice premier, Vojislav
Seselj, said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the
terrorists.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for the province's
independence, stopped short of abrogating a separate cease-fire it
proclaimed unilaterally just before the October deal was reached.
	   In a statement issued in Pristina, however, the rebels said they
would ``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means
available.''
	   Yugoslav army soldiers backed by tanks and artillery struck at
rebel-occupied villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles)
north of Pristina, purportedly searching for gunmen who killed a
Serb policeman three days before.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and in vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   ``Both sides have been looking for trouble and found it,'' said
William Walker, the American head of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe's verification force monitoring the
October accord. He expressed frustration at the apparent lack of
will for a peaceful settlement.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC television that
the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments''
undertaken in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' Solana said.
	   In neighboring Albania, the Foreign Ministry called for NATO to
intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the overwhelming
majority.
	   Serb police said they encountered ``fierce fire'' but
``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel stronghold
Lapastica, in a statement distributed Thursday night by the
Yugoslav government's Tanjug news agency.
	   In London, a KLA political representative, Pleurat Sejdru, told
BBC-TV that the cease-fire ``doesn't have any sense to be in
place.''
	   The U.S. and French governments condemned the Serb attack. The
State Department also condemned all breaches of the cease-fire,
including provocative attacks committed by elements of the KLA.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   That phase ended with an agreement between Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, which averted threatened NATO airstrikes.
But diplomatic efforts to forge a long-term formula for Kosovo's
future have stalled, with both sides rejecting U.S. proposals.

Coast guard search for missing pilot in plane crash

	   BRADWELL-ON-SEA, England (AP) _ Hopes were fading Friday in the
search for the pilot of a jet that crashed into the sea off the
southern coast of England.
	   A witness who raised the alarm Thursday afternoon reported a
parachute leaving the twin-seater plane as it hit the water. A
police helicopter crew later found a seat and a flying helmet
floating among debris of the wreckage of the former Royal Air Force
trainer plane, but there was no sign of the pilot.
	   A coast guard spokesman said it was unlikely that the pilot, who
has not been named, would be found alive. Volunteers had joined the
search Friday.
	   The pilot, believed to be in his 30s and from outside Essex in
England, is thought to have been alone when he took off from the
North Weald Airfield at 1.14 p.m. (1314GMT)

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Carbon monoxide fumes believed to have come from a
faulty heating system sickened 250 people attending Christmas Mass
in a village church, sending 40 of them to the hospital.
	   The worshipers and the priest suffered headaches, nausea and
vomiting as the Thursday evening service ended in Saverdun, a
village in the southwestern Ariege region.
	   Recognizing the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, a doctor
called for help, and a crisis center was set up in a village hall,
where throughout the night worshipers were treated with oxygen.
	   Forty people, including young children and a pregnant woman, had
to be hospitalized in nearby Toulouse or other towns. No lives were
in danger, officials said.

Rival Iraqi Kurds plan meeting to further peace agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Leaders of two Iraqi Kurdish groups are to
meet soon in another step toward ending their often violent rivalry
that has hampered plans for a strong opposition to Saddam Hussein,
an official said Friday.
	   Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and
Massoud Barzani, who heads the Kurdistan Democratic Party, are to
discuss ways of implementing a U.S.-brokered agreement.
	   The meeting would take place ``in the coming days'' in
Salahuddin, a town close to the main Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil,
said Shazad Saib, the Turkey-based representative of Talabani's
group.
	   Under the agreement reached in Washington in September, the two
leaders agreed to hold regional elections next summer, and to share
revenue and power, two issues at the heart of their differences.
	   It would be the first time the two leaders will be meeting face
to face in northern Iraq since their hostilities began in 1994,
although they have met several times abroad since the Washington
agreement.
	   The two groups are hostile to the Baghdad regime, but have been
more focused on fighting each other, undermining efforts to form a
strong opposition that could weaken Saddam's regime.
	   The Kurdish groups are protected in a safe haven north of the
36th parallel, by a U.S.-led air force based in southern Turkey.

Republic of Congo rebels open up new front, government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ A rogue militia group
loyal to Republic of Congo's former prime minister has opened up
new attacks in towns west of the capital, a government spokesman
said Friday.
	   The Ninja militia fighting on behalf of ex-Prime Minister
Bernard Kolelas has attacked soldiers and civilians in the
neighboring towns of Nkayi and Dolisie about 250 kilometers (150
miles) west of Brazzaville, Francois Ibovi told reporters without
giving details.
	   Ibovi accused Kolelas and former President Pascal Lissouba of
hatching a ``criminal plot'' to destabilize the Central African
country and divide its ethnic groups.
	   Human rights and aid groups say recent fighting between the
Ninjas and President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's personal Cobra militia
has prompted tens of thousands of civilians to flee their homes in
Brazzaville and towns in the country's southwest.
	   Unarmed residents have been killed, women raped and homes
destroyed in shelling between the two forces.
	   The hostilities are a reversal of last year's civil war that
ravaged Brazzaville and resulted in up to 10,000 deaths when
Sassou-Nguesso captured the presidency from Lissouba, a sometime
ally of Kolelas.
	   Sassou-Nguesso, the Republic of Congo's longtime Marxist
dictator who is now advocating capitalist reform, was ousted in the
country's first multi-party elections in 1992.
	   Angola and Chad have soldiers in Republic of Congo supporting
Sassou-Nguesso's government.

Celebrating Christmas, John Paul looks forward to new millennium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A tired-looking Pope John Paul II on Friday
offered a Christmas prayer that the world not become resigned to
violence but work to end arms production, the death penalty capital
and genocide.
	   As he had the last few years, the pope no longer celebrated
late-morning Christmas day Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. Instead,
after leading the faithful in a Christmas Eve midnight Mass that
ended about 1:30 a.m. (0030 gmt), John Paul had a few hours more to
rest before appearing on the central balcony of the basilica at
noon to deliver his traditional ``Urbi et Orbi'' message (Latin for
to the city and to the world).
	   Before he reading holiday greetings in 58 languages, ranging
from Samoan to Georgian, John Paul reflected on ``the disturbing
developments ... coming each day from television and the
newspapers, sweeping from one hemisphere to the other of the globe,
tragic situations, which often involve human guilt and even malice,
soaked in fraticidal hate and senseless violence,'' John Paul said.
	   John Paul prayed that consensus be strengthened worldwide for
``urgent and adequate measures to halt the production and sale of
arms, to defend human life, to end the death penalty'' as well as
to ``restrain the bloodied hand of those responsible for genocide
and crimes of war....''
	   The phrase ``defend human life'' for the Vatican usually refers
to the church's opposition to abortion and euthanasia.
	   In a reference to the shaky peace process, John Paul prayed for
encouragement for those trying to help ``the tormented situation in
the Middle East by respecting international commitments.''
	   His speech mentioned no region except for the Middle East, but
at the the end of the speech, John Paul, speaking off the cuff,
offered a ``cordial greeting to the Kurdish people.''
	   A small group of Kurds was reportedly in the crowd of some
40,000 people in St. Peter's Square. A rebel leader of Turkish
Kurds, Abdullah Ocalan, detained in Rome Nov. 12, is waiting to
hear if Italy will grant him political asylum. Italy has refused to
extradite Ocalan to Turkey because he could face the death penalty
if convicted of terrorism.
	   Although looking weary, John Paul read out all the languages in
a strong voice, gliding over the musical tones of Maori and
offering the longest greetings of all in Italian and in his native
Polish.
	   His left hand tremor was noticeable as he gripped his staff. His
stopped figure seemed almost lost on the balcony, which was the
only part of the front of the basilica not swathed in the netting
covering restorers' scaffolding.
	   On Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will launch Holy Year celebrations
for 2000 with the symbolic opening of a basilica door that is
sealed during all but church jubilee years.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, the church shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the
opening of the holy door,'' John Paul said during midnight Mass.
	   The phrase was a slight change in wording from his prepared text
_ in the original, the pope said he himself would inaugurate the
jubilee.
	   Increasingly frail at 78, the pope had to lighten his schedule
and cancel some appointments after coming down with the flu and a
fever Dec. 18.

Turkish Cypriots demand increased security at buffer zone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to correct shooting occurred on border between Turkish
side and British base, Cypriot officials deny involvement, ADDS
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriots have demanded increased
security measures at a U.N. buffer zone after shots were fired
across the line that divides the island into Turkish and Greek
sectors, news reports said Friday.
	   Ten shots were fired at Turkish Cypriot guards late Thursday
from a speeding car along a road between the Turkish sector and the
British base of Dhekelia, the Turkish Cypriot news agency, TAK,
quoted Turkish Cypriot authorities as saying.
	   The guards fired two shots in return. There were no injuries.
	   A British police spokesman at the Dhekelia base said he did hear
shots on the Turkish side of the demilitarized zone and a flare was
seen.
	   Thursday's shooting was the fourth in a string of similar
shooting incidents over the past few months at the U.N.-patrolled
buffer zone that separates the Turkish and Greek communities,
Turkish Cypriot officials said.
	   ``Such attacks and provocation, which are beginning to test the
limits of our patience and tolerance, could lead to sad results,''
said a statement issued by Turkish Cypriot security forces.
	   Spokesmen for the Greek Cypriot police and the Cypriot National
Guard denied any involvement of their forces.
	   The Turkish Cypriot statement said officials had formally
complained to U.N. and British forces, demanding ``more efficient''
security measures at the 180-kilometer (113-mile) zone.
	   A duty officer at the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping
force on the island said no spokesman was available to comment on
the reports.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in forces
following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in the north, some of which are
positioned only yards away from Greek Cypriot troops.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II
celebrated this Christmas with his mind on the next one, looking
ahead eagerly to the opening of the jubilee year that will launch
Christianity's third millennium. ``My thoughts already turn to
Christmas next year, when, God willing, the church shall inaugurate
the great jubilee with the opening of the holy door,'' John Paul
said in a midnight Mass at St. Peter's Basilica televised in about
40 countries. Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in Bethlehem on
Christmas Eve _ delayed by a manhunt for a Palestinian fugitive but
still in time for celebrations in the town of Jesus' birth.
Troubles intruded on holiday celebrations elsewhere in the world,
too, with refugees of Hurricane Mitch finding Christmas spirit hard
to come by and Christians in Indonesia shaken by attacks on
churches. (CHRISTMAS ROUNDUP)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a Serb offensive against
an ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold in Kosovo, both sides are
vowing to keep fighting, dealing a new blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the region. International peace verifiers said an
ethnic Albanian girl was killed in the town of Podujevo by a sniper
in the Christmas Eve offensive. They had no other details. The
ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said at least nine
people, including a woman and a 6-year-old girl, were killed in the
Christmas Eve offensive and a large, unspecified number were
wounded. There are no fresh reports of fighting Friday.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Three balloonists streaking across the Pacific
Ocean were caught into a dangerous weather system early Friday that
threatened their attempt at the first nonstop balloon trip around
the world. ``It's in the lap of the gods,'' the team's project
director Mike Kendrick, said Friday. British mogul Richard Branson,
American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden got
sucked into a low pressure system overnight that prompted them to
bring the balloon down to 6,000 feet (1,830 meters) above to the
surface of the water to look for a stronger wind. (BALLOON QUEST)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, accused of
masterminding the bombings of two U.S. embassies, renewed his call
for attacks on the United States and Israel, a U.S. television
network reported. ``We are confident that the Muslim nation would
rid Islamic countries of the Americans and the Jews,'' bin Laden
told ABC News on Thursday night, speaking through an interpreter.
ABC broadcast brief excerpts from an interview with the Saudi
millionaire, which it said was conducted Wednesday night in a tent
in the wilderness of Afghanistan under heavy security. Bin Laden,
who has been living in exile in Afghanistan, denied he was involved
in the August bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania but
supported the attacks and said he knew some of the suspects who
have been charged, according to ABC. (AFGHANISTAN-BIN LADEN)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ This political outsider kept her uniform on
when she jumped into Israel's political fray. In an election
campaign increasingly dominated by former generals, former beauty
queen Pnina Rosenblum provided a fresh face. Israel's parliament
voted to go to early elections, largely out of bipartisan
unhappiness with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security
policies. Tension with the Palestinians and trouble with Lebanon
have prompted the former Miss Israel and a bevy of generals to name
themselves candidates. Their emergence has been attributed to a
search for outsiders to replace a political establishment that has
worn thin for many in Israel. (ISRAEL-POLITICS OF PULCHRITUDE)

Japanese official defends rice tariffs criticized by U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan defended its decision to impose a heavy tax
on imported rice on Friday, arguing that not only was the move
allowed under an international agreement, but that eventually it
will be good for global trade.
	   Japan's Cabinet endorsed a plan a week ago to impose heavy
duties on foreign rice to protect the country's
politically-influential farmers.
	   ``Although the decision was made in our national interest, in
the long-term it will be positive for the overall multilateral
trade system,'' said an official from Japan's Foreign Ministry who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States and other trading partners have strongly
opposed the tariff, which they say will restrict sales of imported
rice at a time when Japan's global trade surplus is ballooning.
	   In 1993, Japan agreed to import 4 percent of its rice and
gradually increase the share to 8 percent by 2000. But the pact
also allowed Japan to slow the growth rate if it replaced that
quota with the more-efficient tariff system.
	   Earlier this week Japan informed the World Trade Organization
that it would do just that, citing a commitment to liberalize its
rice market at the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
	   ``What we did was entirely legitimate under the agreement,''
said the Foreign Ministry official.
	   As of April 1, 1999, Japan will impose a tariff of 351.17 yen
(dlrs 3.05) on each kilogram of imported rice. The import duty will
be reduced to 341 yen (dlrs 2.96) per kilogram the following year.
	   Free trade advocates prefer tariffs to fixed quotas because, in
theory, a tariff would allow foreigners to sell an unlimited amount
of rice in Japan. That it why the foreign ministry says the new
tariffs could stimulate trade.
	   But Japan's trading partners worry the rate for rice was set
unfairly high.
	   Rice grown overseas _ the United States, South Korea and
Thailand are all big producers _ costs less than a tenth the price
of Japanese rice. Tack on the tax, though, and the price of
imported rice would be higher.
	   And robbing foreign growers of their natural cost advantage
would give them little chance of competing here because many
consumers think foreign rice does not taste as good as Japanese
brands.
	   Despite the opposition from abroad, the foreign ministry
official said Japan would go through with the tariff plan.
	   ``Our position is that it is not subject to negotiation,'' he
said.

Mother, three children slain and burned on Christmas morn

<TEXT>
	   WAGENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Christmas morning brought a scene
of horror in this central Dutch town: the charred bodies of a
mother and her three young children. Police said all four were
slain.
	   Firefighters responding to a blaze in the family home found the
burned bodies of the mother and the youngsters, who ranged in ages
from three to 11, Dutch television reported Friday.
	   Authorities said the unknown killer apparently set fire to the
house to cover his tracks. The home was completely destroyed by the
blaze, which started in the lower levels of the house at around
7:30 a.m.
	   The victims' identities were not released in line with Dutch
privacy laws.
	   Wageningen is a university town in the central Netherlands,
about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. Last New
Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a private party there.

West Indies faces decisive match against South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies face their decisive play
Saturday in the five-match cricket Test against South Africa, whose
dominant bowling has held them to 2-0.
	   The visitors have the advantage of a pitch in Durban that has
traditionally been kind to pace bowling. South Africa lost the last
test they played there against Pakistan, when they went down in the
final innings to the leg-spinning wiles of Mushtaq Ahmed, who took
six for 78 in that innings.
	   South Africa's record test score of 622 was achieved on the
Durban ground. There have also been some recent centuries in tests
by visitors there: Azhar Mahmood and Saeed Anwar scored 132 and 118
respectively for Pakistan last March.
	   With batting application like that of Shivnarine Chanderpaul
against South Africa's A Team earlier this week, West Indies could
find suitable targets again for ageing fast-bowling warhorses
Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh.
	   But the two will need better support than they have received so
far from their understudies in speed _ Nixon McLean, Mervyn Dillon
and Franklin Rose. They will also need a good spinning performance
from Carl Hooper and leg spinner Rawl Lewis.
	   West Indies Captain Brian Lara seemed to be hitting his stride
in the final innings of the defeat at the second match in Port
Elizabeth earlier this month, when he scored freely against a South
African attack keen with the smell of victory.
	   Supporting West Indies batsmen would also benefit from imitating
Chanderpaul's style _ controlled aggression with a healthy dose of
patience.
	   South Africa has the advantage of entering the Test on a stable
foot, unlike West Indies that were fighting a pay dispute before
their delayed arrival in South Africa in November.
	   The home team has the dynamic pair of Allan Donald and Shaun
Pollock, whose opening bowling attack is among the best in the
world. They have the pace backup which the West Indies sorely lack
in Jacques Kallis and David Terbrugge.
	   Jonty Rhodes, with strong fielding, and Pat Symcox as a dynamic
off-spinner, represent the sort of all-round talent that keeps the
South Africans strong.
	   The tour was expected to have political significance in
post-apartheid South Africa, with Lara, the world's most famous
cricketer, leading a black Caribbean team in a country where
cricket is mainly a white sport.
	   The South African team has been under pressure from political
leaders to name more nonwhites to its team.
	   Teams:
	   South Africa: Gary Kirsten, Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis,
Darryll Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes, Shaun
Pollock, Mark Boucher, Pat Symcox, Allan Donald, David Terbrugge,
Paul Adams.
	   West Indies: Clayton Lambert, Stuart Williams, Philo Wallace,
Brian Lara (captain), Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper, Darren
Ganga, Floyd Reifer, Junior Murray, Ridley Jacobs, Curtly Ambrose,
Courtney Walsh, Nixon McLean, Mervyn Dillon, Franklin Rose, Rawl
Lewis.

In a generals' race, a beauty queen throws in her chapeau

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ This political outsider kept her uniform on
when she jumped into Israel's political fray.
	   In an election campaign increasingly dominated by former
generals, former beauty queen Penina Rosenblum provided a fresh
face.
	   Well, a heavily made-up face. The former Miss Israel markets a
popular line of cosmetics in Israel, and the dyed blond didn't lack
for her creations when she ventured into the Jerusalem streets on
Thursday. Facial pancake gleamed on an unseasonably warm day.
	   ``What a beauty,'' exclaimed one fan, hugging Rosenblum at a
mall. ``I washed my hair with your shampoo this morning.''
	   Israel's parliament voted to go to early elections, largely out
of bipartisan unhappiness with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
security policies.
	   Tension with the Palestinians and trouble with Lebanon have
prompted a bevy of generals to name themselves candidates. Their
emergence has been attributed to a search for outsiders to replace
a political establishment that has worn thin for many in Israel.
	   The latest was the most recently-retired chief-of-staff, Lt.
Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who doffed his uniform for civilian
clothes Thursday.
	   Rosenblum, by contrast, was in full battle dress Thursday: form
fitting Penina Rosenblum black suit, mini skirt hovering over sheer
black Penina Rosenblum stockings.
	   She started her day by stopping at the Interior Ministry and
registering ... the Penina Rosenblum Party.
	   She'll head a list that will attempt to break the 1.5 percent _
or 45,000-vote _ threshold needed to get at least one seat
parliament.
	   That system has always encouraged marginal parties to run; also
registering Thursday were the ``Pensioners Power'' party, the
``Men's Rights in Marriage'' party and a new Romanian immigrants
party that has a simple platform: a Romanian-language television
channel.
	   For Rosenblum, the first order of business after registering the
party was calling Mom.
	   ``Hello, Mom,'' she said. ``I'm registered as a party!''
	   ``Mazal Tov!'' Mom said over the car phone speaker. ``Who's
running with you?''
	   ``Don't worry,'' she assured her. ``Good people.''
	   Later, Rosenblum would not say who was running with her, but she
quipped: ``My number two won't be a general.''
	   ``I am one of the people,'' Rosenblum told reporters, not long
after she was swamped by a crowd of autograph-hunting schoolgirls.
``I've worked very hard in my life. Now I want to use my experience
to help the simple people.''
	   Extracting a platform from the other-side-of-40 model wasn't
easy. She volunteered that she would crack down on bad checks.
	   What about Lebanon? Does she support withdrawal?
	   ``In an orderly fashion.''
	   Rabbinical students _ should they be forced into conscription?
	   ``In an orderly fashion.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Japanese and Thai share prices rose Friday, but
most other Asian stock markets were closed for the Christmas
holiday. Tokyo's 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average picked up
91.22 points, or 0.67 percent, to close the week's trading at
13,797.95. Bank shares rebounded from a recent slump after rising
bond prices eased investor concerns over turmoil in the credit
market. In Bangkok, the key Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index
rose 9.23 points, or 2.7 percent, to 356.16 in thin trading.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 116.18 yen in late
afternoon trading, up 0.06 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but
below its late New York level of 116.29 yen overnight. (ASIAN
MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate hit a record high of 4.4
percent in November as companies struggling in the country's worst
recession in decades trimmed their work forces and suffered from a
wave of bankruptcies, the government said Friday. The total number
of workers shrank by 480,000 from a year ago to 64.81 million,
marking the 10th straight month of on-year declines, said the
statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency. The
total number of jobless stood at 2.91 million. The November rate
tops the previous record of 4.3 percent, set in recent months. The
jobless rate _ the highest since the government started measuring
it in the 1950s _ also set another record: it was the first time
Japan's unemployment rate equaled that of the United States, where
the jobless rate also stood at 4.4 percent in November, an agency
official said. (JAPAN-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After years of delay, a top committee of China's
legislators is expected to approve the country's first national
securities law by Tuesday, the official newspaper China Daily
reported Friday. The Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress has discussed the latest draft of the law, and
most members want it passed before its current six-day session ends
on Tuesday, the report said. The law would fill a regulatory vacuum
that has left China's nascent financial markets prone to illegal
trading and bouts of volatility. Dwindling investor interest in the
securities markets and frequent scandals have led legislatures to
push for the passage of a national law that could provide
more-centralized regulation and legal transparency.
(CHINA-SECURITIES LAW)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of Indonesian workers at a
steel plant in East Java went on a rampage to protest cuts in their
bonuses, burning a car and damaging facilities owned by the
steelmaker, a company guard said Friday. The PT Alma Surya Steel
workers in Surabaya, the capital of East Java, staged the protest
on Wednesday after reading an announcement saying annual bonus
payments would be cut by 50 percent from the amount they received
last year. According to the daily Media Indonesia, the company
usually paid an annual bonus in December worth between one and 2
1/2 times a worker's average monthly salary. The management cited
the current economic crisis affecting the Southeast Asian nation
for this years cuts, the newspaper reported. (INDONESIA-PROTEST)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan has unveiled another stimulus
package to help companies facing financial troubles, but economists
warned Friday that the short-term measures may not bring about an
economic recovery. On Thursday, the government announced a plan to
provide up to 120 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.8 billion) in
state-backed loans to companies having temporary cash-flow
problems. It followed the setup of an intervention fund of 283
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 8.7 billion) in November to prop
up share prices, which had plunged in the aftermath of a string of
corporate failures _ due in part to tighter bank credit policies.

Germany urges Cypriots to disarm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,
whose country starts chairing the European Union on Jan. 1,
appealed Friday to both sides in war-divided Cyprus to disarm.
	   Fischer welcomed the Security Council's decision this week to
renew the mandate of 2,500 United Nations peacekeepers who patrol a
buffer zone between the Turkish-occupied north of the island and
the Greek-dominated south.
	   ``The German government supports all efforts aimed at bringing
about a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus question by reductions
in weaponry and troops as well as confidence-building measures,''
he said in a statement.
	   He appealed to all sides to refrain from moves that heighten
tensions.
	   Cyprus _ without the breakaway Turkish state in the north _ is
among six nations that started membership talks with the EU this
fall. Germany takes over the six-month EU presidency from Austria
on New Year's Day.
	   Turkey also wants to join, but the EU has refused talks partly
because of the unresolved Cyprus question.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. The Turkish
Cypriot state is recognized only by Turkey, which keeps 35,000
troops there.

Togo's president and rivals agree to invite foreign mediators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema and his
main rivals have agreed to invite diplomats from Europe and
French-speaking countries to mediate in January talks aimed at
resolving an election dispute, party officials said Friday.
	   The mediators are from the European Union, Germany, France and
other French-speaking countries, representatives of the government
and a coalition of nine opposition groups said in private radio
station broadcasts.
	   Talks observers from the United States, Canada and neighboring
African states may also be invited.
	   Party leaders have quietly met three times in the past month to
lay the groundwork for official talks likely to take place in
mid-January, said an official from the largest opposition group
Union of Forces for Change led by Gilchrist Olympio.
	   Olympio has filed a protest with Togo's Supreme Court,
contesting the results of June presidential elections in which
Eyadema prematurely ended vote-counting and declared himself the
winner.
	   The opposition groups have boycotted parliament and organized
several several street protests which have flared into violence
with police.
	   Eyadema has offered to form a coalition government with Olympio,
but the opposition leader rejected the proposal and said he would
continue to contest the June election results.
	   Eyadema has ruled Togo since seizing power 31 years ago in a
bloody military coup, during which he ordered the execution of
former President Sylvanus Olympio, Gilchrist's father.

Serb attack deals new setback to shaky Kosovo peace accord

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fresh fighting erupted Friday near a
rebel stronghold in northern Kosovo, where a Serb offensive that
began the previous day has dealt a new blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the region.
	   The renewed clashes were confirmed by Jorgen Grunnet, spokesman
for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He
said William Walker, the American diplomat who heads the OSCE's
team of unarmed peace verifiers, had gone to the area of the
fighting near the northern town of Podujevo.
	   Details on the extent of the latest fighting were not
immediately available.
	   At least one person was confirmed dead from the offensive
against several rebel-occupied villages which began Christmas Eve,
backed by artillery and dozens of Yugoslav army tanks.
	   International verifiers said an ethnic Albanian girl was killed
in Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital
Pristina, by a sniper.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center put Thursday's
death toll at at least nine, including a woman and a 6-year-old
girl, and said a large number were wounded.
	   The government action was ``revenge aimed at killing 10 ethnic
Albanians for one killed Serb,'' the ethnic Albanian center said in
a statement Friday.
	   The United States, France and the European Union warned both
sides against further violence. In an interview with the Serbian
independent newspaper Danas, the EU envoy for Kosovo, Wolfgang
Petritsch, said the international community ``will not tolerate an
excessive use of force by the Yugoslav army'' in the province.
	   ``Dozens of armored vehicles and tanks have been observed
deployed in the region,'' Petritsch, Austria's ambassador to
Belgrade, said. ``Villages close to Podujevo are attacked by heavy
artillery and automatic fire.''
	   Besides threatening to plunge Kosovo back into widespread combat
following more than two months of a shaky peace, the fighting has
raised new concerns for the safety of the OSCE verifiers.
	   A team of peace monitors was threatened by a Serbian policeman
Thursday while they were watching a Yugoslav military barracks in
Pristina from which tanks and armored vehicles were moving toward
Podujevo, according to Grunnet. The policeman threatened to shoot
unless the observers moved away in two minutes, he said.
	   ``A very strong protest was sent to Yugoslav authorities,''
Grunnet said.
	   The Yugoslav government has pledged to ensure the protection of
the verifiers force, which currently consists of about 600 and is
to reach 2,000 by the end of next month. A NATO force of 1,800
soldiers is stationed in neighboring Macedonia to rescue them if
needed.
	   Serbian authorities have said the action was in response to the
killing of a Serb policeman, and was reinforced after a ``terrorist
attack'' on a convoy that wounded two soldiers Thursday.
	   ``The Yugoslav army returned fire and destroyed the terrorist
group,'' the statement concluded. Police also reported they
captured a 24-year-old ethnic Albanian, Daut Rahmani, accused of
killing a pro-Serb ethnic Albanian this week at a cafe in the town
of Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of Pristina has sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills. An
Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by an artillery shell in the village of Glavnik, and ethnic
Albanians said several others were injured.
	   It came after U.S. and NATO officials warned both sides against
violence which could threaten a fragile Oct. 12 cease-fire. That
deal ended most of the fighting between government forces and
ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for Kosovo from Serbia,
Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for the province's
independence, stopped short of abrogating a separate cease-fire it
proclaimed unilaterally just before the October deal was reached.
	   In a statement issued in Pristina, however, the rebels said they
would ``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means
available.''
	   Walker expressed frustration at the apparent lack of will for a
peaceful settlement.
	   ``Both sides have been looking for trouble and found it,'' he
said.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC television
Thursday the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the
commitments'' undertaken in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' Solana said.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.

Bin Laden urges Muslims to kill Americans, Britons to avenge Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Muslim extremist Osama Bin Laden has
called for Muslims to kill Americans and Britons as they supported
their armed forces' attacks on Iraq.
	   ``The British and the American people loudly declared their
support for their leaders' decision to attack Iraq,'' Bin Laden
said in Friday's edition of the Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat.
	   This made it ``the duty of Muslims to confront, fight and kill
(Britons and Americans). And anything that can be taken from them
by force is the rightful prize of Muslims'' Bin Laden added.
	   The London-published newspaper said the interview with Bin Laden
was conducted in the mountains of Helmand province, southern
Afghanistan.
	   The United States and Britain carried out airstrikes on Iraqi
military and communications sites Dec. 16-19 to punish Baghdad for
its alleged obstruction of U.N. inspectors seeking evidence of its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Washington accuses Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, of
masterminding the twin bombing of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya on Aug. 7. The blasts killed 224 people, including 12
Americans.
	   Thirteen days later the United States blasted Bin Laden's camps
in Afghanistan with cruise missiles.
	   Bin Laden denied any involvement in the embassy bombings, but
expressed his ``admiration and support'' for the attackers.
	   After the United States attacked Bin Laden's camps, the Taliban
_ the militia that controls 90 percent of Afghanistan _ announced
that it had imposed restrictions on Bin Laden, including barring
him from giving press interviews.
	   Bin Laden told Asharq Al-Awsat that while the Taliban had
prohibited him from carrying out attacks on foreign countries, he
continues to ``guide (Muslims) toward holy war against Jews and
Christians. This is a duty.''
	   The interview was the second to be published with Bin Laden in
two days. It was not immediately clear whether he was defying the
Taliban's restrictions or whether they had been eased. A Taliban
spokesman could not be reached for comment.
	   A businessman who made a fortune in construction, Bin Laden
first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against the Soviet
occupation army.

Chechnya's Islamic court suspends parliament, fires officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government reaction in new grafs 5, 8. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a blow to Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov,
the top Islamic court in the breakaway republic suspended the
parliament and fired several senior officials for ``collaboration''
with Russians, news reports said on Friday.
	   The Supreme Shariah Court also found Maskhadov guilty of
appointing the officials, whom it said assisted Russia's
``occupation regime'' during the 1994-96 independence war, and
warned him against such actions in the future.
	   In a ruling announced late Thursday, the court also dismissed
Maskhadov's wife Kusama as head of a charity, citing
``inadmissibility of women holding top posts in an Islamic state,''
the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported.
	   The court ruled to suspend the pro-president Chechen parliament,
saying its activities contradicted Islamic norms, and ordered it be
replaced with a council of top military commanders. It was not
clear what the court meant by suspending parliament.
	   Turpal Atgeriyev, Chechnya's deputy prime minister, said on
Friday that the court's decision didn't mean the dissolution of the
parliament. Members of parliament will join the new council along
with military chiefs and religious leaders, he said.
	   The court also dismissed Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur
Tagirov along with the local airline chief, tax boss and Chechnya's
envoy to Russia.
	   The court's verdict came after an appeal from a group of
prominent Chechen warlords, who accused Maskhadov of breaking
Chechen law by maintaining close relations with Russia and had
demanded his ouster.
	   Maskhadov accepted the court's ruling, saying through Atgeriyev
that he would accept any verdict ``as the Koran requires from a
faithful Muslim.''
	   Chechnya has run its own affairs since defeated Russian troops
withdrew in 1996, but no country has recognized its independence
bid and Moscow continues to consider the southern republic a part
of Russia.
	   Maskhadov won presidential elections almost two years ago by an
overwhelming margin, and retains widespread support despite his
failure to restore stability and combat kidnapping and other crime.
	   Hundreds of people have been abducted for ransom in Chechnya in
recent years. In an unusually gruesome display of lawlessness, four
Western captives were beheaded earlier this month.

Parliament bars Zhirinovsky from speaking after a squabble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist-dominated parliament on Friday
censored ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky for insulting fellow
lawmakers after he shouted that the Communists deserve to ``be
shot.''
	   The parliament's lower house, the State Duma, voted 242-1 to bar
Zhirinovsky from taking the floor for one month following a heated
squabble during Friday's debate on ratification of a friendship
treaty with Ukraine.
	   Zhirinovsky, who leads the third-largest Duma faction, denounced
the treaty, saying it would hurt Russia's interests. The Communists
and other factions voted for the treaty.
	   After the Duma ratified the treaty, Zhirinovsky erupted in anger
and assailed the Communists, shouting at one point that they should
be shot.
	   He then stormed out of the house, joined by his 50-member
faction.
	   Zhirinovsky, known for outrageous statements and violent
behavior, has been involved in a number of brawls and other
incidents inside and outside of parliament.
	   During one fight in the Duma, Zhirinovsky grabbed a woman
lawmaker by the throat and punched her in the head.
	   He also once punched a parliamentary deputy from St. Petersburg
in a dispute over who would go first in the lunch line. Another
time, he beat up a defector from his party and then threatened to
tear another lawmaker's beard out ``hair by hair.''

Russia continues to oppose use of force against Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday
warned the West against using force to halt the latest violence in
Kosovo.
	   U.S. and NATO officials warned both sides in Kosovo not to use
violence after a Serb offensive against an ethnic Albanian rebel
stronghold. The U.S. State Department also condemned all breaches
of an October cease-fire, including attacks by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which seeks to secede from Yugoslavia.
	   Last October, NATO prepared air raids against the Serbs over
their crackdown on Kosovo's Albanians, but the offensive was put on
hold after the cease fire was reached and Belgrade pulled out some
of its forces.
	   Ivanov said that if the West attacks Serbian forces, such
``strikes would play into the hands of extremists in the region.''
He blamed the KLA for the recent violence, and said that Moscow
would do all it could to avert any NATO strikes.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed use of force against the Serbs, its
long-time allies.

Bin Laden urges Muslims to kill Americans, Britons to avenge Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Muslim militant Osama Bin Laden has
urged Muslims to kill Americans and Britons for supporting their
armed forces' attacks on Iraq, according to an interview with an
Arabic newspaper.
	   ``The British and the American people loudly declared their
support for their leaders' decision to attack Iraq,'' Bin Laden
said in Friday's edition of the newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat.
	   This made it ``the duty of Muslims to confront, fight and kill
(Britons and Americans),'' Bin Laden said. ``And anything that can
be taken from them by force is the rightful prize of Muslims.''
	   The United States and Britain carried out airstrikes on Iraqi
military and communications sites Dec. 16-19 to punish Baghdad for
its alleged obstruction of U.N. inspectors seeking evidence of its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   The London-published newspaper said the interview with Bin Laden
was conducted in the mountains of Helmand province, southern
Afghanistan.
	   Washington accuses Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, of
masterminding the twin bombing of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya on Aug. 7. The blasts killed 224 people, including 12
Americans. Thirteen days later the United States blasted Bin
Laden's camps in Afghanistan with cruise missiles.
	   Bin Laden denied any involvement in the embassy bombings, but
expressed his ``admiration and support'' for the attackers.
	   After the United States attacked Bin Laden's camps, the Taliban
_ the militia that controls 90 percent of Afghanistan _ announced
that it had imposed restrictions on Bin Laden, including barring
him from giving press interviews.
	   Bin Laden told Asharq Al-Awsat that while the Taliban had
prohibited him from carrying out attacks on foreign countries, he
continues to ``guide (Muslims) toward holy war against Jews and
Christians. This is a duty.''
	   The interview was the second to be published with Bin Laden in
two days. It was not immediately clear whether he was defying the
Taliban's restrictions or whether they had been eased. A Taliban
spokesman could not be reached for comment.
	   A businessman who made a fortune in construction, Bin Laden
first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against Soviet
occupation.

PaineWebber sets up mutual fund venture with major Japanese insurer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with confirmation from companies,
details.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ New York-based PaineWebber Group Inc. and Yasuda
Mutual Life Insurance Co., one of Japan's top insurers, announced
plans Friday to set up a jointly owned company to sell mutual funds
in the Japanese market.
	   The joint venture, called Yasuda PaineWebber Mutual Fund Co.,
will open its doors in April and aims to carve out a share of
Japan's estimated dlrs 9 trillion pool of personal savings.
	   It will specialize in developing and marketing investment trusts
_ Japan's version of mutual funds _ ahead of the expected
introduction of retirement savings plans similar to the 401(k)
common in the United States.
	   The accord builds on an 11-year business alliance between the
two companies that has been fortified by Yasuda Mutual's purchase
of an 8.1 percent stake in PaineWebber.
	   PaineWebber will take a 45 percent share in the venture, with
the remaining majority stake going to Yasuda Mutual and a Yasuda
affiliate.
	   The move is the latest example of an American financial
powerhouse expanding its presence in Japan, which recently has
begun deregulating its banking, brokerage and insurance industries.
	   In October, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co. said
it would set up a Tokyo-based mutual fund business with Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest lenders.
	   Prudential Insurance Co. and Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. agreed
in July to open a joint mutual fund company. Earlier this year,
Merrill Lynch and Fidelity Investments Co. both announced plans to
set up separate nationwide retail networks in Japan.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko on Friday agreed to take moves to merge the two former
Soviet republics into a single state as early as next year.
	   Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed to put the proposed merger to
public discussion by the middle of next year. Without waiting for
popular approval, they would also move early next year to introduce
a single currency and harmonize taxes.
	   ``We are now calling for merging our nations in one union
state,'' Yeltsin said at a news conference after the signing. ``We
can be proud of such work.''
	   ``God help us to enter the next millennium as a single state,''
Lukashenko said.
	   Yeltsin, plagued by poor health in recent years, appeared tired
at the meeting, although he spoke clearly and strongly. At one
point, he struggled to get up from a chair and had to be helped by
an aide.
	   The authoritarian Lukashenko, an admirer of the Soviet Union,
has long pushed for uniting his nation of 10 million people with
Russia's 147 million people. In 1996, he and Yeltsin signed a union
agreement, boosting political, economic and military ties between
the two nations, but stopping short of creating one state.
	   The two leaders have long pledged to take further integration
steps, but had done little. It remains unclear whether today's
agreements would be implemented, as many Russian politicians oppose
a merger.
	   Russian news reports said the proposed merger would be put to a
plebiscite, but the text of the statement signed by Yeltsin and
Lukashenko called only for ``public discussion,'' a vague formula
that doesn't necessarily mean a referendum.
	   Yeltsin appeared to cast doubt on a referendum. ``The referendum
issue may arise, or it may not,'' he said. ``If it arises, we must
somehow solve it.''
	   Other Russian top officials quickly said there is no immediate
plan to merge the two nation's armed forces or pool the government
coffers.
	   Lukashenko wants a merger to solve Belarus' economic problems
that have already led to food rationing in some regions. The
Belarusian economy is one of the most unreformed in the former
Soviet Union, with virtually all assets and markets under
government control.
	   In an immediate step to ease Belarusian economic woes, Yeltsin
and Lukashenko signed a document to allow Russian and Belarusian
companies to import goods from each other at domestic prices. The
agreement is crucial for Belarus, which relies on Russia's energy
resources and has run up a huge debt.
	   Domestic prices for Russia's oil and natural gas are still far
lower than the world market price.
	   Apart from the economic interests, many politicians in both
nations believe that the main motive behind Lukashenko's drive for
union is his ambition to run for the Russian presidency. Lukashenko
has dodged questions about his possible ambitions.
	   ``Some believe that Lukashenko wouldn't mind becoming the
Russian leader, and many Russians wouldn't like that,'' Yegor
Stroyev, the speaker of the Russian parliament's upper house said
in an interview published Friday in the daily Novye Izvestia.
	   Russian liberals and the West assail Lukashenko for his
crackdown on the opposition and the independent media. Russian
Communists and other hardliners publicly hail the proposed merger,
but tacitly oppose it, fearing that the assertive Belarusian
president would push them to the sidelines if he joins Russia's
presidential race.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government, struggling with the worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse, has been lukewarm on the
merger with even poorer Belarus.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of Protestant worshipers
gathered for a Christmas Day service in a church gutted by fire in
a riot, praying and singing hymns within mottled and blackened
walls.
	   But the congregation stood under a new metal roof that replaced
the one that collapsed in flames last month, when a Muslim mob
attacked and ransacked the church hours after a Sunday service.
	   For weeks afterward, shaken but determined women cooked and
brought food from home while their husbands, brothers and sons
installed wooden pews, metal folding chairs and a borrowed sound
system.
	   ``We have tried to renovate it by our own efforts,'' said Pang
Pak Im, a deacon at the Taman Sari Protestant church in Jakarta,
the sprawling capital of predominately Muslim Indonesia.
	   Built in 1990, the church was among more than a dozen that were
burned or ransacked on Nov. 22 after religious and ethnic tensions
triggered rioting that killed 14 people. Muslim rioters shouted
``God is great'' as they smashed stained glass windows and statues
of Jesus Christ.
	   A week later, Christians in the city of Kupang in eastern
Indonesia retaliated by setting fire to four mosques as well as a
Muslim school and hostel for Islamic pilgrims.
	   Beset by political uncertainty and a lingering economic crisis,
Indonesia has endured sporadic riots since the turbulent ouster of
former President Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian
rule.
	   Many people fear more violence ahead of parliamentary elections
set for June as newly formed political parties jostle for
influence. Student protests against Suharto's successor, President
B.J. Habibie, are expected to resume next year.
	   Plans for a Christmas midnight mass at Jakarta's Roman Catholic
cathedral were dropped months ago because of growing street crime
linked to the worst economic turmoil in three decades. Millions of
people have lost their jobs and prices of basic commodities have
soared.
	   Thousands of people attended daytime and evening Christmas
services at the cathedral as well as at other churches around
Indonesia.
	   ``All of us are aware the situation in Indonesia is still
unpredictable,'' said the Protestant deacon, Pang, who works as a
manager of the Indonesian subsidiary of EMI records. ``People
advised us to rebuild but we think it is unwise.''
	   Wary of the threat of more religious unrest, parishioners will
hold off on renovating the church for at least two years. Much of
the money they collect will be used to dispatch missionaries to
villages around the archipelago nation of 200 million people.
	   At a Christmas Eve mass, an odor of charred timbers lingered and
several policemen stood guard outside. Worshipers, most of them
ethnic Chinese, lit candles and sang ``O, Holy Night''
	   Ninety percent of Indonesians are Muslim, and the rest are
mostly Christian or Buddhist. Religious tolerance is enshrined in
the state philosophy, Pancasila, and Christmas is a national
holiday.
	   Many Christians are members of the Chinese minority, which has
often been targeted in times of social unrest because of its
relative wealth and perceived links to corrupt government
officials.
	   ``You have to be grateful for what you have,'' said parishioner
Mary Lengkong, a health lecturer at the state University of
Indonesia. ``But maybe deep down, there's a little fear.''

Spanish prosecutor favors extraditing suspected murderer to
</HEADLINE>
Britain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chief prosecutor of Spain's National
Court has come out in favor of granting Britain's request to
extradite alleged road rage murderer Kenneth Noye, a news report
said Friday.
	   Prosecutor Eduardo Fungairino concluded that Noye should be
extradited in a report prepared for the Madrid-based National Court
that is hearing the case, according to the private news agency
Europa Press.
	   No further details of the report were available.
	   Noye is wanted for questioning by the British authorities for
the stabbing death of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron after the two got
into an argument in May 1996 on the busy M25 highway encircling
London.
	   After over two years on the run, Noye was arrested in southern
Spain in August, and is currently being held in a prison close to
Madrid.
	   Fungairino's report prepared for the National Court is a
required step towards a formal extradition hearing before a
three-judge panel that will decide whether to send Noye to Britain.
	   Noye, 51, said he would fight extradition during a 10-minute
preliminary hearing on Nov. 16 before Judge Baltasar Garzon _ the
same judge spearheading efforts to extradite former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain from London on charges of
terrorism, torture and genocide.
	   Spain's National Court hears cases considered of national
interest such as large-scale corruption, terrorism, or extradition.
	   Routinely referred to in Britain's tabloid press as one of the
country's most wanted men, Noye was sentenced in 1986 to 14 years
in prison for his role in a dlrs 38.7 million gold robbery. He was
released several years ago.
	   In 1985 he was acquitted of killing an undercover policeman,
John Fordham, who was part of a team investigating the gold
robbery.

	   LONDON: you down.''
	   ``I am sorry that it is now all over. We raced across the
Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (322 kph) but ended up hitting a
solid trough from one end to the other,'' Branson said. ``All day
and all night we battled to get through it.''
	   ``Our weather team say that it would have taken us a week to get
through if we are lucky _ but by the end of the week we would more
likely end up in the Pacific anyway.
	   The balloonists got sucked into a low pressure system overnight
in the Pacific. They had been moving the craft up and down between
6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) in an
effort to find a fast enough easterly wind to carry them to the
United States.
	   They had picked up an easterly wind, but at 14 knots (16 mph or
26 kph), it was not enough to get them out of trouble.
	   If the balloonists had made the U.S. West Coast they would have
broken the balloon distance record which American Fossett set on an
earlier attempt to circumnavigate the globe earlier this year.
	   Ironically, it was the treacherous Pacific which ended that
venture, forcing him to ditch hundreds of miles from the coast in
shark-infested waters.

Serb attack deals new setback to shaky Kosovo peace accord

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fresh fighting erupted Friday near a
rebel stronghold in northern Kosovo, where a Serb offensive dealt a
new blow to U.S.-led efforts to bring peace to the region.
	   The renewed clashes were confirmed by Jorgen Grunnet, spokesman
for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He
said William Walker, the U.S. diplomat who heads the OSCE's
cease-fire monitors, had gone to the area of the fighting near the
northern town of Podujevo.
	   The fighting comes after U.S. and NATO officials warned both
sides against violence which could threaten a fragile Oct. 12
cease-fire. That deal ended most of the fighting between government
forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for Kosovo
from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   Details on the extent of the latest fighting were not
immediately available.
	   At least one person was confirmed dead from the offensive
against several rebel-occupied villages which began Christmas Eve,
backed by artillery and dozens of Yugoslav army tanks.
	   International verifiers said an ethnic Albanian girl was killed
by a sniper in Podujevo, 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
capital Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center put Thursday's
death toll at nine, including a woman and a 6-year-old girl, and
said a large number were wounded.
	   The government action was ``revenge aimed at killing 10 ethnic
Albanians for one killed Serb,'' the ethnic Albanian center said in
a statement Friday.
	   The United States, France and the European Union warned both
sides against further violence.
	   In an interview with the Serbian independent newspaper Danas,
the EU envoy for Kosovo, Wolfgang Petritsch, said the international
community ``will not tolerate an excessive use of force by the
Yugoslav army'' in the province.
	   Besides threatening to plunge Kosovo back into widespread combat
following more than two months of a shaky peace, the fighting has
raised new concerns for the safety of the OSCE verifiers.
	   A team of peace monitors was threatened by a Serbian policeman
Thursday while they were watching Yugoslav military barracks in
Pristina from which tanks and armored vehicles were moving toward
Podujevo, according to Grunnet. The policeman threatened to shoot
unless the observers moved away, he said.
	   ``A very strong protest was sent to Yugoslav authorities,''
Grunnet said.
	   The Yugoslav government has pledged to protect the 600
verifiers, whose numbers are to reach 2,000 by the end of January.
A NATO force of 1,800 soldiers is stationed in neighboring
Macedonia to rescue them if needed.
	   Serbian authorities have said the action was in response to the
killing of a Serb policeman, and was reinforced after a ``terrorist
attack'' on a convoy that wounded two soldiers Thursday.
	   ``The Yugoslav army returned fire and destroyed the terrorist
group,'' the statement concluded. Police also reported they
captured a 24-year-old ethnic Albanian, Daut Rahmani, accused of
killing a pro-Serb ethnic Albanian this week at a cafe in the town
of Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of Pristina has sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for the province's
independence, stopped short of abrogating a separate cease-fire it
proclaimed unilaterally just before the October deal was reached.
	   In a statement issued in Pristina, however, the rebels said they
would ``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means
available.''
	   Walker expressed frustration at the apparent lack of will for a
peaceful settlement.
	   ``Both sides have been looking for trouble and found it,'' he
said.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday the Serb
offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments'' undertaken
in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end eight
months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.

Japanese draft budget will double size of annual deficit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet unveiled a draft budget for 1999 on
Friday that will double the size of the annual deficit as it pays
for efforts to kickstart the nation's moribund economy.
	   The 81.9-trillion yen (dlrs 706 billion) in proposed spending,
which still must win approval from Parliament, represents a 5.4
percent increase from this year's budget.
	   The budget proposal features 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion)
in new public works spending and tax cuts worth more than 9
trillion yen (dlrs 78 billion).
	   Both steps are aimed at lifting the economy out of its worst
recession since the end of World War II.
	   ``This draft budget for fiscal year 1999 has been made up with
priority on promoting economic recovery,'' the Ministry of Finance,
which compiled the spending proposal, said in a statement.
	   The new spending comes as tax revenues are projected to shrink
by 20 percent from this year due to the tax cuts and the weak
economy.
	   That would leave the proposed budget with a shortfall of more
than 31 trillion yen (dlrs 267 billion), which the government must
cover with new borrowing.
	   That's about twice the 15.6 trillion-yen (dlrs 134-billion)
deficit in this year's original budget.
	   Japan's cumulative national debt is already larger than its
gross domestic product _ a dubious distinction it shares only with
Italy among developed nations. The U.S. national debt, by contrast,
is just half its GDP.
	   But Tokyo has set aside concerns about the ballooning size of
its national debt since Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took office
this past summer and proclaimed reviving the economy as his
administration's primary goal.
	   The budget proposal also includes large increases for spending
on social security, scientific research and programs to retrain
unemployed workers.
	   Foreign aid will total 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.6 billion), a
slight rise from this year.
	   Military spending will slip 0.2 percent as Tokyo cancels or
postpones purchases of new ships and aircraft. But the budget would
add 960 million yen (dlrs 8.3 million) to begin study of a joint
ballistic missile defense system with the United States.
	   Parliament will begin deliberating on the budget in January, in
time for the start of fiscal 1999 in April.

	   MARGATE, South Africa (AP) _ Eight people were killed on
Thursday in a raid by apparent gate-crashers to a party, police
said.
	   The victims, including two injured, were celebrating Christmas
Eve with friends at their home when a group of men opened fire on
them, police spokesman Bala Naidoo said Friday.
	   It was not clear if the attack was connected to ongoing
political clashes in the region.
	   The alleged gunmen ``apparently wanted to gate crash the party
but were refused entry,'' Naidoo said.
	   The attack occurred before midnight on the southeastern coast of
South Africa. Seven people survived the attack.
	   The attackers took the family's music system and fled, Naidoo
said. President Nelson Mandela on Friday condemned the Christmas
Eve attack.
	   ``I appeal to members of the public not to take the law into
their own hands and resort to any revenge attacks,'' Mandela said
in a statement from his home at Qunu, near Umtata in the Eastern
Cape.
	   -----
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema and his
main rivals have agreed to invite diplomats from Europe and
French-speaking countries to mediate in January talks aimed at
resolving an election dispute, party officials said Friday.
	   The mediators are from the European Union, Germany, France and
other French-speaking countries, representatives of the government
and a coalition of nine opposition groups said in private radio
station broadcasts.
	   Observers from the United States, Canada and neighboring African
states may also be invited.
	   Party leaders have quietly met three times in the past month to
lay the groundwork for official talks likely to take place in
mid-January, said an official from the largest opposition group
Union of Forces for Change led by Gilchrist Olympio.
	   Olympio has filed a protest with Togo's Supreme Court,
contesting the results of June presidential elections in which
Eyadema prematurely ended vote-counting and declared himself the
winner.
	   The opposition groups have boycotted parliament and organized
several street protests which have flared into violence with
police.
	   Eyadema has offered to form a coalition government with Olympio,
but the opposition leader rejected the proposal and said he would
continue to contest the June election results.
	   Eyadema has ruled Togo since seizing power 31 years ago in a
bloody military coup, during which he ordered the execution of
former President Sylvanus Olympio, Gilchrist's father.
	   -----
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ A rogue militia group
loyal to Republic of Congo's former prime minister has opened up
new attacks in towns west of the capital, a government spokesman
said Friday.
	   The Ninja militia fighting on behalf of ex-Prime Minister
Bernard Kolelas has attacked soldiers and civilians in the
neighboring towns of Nkayi and Dolisie about 250 kilometers (150
miles) west of Brazzaville, Francois Ibovi told reporters without
giving details.
	   Ibovi accused Kolelas and former President Pascal Lissouba of
hatching a ``criminal plot'' to destabilize the Central African
country and divide its ethnic groups.
	   Human rights and aid groups say recent fighting between the
Ninjas and President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's personal Cobra militia
has prompted tens of thousands of civilians to flee their homes in
Brazzaville and towns in the country's southwest.
	   Unarmed residents have been killed, women raped and homes
destroyed in shelling between the two forces.
	   The hostilities are a reversal of last year's civil war that
ravaged Brazzaville and resulted in up to 10,000 deaths when
Sassou-Nguesso captured the presidency from Lissouba, a sometime
ally of Kolelas.
	   Sassou-Nguesso, the Republic of Congo's longtime Marxist
dictator who is now advocating capitalist reform, was ousted in the
country's first multi-party elections in 1992.
	   Angola and Chad have soldiers in Republic of Congo supporting
Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   ----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A petrol bomb injured two people
on Friday and destroyed a house belonging to a man who had been
warned by an anti-drug group, police said.
	   Police are investigating arson and attempted murder, said police
spokesman Supt. Wicus Holtzhausen. The alleged attackers also fired
15 shots into the house.
	   Similar attacks in the past have been linked to a vigilante
group called People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, or PAGAD.
	   The house owner, Jacobus May, 58, was wounded in the stomach and
leg in the early morning incident. A second person suffered burn
wounds.
	   Holtzhausen said May was warned at the beginning of the year by
an anti-drug group to cease his alleged illegal activities. He did
not name the group.

Mother, three children slain and burned on Christmas morn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with suspect, the father, killed in a car
crash; other motorist seriously injured. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WAGENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Christmas morning brought a scene
of horror in this central Dutch town: the charred bodies of a
mother and her three young children. Police said all four had been
murdered.
	   Firefighters responding to a blaze in the family home found the
burned bodies of the mother and the youngsters, who ranged in ages
from three to 11, Dutch television reported Friday.
	   Neighbors said they heard a terrible quarrel in the home before
the fire broke out at around 7:30 a.m., destroying the house.
Authorities said the killer apparently set fire to the house to
cover his tracks.
	   Dutch television said the father was the prime suspect in the
slayings, but that shortly after the blaze began, he was killed in
a head-on car crash on a nearby highway. The driver of the other
vehicle was seriously injured.
	   Police would not confirm whether the man killed in the crash was
the father, or comment on whether his death might have been a
suicide.
	   The victims' identities were not released in line with Dutch
privacy laws.
	   Wageningen is a university town in the central Netherlands,
about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. Last New
Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a private party there.

Soft drugs on demand? German doctors say no
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A suggestion by Germany's health minister
to allow pharmacies to sell small amounts of soft recreational
drugs was rejected Friday by the main doctors' association.
	   Andrea Fischer, health minister in the new center-left
government, floated the idea this week, saying it could keep casual
users from moving to more dangerous substances by ``separating the
markets for soft and hard drugs.''
	   Karsten Vilmar, head of the German Chamber of Doctors,
disagreed. He called the proposal ``a false liberalization'' that
would give a state stamp of approval to drug use and actually lead
more young people into addiction.
	   ``Drug consumption risks becoming a normal part of our culture
if hashish now is to be sold over the counter,'' he said in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Carbon monoxide fumes believed to have come from a
faulty heating system sickened 250 people attending Christmas Mass
in a village church, sending 40 of them to the hospital.
	   The worshippers and the priest suffered headaches, nausea and
vomiting as the Thursday evening service ended in Saverdun, a
village in the southwestern Ariege region.
	   Recognizing the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, a doctor
called for help, and a crisis center was set up in a village hall,
where throughout the night worshippers were treated with oxygen.
	   Forty people, including young children and a pregnant woman, had
to be hospitalized in nearby Toulouse or other towns. No lives were
in danger, officials said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three adventurers abandoned their bid Friday to be
the first to fly non-stop around the world in a balloon after
hitting dangerous weather in the Pacific Ocean.
	   ``I'm afraid the weather has beaten us,'' said the team's
project director Mike Kendrick. ``We are planning to bring the
balloon down towards Honolulu to attempt a beach or sea landing.''
	   He said they would wait until it is dawn there (1745GMT) for the
best landing conditions.
	   The balloonists, British mogul Richard Branson, American
millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were feeling
``deflated _ like the balloon is going to be in a few hours,''
Kendrick said, speaking from the project's control center in
England.
	   ``It's a bit of bad luck. We almost made it. I think we missed
the weather by an hour.''
	   He said the safety of the team, all veteran balloonists, was not
in jeopardy and that the landing is being treated as non-emergency.
	   The balloonists got sucked into a low pressure system overnight
in the Pacific. They had been moving the craft up and down between
6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) about 200
miles (322 kilometers) off Hawaii in an effort to find a fast
enough easterly wind to carry them to the United States.
	   They had picked up an easterly wind, but at 14 knots (16 mph or
26 kph), it was not enough to get them out of trouble. Hendrick
said there was no chance of any stronger winds soon and that they
would have been stuck in the depression for a week.
	   ``By the time weathermen finished their work and analyzed all
the information it was quite easy to see that no hanging around
would produce a good result. It is time to cut our losses,''
Hendrick said.
	   Branson outlined the last hours of the struggle in a statement
read out by Kendrick to a news conference at the control center.
	   ``We raced across the Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (322
kph) but ended up hitting a solid trough from one end to the
other,'' Branson said. ``It has been like hitting up against a
solid brick wall. All day and all night we battled to get through
it.''
	   ``We are sorry to have let you down,'' he said, adding the team
plan to return home to spend what was left of the Christmas holiday
with their families and friends.
	   If the balloonists had made the U.S. West Coast they would have
broken the balloon distance record which American Fossett set on an
earlier attempt to circumnavigate the globe earlier this year.
	   It was the treacherous Pacific which ended that venture, forcing
him to ditch hundreds of miles from the coast in shark-infested
waters.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, but cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   The voyage of the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot-air and
helium balloon began in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18., aiming to
land in Western Europe.
	   Before hitting bad weather in the Pacific, the crew faced
diplomatic problems.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   Last Friday, Libya withdrew permission to fly over its territory
and only reversed the decision after a personal plea from Branson
to Lybian leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Then, in conditions marred by thunderstorms, the crew had to
maneuver the craft through narrow gaps between no-fly territories,
including war-torn Iraq.
	   And negotiations took place over several days earlier this week
with the Chinese authorities after the balloon drifted into
unauthorized airspace.
	   The Chinese asked the balloonists to land at an airfield, but
the balloon overshot the site and could not come down anywhere
else. With the help of British diplomats, the balloonists won
Chinese permission to continue.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three bodies in what appeared to be North Korean
military uniforms were found near the coast of Japan early Friday,
but police said they had been at sea too long to be crewmen from a
North Korean spy boat sunk by South Korea last week.
	   The bodies were spotted floating near a beach in the town of
Takahama at around 7:40 a.m. Friday (2340 GMT Thursday), said a
spokesman for the Fukui prefectural police.
	   All three were decomposed, which indicated they had been in the
Sea of Japan for much longer than one week, said the officer, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   That appeared to make it unlikely the bodies were from a North
Korean vessel sunk by South Korean ships on Dec. 18 in waters
between the Korean peninsula and Japan, he said.
	   The bodies were tied with rope to a small wooden raft. One had
what appeared to be a star-shaped North Korean insignia of rank
attached to a shirt collar, he said.
	   Autopsies were planned to determine the cause of death, the
officer said.
	   Takahama, located about 430 kilometers (267 miles) west of
Tokyo, is a fishing town facing the Sea of Japan near where the
North Korean vessel was sunk.
	   South Korean navy ships have been scouring the area since the
sinking, looking for debris and other North Korean vessels.
	   They have found the body of one of the vessel's crew but said
three more people were sighted on the boat before it went down.
	   South Korean officials have said the vessel, described as a
fast, low-profile boat used to land or pick up spies, was believed
to be on an espionage mission.

Spokesman: Yeltsin plans trip to France in January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin may travel to France in
January, his spokesman said Friday. This would be the first foreign
trip after months of canceled travel plans due to Yeltsin's
ailments.
	   Russian media and politicians _ including Yeltsin's own aides _
have speculated that Yeltsin's health problems would rule out any
foreign travel during the rest of his term, which runs out in
mid-2000.
	   Angered by such suggestions, Yeltsin fired his staff wholesale
earlier this month and appointed a new team, which soon announced
that doctors had judged Yeltsin fit to travel and that several
trips abroad are planned for 1999.
	   No definite schedule has been announced. Yeltsin doesn't plan to
leave Moscow before the end of the year, presidential spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin said Friday.
	   But ``the work schedule for January is being worked out now, and
a trip to France is being considered,'' Yakushkin told reporters.
	   In another move to assert his authority, Yeltsin scolded his
potential successors Thursday for actively mounting presidential
campaigns 18 months before the election _ or even acting as if they
were already president.
	   Yeltsin didn't name names. Yakushkin said he had asked Yeltsin
to elaborate on Friday, but the president had refused.
	   ``He smiled and said: `Let them think. Let them guess,'''
Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin appeared to be referring to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov,
who recently launched his own political movement and has been
speaking out on national issues such as economic policy and
Russia's foreign relations.
	   Luzhkov has been an ally of Yeltsin for years, but recently the
mayor has been critical of the president.
	   Yeltsin worked at the Kremlin on Friday, meeting with his chief
of staff Nikolai Bordyuzha and holding telephone conversations with
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and speaker of parliament Gennady
Seleznyov.
	   During a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko,
Yeltsin appeared tired, though he spoke clearly and strongly. At
one point, an aide had to help him out of his chair.
	   Yeltsin has made only occasional trips to the Kremlin recently,
spending most of his time at Gorky-9 while recuperating from
illnesses including a recent bout of pneumonia.
	   The 67-year-old leader underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery
two years ago. But he insists he has no crippling illness and
intends to serve out his term, which runs until mid-2000.
	   Aside from his meetings, Yeltsin was busy Friday preparing New
Year's gifts for his grandchildren. New Year is the biggest holiday
in Russia, while Christmas _ celebrated on Jan. 7 _ is largely an
afterthought.
	   Yeltsin plans to celebrate New Year with his family at a country
residence near Moscow, gathering around a camp fire outside when
the clock strikes midnight, Yakushkin said.
	   The clock will strike midnight twice for the Yeltsins: The
family celebrates New Year first when it comes to their native
Siberian city of Yekaterinburg, two time zones ahead of Moscow, and
then according to Moscow time, Yakushkin said.

Congo peace summit postponed again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Peace talks to end to the war in Congo were
postponed for the third time after Congo President Laurent Kabila
refused to meet with rebel leaders, the state controlled Herald
newspaper reported in Zimbabwe on Friday.
	   A summit of regional presidents was scheduled in the Zambian
capital of Lusaka on Monday.
	   The Herald said regional leaders failed to agree on ``the level
of participation'' of Congolese rebels at the summit.
	   It said South Africa favored face-to-face talks between all
warring sides while Kabila and his southern African military allies
_ Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe _ wanted ``proximity talks'' with
the rebels mediated by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
	   Kabila's refusal to meet with the rebels doomed two earlier
summits aimed at ending the five-month-old war that involves troops
from six other nations.
	   No date for a rescheduled summit was given.
	   Rwanda and Uganda, which back the rebels, have admitted sending
troops onto Congolese soil. The two countries argue that a
tentative peace agreement forged in Paris last month does not fully
address their security concerns.
	   Kabila has insisted on negotiating only with Rwanda and Uganda.
He refuses to speak to the rebel coalition made up of ethnic
Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition Congolese
politicians.

Ukraine's parliament postpones debate of 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday postponed
debate of the government's 1999 budget draft until next week after
deputies failed to agree on the projected deficit.
	   Communists and their allies voted against the proposed deficit
of 1 percent of the gross domestic product, arguing that the budget
draft the Cabinet had proposed for debate in the second reading
differed from targets earlier approved by lawmakers.
	   No decision was made about when the budget debate would be
resumed.
	   Parliament initially approved the 1999 draft budget on its first
reading earlier in December, raising the government's original
revenue target by nearly 50 percent and limiting the deficit to
zero.
	   The Cabinet, however, strongly objected to parliament's move and
restored the budget's primary targets practically to the original
ones.
	   The draft debated Friday provided for revenues of 23.4 billion
hryvna (dlrs 6.83 billion) and expenditures of 24.6 billion hryvna
(dlrs 7.18 billion), with annual inflation forecast at 19 percent.
	   Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov, who presented the budget to
lawmakers, argued that with Ukraine's economy expected to further
decline by 1 percent in 1999 and with mounting debt obligations,
the former Soviet republic cannot count on revenues and
expenditures as high as parliament wanted.
	   He also said the deficit of 1 percent was ``acceptable and
absolutely safe'' and was needed to allow the government more money
to cover the huge wage and pension arrears.
	   ``We must approve this budget in order to preserve economic and
social stability,'' Mitiukov said.
	   Ukraine's government has consistently failed to implement
reforms since gaining independence in 1991, bringing on continuous
economic decline, mounting wage arrears and a huge foreign debt.
	   The government raised only 63 percent of planned annual revenues
in the first 11 months of 1998, while its debt in unpaid wages and
pensions has steadily grown to more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 875
million), according to official statistics.

<TEXT>
	   WAGENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Christmas morning brought a scene
of horror in this central Dutch town: the charred bodies of a
mother and her three young children. Police said all four had been
murdered.
	   Firefighters responding to a blaze in the family home found the
burned bodies of the mother and the youngsters, who ranged in ages
from three to 11, Dutch television reported Friday.
	   Neighbors said they heard a terrible quarrel in the home before
the morning fire, destroying the house. Authorities said the killer
apparently set fire to the house to cover his tracks.
	   Dutch television said the father was the prime suspect in the
slayings, but that shortly after the blaze began, he was killed in
a head-on car crash on a nearby highway. The driver of the other
vehicle was seriously injured.
	   Police would not confirm whether the man killed in the crash was
the father, or comment on whether his death might have been a
suicide.
	   The victims' identities were not released in line with Dutch
privacy laws.
	   Wageningen is a university town in the central Netherlands,
about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. Last New
Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a private party there.

</HEADLINE>
minister

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The president of Sao Tome and Principe
has ratified the parliamentary choice for the new prime minister of
this west African archipelago, news reports said Friday.
	   President Miguel Trovoada confirmed Guilherme Posser da Costa as
prime minister on Wednesday, five days after he was named by the
Movement of Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe/Social Democratic
Party to head a new government, Portuguese daily Diario de Noticias
said.
	   The center-left MLSTP/PSD won 31 seats in the 55-seat parliament
in parliamentary elections on Nov.8.
	   Posser da Costa replaces Raul Braganca Neto who headed a
two-year coalition government made up of the MLSTP/PSD and the
Democratic Convergence Party.
	   A law graduate who began his political career in the MLSTP/PSD
in the 1970s, Posser da Costa served as foreign minister between
1986 and 1995.
	   After winning the parliamentary elections, the MLSTP/PSD was
expected to name party chief Manuel Pinto da Costa as the new prime
minister _ a longtime political rival of President Trovoada.
	   Pinto da Costa ran the former Portuguese colony under a
single-party Marxist system for 16 years following its 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea _ about 240
kilometers (150 miles) west of Gabon _ in one of the most active
oil exploration areas in the African continent.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko agreed Friday to take steps to merge the two former
Soviet republics into a single state as early as next year.
	   Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed to put the proposed merger to
public discussion by mid-1999. Without waiting for popular
approval, they would also move early next year to introduce a
single currency and harmonize taxes.
	   ``We are now calling for merging our nations in one union
state,'' Yeltsin said at a news conference after the signing. ``We
can be proud of such work.''
	   ``God help us to enter the next millennium as a single state,''
Lukashenko said.
	   Yeltsin, plagued by poor health in recent years, appeared tired
at the meeting, although he spoke clearly and strongly. At one
point, he struggled to get up from a chair and had to be helped by
an aide.
	   The authoritarian Lukashenko, an admirer of the Soviet Union,
has long pushed for uniting his nation of 10 million people with
Russia's 147 million people. In 1996, he and Yeltsin signed a union
agreement, boosting political, economic and military ties between
the two nations, but stopping short of creating one state.
	   The two leaders have long pledged to take further integration
steps but have in fact done little. It remains unclear whether
today's agreements will be implemented, as many Russian politicians
oppose a merger.
	   Russian news reports said the proposed merger would be put to a
plebiscite, but the text of the statement signed by Yeltsin and
Lukashenko called only for ``public discussion.''
	   Other top Russian officials quickly said there is no immediate
plan to merge the two nation's armed forces or pool the government
coffers.
	   Lukashenko wants a merger to solve Belarus' economic problems,
which have already led to food rationing in some regions. The
Belarusian economy is one of the most unreformed in the former
Soviet Union, with virtually all assets and markets under
government control.
	   ``The man who has brought his nation to a deadlock is now
desperately trying to find a way out,'' Semyon Sharetsky, an
opposition leader in Belarus, said of Lukashenko.
	   In an immediate step to ease Belarusian economic woes, Yeltsin
and Lukashenko agreed to allow Russian and Belarusian companies to
import goods from each other at domestic prices. The agreement is
crucial for Belarus, which relies on Russia's energy resources and
has run up a huge debt.
	   Domestic prices for Russia's oil and natural gas are still far
below the world market price.
	   Apart from the economic interests, many politicians in both
nations believe that the main motive behind Lukashenko's drive for
union is his ambition to run for the Russian presidency.
	   Russian liberals and the West have assailed Lukashenko for his
crackdown on the opposition and the independent media. Russian
Communists and other hardliners publicly hail the proposed merger,
but tacitly oppose it, fearing that the assertive Belarusian
president would push them to the sidelines if he joins Russia's
presidential race.
	   The Russian government, struggling with the worst economic
crisis since the Soviet collapse, has been lukewarm on the merger
with even poorer Belarus.

Ukraine's parliament raises minimum wage again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament raised the country's
minimum wage on Friday, two days after failing to override a
presidential veto on a bill that would have allowed an sharper wage
increase.
	   Lawmakers increased the monthly minimum wage from 55 hryvna
(dlrs 16) to 73.7 hryvna (dlrs 22) and set the official poverty
level at 90.7 hryvna (dlrs 26).
	   Last month, parliament nearly tripled the minimum wage to 148
hryvna (dlrs 43). However, President Leonid Kuchma refused to sign
the bill into law, arguing that the hike would force the government
to lay off workers and print more money.
	   The parliament's latest wage hike may not be vetoed, since it
nearly meets the targets used by the Cabinet in calculating the
1999 budget.
	   Nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage. The
average monthly salary was about 170 hryvna (dlrs 50) in the first
half of 1998.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers ratified a long-delayed friendship
treaty with Ukraine on Friday after the Russian government warned
that rejection would push Kiev toward closer links with NATO.
	   The parliament's lower house, the State Duma, voted 244-30 to
ratify the treaty signed by Russia's Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma in May 1997.
	   Kuchma hailed the ratification, saying the treaty would benefit
both nations. Ukraine's parliament speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko also

Heavy prison terms for 15 Kosovo Albanian separatists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fifteen ethnic Albanians were
sentenced to a total of 100 years in jail Friday by a court in
Serbia's Kosovo province for terrorism and ``activities hostile to
the state.''
	   Only seven stood trial, which had opened earlier this month, and
the remaining eight were tried in absentia with search warrants for
them still active. The individual prison terms ranged from three to
10 years.
	   The most prominent among the accused is Berat Luzha, a former
journalist and head of the Kosovo Albanians' Association of
Political Prisoners. His first conviction, on similar charges, was
in the early 1980s for taking part in rallies by Kosovo Albanian
secessionists.
	   The trial was held under tight security in the district court in
the province's capital Pristina, amid high tensions brought by
renewed fighting between ethnic Albanian pro-secession rebels and
Serbian government troops.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three adventurers abandoned their bid Friday to be
the first to fly nonstop around the world in a balloon after
hitting dangerous weather over the Pacific Ocean.
	   ``I'm afraid the weather has beaten us,'' said the team's
project director Mike Kendrick. ``We are planning to bring the
balloon down towards Honolulu to attempt a beach or sea landing.''
	   He said they would wait until it is dawn there (1745GMT) for the
best landing conditions.
	   The balloonists, British mogul Richard Branson, American
millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were feeling
``deflated _ like the balloon is going to be in a few hours,''
Kendrick said, speaking from the project's control center in
England.
	   ``It's a bit of bad luck. We almost made it. I think we missed
the weather by an hour.''
	   He said the safety of the team, all veteran balloonists, was not
in jeopardy and that the landing is being treated as non-emergency.
	   The balloonists got sucked into a low pressure system overnight
in the Pacific. They had been moving the craft up and down between
6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) about 200
miles (322 kilometers) off Hawaii in an effort to find a fast
enough easterly wind to carry them to the continental United
States.
	   They had picked up an easterly wind, but at 14 knots (16 mph or
26 kph), it was not enough to get them out of trouble. Hendrick
said there was no chance of any stronger winds soon and that they
would have been stuck in the depression for a week.
	   ``By the time weathermen finished their work and analyzed all
the information it was quite easy to see that no hanging around
would produce a good result. It is time to cut our losses,''
Hendrick said.
	   Branson outlined the last hours of the struggle in a statement
read out by Kendrick to a news conference at the control center.
	   ``We raced across the Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (322
kph) but ended up hitting a solid trough from one end to the
other,'' Branson said. ``It has been like hitting up against a
solid brick wall. All day and all night we battled to get through
it.''
	   ``We are sorry to have let you down,'' he said, adding the team
plan to return home to spend what was left of the Christmas holiday
with their families and friends.
	   If the balloonists had made the U.S. West Coast they would have
broken the balloon distance record which Fossett set on an earlier
attempt to circumnavigate the globe earlier this year.
	   It was the treacherous Pacific which ended that venture, forcing
him to ditch hundreds of miles from the coast in shark-infested
waters.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, but cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   Rival balloonist Colin Prescott, who is planning his own bid to
circumnavigate the globe in a balloon, said the defeat of the ICO
balloon was ``sad, but not a complete surprise.''
	   ``It has been an amazing journey. Let's hope it all ends happily
and safely,'' he told SKY News.
	   The voyage of the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot-air and
helium balloon began in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18., aiming to
land in Western Europe.
	   Before hitting bad weather in the Pacific, the crew faced
diplomatic problems.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   Last Friday, Libya withdrew permission to fly over its territory
and only reversed the decision after a personal plea from Branson
to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Then, in conditions marred by thunderstorms, the crew had to
maneuver the craft through narrow gaps between no-fly territories,
including Iraq.
	   And negotiations took place over several days earlier this week
with the Chinese authorities after the balloon drifted into
unauthorized airspace.
	   The Chinese asked the balloonists to land at an airfield, but
the balloon overshot the site and could not come down anywhere
else. With the help of British diplomats, the balloonists won
Chinese permission to continue.

Mother, three children slain and burned on Christmas morn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WAGENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A man murdered his wife and three
young children early Christmas morning, then set fire to their home
and fled, police said. Within hours, the man was killed in a
head-on car crash.
	   Dutch television quoted neighbors as saying the couple had a
terrible fight before flames burst from the house in this
university town in the central Netherlands, about 80 kilometers (50
miles) southeast of Amsterdam.
	   Firefighters responding to the blaze made the grisly discovery
of the charred bodies of the children, ages 3, 7 and 11, and their
mother, 34. Their names were not released in line with Dutch
privacy laws.
	   TV reports said the woman's husband, 37, was killed in a crash
on a nearby highway not long after firefighters were called to the
home at 7:30 a.m. Friday. The other driver involved in the accident
was seriously injured.
	   Authorities said the man apparently set fire to the house to
cover his tracks. They would not say whether his death was a
suicide.
	   It was the second holiday tragedy to strike Wageningen in less
than a year. Last New Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a
private party there after a fight broke out among guests.

Search continues for boat lost with eight men
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Searches were continuing Friday for a Spanish
fishing boat with eight men aboard that vanished when a storm hit
the southwestern French coast nearly a week ago.
	   French authorities suspended their search on Thursday, but
Spanish authorities were still looking for the ``Marero,'' which is
registered in the port of Pasajes in Spain's Basque province of
Guizpoca.
	   Three helicopters, a patrol plane, and two tugboats were being
used in the search.
	   The 23-meter (yard) vessel disappeared Saturday about 90
kilometers (55 miles) north of the French port of Bayonne during a
fierce storm.
	   France's Center for Monitoring and Sea Rescue is still
coordinating the Spanish search effort.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fresh fighting erupted Friday near a
rebel stronghold in northern Kosovo, where a Serb offensive that
began the previous day has dealt a new blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the region.
	   The renewed clashes were confirmed by Jorgen Grunnet, spokesman
for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He
said William Walker, the American diplomat who heads the OSCE's
team of unarmed peace verifiers, had gone to the area of the
fighting near the northern town of Podujevo.
	   Details on the extent of the latest fighting were not
immediately available. The state Tanjug news agency said a team of
Serbian officials investigating Thursday's fighting was fired at by
ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.'' There were no injuries after the
investigators withdrew from near the village of Lapastica, Tanjug
said.
	   At least one person was confirmed dead from the offensive
against several rebel-occupied villages which began Christmas Eve,
backed by artillery and dozens of Yugoslav army tanks.
	   International verifiers said a 4-year-old child _ presumably
ethnic Albanian _ was killed in Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles)
north of the capital Pristina, as a result of Thursday's gunfire.

Latest data shows Japan's economy continues to crumble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economy continued to crumble last month,
with no indication the country is poised for a rebound, economic
data released Friday showed.
	   Industrial output is sliding, sales at department stores are
slumping and unemployment has reached a new postwar high, according
to government figures for November.
	   What's more, a report from financial authorities shows that
Japan's notoriously troubled banks have even more bad loans than
previously thought.
	   Nothing in the latest batch of economic data supports recent
predictions by government officials that Japan's worst postwar
recession is nearing an end.
	   The series of dour economic reports began with the release of
November job figures early Friday. The Management and Coordination
Agency said Japan's unemployment rate rose to a record-high 4.4
percent as the corporate world cut payrolls and suffered a wave of
bankruptcies.
	   The jobless rate was the highest since the government started
keeping track of unemployment in the 1950s, topping the previous
record of 4.3 percent.
	   For the first time, unemployment in Japan equaled that of the
United States, where the jobless rate also was 4.4 percent in
November.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said the
job situation would likely get worse before it gets better.
	   ``There's strong pressure for the jobless rate to rise,'' said
Sakaiya, one of Japan's top economic planners.
	   His comments contrasted sharply with his recent upbeat
prediction that the economic slump would soon near an end.
	   The news Friday was no better for Japan's once-mighty
manufacturers.
	   Industrial output at factories and mines in November fell a
larger-than-expected 2 percent compared to the previous month, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
	   The fall was considerably larger than forecast by private
economists and the government.
	   And while the ministry predicted there would be a 0.3 percent
rebound in production in December, it agreed with other forecasters
that a recovery was not yet in sight.
	   ``There still isn't enough data to indicate that the economy has
hit bottom,'' the ministry said.
	   Meanwhile, the trade ministry also reported that sales at major
department stores and supermarkets fell 1.5 percent in November
from a year earlier, the seventh straight month of declines.
	   Economists blame problems at Japan's banks for the prolonged
slump.
	   Many banks are buried under mountains of bad loans left from the
collapse of a speculative bubble in land prices in the early 1990s.
	   While they battle with those debts, they have cut back on new
loans to businesses, contributing to a nasty credit and record rise
in bankruptcies.
	   Another report Friday showed the bad loan problem is worse than
banks have admitted.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency said the 17 banks had about
49.50 trillion yen (dlrs 427 billion) in shaky loans as of March
31, about 12 percent more than the banks had disclosed.

SAfrican Muslims start boycott to protest Iraq bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A coalition of Muslim
organizations said on Friday it would organize a boycott of
American and British products to protest the bombing of Iraq.
	   The group, the Iraq Action Committee, said in a statement that
it would join an international movement of protest actions.
	   Yusuf Saloojee, spokesman for the group, said the Iraq bombing
was a crime against humanity that needed to be stopped by a
``culture of resistance.''
	   The group called for a ``united action of peace loving people
internationally and within South Africa to condemn the unilateral
bombing and massacre of the Iraqi people by the United States and
Britain.''

Kyrgyz parliament confirms new prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The parliament of Kyrgyzstan approved the newly
appointed prime minister on Friday, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   President Askar Akayev named Zhumabek Ibraimov to the top
government post after the Cabinet resigned en masse earlier this
week. Akayev had accused the Cabinet of incompetence in dealing
with the Central Asian nation's economic problems.
	   Ibraimov has previously served as director of a car assembly
plant, head of the city administration in the capital Bishkek, head
of Akayev's presidential administration and Akayev's representative
in parliament. Since 1997, he has headed Kyrgyzstan's property
fund, which is responsible for privatization, Interfax said.
	   Akayev has led Kyrgyzstan since it won independence in the 1991
Soviet breakup. The mountainous country has enjoyed political
stability, but there has been minimal economic development.
	   According to government figures, the economy has grown 1.7
percent this year, which would make Kyrgyzstan one of the few
ex-Soviet republics that has not seen an economic contraction in
1998.
	   However, the country suffers from high inflation, a trade
deficit and a weakening currency.

sides against violence which could threaten a fragile Oct. 12
cease-fire. That deal ended most of the fighting between government
forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for Kosovo
from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.

	   WAGENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch man murdered his wife and
three young children Christmas morning, then set fire to their home
and fled, police said. Within hours, the man was killed in a
head-on car crash.
	   Dutch television quoted neighbors as saying the couple had a
terrible fight before flames burst from the house in this
university town in the central Netherlands, about 80 kilometers (50
miles) southeast of Amsterdam.
	   Firefighters responding to the blaze made the grisly discovery
of the charred bodies of the children, ages 3, 7 and 11, and their
mother, 34. Their names were not released in line with Dutch
privacy laws.
	   TV reports said the woman's husband, 37, was killed in a Friday
morning crash on a nearby highway not long after firefighters were
called to the home. The other driver involved in the accident was
seriously injured.
	   Authorities said the man apparently set fire to the house to
cover his tracks. They would not say whether his death was a
suicide.
	   It was the second holiday tragedy to strike Wageningen in less
than a year. Last New Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a
party after a fight broke out among guests.

Nepalese prime minister names new Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's prime minister on Friday named an
11-member Cabinet that for the first time included a nominee of the
king, the state-run Radio Nepal said.
	   Nepal's politics has been in turmoil since no party won a clear
majority in the 1994 general elections. Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala is heading the sixth government in the past four
years.
	   Five ministers come from the party of Koirala, the United
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal has four and the Nepal
Goodwill Party one minister.
	   Ramesh Nath Pandey, a lawmaker nominated by King Birendra to the
upper house, has been included in the Cabinet for the first time
since democracy returned to the Himalayan kingdom in 1990. He will
be the minister for population and environment.
	   The king nominates one-sixth of the 60 members in the upper
house. But the powerful 205-seat lower house is directly elected by
the people.
	   Prime Minister Koirala will also head the foreign and defense
ministries. Bharat Mohan Adhikari of the United Marxist-Leninist
Communist Party of Nepal will be the new finance minister.
	   Interior security will be the responsibility of Govindraj Joshi
of the Koirala's Nepali Congress party. Gajendra Narayan Singh of
the Nepal Goodwill Party was named industry minister.
	   Koirala was re-appointed prime minister Wednesday after he
cobbled together a new coalition after losing the parliamentary
majority. The next general elections are due in November next year,
but Koirala and his allies plan to advance the voting to April.
	   Until 1990, Nepal was an absolute monarchy. A pro-democracy
movement forced constitutional reforms that reduced the king to a
figurehead.

Cuban government to allow broadcast of Christmas message
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Cardinal's message scheduled for 2200 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANITA SNOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuba's communist government was granting the Roman
Catholic church a rare Christmas wish on Friday: authorization to
send a holiday greeting over government-controlled radio.
	   Cardinal Jaime Ortega, Cuba's top Catholic leader, received
permission to read the message Christmas afternoon over the music
station called Radio Musical Nacional, government and church
sources confirmed.
	   The authorization was a sign of continued warming relations
between Fidel Castro's government and the Catholic church nearly
one year after Pope John Paul II visited the island.
	   It comes a month after the government declared that Christmas
would become an official permanent holiday. It made Christmas a
one-day holiday last year as a favor to the pope before his January
1998 visit.
	   Ortega said earlier this week that he had asked the government
for permission to send Cubans a radio message to explain the
Christian meaning of Christmas. Access to the official media has
been one of the church's leading demands and was granted on a
limited basis before and during the papal visit, which was covered
extensively by government broadcasts.
	   ``It is necessary to show that Christmas is a holiday with other
characteristics,'' Ortega said at the time. ``It is not a carnival
nor an end-of-year party that you celebrate in a public plaza. It
is something intimate and of the family.''
	   Cubans have embraced the idea of having another day off, but the
resurgent celebrations remain largely secular.
	   Most families in the capital celebrated by decorating a small
artificial Christmas tree in their home and sharing quiet holiday
meals of roast pork with their families.
	   Still, as last year, hundreds crowded churches for midnight
Christmas eve services _ a tradition that has grown in recent
years.
	   Early Christmas morning, most residents of Havana seemed to be
celebrating the holiday by sleeping late. The capital's streets
were more quiet than an average Sunday.
	   Ortega and other church leaders in recent days have emphasized
the need to recapture the religious traditions of the holiday,
largely forgotten here during the nearly three decades that
Christmas was abolished.
	   Although the communist government declared itself atheist in
1962, Christmas remained an official holiday in Cuba until 1969,
when the government was throwing its resources into an unsuccessful
effort to harvest 10 million metric tons of sugar.
	   The government argued that holidays interfered with the harvest.
	   In late November, the Communist Party said mechanization had
reduced the need for manpower in the sugar harvest and reinstated
the holiday.
	   At the time Christmas was abolished the government often clashed
with the Catholic hierarchy.
	   Religious believers were barred from being members of the
Communist Party and from holding many sensitive jobs. Displaying a
Christmas tree at that time could lead to conflicts with
neighborhood Communist Party officials.
	   In 1976, Cuba's constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and
in 1991, the Communist Party dropped its ban on religious
believers. A year later, Cuba declared itself a secular rather than
an atheist state.
	   Restrictions on believers have fallen away and church-state
relations have grown steadily warmer, capped by the papal visit.

South African Muslims start boycott to protest Iraq bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A coalition of Muslim
organizations said on Friday it would organize a boycott of
American and British products to protest the bombing of Iraq.
	   The group, the Iraq Action Committee, said in a statement that
it would join an international movement of protest actions.
	   Yusuf Saloojee, spokesman for the group, said the Iraq bombing
was a crime against humanity that needed to be stopped by a
``culture of resistance.''
	   The group called for a ``united action of peace loving people
internationally and within South Africa to condemn the unilateral
bombing and massacre of the Iraqi people by the United States and
Britain.''

	   The Vatican's English translation of the Pope John Paul II's
``Urbi et Orbi'' (Latin for to the city and to the world) Christmas
message, delivered in Italian, Friday:
	   ``Regem venturum Dominum, venite, adoremus''.
	   ``Come, let us adore the King, the Lord, who is to come.''
	   How many times have we repeated these words throughout the
season of Advent, echoing the expectation of all humanity.
	   Straining towards the future from his very origins, man thirsts
for God, the fullness of life. From the beginning he has invoked a
Savior to free him from evil and death, to fulfill his need for
happiness. In the Garden of Eden, after the first sin, God the
Father, faithful and merciful, had foretold to him the coming of a
Savior (Gen 3:15), who would restore the broken covenant, and
create a new relationship of friendship, understanding and peace.
	   This joyful message, entrusted to the children of Abraham, from
the time of the Exodus from Egypt (Exodus 3:6-8), has echoed down
the centuries as a cry of hope on the lips of Israel's prophet, who
time and again reminded the people: ``Prope est dominus, venite,
adoremus!''
	   ``The Lord is near; come let us adore him!''
	   Come to adore the God who does not forsake those who seek him
with a sincere heart and strive to keep his law. Heed his message,
which strengthens hearts broken and confused. Prope est Dominus:
faithful to his ancient promise, God the Father has now brought it
to pass in the mystery of Christmas.
	   Yes, his promise, which nourished the trusting expectation of
countless believers, has become a gift in Bethlehem, in the heart
of the Holy Night. Yesterday the Liturgy of the Mass reminded us of
it: ``Hodie scietis quia veniet Dominus, et mane videbitis gloriam
eius.''
	   ``Today you will know that the Lord comes: at daybreak will see
his glory.''
	   Last night we saw the glory of God, proclaimed by the joyful
singing of the angels; we have adored the King, the Lord of the
universe, together with the shepherds keeping watch over their
flock. With the eyes of faith we too have seen, placed in a manger,
the Messiah, the Prince of Peace, and beside him the Virgin Mother
in silent adoration.
	   Today we join the angelic host, the enraptured shepherds; we too
sing in exultation: ``Christus natus est nobis: venite, adoremus,''
	   ``Christ is born for us: come, let adore him.''
	   From the night of Bethlehem until today, the Birth of the Lord
continues to inspire hymns of joy which express the tenderness of
God, sown in the hearts of men. In all the world's tongues, the
event most grand and most lowly is being celebrated: Emmanuel, God
with us for ever.
	   How many expressive songs has Christmas inspired in every people
and culture? Who has not known the emotions they express? Their
melodies bring alive once more the mystery of the Holy Night; they
tell us the encounter between the Gospel and the paths of mankind.
Yes, Christmas has entered the hearts of the people, who look to
Bethlehem with shared wonderment. The General Assembly of the
United Nations has also, unanimously, recognized the little city of
Judah (Matthew 2:6) as the land where the celebrations of Jesus's
birth will be, in the year 2000, a unique occasion for projects of
hope and peace.
	   How can we fail to notice the strident contrast between the
serenity of the Christmas carols and the many problems of the
present hour? We know the disturbing developments from the reports
coming each day from television and the newspapers, sweeping from
one hemisphere to the other of the globe: tragic situations, which
often involve human guilt and even malice, soaked in fratricidal
hate and senseless violence. May the light coming from Bethlehem
save us from the danger of becoming resigned to so tormented and
distressing scenario.
	   May the proclamation of Christmas be a source of encouragement
to all those who work to bring relief to the tormented situation in
the Middle East by respecting international commitments. May
Christmas help to strengthen and renew, throughout the world, the
consensus concerning the need for urgent and adequate measures to
halt the production and sale of arms, to defend human life, to end
the death penalty, to free children and adolescents from all forms
of exploitation, to restrain the bloodied hand of those responsible
for genocide and crimes of war, to give environmental issues,
especially after the recent natural catastrophes, the indispensable
attention which they deserve for the protection of creation and
human dignity!
	   May the joy of Christmas, which sings of the birth of the
Savior, instill in all trust in the power of truth and of patient
perseverance in doing good. For each of us the divine message of
Bethlehem resounds: ``Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good
news of a great joy, to you is born this day in the city of David
the Savior, who is Christ the Lord (Luke 2:10-11).''
	   Today there shines forth, Urbi et Orbi, upon the city of Rome
and upon the whole world, the face of God: Jesus reveals him to us
as the Father who loves us. All you who are seeking the meaning of
life, all you whose hearts are burning with the hope of salvation,
freedom and peace, come to meet the Child born of Mary: He is God,
our Savior, the only one worthy of this name, the one Lord.
	   He is born for us, come, let us adore him!

Nine people die in Peru discotheque after tear gas bomb explodes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Nine people were crushed to death and seven
injured Friday morning after a tear gas attack in a Lima
discotheque packed with teen-agers celebrating Christmas Eve.
	   More than 200 people in the Suarez discotheque in the Lima
shantytown of Santa Anita fought to leave the second-story club
down its one, narrow staircase, crushing people underfoot, police
spokesman Omar Chinchay said.
	   The club's one door on the building's main floor had been locked
by the owners, forcing people to push their way out in a crushing
stampede, Chinchay said.
	   The canister was thrown into the discotheque from the street
through a window early Christmas morning, police said. The victims
ranged from 13 to 21 years of age, and all died of asphyxiation.
	   ``There was no space to leave the discotheque. The staircase was
narrow and the teen-agers were desperate to leave. It was almost a
jail,'' said Elcides Espejo, the father of a victim who had rushed
to the scene.
	   Police have not determined who threw the bomb, but witnesses
told local radio station Radioprogramas that they were members of a
youth gang.
	   Outside the discotheque, gang members fought police briefly
before being dispersed. The discotheque is a regular site of gang
clashes, neighbors said.
	   Most of the victims were poor teen-agers from Santa Anita, a
shantytown on Lima's eastern outskirts.

Kremlin: Communists consistently promote anti-Semitism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist Party is intentionally pushing
an anti-Semitic line, the Kremlin and Russian Jewish leaders said
Friday.
	   Virulent anti-Semitism has been voiced at increasingly high
levels of the party. The Justice Ministry, which is responsible for
enforcing the law against nationalist incitement, recently demanded
that party leader Gennady Zyuganov take a stand on his colleagues'
statements.
	   Zyuganov responded this week by accusing Jews of bringing on the
``extinction'' of Russia's people and the country's economic woes.
	   In an open letter, Zyuganov complained of the ``aggressive,
destructive role of Zionist (Jewish) capital in the collapse of
Russia's economy and the pilfering of its national wealth,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The Communists make up Russia's biggest political party, and
their faction dominates the lower house of parliament, the State
Duma. Zyuganov finished second in Russia's presidential election in
1996 and is likely to run again in 2000.
	   The Communists' anti-Semitic slurs ``demonstrate that there is a
clear political line by the party that is headed by Mr. Zyuganov,''
Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Friday.
	   ``This is not an accident, this is not a slip. ... They
consistently continue their line.''
	   ``This reminds of some very bad times not only in (the history
of) Russia, but in other countries as well,'' Yakushkin said,
referring to Nazi Germany.
	   In his letter to the Justice Ministry, Zyuganov lambasted
Zionism, a movement of support for the Jewish state of Israel. The
term is often used by Russian anti-Semites to refer to a perceived
Jewish conspiracy for world domination.
	   ``Our people are not blind. They cannot fail to see that the
spread of Zionism in the state government in Russia is one of the
reasons for the current catastrophic condition of the country, the
mass impoverishment and the process of extinction of its people,''
Zyuganov wrote in the letter, which has been widely quoted in the
Russian media.
	   The Justice Ministry said Friday that Zyuganov's response had
forced it to ``take immediate steps for preventing and thwarting
statements and actions aimed at fueling tension in society,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   However, the ministry didn't specify what actions it intended to
take. Previously, it has not gone beyond censorious rhetoric.
	   Several prominent Russian businessmen and politicians have
called for banning the party, saying it had evolved into fascism.
	   ``With his letter, Zyuganov emphasized that Communists
purposefully make anti-Semitism part of their ideology,'' Russia's
chief rabbi, Adolf Shayevich, said Friday, according to Interfax.

Queen calls for alliance of young and old
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a new-look Christmas broadcast, Queen Elizabeth
II called Friday for an alliance of young and old.
	   The 10-minute message showed video footage of all generations of
the royal family at work and play, highlighting moments from the
Queen Mother Elizabeth's 98th birthday and Prince Charles' 50th
birthday party to 14-year-old Prince Harry's arrival at Eton
College, one of Britain's most prestigious boarding schools.
	   ``It is not always easy for those in their teens or twenties to
believe that someone of my age _ of the older generation _ might
have something useful to say to them,'' said the queen, 72.
	   ``But I would say that my mother has much to say to me. Indeed,
her vigor and enjoyment of life is a great example of how to close
the so-called generation gap,'' she said.
	   The broadcast began with video footage of the royal family
around a Christmas tree at Buckingham Palace.
	   The format, relying less on the queen reading to the camera and
more on video footage from the royal year, was considered an
attempt to appeal to the younger generation as well as older
people.
	   ``No age group has a monopoly of wisdom, and indeed I think the
young can sometimes be wiser than us,'' she said. ``But the older I
get, the more conscious I become of the difficulties young people
have to face as they learn to live in the modern world.
	   ``We parents and grandparents must learn to trust our children
and grandchildren as they seize their opportunities, but we can, at
the same time, caution and comfort if things go wrong, or guide and
explain if we are needed.''
	   The queen paid tribute to forces that saw action in the Persian
Gulf this year, and to veterans of the two world wars, urging that
they and others who remember struggles unknown to the young not be
forgotten.
	   ``I know that those memories of ours define us as old, but they
are shared with millions of others, in Britain and the
Commonwealth, people who often feel forgotten by the march of
time,'' she said.
	   ``But with age does come experience, and that can be a virtue if
it is sensibly used,'' she said.
	   It was estimated that more than 100 million people worldwide
watched the broadcast.
	   Continuing the generational theme of her Christmas broadcast,
the queen referred to a reception held in June at Buckingham Palace
young achievers _ ``young people who, in their short lives, have
already set an example to us all,'' she said.
	   Finally, the queen paid tribute to people who volunteer for
community service, saying volunteer organizations provide ``bridges
across which the generations travel, meet and learn from one
another.''
	   ``They give us, with our families, our sense of belonging. It is
they that help define our sense of duty. It is they that can make
us strong as individuals, and keep the nation's heartbeat strong
and steady too.
	   ``Christmas is a good time for us to recognize all that they do
for us and to say a heartfelt thank you to each and every one of
them.''

Ukraine's parliament postpones debate of 1999 budget

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday postponed
debate of the government's 1999 budget draft until next week after
deputies failed to agree on the projected deficit.
	   Communists and their allies voted against the proposed deficit
of 1 percent of the gross domestic product, arguing that the budget
draft the Cabinet had proposed for debate in the second reading
differed from targets earlier approved by lawmakers.
	   No decision was made about when the budget debate would be
resumed.
	   Parliament initially approved the 1999 draft budget on its first
reading earlier in December, raising the government's original
revenue target by nearly 50 percent and limiting the deficit to
zero.
	   The Cabinet, however, strongly objected to parliament's move and
restored the budget's primary targets practically to the original
ones.
	   The draft debated Friday provided for revenues of 23.4 billion
hryvna (dlrs 6.83 billion) and expenditures of 24.6 billion hryvna
(dlrs 7.18 billion), with annual inflation forecast at 19 percent.
	   Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov, who presented the budget to
lawmakers, argued that with Ukraine's economy expected to further
decline by 1 percent in 1999 and with mounting debt obligations,
the former Soviet republic cannot count on revenues and
expenditures as high as parliament wanted.
	   He also said the deficit of 1 percent was ``acceptable and
absolutely safe'' and was needed to allow the government more money
to cover the huge wage and pension arrears.
	   ``We must approve this budget in order to preserve economic and
social stability,'' Mitiukov said.
	   Also Friday, Central Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said approval
of higher spending and deficit targets as opposed to what the
Cabinet wanted would make it impossible for the bank to keep the
hryvna stable.
	   ``We would be able to maintain positive trends in the currency
market only if a realistic budget draft (such as proposed by the
government) is approved,'' Yushchenko said.
	   Ukraine's government has consistently failed to implement
reforms since gaining independence in 1991, bringing on continuous
economic decline, mounting wage arrears and a huge foreign debt.
	   The government raised only 63 percent of planned annual revenues
in the first 11 months of 1998, while its debt in unpaid wages and
pensions has steadily grown to more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 875
million), according to official statistics.

Moderate earthquake hits Peru's capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A moderate earthquake rattled Peru's capital
on Friday, shaking buildings and causing office towers to sway, but
there were no initial reports of damage, authorities said.
	   A preliminary estimate put the Lima earthquake at magnitude 4.6,
said Luis Vilcapoma, a spokesman for Peru's Geophysical Institute.
A magnitude 4 quake can cause moderate damage.
	   Most high-rise buildings were empty for Christmas Day. In Lima's
sprawling shantytowns, where precarious hovels are vulnerable to
earthquakes, people ran out into the streets fearing their houses
would collapse.
	   They returned to their homes when there were no aftershocks,
local radio station Radioprogramas reported.
	   A slide of rubble and rock caused by the quake temporarily
blocked a stretch of Lima's Costa Verde highway, which runs along
the beach.
	   Vilcapoma said the quake, at 9:26 a.m. local time (1426 GMT),
hit seven miles (11 kilometers) southwest of downtown Lima under a
beach in the district of Chorillos.
	   It was felt along Peru's central coastline, he said.

One youth dies and 23 are injured in Brazilian riot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Christmas Eve riot at an
overcrowded juvenile detention facility in Brazil has left one
youth dead and nearly two dozen injured, officials said Friday.
	   Some 75 inmates overpowered several guards at the state-run
Tatuape juvenile detention center in Sao Paolo, Brazil's largest
city.
	   The rioters then set fire to the facility and were quickly
engulfed in flames. One youth burned to death while 23 others were
hospitalized with serious burns. No youth escape.
	   Most riots in juvenile detention centers and adult prisons are
caused by overcrowding, which forces prisoners to sleep on floors,
share the same bed or sleep in shifts.
	   Detention center guards have also complained that there is only
one guard per 20 juvenile offenders and that the center built for
3,000 youths houses 4,000.
	   Yet Francisco Solano de Carvalho, an administrator for the
state-juvenile detention system, said that escape attempts
occasionally occur on Christmas Eve, when many youth want to go
home. ``Christmas brings it on,'' he said.

Yassin, at Hamas rally, denounces Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual
leader of the militant Hamas group, on Friday denounced the visit
earlier this month of U.S. President Bill Clinton as an attempt to
destroy Palestinian unity.
	   Yassin's appearance at a rally to mark the 11th anniversary of
Hamas' founding was his first major appearance since being released
Wednesday from two months of house arrest.
	   Yasser Arafat's government put the charismatic sheik under house
arrest in October, after Hamas tried to blow up a school bus full
of Jewish children in the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat's dealings with Hamas have been difficult: Israel demands
that he act strongly contain Islamic militants who stage attacks
against Israel, but the Palestinian leader is reluctant to alienate
Yassin's following.
	   At the Gaza City refugee camp where the rally was held, a crowd
of at least 10,000 people turned out, chanting ``Yassin! Yassin!''
and struggled to touch the jeep in which he was driven through the
crowd. When the jeep stopped, followers lifted the ailing cleric's
wheelchair and carried him to the stage.
	   Representatives of Arafat's more moderate leadership
participated in the rally, perhaps to try to balance out to the
more militant message of Hamas, which opposes any peace with
Israel.
	   Hani Hassan, of Arafat's Fatah faction, praised Clinton's visit
to the Palestinian lands as a show of support for Palestinian
statehood.
	   But Yassin called Clinton an enemy.
	   ``I want to ask, what did Clinton do for us during his visit?
The purpose of his visit to the region was ... to destroy
Palestinian unity and the Palestinian dream,'' he told the
screaming crowd.
	   Touching on another sore point, Yassin called on the Palestinian
Authority to release Hamas activists from its jails and to root out
corruption within its ranks. The sheik also criticized the
Palestinian Authority for arresting Palestinian journalists last
week to try to prevent them from covering pro-Iraq rallies.
	   Despite the size of the rally and the stridency of the speeches,
Hamas was treading carefully. A Palestinian police official said
the radical group was told not to burn American flags or allow
masked demonstrators to appear at the rally.
	   More moderate demonstrations also took place Friday in the West
Bank town of Beit Sahur, where 2,000 Palestinians marched with 150
Israeli peace activists demanding peace and the creation of a
Palestinian state. Marchers released white pigeons as a symbol of
peace.

John Paul urges bad-news world to fight resignation

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In his Christmas message to the world, Pope
John Paul II on Friday worried about the danger of growing resigned
to daily reports of hate and violence and urged more efforts to ban
the death penalty and arms production.
	   Because he did not lead the faithful in the mid-morning Mass in
St. Peter's Basilica, the ailing, 78-year-old pope had a few extra
hours to rest, compared to many past years, following his
celebration into the wee hours of the public midnight Christmas Eve
Mass at the Vatican.
	   Still, John Paul, who last week had to cancel appointments
because of the flu, looked tired when he stepped out, his stooped
figure leaning heavily on his staff, at noon onto the main balcony
of the basilica facing St. Peter's Square to deliver the
traditional ``Urbi et Orbi'' message (Latin for to the city and to
the world).
	   ``How can we fail to notice the strident contrast between the
serenity of the Christmas carols and the many problems of the
present hour?'' the pope said, as nearly 40,000 pilgrims, tourists
and Romans listened in the sunny but chilly weather in the square
and millions watched on TV in dozens of countries.
	   John Paul spoke of the ``disturbing developments from the
reports coming each day from television and the newspapers,
sweeping from one hemisphere to the other of the globe, tragic
situations, which often involve human guilt and even malice, soaked
in fratricidal hate and senseless violence.''
	   ``May the light coming from Bethlehem save us from the danger of
becoming resigned to so tormented and distressing a scenario,'' the
pope continued.
	   In his message, John Paul mentioned no country by name. But he
singled out the ``tormented situation in the Middle East'' and
called for respect for ``international commitments,'' in apparent
reference to the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.
	   Last week, the pope denounced the Anglo-American airstrikes of
Iraq last week and urged Baghdad to do its part to resolve the
crisis over international arms inspections.
	   John Paul prayed that consensus be strengthened worldwide for
``urgent and adequate measures to halt the production and sale of
arms, to defend human life, to end the death penalty'' as well as
free children from exploitation and ``restrain the bloodied hand of
those responsible for genocide and crimes of war ....''
	   After reading his message, he made another, this time unscripted
call for banning the death penalty. St. Peter's Square was the
ending point of a march through Rome Friday morning by death
penalty opponents, including the city's mayor.
	   The phrase ``defend human life'' for the Vatican usually refers
to the church's opposition to abortion and euthanasia.
	   John Paul offered an impromptu greeting to the Kurdish people.
Earlier, a small group of Kurds reportedly tried to go into the
basilica with an Italian flag. Security officers took away the flag
and then let them go in, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
	   A rebel leader of Turkish Kurds, Abdullah Ocalan, detained in
Rome Nov. 12, is waiting to hear if Italy will grant him political
asylum. Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan to Turkey because he
could face the death penalty if convicted of terrorism.
	   John Paul's stooped figure seemed almost lost on the balcony,
which was the only part of the front of the basilica not covered by
netting and scaffolding as part of restoration for Holy Year
celebrations in 2000.
	   During midnight Mass, John Paul mentioned the approaching
Jubilee year. But while in his prepared text the pope said he
himself would inaugurate the Holy Year, in his speech the pope
spoke of the Roman Catholic church doing so.
	   On Friday, John Paul read out holiday greetings in 58 languages,
gliding over the musical tones of Maori and offering the longer
versions in Italian and in his native Polish.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has
rebuked some priests for their love of expensive cars and mobile
phones at a time when many parishioners are struggling to live, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Patriarch Alexy II told a church meeting on Wednesday that some
priests had assumed the lifestyle of ``new Russians'' - newly-rich
people notorious for ostentatious displays of wealth. The remarks
were unusually blunt since the church rarely exhibits its internal
problems.
	   Some priests were out of touch with ordinary Russians, who are
struggling to make ends meet as the economy goes through its worst
crisis since the Soviet collapse, the Moscow Times quoted Alexy as
saying.
	   ``One has to realize that a mass transformation of consciousness
is taking place among simple impoverished people,'' he said. ``They
see that they are not needed by anybody: Neither the state nor the
society is taking care of them, and now the Church too shows that
the rich and not the poor are closer to her.''
	   The patriarch also complained that some priests were forming
ties with dubious, possibly illegal businesses to obtain money.
	   Some parishes had ``business contacts with representatives of
private companies, banks and the shadow economy, who are interested
in legalizing their business through the Church. Should one say how
much this does not correspond with Christian ethics?'' he said.
	   He also said some priests were not doing enough to help the
poor.

Japanese finance watchdog says bad loans at banks exceed previous

estimates &QL;

 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese government financial watchdog said
Friday that the country's 17 largest banks have more bad loans on
their books than the liability-ridden lenders had previously
reported.
	   Uncertainty over the true extent of the non-performing loan
problem at Japanese banks has helped generate concern over the
stability of the country's banking system.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency announced Friday that its
investigations found the banks had about 49.5 trillion yen (dlrs
426 billion) in problem loans as of the end of the last fiscal year
in March. That's about 12 percent more than the banks' own estimate
of 44 trillion yen (dlrs 379 billion).
	   The agency's figure for problem loans, or loans which are highly
or somewhat likely to go bad, come in addition to 375.6 billion yen
(dlrs 3.23 billion) in already sour loans at the top banks.
	   Bad loans have mushroomed amid Japan's worst recession since
World War II as cash-strapped borrowers have increasing trouble
repaying funds readily extended during an economic boom in the late
1980s.
	   No breakdown was given for the burden at each of the key
lenders, which include industry leader Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd. and second-ranked Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
	   The roughly 5-trillion yen (dlrs 43 billion) discrepancy between
the government figure and the banks' previous estimates stemmed
from bank errors in calculations, such as excluding bad debts
racked up by affiliate companies, the agency said.
	   Private sector analysts said the number came as no surprise.
	   ``The figures came roughly as expected,'' said James Fiorillo,
an analyst in the Tokyo office of ING Baring Securities.
	   But Fiorillo said the amount of soured loans could be even
higher than the government's latest estimate because the payment
status for many loans has probably deteriorated since the start of
the current fiscal year.
	   Two banks that downplayed their exposure to bad loans were
recently declared insolvent and nationalized by the government.
	   Eager to ease worries, the government passed legislation in
October earmarking 60 trillion yen (dlrs 516 billion) in public
money to bail out weak banks or help replenish capital reserves at
healthier ones.
	   The establishment in June of the Financial Supervision Agency
with sweeping oversight powers was also designed to boost
confidence in Japan's ability to deal with the worsening banking
crisis.

Indian Defense minister urges ban on foreign consumer goods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ India's Defense Minister on Friday exhorted
the people to launch a movement against foreign consumer goods.
	   Fernandez, a socialist leader, threw Coca-Cola out of India
within a month of taking over as the country's industry minister in
1977.
	   Inaugurating a student conference in Bombay, George Fernandes
said India should import ``only those goods needed for its defense
and development.''
	   Without naming Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola, he said Friday that
these companies were controlling the soft drinks market in India.
	   He said that nationalism, or swadeshi, meant self-reliance,
self-respect, and using one's own language.

Russian government, lawmakers discuss budget amendments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Members of the Cabinet and parliament convened
Friday to discuss possible amendments to the draft 1999 budget
before the document goes up for a second vote in the legislature.
	   The lower house of parliament, or the State Duma, gave quick
initial approval to the draft budget Thursday in a sign of
political support for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government.
Yet the draft still must go through several rounds of voting in the
legislature, and lawmakers are expected to propose amendments
during each stage.
	   President Boris Yeltsin praised the quick passage of the draft
during a telephone conversation Friday with Duma speaker Gennady
Seleznyov, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   ``The president expressed hope that if this kind of cooperation
between the executive power and the Duma continues, then major
success will await us in 1999,'' Yakushkin told reporters.
	   A task-force made up of representatives of the two chambers of
parliament and the Cabinet met Friday.
	   It appeared that the task-force managed to resolve only a few
issues linked with Russia's proposed tax reform. The commission
proposed lowering the minimum taxable income from 60,000 rubles
(dlrs 3,000) a year to 30,000 or 40,000 rubles (dlrs 1,500 to dlrs
2,000) a year, said Alexander Zhukov, the chairman of the Duma's
budget committee.
	   It also proposed raising the value-added tax from 15 percent to
17 percent, he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said Friday that the slide
of the ruble and the ensuing fall in imports have given Russian
producers a ``unique'' chance to ``occupy market niches earlier
held by imports.''
	   He added that production and sale of some domestic goods has
already risen 10 percent to 50 percent since the start of the
crisis.
	   Desperate to fill its coffers, the government is trying to keep
up exports of oil _ Russia's main revenue earner _ despite the
slide in world oil prices, said Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister
Valery Garipov.
	   In the first 10 months of this year, Russia's oil exports were
up 8.1 percent against the same period last year and reached 114
million metric tons, Garipov said.
	   However, oil export earnings were down to 27.7 percent, to dlrs
8.9 billion, he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia's oil production this year is expected to total 302
million metric tons, and exports may exceed 130 million metric
tons, he said.
	   Also Friday, the state-controlled savings bank Sberbank began
repaying private deposits transferred from SBS-Agro, a commercial
bank that froze its accounts after the economic crisis hit in
August.

<TEXT>
	   WAGENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A man stabbed to death his wife
and three young children Christmas morning, then set fire to their
home and fled, police said. Within hours, the man was killed in a
head-on car crash.
	   Dutch television quoted neighbors as saying the couple had a
terrible fight before flames burst from the house in this
university town in the central Netherlands, about 80 kilometers (50
miles) southeast of Amsterdam.
	   Firefighters responding to the blaze made the grisly discovery
of the charred bodies of the children, ages 3, 7 and 11, and their
mother, 34. Their names were not released in line with Dutch
privacy laws.
	   TV reports said the woman's husband, 37, was killed in a crash
on a nearby highway not long after firefighters were called to the
home at 7:30 a.m. Friday. The other driver involved in the
accident, 33, was seriously injured.
	   Authorities said the killer, who used a kitchen knife in the
slayings, apparently set fire to the house to cover his tracks.
They would not say whether his death was a suicide.
	   It was the second holiday tragedy to strike Wageningen in less
than a year. Last New Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a
private party there after a fight broke out among guests.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Feeling ``deflated,'' three men attempting to be
first to circumnavigate the globe by balloon announced Friday that,
defeated by weather problems over the Pacific Ocean, they have
given up their challenge.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ all veteran balloonists _
planned a beach or sea landing off Honolulu, Hawaii, during the
early morning local time (1900GMT) to get the best conditions.
	   ``It's a bit of bad luck. We almost made it. I think we missed
the weather by an hour,'' said the team's project director Mike
Kendrick.
	   The failure means that Fossett's ballooning distance record of
15,200 miles (2,4461 kilometers), set earlier this year, still
stands. That attempt also ended in the Pacific, but closer to the
mainland of the United States.
	   ``We are deflated, about as deflated as the balloon will be in a
few hours time,'' Kendrick said. ``We are balloonatics, you know,
and we just keep going.''
	   The balloonists got sucked into a low pressure system overnight
in the Pacific. They had been moving the craft up and down between
6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) about 200
miles (322 kilometers) off Hawaii in an effort to find a fast
enough easterly wind in the atmosphere's jetstream to carry them to
the continental United States.
	   They had picked up an easterly wind, but at 14 knots (16 mph or
26 kph), it was not enough to get them out of trouble. Kendrick
said there was no chance of any stronger winds soon and that they
would have been stuck in the depression for a week.
	   ``By the time weathermen finished their work and analyzed all
the information it was quite easy to see that no hanging around
would produce a good result. It is time to cut our losses,''
Kendrick said. He said the safety of the team was not in jeopardy
and that the landing is being treated as non-emergency.
	   ``Richard, Per and Steve are all experienced pilots and the
balloon is in the best hands possible but we shan't relax until we
see those guys walking,'' he said.
	   Branson outlined the last hours of the struggle in a statement
read out by Kendrick to a news conference at the control center.
	   ``We raced across the Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (322
kph) but ended up hitting a solid trough from one end to the
other,'' Branson said. ``It has been like hitting up against a
solid brick wall. All day and all night we battled to get through
it.''
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, but cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   There are at least seven other contenders waiting in the wings
to claim one of the last remaining prized records.
	   Rival balloonist Colin Prescott, whose team plans its own
imminent bid, said the ICO balloon's failure was ``sad,'' but not
surprising.
	   ``I'm sure they'll be tired, and a bit stressed,'' he said.
``It's been an amazing journey. Let's hope it all ends happily and
safely.''
	   ``I wouldn't be human if I didn't say that we would rather that
they had a happy landing short of their goal,'' he added.
	   The voyage of the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot-air and
helium balloon began in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18., aiming to
land in Western Europe.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   But last Friday, Libya withdrew permission to fly over its
territory and only reversed the decision after a personal plea from
Branson to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Then, in conditions marred by thunderstorms, the crew had to
maneuver the craft through narrow gaps between no-fly territories,
including Iraq.
	   And negotiations took place over several days earlier this week
with the Chinese authorities after the balloon drifted into
unauthorized airspace.
	   The Chinese asked the balloonists to land at an airfield, but
the balloon overshot the site and could not come down anywhere
else. With the help of British diplomats, the balloonists won
Chinese permission to continue.

Russia's ``shuttle trade'' down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The small army of Russia's ``shuttle traders'' has
seen its business drop considerably since the start of the economic
crisis and the drop of the ruble in August, officials said Friday.
	   Soaring unemployment and wages that go unpaid for months have
prompted millions of Russians to turn to ``shuttle trade'' _
traveling abroad to buy goods and selling them after returning to
Russia.
	   Between 10 million and 15 million people _ one-tenth of Russia's
150-million population and a major share of the country's work
force _ have been engaged in shuttle trade, according to estimates
carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   But the fall of the ruble has made the shuttle trade
unprofitable.
	   In the first 10 months of this year, the volume of shuttle trade
fell 14.4 percent to dlrs 15 billion, ITAR-Tass reported, citing
the Russian Trade Ministry.
	   The report didn't give a breakdown for how much of that drop
came after the August crisis, but the share appeared to be large.

	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. head of international
monitors in Kosovo ventured to the center of a dangerous new
outbreak of fighting Friday, appealing to both rebel and Serb
forces in a desperate attempt to avert a return to full-scale war.
	   William Walker met with a rebel commander in a Kosovo Liberation
Army stronghold during a lull in a second day of fighting in
northern Kosovo, while Yugoslav army tanks pointed their turrets at
the rebel-held village from a nearby hill.
	   He said he hoped to talk to Serb commanders later as part of his
bid to end the Serb offensive that killed a reported nine or more
ethnic Albanians and prompted a fierce response from the Albanians'
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``This is the tensest period since the agreement was signed in
October,'' said Walker, head of the team of unarmed peace verifiers
still being assembled by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   But he dispelled any notion of a withdrawal of the monitoring
force _ now 600-strong and being increased to 2,000 in the coming
weeks _ in face of increased danger.
	   ``More verifiers are the answer to violence,'' the American told
reporters.
	   A day after the Serbs launched their crackdown just west of the
northern town of Podujevo, near the main road between Belgrade and
Kosovo's capital Pristina, machine-gun and small-arms fire rattled
the area.
	   OSCE spokesman Jorgen Grunnet reported there was ``a lot less
activity'' than Thursday, when Serb forces backed by artillery and
dozens of tanks swept into the area in what they said was a
response to the killing of a policeman earlier in the week.
	   But the fighting still poses the gravest threat yet to the Oct.
12 agreement that brought a tenuous halt to months of combat
between the Serbs and the guerrillas trying to break the
predominantly Albanian-populated province away from Serbian rule.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of Pristina sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills.
	   Two columns of Yugoslav military vehicles, each consisting of
several tanks and armored personnel carriers, returned to their
base from the fighting area late Friday, Grunnet said, although it
wasn't clear if the clashes were over.
	   In the wake of the Serbs' Christmas Eve offensive, the KLA
stopped short of saying it would no longer abide by an informal
cease-fire, but said late Thursday it would ``not sit idly by'' and
would ``attack with all means available.''
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center put Thursday's
death toll at at least nine, including a woman and a 6-year-old
girl, and said a large number were wounded.
	   Serb authorities blamed the rebels for the latest shooting in
the Podujevo area, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina. The
state Tanjug news agency said a team of Serbian officials
investigating Thursday's fighting was fired at Friday by ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Army tanks could be seen filling in trenches dug by the KLA
around Lapastica, the village which houses the rebels' regional
command post and which was left largely intact despite the clash.
Several burned-out cars, their windows shot out, were visible along
the road from Podujevo to Lapastica.
	   Bozidar Filic, the spokesman for Serb police in Kosovo, said the
action Friday was against rebels in the Lapastica region ``who have
built up a whole system of fortifications, used for their attacks
against police and the civilians.''
	   Walker held talks with the KLA regional commander, known simply
as Remi, who insisted to the diplomat that his forces were not
firing unless fired upon and demanded that the Serbs withdraw.
	   ``I'm here to convince both sides that this isn't the way to
settle differences,'' Walker said after emerging from the two-story
building in a walled compound. But, he acknowledged, ``It's a tough
situation.''
	   The United States, France and the European Union have warned
both sides against further violence. In an interview with the
Serbian independent newspaper Danas, the EU envoy for Kosovo,
Wolfgang Petritsch, said the international community ``will not
tolerate an excessive use of force by the Yugoslav army'' in the
province.
	   The OSCE sent a ``very strong protest'' to Yugoslav authorities,
Grunnet said, after an incident Thursday in which a Serb policeman
warned a team of verifiers he would shoot if they didn't leave
immediately from outside the military barracks in Podujevo they
were watching.
	   The Yugoslav government has pledged to ensure the protection of
the verifiers force. A NATO force of 1,800 soldiers is stationed in
neighboring Macedonia to rescue them if needed.

	   WAGENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A man stabbed to death his wife
and three young children Christmas morning, then set fire to their
home and fled, police said. Within hours, the man was killed in a
head-on car crash.
	   Dutch television quoted neighbors as saying the couple had a
terrible fight before flames burst from the house in this
university town in the central Netherlands, about 80 kilometers (50
miles) southeast of Amsterdam.
	   Firefighters responding to the blaze made the grisly discovery
of the charred bodies of the children, ages 3, 7 and 11, and their
mother, 34. Their names were not released in line with Dutch
privacy laws.
	   TV reports said the woman's husband, 37, was killed in a morning
crash on a nearby highway not long after firefighters were called
to the home. The other driver involved in the accident, 33, was
seriously injured.
	   Authorities said the killer, who used a kitchen knife in the
slayings, apparently set fire to the house to cover his tracks.
They would not say whether his death was a suicide.
	   It was the second holiday tragedy to strike Wageningen in less
than a year. Last New Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a
party in a fight among guests.

Yassin, at Hamas rally, denounces Clinton visit

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual
leader of the militant Hamas group, on Friday denounced the visit
earlier this month of U.S. President Bill Clinton as an attempt to
destroy Palestinian unity.
	   Yassin's appearance at a rally to mark the 11th anniversary of
Hamas' founding was his first major appearance since being released
Wednesday from two months of house arrest.
	   Yasser Arafat's government put the charismatic sheik under house
arrest in October, after Hamas tried to blow up a school bus full
of Jewish children in the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat's dealings with Hamas have been difficult: Israel demands
that he act strongly contain Islamic militants who stage attacks
against Israel, but the Palestinian leader is reluctant to alienate
Yassin's following.
	   At the Gaza City refugee camp where the rally was held, a crowd
of at least 10,000 people turned out, chanting ``Yassin! Yassin!''
and struggled to touch the jeep in which he was driven through the
crowd. When the jeep stopped, followers lifted the ailing cleric's
wheelchair and carried him to the stage.
	   Representatives of Arafat's more moderate leadership
participated in the rally, perhaps to try to balance out to the
more militant message of Hamas, which opposes any peace with
Israel.
	   Hani Hassan, of Arafat's Fatah faction, praised Clinton's visit
to the Palestinian lands as a show of support for Palestinian
statehood.
	   But Yassin called Clinton an enemy.
	   ``I want to ask, what did Clinton do for us during his visit?
The purpose of his visit to the region was ... to destroy
Palestinian unity and the Palestinian dream,'' he told the
screaming crowd.
	   Touching on another sore point, Yassin called on the Palestinian
Authority to release Hamas activists from its jails and to root out
corruption within its ranks. The sheik also criticized the
Palestinian Authority for arresting Palestinian journalists last
week to try to prevent them from covering pro-Iraq rallies.
	   Despite the size of the rally and the stridency of the speeches,
Hamas was treading carefully. A Palestinian police official said
the radical group was told not to burn American flags or let masked
demonstrators appear at the rally.
	   More moderate demonstrations also took place Friday in the West
Bank town of Beit Sahur, where 2,000 Palestinians marched with 150
Israeli peace activists demanding peace and the creation of a
Palestinian state. Marchers released white pigeons as a symbol of
peace.

Rebels vow to storm Sierra Leone's capital as foreigners evacuated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Amid a growing British-led
evacuation effort in Sierra Leone, the West African country's
feared rebel alliance on Friday boasted key battlefield gains and
threatened to storm the capital on New Year's Day.
	   Sam Bockarie, a rebel general known as ``Maskita (Mosquito)'' by
his Revolutionary United Front, said the renegades had captured the
provincial town of Makeni, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northwest of Freetown and were battling for Kenema, a
diamond-mining town about 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the
southwest.
	   Rebels also captured a barracks used by the Nigerian-led West
African ECOMOG intervention force defending Sierra Leone's
government about five miles (eight kilometers) outside Freetown,
Bockarie told The Associated Press in a satellite telephone
interview from an undisclosed location.
	   His claims could not be immediately confirmed and neither
government or ECOMOG spokesmen were available for immediate
comment.
	   ``We are going to march into Freetown on New Year's Day unless
the government agrees to our terms,'' Bockarie said. ``We have the
will and the way.''
	   He added that the rebels had captured an undisclosed number of
Nigerian soldiers as well as large quantities of light and heavy
weaponry from ECOMOG.
	   The rebel threat followed the evacuation of 81 British and
European citizens, including nine Italian priests in two British
air force transport planes from Lungi Airport outside of Freetown
on Thursday.
	   Another 150 British nationals were also preparing to airlift
out, although it was unclear when that would happen, a British High
Commission spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He did not
give details.
	   In a state radio broadcast, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
government condemned the airlift, saying it played into the hands
of the rebels who he said wanted to spread panic.
	   The rebels, an alliance of ousted junta gunmen and renegade
fighters, have since their ouster from power in March launched
lightning raids from remote jungle bases with little official
contact with the outside world.
	   Bockarie was contacted on the rebels' portable satellite
telephone through an intermediary in Burkina Faso who requested
anonymity.
	   Bockarie said the rebels demand direct talks with the government
and the immediate release of Foday Sankoh, the inspirational rebel
leader who is imprisoned awaiting appeal on a death sentence handed
down in October in connection with a bloody 1997 coup.
	   Kabbah has refused to negotiate with the rebels, who are widely
blamed of killing, maiming and raping thousands of unarmed
civilians. The government also refuses to free Sankoh, who was
imprisoned earlier this year after being extradited from Nigeria,
although other rebels have been offered amnesty in return for
laying down their arms.
	   Bockarie, who said rebel troops were advancing on Freetown's
outskirts through the jungle, denied the government's repeated
accusation that the rebels were being backed by neighboring
Liberia.
	   ``We are doing this alone. We have 40,000 men and we are
capturing weapons every day. That is all we need,'' he said.
	   Refugees have poured into Sierra Leone's capital this week after
fighting intensified between rebel forces and Nigerian-led West
African intervention troops based in nearby towns.
	   Thousands of villagers have lost limbs and others have been
killed and raped in attacks apparently carried out by the rebel
troops, seeking revenge for their ouster from Freetown by the West
African force known as ECOMOG in February.
	   That allowed elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to return from
months in exile after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma took power in a
bloody May 1997 coup.
	   ECOMOG, which together with the civilian Kamajor militia has
been given defense duties by the government, has reportedly sent
reinforcements to Sierra Leone from Nigeria, and claims the
security situation is under control.
	   ECOMOG officers has threatened jail terms to journalists for
unauthorized press dispatches and has blamed the media for
spreading panic among civilians.

Economy minister: Arms exports to grow 20 percent in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's arms exports in 1999 will be 20 percent
higher than this year, the minister of economy said Friday,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said the government would
provide guarantees to ``reliable and solvent'' arms-export
companies, and that negotiations had already been conducted with
India, China and other countries.
	   Although well down from Soviet levels, Russia is one of the
world's top four arms exporters, supplying relatively inexpensive
weapons with a reputation for reliability.
	   With the Russian economy in crisis, arms exports are among the
country's few steady sources of hard currency and one of the few
sectors where Russian industry continues to operate efficiently.
	   An official from Rosvooruzheniye, the state arms exporter, said
in August that Russia hoped to export about dlrs 3.5 billion of
weapons this year and hoped to increase that figure to dlrs 8
billion by 2005.

Cruzeiro and Palmeiras to meet in second game for Mercosur Cup
</HEADLINE>
final &QL; 
 &UR; BY JACK EPSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Cruzeiro has a third and final
chance to capture an elusive championship title this year if they
beat Palmeiras on Saturday in the second leg of the Mercosur Cup
final.
	   Last week Cruzeiro lost the Brazilian Championship to the
Corinthians in a hard fought three game series. Earlier this year,
Cruzeiro lost the Brasil Cup to archrival Palmeiras, a team laden
with current and former members of the Brazilian national team and
coached by Luiz Felipe Scolari.
	   Those losses left Cruzeiro out of the continent-wide Liberators
of America Cup next year.
	   ``Head coach Levir Culp knows that he has his work cut out for
him to lift the morale of his players,'' the Rio daily Jornal do
Brasil said Friday.
	   But Cruzeiro, based in Belo Horizonte, now has the upper hand
after beating Palmeiras 2-1 in the first leg of the Mercosur Cup
finals Dec. 16. Cruzeiro needs only a tie to capture the title,
while Palmeiras needs to win by at least two goals at their
Antartica Park stadium in Sao Paulo. If Palmeiras wins by less than
two goals, a third and final game will be played Dec. 29.
	   Cruzeiro has two other advantages. Palmeiras all-star players
Junior Bahiano (defender) and Oseas (striker) are doubtful for
Saturday's game due to injuries. And Cruzeiro management has
promised to pay its players a million dollars if they win the
Mercosur Cup.
	   Probable Line-ups:
	   Cruzeiro: Dida, Gustavo, Marcelo Djian, Wilson Gottardo,
Gilberto, Marcos Paulo, Ricardinho, Valdo (Djair), Marcelo Ramos
(Fabio Junior), Caio (Alex Alves) and Muller.
	   Palmeiras: Velloso, Almir (Arce), Junior Baiano (Agnaldo),
Cleber, Junior, Roque Junior, Rogerio, Alex, Zinho, Paulo Nunes and
Oseas.

	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. head of international
monitors in Kosovo ventured to the center of a dangerous new
outbreak of fighting Friday, appealing to both rebel and Serb
forces in a desperate attempt to avert a return to full-scale war.
	   William Walker met with a rebel commander in a Kosovo Liberation
Army stronghold during a lull in a second day of fighting in
northern Kosovo, while Yugoslav army tanks pointed their turrets at
the rebel-held village from a nearby hill.
	   He said he hoped to talk to Serb commanders later as part of his
bid to end the Serb offensive that killed a reported nine or more
ethnic Albanians and prompted a fierce response from the Albanians'
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``This is the tensest period since the agreement was signed in
October,'' said Walker, head of the team of unarmed peace verifiers
still being assembled by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   But he dispelled any notion of a withdrawal of the monitoring
force _ now 600-strong and being increased to 2,000 in the coming
weeks _ in face of increased danger.
	   ``More verifiers are the answer to violence,'' the American told
reporters.
	   A day after the Serbs launched their crackdown just west of the
northern town of Podujevo, near the main road between Belgrade and
Kosovo's capital Pristina, machine-gun and small-arms fire rattled
the area.
	   OSCE spokesman Jorgen Grunnet reported there was ``a lot less
activity'' than Thursday, when Serb forces backed by artillery and
dozens of tanks swept into the area in what they said was a
response to the killing of a policeman earlier in the week.
	   But the fighting still poses the gravest threat yet to the Oct.
12 agreement that brought a tenuous halt to months of combat
between the Serbs and the guerrillas trying to break the
predominantly Albanian-populated province away from Serbian rule.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of Pristina sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills.
	   Two columns of Yugoslav military vehicles, each consisting of
several tanks and armored personnel carriers, returned to their
base from the fighting area late Friday, Grunnet said, although it
wasn't clear if the clashes were over.
	   In the wake of the Serbs' Christmas Eve offensive, the KLA
stopped short of saying it would no longer abide by an informal
cease-fire, but said late Thursday it would ``not sit idly by'' and
would ``attack with all means available.''
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center put Thursday's
death toll at at least nine, including a woman and a 6-year-old
girl, and said a large number were wounded.
	   Serb authorities blamed the rebels for the latest shooting in
the Podujevo area, 32 kilometers (20 miles) nigating Thursday's
fighting was fired at Friday by ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Army tanks could be seen filling in trenches dug by the KLA
around Lapastica, the village which houses the rebels' regional
command post and which was left largeleveral burned-out cars, their
windows shot out, were visible along the road from Podujevo to
Lapastica.
	   Bozidar Filic, the spokesman for Serb police in Kosovo, said the
action Friday was against rebels in the Lapastica region ``who have
built upsed for their attacks against police and the civilians.''
	   Filic said the only reason for the Serb attack was that they
were looking for the killer of a Serb policeman earlier this week
in the area. ``The terrorists attacked us, and we responded in an
adequate manner, liquidating a number of them,'' he said.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Amid a growing British-led
evacuation effort in Sierra Leone, the West African country's
feared rebel alliance on Friday boasted key battlefield gains and
threatened to storm the capital on New Year's Day.
	   Sam Bockarie, a rebel general known as ``Maskita (Mosquito)'' by
his Revolutionary United Front, said the renegades had captured the
provincial town of Makeni, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northwest of Freetown and were battling for Kenema, a
diamond-mining town about 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the
southwest.
	   Rebels also captured a barracks used by the Nigerian-led West
African ECOMOG intervention force defending Sierra Leone's
government about five miles (eight kilometers) outside Freetown,
Bockarie told The Associated Press in a satellite telephone
interview from an undisclosed location.
	   His claims could not be immediately confirmed and neither
government or ECOMOG spokesmen were available for immediate
comment.
	   ``We are going to march into Freetown on New Year's Day unless
the government agrees to our terms,'' Bockarie said. ``We have the
will and the way.''
	   He added that the rebels had captured an undisclosed number of
Nigerian soldiers as well as large quantities of light and heavy
weaponry from ECOMOG.
	   The rebel threat followed the evacuation of 81 British and
European citizens, including nine Italian priests in two British
air force transport planes from Lungi Airport outside of Freetown
on Thursday. Another 150 Britons were expected to be airlifted out,
said a British High Commission official in Freetown on Friday on
condition of anonymity. Essential British embassy staff remained in
Sierra Leone, officials said.
	   About 50 people mostly British, were expected to arrive in
London in the second wave of the airlift on a British plane later
Friday the night, the Press Association of Britain meanwhile
reported.
	   ``We are doing all we can to protect the interests of British
people in Sierra Leone,'' British Foreign Office Minister Tony
Lloyd said in London.
	   In a state radio broadcast, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
government condemned the airlift, saying it played into the hands
of the rebels who he said wanted to spread panic.
	   But Lloyd said the evacuation did not affect British support for
Sierra Leone's government. Britain is Sierra Leone's former
colonial ruler and remains the largest diplomatic presence in the
country.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Carbon monoxide fumes from a faulty
heating system sickened more than 200 people attending Christmas
Mass in a village church, sending about 50 of them to the hospital.
	   Worshippers and the priest suffered headaches, nausea and
vomiting as the Thursday evening service ended in Saverdun, a
village in the southwestern Ariege region.
	   Recognizing the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, a doctor
called for help, and a crisis center was set up in a village hall,
where through the night 217 worshippers were treated with oxygen.
	   Some 50 people, including young children and two pregnant women,
had to be hospitalized in nearby Toulouse or other towns.
	   But no lives were in danger, said regional prefect Philippe
Zeller.
	   He added the church will stay closed until officials determine
it is safe. A police investigation confirmed that a faulty heater
was at fault, he said.
	   The church building had not been inspected in the last few
years, but Zeller said such inspections are not mandatory at
churches. Therefore, a judicial investigation will not be launched.

Russia continues to oppose use of force against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Foreign Ministry calling for maximum restraint. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday
warned the West against using force to halt the latest violence in
Kosovo, and the Foreign Ministry called on both sides in the
conflict to exercise ``maximum restraint.''
	   U.S. and NATO officials warned both sides in Kosovo not to
resort to violence after a Serb offensive against an ethnic
Albanian rebel stronghold. The U.S. State Department also condemned
all breaches of an October cease-fire, including attacks by the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which seeks to secede from Yugoslavia.
	   Last October, NATO prepared airstrikes against the Serbs as
punishment for their crackdown on Kosovo's Albanians, but the
attacks were put on hold after the cease fire was reached and
Belgrade pulled out some of its forces.
	   Russia has steadfastly opposed attacks against the Serbs, its
longtime allies.
	   Ivanov said that if the West attacks Serbian forces, such
``strikes would play into the hands of extremists in the region.''
He blamed the KLA for the recent violence, and said that Moscow
would do all it could to avert any NATO strikes.
	   In an official statement Friday evening, the Foreign Ministry
said it considered the KLA's announcement that it would stop
observing a cease-fire ``a dangerous signal.'' The KLA had said
late Thursday it would ``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with
all means available.''
	   ``The continuation of provocations and hostile actions carries a
threat to the already fragile balance in the region,'' the ministry
statement said.
	   The ministry also said it was alarmed by violations of
Yugoslavia's borders, and pointed in particular to Albania, ``from
whose territory fighters and weapons continue to be sent,
especially into those areas from which (Serb) army and police have
already been relocated.''
	   The ministry called again for a political settlement to the
conflict.
	   ``The attempts to shift the accent from promoting a political
settlement to the use of force ... are unacceptable,'' the
statement said.

on Thursday. Another 150 Britons were expected to be airlifted out,
said a British High Commission official in Freetown on Friday on

Sierra Leone, officials said.
	   About 50 people mostly British, were expected to arrive in
London in the second wave of the airlift on a British plane later

	   ``We are doing all we can to protect the interests of British

Lloyd said in London.
	   In a state radio broadcast, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
government condemned the airlift, saying it played into the hands
of the rebels who he said wanted to spread panic.
	   But Lloyd said the evacuation did not affect British support for
Sierra Leone's government, adding that Britain would lobby for
support on Kabbah's behalf in the U.N. Security Council. Britain is
Sierra Leone's former colonial ruler and remains the largest
diplomatic presence in the country.
	   The rebels, an alliance of ousted junta gunmen and renegade
fighters, have since their ouster from power in March launched
lightning raids from remote jungle bases, while making little
official contact with the outside world.
	   Bockarie was contacted on the rebels' portable satellite
telephone through an intermediary in Burkina Faso who requested
anonymity.
	   Bockarie said the rebels demand direct talks with the government
and the immediate release of Foday Sankoh, the inspirational rebel
leader who is imprisoned awaiting appeal on a death sentence handed
down in October in connection with a bloody 1997 coup.
	   Kabbah has refused to negotiate with the rebels, who are widely
blamed of killing, maiming and raping thousands of unarmed
civilians. The government also refuses to free Sankoh, who was
imprisoned earlier this year after being extradited from Nigeria,
although other rebels have been offered amnesty in return for
laying down their arms.
	   Bockarie, who said rebel troops were advancing on Freetown's
outskirts through the jungle, denied the government's repeated
accusation that the rebels were being backed by neighboring
Liberia.
	   ``We are doing this alone. We have 40,000 men and we are
capturing weapons every day. That is all we need,'' he said.
	   Refugees have poured into Sierra Leone's capital this week after
fighting intensified between rebel forces and Nigerian-led West
African intervention troops based in nearby towns.
	   Thousands of villagers have lost limbs and others have been
killed and raped in attacks apparently carried out by the rebel
troops, seeking revenge for their ouster from Freetown by the West
African force known as ECOMOG in February.
	   That allowed elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to return from
months in exile after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma took power in a
bloody May 1997 coup.
	   ECOMOG, which together with the civilian Kamajor militia has
been given defense duties by the government, has reportedly sent
reinforcements to Sierra Leone from Nigeria, and claims the
security situation is under control.
	   ECOMOG officers has threatened jail terms to journalists for
unauthorized press dispatches and has blamed the media for
spreading panic among civilians.

Report: Radioactive, chemical weapons contaminate Arctic, Baltic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Radioactive waste that the Soviet Union dumped in
Arctic seas is leaking through its containers, causing radiation
levels in nearby areas to reach up to 100 times the norm, officials
said Friday.
	   Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry said that radiation
levels in waters off the Novaya Zemlya archipelago exceed the norm
dozens of times, and in the nearby Stepovoi Gulf by 100 times, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Radiation levels in the Barents Sea are also above normal, the
ministry said.
	   Several containers that the Soviet Union used for Arctic
radioactive dumps in the 1960s have become depressurized, and toxic
waste is leaking out, the ministry said.
	   Chemical weapons dumps in the Baltic Sea are also causing
contamination with heavy metals and arsenic, the ministry said,
citing a study it conducted over the past three years.
	   Sedimental concentrations of heavy metals in several areas of
the Baltic Sea are 10 to 100 times above normal levels, and arsenic
levels are also high, the ministry said, according to ITAR-Tass.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Members of the Cabinet and parliament convened
Friday to discuss possible amendments to the draft 1999 budget
before the document goes up for a second vote in the legislature.
	   The lower house of parliament, or the State Duma, gave quick
initial approval to the draft budget Thursday in a sign of
political support for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government.
Yet the draft still must go through several rounds of voting in the
legislature, and lawmakers are expected to propose amendments
during each stage.
	   President Boris Yeltsin praised the quick passage of the draft
during a telephone conversation Friday with Duma speaker Gennady
Seleznyov, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   ``The president expressed hope that if this kind of cooperation
between the executive power and the Duma continues, then major
success will await us in 1999,'' Yakushkin told reporters.
	   A lean budget is essential for resolving the economic crisis. It
is also a key condition for getting new foreign loans, which Russia
desperately needs to help pay off its huge debts.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Friday that
Russia's foreign debt would grow to dlrs 145 billion by Jan. 1, the
Interfax news agency reported. He said that dlrs 103 billion of
that debt dated back to the Soviet Union and that Russia's
post-Soviet debt amounted to dlrs 42 billion.
	   Russia cannot repay more than dlrs 9.5 billion of its debt next
year, Kasyanov told the Ekho Moskvy radio station, according to
Interfax. Russia is trying to reschedule payment of the remaining
dlrs 8 billion it is supposed to repay next year.
	   A task-force made up of representatives of the two chambers of
parliament and the Cabinet met Friday to discuss differences over
the draft budget.

Four Russian denominations form joint council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Religious leaders of Russia's Orthodox Christian,
Islamic, Jewish and Buddhist confessions have formed an ecumenical
council to coordinate positions on Russia's problems, the Orthodox
Church announced Friday.
	   ``Representatives of the four traditional religions ... will be
able to discuss together the problems that are facing modern
Russian society, in order to work out a joint position on them to
present to the authorities and the people,'' the Russian Orthodox
Church said in a statement released Friday.
	   The council will be open to other ``traditional'' religions in
Russia, the group decided during a meeting Wednesday.
	   Rights of religions that are not judged ``traditional'' in
Russia have been sharply curtailed under a controversial religion
law adopted last year.
	   The law enshrines the Russian Orthodox Church as the country's
preeminent religion, and also pledges to respect Islam, Judaism and
Buddhism.
	   But other religious groups are subjected to arduous registration
requirements and their public activities are sharply restricted
until they can prove that they have been in Russia for 15 years.
	   The restrictions apply to many Protestant and Catholic groups
that have become active in Russia only since the 1991 Soviet
collapse.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had tried to block passage of the law,
which has provoked many protests by religious and human rights
organizations. But he eventually signed the bill, apparently
unwilling to risk a rift with the influential Orthodox Church or
the appearance of caving in to pressure from the West.

 &UR; U.S. diplomat ventures into Kosovo fighting area, urges restraint &QL;

stronghold, sporadic shooting, quotes; trims, changes dateline. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. head of international
monitors in Kosovo ventured to the center of a new fighting Friday,
appealing to both rebel and Serb forces to avert a return to
full-scale war.
	   William Walker met with a rebel commander in a Kosovo Liberation
Army stronghold during a lull in a second day of fighting in
northern Kosovo, while Yugoslav army tanks pointed their turrets at
the rebel-held village from a nearby hill.
	   He said he hoped to talk to Serb commanders later as part of his
bid to end the Serb offensive that reportedly killed at least nine
ethnic Albanians and prompted a fierce response from the Albanians'
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``This is the tensest period since the agreement was signed in
October,'' said Walker, head of the international team of unarmed
peace monitors of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   But he rejected withdrawing the monitoring force _ now
600-strong and being increased to 2,000 in the coming weeks _ in
the face of increased danger.
	   ``More verifiers are the answer to violence,'' Walker said.
	   A day after the Serbs launched their crackdown just west of the
northern town of Podujevo, near the main road between Belgrade and
Kosovo's capital Pristina, machine-gun and small-arms fire rattled
the area.
	   OSCE spokesman Jorgen Grunnet reported there was ``a lot less
activity'' than Thursday, when Serb forces backed by artillery and
dozens of tanks swept into the area after this week's killing of a
policeman.
	   The fighting poses the gravest threat yet to the Oct. 12
agreement that brought a tenuous halt to months of combat between
ruling Serbs and separatist guerrillas in the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six northern
villages sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills.
	   Two columns of Yugoslav military vehicles, each consisting of
several tanks and armored personnel carriers, returned to their
base from the fighting area late Friday, Grunnet said, although it
wasn't clear if the clashes were over.
	   After the Serbs' Christmas Eve offensive, the KLA said it would
``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means available'' _
but stopped short of saying it would no longer abide by the
cease-fire.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center put Thursday's
death toll at nine, including a woman and a 6-year-old girl, and
said a large number were wounded.
	   Serb authorities blamed the rebels for the latest shooting in
the Podujevo area, 30 kilometers (20 miles) by ethnic Albanian
``terrorists.''
	   On Friday, army tanks could be seen filling in trenches dug by
the KLA around Lapastica, the village that houses the rebels'
regional command post. Several burned-out cars, their windows shot
out, were visible along the road from Podujevo.
	   Bozidar Filic, the spokesman for Serb police in Kosovo, said the
action Friday was against rebels in the region attacking police and
civilians.
	   Filic said the only reason for the Serb attack was that they
were looking for the killer of a Serb policeman earlier this week.
``The terrorists attacked us, and we responded in an adequate
manner, liquidating a number of them,'' he said.
	   Walker held talks with the KLA regional commander, known simply
as Remi, who insisted to the diplomat that his forces were not
firing unless fired upon and demanded that the Serbs withdraw.
	   ``I'm here to convince both sides that this isn't the way to
settle differences,'' Walker said after emerging from the building
in a walled compound.
	   The United States, France and the European Union have warned
both sides against further violence.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In his Christmas message to the world, a
weary-looking Pope John Paul II warned Friday against indifference
toward hate and violence and issued an urgent call to end the death
penalty.
	   As church bells echoed around the world, the 78-year-old pontiff
_ hunched over and slowed by age and illness _ gingerly stepped out
onto the main balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to deliver the
traditional ``Urbi et Orbi'' message.
	   Before a crowd of 40,000 who stood in the chilly, winter
sunshine to listen and millions who watched on TV in dozens of
countries, the pope pleaded for an end to war, genocide, the death
penalty, the exploitation of children and the proliferation of
weapons.
	   ``How can we fail to notice the strident contrast between the
serenity of the Christmas carols and the many problems of the
present hour?'' the pope said.
	   The pontiff noted that much of the world is steeped in ``tragic
situations, which often involve human guilt and even malice, soaked
in fratricidal hate and senseless violence.''
	   ``May the light coming from Bethlehem save us from the danger of
becoming resigned to so tormented and distressing a scenario,'' the
pope said.
	   And he prayed for the world to ``defend human life'' _ a phrase
the Vatican uses to mean its opposition to abortion and euthanasia
_ and to ``restrain the bloodied hand of those responsible for
genocide and crimes of war.''
	   After reading his message, he made an unscripted call to abolish
the death penalty.
	   The stooped figure of John Paul _ who contracted the flu and a
fever last week _ seemed almost lost on the balcony. He read out
holiday greetings in 58 languages, gliding over the musical tones
of Maori and offering the longer versions in Italian and in his
native Polish.
	   During midnight Mass, John Paul mentioned the approaching
Jubilee year in 2000. In his prepared text, the pope said he
himself would inaugurate the Holy Year. But in his speech, the pope
said the Roman Catholic Church would do so.
	   John Paul prayed for encouragement for those trying to help
``the tormented situation in the Middle East by respecting
international commitments.''
	   The region has become increasingly chaotic with U.S. and British
forces bombing Iraq last week for failing to comply with U.N.
weapons inspections and the Israel-Palestinian peace process
becoming increasingly tenuous.
	   In dozens of Christian churches scattered throughout Jerusalem,
the day began with joyful Christmas services. The pealing of church
bells and the ethereal sound of chants and carols echoed through
the Old City's stone streets.
	   ``It's so special to be here at this time of year _ to see this
place now, on Christmas Day,'' said Ronald Genasci, 62, who had
come from Arlington, Texas, to visit Israel.
	   The USS Carl Vinson dropped its anchor in the Gulf on Thursday
as hundreds of homesick sailors readied for holiday celebrations.
	   The huge aircraft carrier, leading an eight-ship battle group in
the Gulf, on Wednesday took over from the USS Enterprise, the
carrier from which several warplanes took off in last week's
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Most of the 5,000 crew members worked their normal 12-hour
shifts aboard the 97,000-ton carrier. Entertainment on the carrier
included the appearance of Santa Claus, songs, a Christmas dinner
and movies such as the 1946 classic ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
	   Christmas was bleaker in other parts of the world.
	   Rosario Ramos, living in cramped, government housing with 1,600
other families in the Dominican Republic after Hurricane Georges
destroyed her home, decided to put up a Christmas tree.
	   But its sparkling lights did little to lift her spirits.
	   ``I can't go on like this,'' she said.
	   In Jakarta, Indonesia, hundreds of Protestant worshippers prayed
and sang hymns within the blackened walls of a church gutted by
fire in a riot,
	   The congregation stood under a new metal roof that replaced the
one that collapsed in flames last month, when a Muslim mob attacked
and ransacked the church hours after a Sunday service.
	   ``We have tried to renovate it by our own efforts,'' said Pang
Pak Im, a deacon at the Taman Sari Protestant Church.

West Indies faces decisive match against South Africa

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with changed West Indies team list in 14th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies face their decisive play
Saturday
	   in the five-match cricket Test against South Africa, whose
dominant bowling has held them to 2-0.
	   The visitors have the advantage of a pitch in Durban that has
traditionally been kind to pace bowling. South Africa lost the last
test they played there against Pakistan, when they went down in the
final innings to the leg-spinning wiles of Mushtaq Ahmed, who took
six for 78 in that innings.
	   South Africa's record test score of 622 was achieved on the
Durban ground. There have also been some recent centuries in tests
by visitors there: Azhar Mahmood and Saeed Anwar scored 132 and 118
respectively for Pakistan last March.
	   With batting application like that of Shivnarine Chanderpaul
against South Africa's A Team earlier this week, West Indies could
find suitable targets again for ageing fast-bowling warhorses
Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh.
	   But the two will need better support than they have received so
far from their understudies in speed _ Nixon McLean, Mervyn Dillon
and Franklin Rose. They will also need a good spinning performance
from Carl Hooper and leg spinner Rawl Lewis.
	   West Indies Captain Brian Lara seemed to be hitting his stride
in the final innings of the defeat at the second match in Port
Elizabeth earlier this month, when he scored freely against a South
African attack keen with the smell of victory.
	   Supporting West Indies batsmen would also benefit from imitating
Chanderpaul's style _ controlled aggression with a healthy dose of
patience.
	   South Africa has the advantage of entering the Test on a stable
foot, unlike West Indies that were fighting a pay dispute before
their delayed arrival in South Africa in November.
	   The home team has the dynamic pair of Allan Donald and Shaun
Pollock, whose opening bowling attack is among the best in the
world. They have the pace backup which the West Indies sorely lack
in Jacques Kallis and David Terbrugge.
	   Jonty Rhodes, with strong fielding, and Pat Symcox as a dynamic
off-spinner, represent the sort of all-round talent that keeps the
South Africans strong.
	   The tour was expected to have political significance in
post-apartheid South Africa, with Lara, the world's most famous
cricketer, leading a black Caribbean team in a country where
cricket is mainly a white sport.
	   The South African team has been under pressure from political
leaders to name more nonwhites to its team.
	   Teams: South Africa: Gary Kirsten, Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques
Kallis, Darryll Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes,
Shaun Pollock, Mark Boucher, Pat Symcox, Allan Donald, David
Terbrugge, Paul Adams.
	   West Indies: Philo Wallace, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper,
Brian Lara (captain), Junior Murray, Ridley Jacobs, Rawl Lewis,
Franklyn Rose, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Nixon McLean, Darren
Ganga.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In his Christmas message to the world, Pope
John Paul II on Friday worried about the danger of growing resigned
to daily reports of hate and violence and urged more efforts to ban
the death penalty and arms production.
	   Because he did not lead the faithful in the mid-morning Mass in
St. Peter's Basilica, the ailing, 78-year-old pope had a few extra
hours to rest, compared to many past years, following his
celebration into the wee hours of the public midnight Christmas Eve
Mass at the Vatican.
	   Still, John Paul, who last week had to cancel appointments
because of the flu, looked tired when he stepped out, his stooped
figure leaning heavily on his staff, at noon onto the main balcony
of the basilica facing St. Peter's Square to deliver the
traditional ``Urbi et Orbi'' message (Latin for to the city and to
the world).
	   ``How can we fail to notice the strident contrast between the
serenity of the Christmas carols and the many problems of the
present hour?'' the pope said, as nearly 40,000 pilgrims, tourists
and Romans listened in the sunny but chilly weather in the square
and millions watched on TV in dozens of countries.
	   John Paul spoke of the ``disturbing developments from the
reports coming each day from television and the newspapers,
sweeping from one hemisphere to the other of the globe, tragic
situations, which often involve human guilt and even malice, soaked
in fratricidal hate and senseless violence.''
	   ``May the light coming from Bethlehem save us from the danger of
becoming resigned to so tormented and distressing a scenario,'' the
pope continued.
	   In his message, John Paul mentioned no country by name. But he
singled out the ``tormented situation in the Middle East'' and
called for respect for ``international commitments,'' in apparent
reference to the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.
	   Last week, the pope denounced the Anglo-American airstrikes of
Iraq last week and urged Baghdad to do its part to resolve the
crisis over international arms inspections.
	   John Paul prayed that consensus be strengthened worldwide for
``urgent and adequate measures to halt the production and sale of
arms, to defend human life, to end the death penalty'' as well as
free children from exploitation and ``restrain the bloodied hand of
those responsible for genocide and crimes of war ....''
	   After reading his message, he made another, this time unscripted
call for banning the death penalty. St. Peter's Square was the
ending point of a march through Rome Friday morning by death
penalty opponents, including the city's mayor.
	   In Milan, inmates at San Vittore prison gave a petition signed
by 2,000 prisoners to visiting Milan Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini.
The petition wants the pope to ask heads of state to reduce
sentences for all prisoners worldwide to mark the new millennium.

 &UR; Yugoslav Premier: America doesn't care about Kosovo Albanians

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reflecting frequently voiced
government stands, the Yugoslav premier said Friday the United
States doesn't care about Kosovo Albanians' human rights, but cares
only about deploying NATO troops.
	   Momir Bulatovic also said that ``the process of cooperation''
with the U.S.-led peace verification mission in Kosovo ``is
conducted with a great difficulty.''
	   ``The verifiers, or at least some of them, have not arrived (in
Kosovo) to see what is happening, but what is demanded from them,''
Bulatovic said.
	   He drew a parallel with the U.N. inspection team in Iraq, whose
negative report triggered a recent Anglo-American bombardment.
	   ``America had decided to bombard Iraq, and we all know how the
(U.N) report was falsified,'' Bulatovic said.
	   He said that the United States ``doesn't care about the
interests of Albanians in Kosovo ... it cares what to do with the
NATO pact.''
	   Under a threat of NATO strikes, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic pledged in October to end his crackdown against majority
of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo who are demanding secession.
	   Under a U.S.-brokered deal, Milosevic also allowed the
deployment of some 2,000 international verifiers of his pledges in
Kosovo. Some 1,700 NATO combat troops are being deployed in
neighboring Macedonia, ready to act in case the verifiers are
endangered.
	   Milosevic's communist-nationalist government officials have
recently given a number of hostile statements against the verifiers
and the United States. And the American head of the mission,
William Walker, recently complained of bad cooperation with the
Yugoslav government.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko agreed Friday to take steps to merge the two former
Soviet republics into a single state as early as next year.
	   Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed to put the proposed merger up for
public discussion by mid-1999. Without waiting for popular
approval, they will also move early next year to introduce a single
currency and harmonize taxes, they said.
	   ``We are now calling for merging our nations in one union
state,'' Yeltsin said at a Kremlin news conference after signing
several agreements. ``We can be proud of such work.''
	   ``God help us to enter the next millennium as a single state,''
Lukashenko said.
	   Meanwhile, in the Belarusian capital Minsk, the opposition
charged that Lukashenko was pushing the merger in order to be able
to run for Russian president in 2000.
	   ``Fearing free democratic election, and in order to keep power
and have a chance to fight for leadership in Russia, Lukashenko has
chosen to eliminate Belarus' statehood,'' said a statement by the
main opposition group, the Belarusian Popular Front.
	   About 20 activists from opposition and human rights movements
tried to block a road in central Minsk to protest the merger.
Police beat protesters and detained them all, said a popular front
leader, Anatoly Krivorot.
	   An elderly man was injured in the scuffle, Krivorot said.
	   The authoritarian Lukashenko, an admirer of the Soviet Union,
has long pushed for uniting his nation of 10 million people with
Russia's 147 million people. In 1996, he and Yeltsin signed a union
agreement, boosting political, economic and military ties between
the two nations, but stopping short of creating one state.
	   The two leaders have long pledged to take further integration
steps but have in fact done little. It remains unclear whether
Friday's agreements will be implemented, as many Russian
politicians oppose a merger.
	   Russian news reports said the proposed merger would be put to a
plebiscite, but the text of the statement signed by Yeltsin and
Lukashenko called only for ``public discussion.''
	   Top Russian officials quickly said there is no immediate plan to
merge the two nation's armed forces or pool the government coffers.
	   Lukashenko wants a merger to solve Belarus' economic problems,
which have already led to food rationing in some regions. The
Belarusian economy is one of the most unreformed in the former
Soviet Union, with virtually all assets and markets under
government control.
	   In an immediate step to ease Belarusian economic woes, Yeltsin
and Lukashenko agreed to allow Russian and Belarusian companies to
import goods from each other at domestic prices. The agreement is
crucial for Belarus, which relies on Russia's energy resources and
has run up a huge debt.
	   Domestic prices for Russia's oil and natural gas are still far
below the world market price.
	   Russian liberals and the West have assailed Lukashenko for his
crackdown on the opposition and the independent media. Russian
Communists and other hardliners publicly hail the proposed merger,
but tacitly oppose it, fearing that the assertive Belarusian
president would push them to the sidelines if he joins Russia's
presidential race.
	   The Russian government, struggling with the worst economic
crisis since the Soviet collapse, has been lukewarm on the merger
with even poorer Belarus.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In his Christmas message to the world, a
weary-looking Pope John Paul II warned Friday against indifference
toward hate and violence and issued an urgent call to end the death
penalty.
	   As church bells echoed around the world, the 78-year-old pontiff
_ hunched over and slowed by age and illness _ gingerly stepped out
onto the main balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to deliver the
traditional ``Urbi et Orbi'' message.
	   Before a crowd of 40,000 who stood in the chilly, winter
sunshine to listen and millions who watched on TV in dozens of
countries, the pope pleaded for an end to war, genocide, the death
penalty, the exploitation of children and the proliferation of
weapons.
	   ``How can we fail to notice the strident contrast between the
serenity of the Christmas carols and the many problems of the
present hour?'' the pope said.
	   The pontiff noted that much of the world is steeped in ``tragic
situations, which often involve human guilt and even malice, soaked
in fratricidal hate and senseless violence.''
	   ``May the light coming from Bethlehem save us from the danger of
becoming resigned to so tormented and distressing a scenario,'' the
pope said.
	   And he prayed for the world to ``defend human life'' _ a phrase
the Vatican uses to mean its opposition to abortion and euthanasia
_ and to ``restrain the bloodied hand of those responsible for
genocide and crimes of war.''
	   After reading his message, he made an unscripted call to abolish
the death penalty.
	   The stooped figure of John Paul _ who contracted the flu and a
fever last week _ seemed almost lost on the balcony. He read out
holiday greetings in 58 languages, gliding over the musical tones
of Maori and offering the longer versions in Italian and in his
native Polish.
	   During midnight Mass, John Paul mentioned the approaching
Jubilee year in 2000. In his prepared text, the pope said he
himself would inaugurate the Holy Year. But in his speech, the pope
said the Roman Catholic Church would do so.
	   John Paul prayed for encouragement for those trying to help
``the tormented situation in the Middle East by respecting
international commitments.''
	   The region has become increasingly chaotic with U.S. and British
forces bombing Iraq last week for failing to comply with U.N.
weapons inspections and the Israel-Palestinian peace process
becoming increasingly tenuous.
	   In dozens of Christian churches scattered throughout Jerusalem,
the day began with joyful Christmas services. The pealing of church
bells and the ethereal sound of chants and carols echoed through
the Old City's stone streets.
	   ``It's so special to be here at this time of year _ to see this
place now, on Christmas Day,'' said Ronald Genasci, 62, who had
come from Arlington, Texas, to visit Israel.
	   In Cuba, the communist government on Friday allowed the Roman
Catholic church to send a national holiday greeting over
government-controlled radio. Cuba last month made Christmas an
official permanent holiday again after nearly 30 years.
	   Cardinal Jaime Ortega, Cuba's top Catholic leader, received
permission to read the message Christmas afternoon, government and
church sources said.
	   The authorization was a sign of continued warming relations
between Fidel Castro's government and the Catholic church nearly
one year after Pope John Paul II visited the island.

Netanyahu denies report of Lebanon pullout plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu denying the report, saying
Cabinet will discuss Lebanon issue
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the government under mounting pressure to
find a way to get Israeli troops out of Lebanon, a newspaper
reported Friday that the Cabinet would be presented this weekend
with a plan for a phased withdrawal. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu denied the report.
	   ``There was no decision like that at all,'' Netanyahu told
Israel TV, saying that while Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
supported unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, the Cabinet was
divided on the issue.
	   ``We have been talking about the Lebanon issue, at my
initiative, for a full year, in an effort to rescue Israel from 20
years of complications with a very difficult problem,'' Netanyahu
said. ``We want to defend the northern border and our allies, and
it's not easy.''
	   The report came two days after Lebanese guerrillas launched a
hail of rockets across Israel's northern border in retaliation for
an Israeli air strike that killed a Lebanese woman and her six
children. Israel called the civilian deaths an accident.
	   Israel and Shiite Muslim guerrillas have been engaged in a
guerrilla war in Lebanon since 1985. Guerrillas from Hezbollah,
along with the Lebanese government and Syria, demand that Israel
pull about 2,000 soldiers out of the Israeli-declared security zone
in south Lebanon.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said the prime minister would not withdraw from south
Lebanon until security guarantees are in hand.
	   The report in the daily Maariv newspaper said that Netanyahu and
Sharon were intending to bring a plan for a gradual withdrawal from
the enclave Israel occupies in south Lebanon for discussion in the
cabinet on Sunday.
	   According to the report, Israel would begin such a phased
pullout before elections are held, probably in the next four
months.
	   Opposition lawmaker Efraim Sneh called the reported plan an
election ploy for the beleaguered Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu said the Cabinet would continue to discuss the Lebanon
issue irrespective of the elections.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Shia Segal issued a flat denial of
the Maariv story and called Sneh's comments ``plain evil.'' Segal
said that Sharon had no intention of making any new Lebanon
proposal on Sunday.
	   The Cabinet has been holding ongoing discussions on Lebanon. The
daily Haaretz reported Friday that Netanyahu and opposition leader
Ehud Barak had held a round of meetings over the summer at which
they agreed to make restarting negotiations with Syria a priority.
	   Bar-Illan confirmed that discussions took place between the two,
but he denied reports that the topic of land concessions on the
Golan Heights ever arose.
	   The public pressure for a pullout from Lebanon has been mounting
along with a steady increase in the death toll among young soldiers
serving there. On Friday, 1st Sgt. Doron Benzigri, 26, a border
policeman who suffered head injuries in a clash with Hezbollah
forces more than three years ago, died without having ever regained
consciousness.

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Police arrested four more suspects
in the killing of a Brazilian congresswoman and three relatives, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Ceci Cunha, a 48-year-old congresswoman with the government's
Brazilian Social Democratic Party was killed Dec. 16 outside her
sister's house in Maceio, the capital of the northeastern state of
Alagoas, 1,000 miles (1,700 kilometers) northeast of Rio de
Janeiro.
	   Cunha, her husband, sister-in-law and her sister's mother-in-law
were gunned down by five men who burst into the home.
	   Two days later, law enforcement officers arrested a bodyguard of
Cunha's political rival, Talvane Albuquerque. He was identified
only as Jadielson.
	   Two other suspects have confessed that they were hired by
Albuquerque, the Rio daily O Globo reported Friday.
	   The newspaper also reported that state prosecutors would ask the
justice system to strip Albuquerque of his diplomatic immunity.
Albuquerque, however, denies any involvement and says he is the
victim of a ``political ambush.''
	   Politics in Alagoas, one of Brazil's poorest states, has long
been dangerous business.
	   Arnon de Mello, the father of former President Fernando Collor
de Mello and a three-time governor of Alagoas, once shot and killed
a colleague during a dispute on the state senate floor in 1963.
	   And since 1993, at least nine prominent politicians have been
murdered, including the chief of police of Maceio and the state tax
director.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Amid a British-led evacuation,
Sierra Leone's feared rebel alliance boasted key battlefield gains
Friday and threatened to storm the capital of the West African
nation on New Year's Day.
	   Sam Bockarie, a rebel general known as ``Maskita (Mosquito)'' by
his Revolutionary United Front, said the renegades had captured the
provincial town of Makeni, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northeast of the capital, Freetown. They were battling for Kenema,
a diamond-mining town about 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the
southeast, he said.
	   ``We are going to march into Freetown on New Year's Day unless
the government agrees to our terms,'' Bockarie said. ``We have the
will and the way.''
	   The rebels, an alliance of ousted junta gunmen and renegade
fighters, since losing power in February have launched lightning
raids from remote jungle bases.
	   Refugees have poured into Sierra Leone's capital this week after
fighting intensified between rebel forces and Nigerian-led West
African intervention troops based in nearby towns.
	   Thousands of villagers have lost limbs and others have been
killed and raped in attacks apparently carried out by the rebel
troops, seeking revenge for their ouster from Freetown by the
intervention force called ECOMOG.
	   That ouster allowed elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah return
from months in exile in March after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma
took power in a bloody May 1997 coup.
	   Rebels also captured barracks outside the capital used by the
Nigerian-led West African ECOMOG intervention force defending
Sierra Leone's government, Bockarie told The Associated Press in a
satellite telephone interview from an undisclosed location.
	   U.N. military observers have been withdrawn from Makeni, Kenema
and several other interior points to a base at Lungi airport
outside the capital, the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone said in a statement. Non-essential staff based in Freetown
were flown to neighboring Guinea.
	   Subhash Joshi, the U.N.'s chief military observer said the move
was temporary. ``Essential components remain in place to maintain
the mission,'' the statement said.
	   Rebels also captured barracks at Benguema, about 20 miles east
of the capital used by the Nigerian-led West African ECOMOG
intervention force defending Sierra Leone's government, Bockarie
told The Associated Press in a satellite telephone interview from
an undisclosed location.
	   He added that the rebels had captured an undisclosed number of
Nigerian soldiers as well as large quantities of light and heavy
weaponry from ECOMOG.
	   The claims could not be independently confirmed and neither
government or ECOMOG spokesmen were available for immediate
comment.
	   The rebel threat followed Thursday's evacuation of 81 British
and European citizens, including nine Italian priests in two
British air force transport planes. About 50 people, mostly
British, were expected to arrive Friday in London in the second
wave of the airlift, the Press Association of Britain reported.
	   ``We are doing all we can to protect the interests of British
people in Sierra Leone,'' British Foreign Office Minister Tony
Lloyd said in London.
	   In a state radio broadcast, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
government condemned the airlift, saying it played into rebel
designs to spread panic.
	   But Lloyd said the evacuation did not affect British support for
Sierra Leone's government, and that Britain would lobby on Kabbah's
behalf in the United Nations Security Council. Britain is Sierra
Leone's former colonial ruler and remains the largest diplomatic
presence in the country.
	   Bockarie said the rebels demand direct talks with the government
and the immediate release of Foday Sankoh, the inspirational rebel
leader who is imprisoned awaiting appeal on a death sentence handed
down in October in connection with the 1997 coup.
	   Kabbah has refused to negotiate with the rebels, widely blamed
for killing, maiming and raping thousands of unarmed civilians. The
government refuses to free Sankoh, who was imprisoned earlier this
year after extradition from Nigeria, although other rebels have
been offered amnesty in return for laying down their arms.
	   Bockarie, who said rebel troops were moving toward Freetown's
outskirts through thick jungle, denied receiving backing from
neighboring Liberia.
	   ``We are doing this alone. We have 40,000 men and we are
capturing weapons every day. That is all we need,'' he said.
	   ECOMOG has reportedly sent reinforcements to Sierra Leone from
Nigeria, and claims the security situation is under control.
	   ECOMOG officers have threatened to jail journalists for
spreading panic among civilians.

Congo accuses world community of ignoring Rwandan atrocities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo on Friday lashed out at the
international community for ignoring what it said were recent
``atrocities'' committed by Rwandan troops in rebel-held eastern
Congo.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said in a statement on state
television that the world community had ignored ``testimonies of
assassinations, rape, summary executions, massive deportations,
dismantling of infrastructure and looting of the region's wealth,''
by Rwanda's forces backing up Congolese rebels in the country's
east.
	   ``How long will the international community remain indifferent?
How far will the aggressors be allowed to go in their
abominations?'' he asked.
	   Mumengi accused U.N. and non-government aid groups in eastern
Congo of ignoring the crimes because they were committed by Rwandan
Tutsis, the main victims of the 1994 genocide in which more than
500,000 people were killed by Hutu extremists.
	   The Information Minister also named international lending
institutions of backing the ``aggressors,'' referring to Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Mumengi said Rwanda had deported a large number of suspects in
Rwanda's 1994 genocide to eastern Congo.
	   Since a coalition of Congolese Tutsis, former allies and
opponents of President Laurent Kabila launched a rebellion to oust
the government in August, the war has drawn in at least six other
countries.

	   UMTATA, South Africa (AP) _ Two boys age 15 and 20 were killed
on Friday by an army hand grenade they found, police said.
	   The grenade exploded and killed them instantly, said police
spokesman Capt. Mzukisi Fatyela.
	   A similar incident claimed the lives of two boys earlier this
year near the same town. Umtata was recently the scene of a tornado
that swept through town while President Nelson Mandela was shopping

	   The combination helium and hot air balloon hit the water about
10 miles (16 kms) north of the island of Oahu and skimmed across
the surface.
	   ``It's a very volatile situation,'' said Chris Johnson, a Coast
Guard assistant duty officer.
	   The crew _ British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire
Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ quit halfway through
the journey after they lost the high-altitude, high-speed winds
they needed to carry them across Pacific to North America.
	   They had gotten caught in a low-pressure system and feared they

	   The crew had hoped to reach North America sometime Friday,
flying over southern Canada or Washington state.

Abkhazia claims Georgians invade, Georgia denies sending troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Officials in the breakaway region of
Abkhazia said that an armed group of Georgians had landed on their
territory on Friday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Georgian officials denied the accusation.
	   The Abkhazian report that a 20-member Georgian sea-landing team
had arrived in the tense Ghali district is ``sheer lunacy,'' said
Capt. Roland Meladze, a duty officer at the Georgian Defense
Ministry in Tbilisi.
	   The Abkhazians said their jet fighters had fired warning shots
at the landing ships and forced them to leave, while ``the landing
zone is blocked and measures are being taken to liquidate the
landing team,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in the Ghali district of
Abkhazia since 1994, following a truce that ended a 1992-93 war in
which Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian government troops.
	   Several tens of thousands of ethnic Georgian refugees have
returned to the district despite Abkhazian resistance, but were
forced to flee again in May when Abkhazian forces attacked their
villages. Some came back when the fighting ended; about 10,000
Georgians are now living in the province.
	   The area has been plagued by frequent clashes. Georgian
officials have often accused the Russian peacekeepers of backing
the separatists _ a charge they deny.
	   Most recently, the Georgian government on Tuesday accused the
peacekeepers of triggering a gun battle in Abkhazia that led to the
death of a Georgian soldier. The spokesman for the peacekeepers
denied the accusation.

German captives receive Christmas gifts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four Germans captives go chocolates and
cigarettes for Christmas and are looking forward to being released
soon, Yemeni tribesmen said Friday.
	   They said the presents, that also included several bottles of
mineral water, were from the German Embassy in the Yemeni capital,
San`a. They were delivered to the hostages by the tribesmen, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Germans, three women and a man, spent ``a silent and
boring'' Christmas Eve in captivity and were not allowed to call
their families in Germany, said one of the tribesmen, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said the hostages, who were abducted Dec. 7, are ``looking
forward to the day of their release.''
	   They are only allowed to walk for 45 minutes a day accompanied
by armed men, he added.
	   The Germans were abducted by gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan tribe
and taken to Marib province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast
of San`a.
	   A Yemeni newspaper identified the hostages as Norbert Degen,
Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The names have
not been confirmed by the German Embassy.
	   The Bani Dhabyan are asking the government for more schools,
hospitals, telephone lines and roads in their poor province.
	   On Sunday, a cardiologist was dispatched to examine one of the
women who was suffering from blood pressure. Her identity was not
revealed.

	   The voyage of the 272-foot-high (83-meter) balloon began in
Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18, and, if successful, would have
ended in Western Europe.
	   The three men were feeling ``deflated _ like the balloon will be
in a couple of hours' time,'' Mike Kendrick, the team's project
director from the ground control center in England, said earlier in
the day.
	   ``I'm afraid the weather has beaten us,'' he said. ``It's a bit
of bad luck. We almost made it. I think we missed the weather by an
hour.''
	   Balloon pilots cannot steer or control their speeds with
precision, relying instead on extremely fast, high-altitude winds
to carry them around the globe. They navigate by changing the lift
of the balloon to ascend or descend into different wind systems.
	   The adventurers' balloon got sucked into a low pressure system
overnight in the Pacific. They had been moving the craft up and
down between 6,000 feet (1829 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230
meters) to find a fast enough easterly wind to carry them to the
West Coast.
	   They had picked up an easterly wind, but at 14 knots, or 16 mph
(26 kph), it was not enough. Hendrick said that there was no chance
of any stronger winds soon and that they would have been stuck in
the depression for a week.
	   ``I am sorry that it is now all over. We raced across the
Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (320 kph) but ended up hitting a
solid trough from one end to the other,'' Branson said in a
statement read by Hendrick before the balloon went down. ``All day
and all night we battled to get through it.''
	   If the balloonists had made the West Coast, they would have
broken the balloon distance record that Fossett set on an attempt
to circumnavigate the globe earlier this year. He, too, was forced
to ditch in the shark-infested waters of the Pacific.
	   During the journey, the team secured permission from 97
countries to cross their airspace. Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea refused permission, and they crew had some tense moments when
they passed over China farther north than the balloon had been
authorized to fly.

Coastguard find missing pilot in plane crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with body of man found grafs 1 to 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRADWELL-ON-SEA, England (AP) _ A coastguard official said
Friday that the body of a man found in mud flats off the coast of
southeast England was likely that of a pilot whose aircraft had
crashed in the area.
	   A Royal Air Force Sea King helicopter crew found the body near
the wrecked fuselage of a two-seater Jet Provost which crashed on
one mile (1.6 km) from the coast of Essex, east of London, on
Thursday.
	   ''We are satisfied that he was the chap who attempted to get out
of the fuselage. He was in the immediate vicinity,'' said
coastguard spokesman Mark Clark. Clark said that the helicopter
crew winched the man, whose name has not been released by police,
from the flats to a waiting ambulance.
	   A witness who raised the alarm Thursday reported a parachute
leaving the twin-seater plane as it hit the water. A police
helicopter crew later found a seat and a flying helmet floating
among debris of the wreckage of the former Royal Air Force trainer
plane, but an initial search failed to find the pilot, who was
believed to be the only occupant of the aircraft.
	   Clark said coastguard did not know when the man died.
	   The pilot, believed to be in his 30s and from outside Essex, is
thought to have been alone when he took off from the North Weald
Airfield on Thursday afternoon.
	   The body was expected to be formally identified Friday, police
said.

U.S. diplomat ventures into Kosovo fighting area

	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The American head of international
monitors in Kosovo ventured to the center of a new outbreak of
fighting Friday, appealing to rebels and Serb forces not to return
to full-scale war.
	   William Walker met with an ethnic Albanian rebel commander
during a lull in the second day of renewed fighting in northern
Kosovo, and Yugoslav army tanks on a nearby hill pointed their
turrets at the rebel-held village.
	   Walker said he also hoped to talk with Serb commanders as part
of his bid to end the latest Serb offensive, which poses the
gravest threat yet to the Oct. 12 agreement that halted months of
violence between Serbs and guerrillas trying to gain independence
for the predominantly ethnic Albanian province in Serbia.
	   ``This is the tensest period since the agreement was signed,''
said Walker, head of a team of unarmed peace verifiers organized by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Walker said the monitoring force _ now 600-strong and set to be
increased to 2,000 in the coming weeks _ would not be pulled out in
the face of increased danger.
	   ``More verifiers are the answer to violence,'' he told
reporters.
	   A day after the Serbs launched their crackdown just west of the
northern town of Podujevo, the rattle of gunfire echoed through the
area.
	   OSCE spokesman Jorgen Grunnet said there was a lot less activity
than Thursday, when Serb forces backed by artillery and dozens of
tanks swept into the area in what they said was a response to the
killing of a policeman earlier in the week.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of the province's capital, Pristina, sent hundreds fleeing into
snow-covered hills. The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information
Center said at least nine people were killed and many others
wounded Thursday.
	   Two columns of Yugoslav military vehicles, each consisting of
several tanks and armored personnel carriers, returned to their
base late Friday, Grunnet said, although it wasn't clear if the
clashes were over.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said late Thursday it would
``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means available.''
However, the KLA regional commander Walker met with insisted that
his forces were not firing unless fired on.
	   Army tanks could be seen filling in trenches dug by the KLA
around Lapastica, the village that houses the rebels' regional
command post.
	   Bozidar Filic, the spokesman for Serb police in Kosovo, said the
renewed fighting was against rebels in the Lapastica region ``who
have built up a whole system of fortifications, used for their
attacks against police and the civilians.''
	   Filic reiterated the claim that the Serb attack was launched to
hunt for the killer of a Serb policeman. ``The terrorists attacked
us, and we responded in an adequate manner, liquidating a number of
them,'' he said.
	   The United States, France and the European Union have warned
both sides not to continue the violence.
	   In an interview with the Serbian independent newspaper Danas,
the EU envoy for Kosovo, Wolfgang Petritsch, said the international
community ``will not tolerate an excessive use of force by the
Yugoslav army'' in the province.
	   In October, NATO prepared airstrikes against the Serbs as
punishment for their crackdown, but the attacks were put on hold
after the cease-fire was reached and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic pulled out some of his forces.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday warned the West
against using force to halt the latest violence in Kosovo, and the
Foreign Ministry called on both sides in the conflict to exercise
``maximum restraint.'' Russia has steadfastly opposed attacks
against the Serbs.
	   Also, the OSCE said it had sent a ``very strong protest'' to
Yugoslav authorities after a Serb policeman told a team of
verifiers Thursday he would shoot if they didn't immediately leave
the area outside a military barracks in Podujevo they were
watching.
	   The Yugoslav government has pledged to ensure the protection of
the verifiers force. A NATO force of 1,800 soldiers is stationed in
neighboring Macedonia to rescue them if needed.

Azerbaijan, Japan sign dlrs 2.3 billion oil exploration contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Azerbaijan's state oil company and a consortium of
four Japanese companies signed a contract Friday for joint
exploration and development of oil deposits in the Caspian Sea,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   Azeri President Geidar Aliev said that the deal was worth an
estimated dlrs 2.3 million. The deposits, in three areas of the
Azeri sector of the Caspian Sea, are thought to contain 100-150
million tons of oil, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Japanese companies are Japex, Inpex, Teikoku and Itochu, the
Interfax news agency reported. The contract is for 25 years.

	   The men were being brought ashore at Barbers Point, about 10
miles (16 kms) west of Honolulu, by two Coast Guard helicopters.
From there, they were to be taken by ambulance to a hospital for an
examination.
	   U.S. customs inspectors were waiting to meet them and have them
sign the customs declaration forms required of all those entering
the United States.
	   The men _ British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire
Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ quit halfway through
the journey after they lost the high-altitude, high-speed winds
they needed to carry them across Pacific to North America.
	   They had gotten caught in a low-pressure system and feared they
would be stuck there for a week.
	   The combination helium and hot air balloon hit the water about
10 miles (16 kms) north of the island of Oahu and skimmed across
the surface.
	   The voyage of the 272-foot-high (83-meter) balloon began in
Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18, and, if successful, would have
ended in Western Europe. The crew had hoped to reach North America
sometime Friday, flying over southern Canada or Washington state.
	   The three men were feeling ``deflated _ like the balloon will be
in a couple of hours' time,'' Mike Kendrick, the team's project
director from the ground control center in England, said earlier in
the day.
	   ``I'm afraid the weather has beaten us,'' he said. ``It's a bit
of bad luck. We almost made it. I think we missed the weather by an
hour.''
	   Balloon pilots cannot steer or control their speeds with
precision, relying instead on extremely fast, high-altitude winds
to carry them around the globe. They navigate by changing the lift
of the balloon to ascend or descend into different wind systems.
	   The adventurers' balloon got sucked into a low pressure system
overnight in the Pacific. They had been moving the craft up and
down between 6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230
meters) to find a fast enough easterly wind to carry them to the
West Coast.
	   They had picked up an easterly wind, but at 14 knots, or 16 mph
(25 kph), it was not enough. Hendrick said that there was no chance
of any stronger winds soon and that they would have been stuck in
the depression for a week.
	   ``I am sorry that it is now all over. We raced across the
Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (320 kph) but ended up hitting a
solid trough from one end to the other,'' Branson said in a
statement read by Hendrick before the balloon went down. ``All day
and all night we battled to get through it.''
	   If the balloonists had made the West Coast, they would have
broken the balloon distance record that Fossett set on an attempt
to circumnavigate the globe earlier this year. He, too, was forced
to ditch in the shark-infested waters of the Pacific.
	   During the journey, the team secured permission from 97
countries to cross their airspace. Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea refused permission, and they crew had some tense moments when
they passed over China farther north than the balloon had been
authorized to fly.

Netanyahu denies report of Lebanon pullout plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu denying the report, saying
Cabinet will discuss Lebanon issue
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied a
newspaper report Friday that the Cabinet this weekend would be
presented with a plan for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops
from Lebanon.
	   ``There was no decision like that at all,'' Netanyahu told
Israel TV, saying that while Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
supported unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, the Cabinet was
divided on the issue.
	   Public pressure for a pullout from Lebanon has been mounting
along with a steady increase in the death toll among young soldiers
serving there.
	   On Friday, 1st Sgt. Doron Benzigri, 26, a border policeman who
suffered head injuries in a clash with Hezbollah forces more than
three years ago, died without having ever regained consciousness.
	   ``We have been talking about the Lebanon issue, at my
initiative, for a full year, in an effort to rescue Israel from 20
years of complications with a very difficult problem,'' Netanyahu
said. ``We want to defend the northern border and our allies, and
it's not easy.''
	   The report in the daily Maariv newspaper said that Netanyahu and
Sharon were intending to bring a plan for a gradual withdrawal from
the enclave Israel occupies in south Lebanon for discussion in the
cabinet on Sunday.
	   According to the report, Israel would begin such a phased
pullout before elections are held, probably in the next four
months.
	   The report came two days after Lebanese guerrillas launched a
hail of rockets across Israel's northern border in retaliation for
an Israeli air strike that killed a Lebanese woman and her six
children. Israel called the civilian deaths an accident.
	   Israel and Shiite Muslim guerrillas have been engaged in a
guerrilla war in Lebanon since 1985. Guerrillas from Hezbollah,
along with the Lebanese government and Syria, demand that Israel
pull about 2,000 soldiers out of the Israeli-declared security zone
in south Lebanon.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said the prime minister would not withdraw from south
Lebanon until security guarantees are in hand.
	   Opposition lawmaker Efraim Sneh called the reported plan an
election ploy for the beleaguered Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu said the Cabinet would continue to discuss the Lebanon
issue irrespective of the elections.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Shia Segal issued a flat denial of
the Maariv story and called Sneh's comments ``plain evil.'' Segal
said that Sharon had no intention of making any new Lebanon
proposal on Sunday.
	   The Cabinet has been holding ongoing discussions on Lebanon. The
daily Haaretz reported Friday that Netanyahu and opposition leader
Ehud Barak had held a round of meetings over the summer at which
they agreed to make restarting negotiations with Syria a priority.
	   Bar-Illan confirmed that discussions took place between the two,
but he denied reports that the topic of land concessions on the
Golan Heights ever arose.

	   ``Everybody is very pleased. They are all fit and well and we're
all very happy. It's all a bit emotional,'' said Kendrick.
	   He said a technical problem on landing had prevented the
envelope, which was meant to detach when it hit the water, from
doing so. The crew were forced to land with the envelope fixed on,
which made it more dangerous.
	   ``We were not told for 15 minutes whether they were alive, dead
or injured,'' he said. ``I know it is a failure but it is a
glorious failure.''

	   MONTGOMERY, Alabama (AP) _ Auburn's Karsten Bailey and LSU's Joe
Wesley, two players from highly disappointing teams, scored pivotal
touchdowns Friday to lead the Blue to a 31-24 win in the Blue-Gray
All-Star Classic of U.S. college football.
	   Bailey, who ended the year as Auburn's career reception leader
in the Tigers' (3-8) worst season since 1952, caught a 65-yard
touchdown catch from Wake Forest's Brian Kuklick with 5:11 to play
to put the Blue up 31-24.
	   Wesley, a linebacker for LSU's (4-7) maligned defense, returned
an interception 82 yards to tie it 24-24 with 12:31 to play. His
interception broke the 60-year-old Blue-Gray record for longest
interception for a score, which was 62 yards set by Mississippi's
Bill Schneller.
	   Bailey was honored as the Gray team's most valuable player and
Wesley was selected as its most valuable defensive player. The game
is for top players whose teams don't advance to post-season bowl
games.
	   Stacey Mack, a running back from Temple, led the Blue team with
three touchdowns and was chosen as its most valuable offensive
player.
	   It was a bittersweet finish to a 1998 season for Bailey and
Wesley, who both expected to be elsewhere on Christmas Day. LSU was
a preseason contender for the national championship and Auburn was
the defending SEC West Division champions.
	   But Auburn struggled offensively all season and Bailey felt he
never had a chance to put up the numbers he thought he was capable
of. He broke the Tigers' career reception record in a losing effort
and said it prevented him from enjoying the feat.
	   Playing for an LSU defense that failed to produce, Wesley and
his teammates took much of the blame for the losing season.

	   HONOLULU (AP) _ Frustrated by slack winds, three adventurers
trying to make the first nonstop round-the-world flight in a
balloon abandoned their quest Friday, splashing down in the
shark-infested waters off Honolulu.
	   All three men were rescued by the Coast Guard and were reported
in good condition.
	   The men were brought ashore at Barbers Point, about 10 miles (16
kms) west of Honolulu, by two Coast Guard helicopters. After
climbing out of the choppers, they smiled and chatted with the
ground crews.
	   U.S. customs inspectors were waiting to meet them and have them
sign the customs declaration forms required of all those entering
the United States.
	   The men _ British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire
Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ quit halfway through
the journey after they lost the high-altitude, high-speed winds
they needed to carry them across Pacific to North America.
	   They had traveled 12,500 miles (20,100 kms) before getting
caught in a low-pressure system and called off the trip, fearing
they would be stuck there for a week.

Dozens killed and wounded in Angolan rebel attack on highland city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ People emerged from their shelters Friday
to attend Christmas religious services in the highland city of
Kuito during a lull in rebel shelling, Roman Catholic church
workers said.
	   Thirty people were killed and 37 were wounded Thursday in the
heaviest rebel attack on the besieged city since fighting between
UNITA rebels and the government flared anew early this month
undermining a 1994 peace accord, the private Radio Eclesia
reported.
	   ``I can't express what it was like,'' a church worker in Kuito,
who did not identify herself, said Friday, referring to the
intensity of Thursday's all-day shelling.
	   Nine of the dead were killed when mortar fire hit a Roman
Catholic church in Kuito's outskirts, the Portuguese news agency
Lusa quoted military sources as saying.
	   UNITA rebels entrenched around Kuito began shelling the city
again Friday around noon, a male church worker said.
	   Kuito's population of about 100,000 was swollen with a further
30,000 displaced in the past two weeks, as battles raged throughout
the central highlands.
	   ``A lot of people have come from other towns and villages and
they have nothing to eat,'' the female church worker said.
	   Relief agencies have stopped flying food and medicine into the
city's airport that has been targeted by the rebels to prevent the
government sending in reinforcements.
	   Kuito, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital
Luanda, has been a major focus of conflict between UNITA rebels and
the government that resumed this month, dissolving the 1994 United
Nations-brokered pact which was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war.
	   The government regained control of Kuito from the rebels during
the intensive conflict that followed UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi's
refusal to accept defeat the country's first elections in 1992,
breaking an earlier peace agreement signed the year before.
	   Angola's civil war began in 1975, following a 14-year fight for
independence from Portugal's colonial rule.
	   About half a million people were killed, and hundreds of
thousands were left maimed, homeless and exposed to disease and
hunger.

Few signs of Christmas for Mitch survivors at refugee camp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With World Christmas &QL;

<TEXT>
	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ At a refugee camp for Hurricane
Mitch survivors, Olivia Cortez carefully divided up six pounds (2.7
kilograms) of donated chicken into 96 small pieces.
	   Each one-ounce (28-gram) piece, along with a little rice and
potatoes, would be the entire Christmas dinner for most of the 74
children at the camp.
	   The 72 adults would have to settle for less.
	   ``We'll have to be content with the smell of chicken,'' said
Cortez, who lost two children and 10 other relatives Oct. 30 when
Hurricane Mitch caused a landslide on the side of the Casitas
volcano, killing 2,000 people.
	   Overall, more than 9,000 people in Central America were killed
by the storm, according to official figures
	   There were few signs of Christmas at the refugee camp in
Posoltega, one of 13 camps for victims of the landslide.
	   There was little food and not enough toys to go around.
	   Barefoot children in ragged clothing danced to the music of a
visitor's car radio as they broke open two candy-filled pinatas
that had been donated to the camp. A few firecrackers were set off.
	   Cortez could only yearn for the Christmases of the past.
	   ``We would kill our own chickens and eat them with the rice that
we grew ourselves,'' she said.
	   Now she lives with 36 other families on a soybean field,
sleeping on the ground in tents donated by the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
	   ``We want land to work on,'' she said. ``Because if we don't get
(any), we're going continue to live in misery.''
	   The Nicaraguan government and the Sandinista-controlled
municipal government offered little help for Christmas.
	   The Sandinista radio station, Radio Ya, had distributed toys on
Tuesday, but many children didn't receive any.
	   The national government didn't give out any presents, refugees
said. The government said it would help the refugees celebrate the
Day of the Three Kings on Jan. 6.

India bats first in second cricket test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Indian skipper Mohammad
Azharuddin won the toss and decided to bat first in the second
cricket test against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve Saturday.
	   Both teams opted for a second spinner after a final look at a
sparsely grassed pitch that is expected to help the spinners from
the third day onwards.
	   While India brought in off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, New Zealand
included off-spinner Paul Wiseman to bowl in tandem with the
experienced left-arm orthodox spinner Daniel Vettori.
	   Ajay Jadeja, who was passed fit after suffering an injury before
the washed out first test, will open the batting for India with
Navjot Sidhu, who is playing in his 50th test.
	   New Zealand left out left-arm seamer Geoff Allott.
	   Simon Doull who was ruled out of the abandoned first test in
Dunedin with a calf injury will spearhead New Zealand's
three-pronged seam attack along with Chris Cairns and Dion Nash.
	   New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (captain), Matthew Horne, Matthew
Bell, Nathan Astle, Craig McMillan, Adam Parore, Chris Cairns, Dion
Nash, Daniel Vettori, Simon Doull, Paul Wiseman. 12th man: Geoff
Allott.
	   India: Mohammad Azharuddin (captain), Navjot Sidhu, Ajay Jadeja,
Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, Nayan Mongia, Anil
Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Harbhajan Singh. 12th
man: Debashish Mohanty.

	   HONOLULU (AP) _ Three adventurers trying to make the first
nonstop round-the-world flight in a balloon abandoned their quest
Friday, ditching in the shark-infested waters off Honolulu a little
more than halfway through their journey.
	   Coast Guard helicopters hoisted them from the water in good
condition and high spirits.
	   The men _ British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire
Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ quit seven days into
their journey after they lost the high-altitude, high-speed winds
they needed to carry them eastward across the Pacific to North
America. They had gotten caught in a low-pressure ``trough'' and
feared they would be stuck there for a week.
	   ``We weren't let down by any of our training or our equipment.
But we were let down by the weather,'' Lindstrand said.
	   ``It was a ridiculous way to spend your Christmas Day but it was
certainly exciting,'' Branson said in a thank-you call to the
operations control room in London.
	   They lowered the 272-foot-high (83-meter), combination helium
and hot-air balloon and let it hit the Pacific Ocean about 10 miles
(16 kms) north of the island of Oahu, where the craft bounced
across the water for miles (kilometers) because the explosive bolts
that were supposed to cut the balloon loose from the crew capsule
had been frozen by the cold and didn't work.
	   The men, wearing their survival suits, were in the water no more
than 10 minutes before they were hoisted in baskets aboard two
Coast Guard helicopters, Fossett said.
	   Lindstrand said he has ditched many aircraft in the past, but
``this was the worst. It was horrendous.''
	   The craft was not immediately recovered, but Fossett said plans
were under way to salvage at least the capsule and the equipment
aboard.
	   All three balloonists have made a total of 11 attempts at a
nonstop flight around globe, some of which ended in near tragedy.
	   This time, as the balloon was landing, Fossett said, he was
thinking ``about the fact that I've made three attempts to fly
round the world just in 1998 and it's getting pretty
discouraging.''
	   ``I think it's time to go sailing,'' Fossett said.
	   The men were brought ashore at Barbers Point, about 10 miles (16
kms) west of Honolulu. U.S. customs inspectors were waiting to meet
them and have them sign the declaration forms required of all those
entering the United States.
	   The balloon voyage began on Dec. 18 in Marrakech, Morocco, and,
if successful, would have ended in Western Europe. The crew had
hoped to reach North America sometime Friday, flying over southern
Canada or Washington state. They covered 12,500 miles (20,100 kms)
before giving up.
	   ``We were not told for 15 minutes whether they were alive, dead
or injured,'' project director Mike Kendrick said from London. ``I
know it is a failure, but it is a glorious failure.''
	   Balloon pilots cannot steer or control their speed with any
precision, relying instead on extremely fast, high-altitude winds
to carry them around the globe. They navigate by changing the lift
of the balloon to ascend or descend into different wind currents.
	   After racing across the Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (320
kph), the adventurers' balloon got sucked into a low-pressure
system. They maneuvered the craft up and down between 6,000 feet
(1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) to try to find a fast
easterly wind. But the best they could do was a 16 mph (25 kph)
wind.
	   ``This is particularly disappointing,'' Fossett said. ``Last
night the weather changed on us and we were stuck. In the middle of
the night we decided it was a hopeless situation.''
	   If the balloonists had made the West Coast, they would have
broken the balloon distance record that Fossett set on an attempt
to circumnavigate the globe earlier this year. He, too, was forced
to ditch in the shark-infested waters of the Pacific.
	   During the journey, the team secured permission from 97
countries to cross their airspace. Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea refused permission. The crew also had some tense moments when
they passed over China farther north than the balloon had been
authorized to fly.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A rebel attack on the highland city of
Kuito killed and wounded dozens of people, some sheltering in a
Roman Catholic church, but Christmas services went ahead Friday
during a lull in the shelling, church workers said.
	   Thirty people were killed and 37 were wounded Thursday in the
heaviest rebel attack on the besieged city since fighting between

	   Kuito, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital
Luanda, has been a major focus of the latest fighting between UNITA
rebels and government forces, which has sent more than 50,000
people fleeing from their homes.
	   The fighting has undermined a 1994 peace accord that called for
UNITA to disband a 70,000-strong guerrilla army and hand over
control of almost half the country to the government.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed the renewed fighting on
UNITA and expressed dismay that Angola appears headed back to civil
war, which has ravaged the southern African nation for most of its
nearly quarter-century of independence.
	   The government regained control of Kuito from the rebels during
the intensive conflict that followed UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi's
refusal to accept defeat in the country's first elections in 1992.

	   About half a million people were killed, and hundreds of
thousands were left maimed, homeless and exposed to disease and

	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has an estimated 30,000 guerrilla soldiers hiding in the vast
southwest African nation. The government has 100,000 troops.

UNITA and expressed dismay that Angola appears headed back to civil
war, which has ravaged the southern African nation for most of its
nearly quarter-century of independence.
	   The government regained control of Kuito from the rebels during
the intensive conflict that followed UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi's
refusal to accept defeat in the country's first elections in 1992.
	   Kuito's population of about 100,000 was swollen with a further
30,000 displaced in the past two weeks, as battles raged throughout
the central highlands.
	   ``A lot of people have come from other towns and villages and
they have nothing to eat,'' the female church worker said.
	   Relief agencies have stopped flying food and medicine into the
city's airport that has been targeted by the rebels to prevent the
government from sending in reinforcements.
	   Angola's civil war began in 1975, following a 14-year fight for
independence from Portugal's colonial rule.
	   About half a million people were killed, and hundreds of
thousands were left maimed, homeless and exposed to disease and
hunger.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has an estimated 30,000 guerrilla soldiers hiding in the vast
southwest African nation. The government has 100,000 troops.

German captives receive Christmas gifts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four Germans abducted 2 1/2 weeks ago got
chocolates, cigarettes and mineral water for Christmas but weren't
allowed to call their families, Yemeni tribesmen said Friday.
	   The tribesmen delivered the presents from the German Embassy in
the Yemeni capital, San`a, to the hostages.
	   The Germans _ three women and a man _ spent ``a silent and
boring'' Christmas Eve and are ``looking forward to the day of
their release,'' said one of the tribesmen, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   They are only allowed to walk for 45 minutes a day accompanied
by armed men, he said.
	   The Germans were abducted Dec. 7 by gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan
tribe and taken to Marib province, 170 kilometers (105 miles)
northeast of San`a. The Bani Dhabyan are asking the government for
more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads in their poor
province.
	   A Yemeni newspaper identified the hostages as Norbert Degen,
Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The names have
not been confirmed by the German Embassy.
	   On Sunday, a cardiologist was dispatched to examine one of the
women who was suffering from blood pressure. Her identity was not
revealed.

Bucs hope they don't stop here
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They need help and they know it. Still, the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers should feel fortunate they still are breathing
in the NFC playoff race of the U.S. National Football League.
	   The Bucs could have been in a power position had they beaten
Washington last Saturday. But they turned over the ball three times
in the last six minutes and the Redskins rallied for a 20-16
victory.
	   Now, they not only must win a road game in December, which they
have done only six times and almost never in cold weather, but they
must have the Arizona Cardinals lose at home to San Diego. And they
need the New York Giants to win at Philadelphia.
	   That would create a three-way tie at 8-8 for the sixth NFC
playoff spot. Tampa Bay would get it through a tiebreaker.
	   ``Maybe on Monday everybody still couldn't believe we were in
this position,'' linebacker Derrick Brooks said. ``Now we've got to
take advantage of it. The reality is we still have a shot and the
only thing that we control is our game. If we go out there and win,
we put ourselves in a position to fly home and listen to those
other two games.''
	   To win, the Bucs must prove they can handle the cold. Of their
six December road wins, only two were in colder areas: at Denver in
1993 and at Washington in 1994. But they're 0-16 when it's under 40
degrees (4 C)at kickoff.
	   Of course, the Bengals (3-12) are one of the league's worst
teams and broke a nine-game slide at Pittsburgh last Sunday. They
are down to third-string quarterback Paul Justin and have little
incentive.
	   ``We have the opportunity to play the spoiler's role,'' Justin
said. ``We did that to Pittsburgh. Now Tampa Bay needs this one.''
	   Only the Cardinals don't need help in the NFC. A win over the
Chargers puts them into the playoffs for the first time since 1982,
a strike year, and for the first full season since 1975. The team
was in St. Louis in those years.
	   ``Right now, I'm focused on the present and what we're doing in
the future,'' said quarterback Jake Plummer, who signed a dlrs 29.7
million contract earlier in the week. ``I'm excited about this next
ball game and the chance to get into the playoffs.
	   ``That's what we set out to do. At the beginning of the year, I
didn't set out to get a new contract, I set out to get in the
playoffs.''
	   In other games to close the regular season, it's Minnesota at
Tennessee and Kansas City at Oakland on Saturday; Miami at Atlanta,
Buffalo at New Orleans, New England at the New York Jets, Green Bay
at Chicago and St. Louis at San Francisco in games with playoff
implications Sunday; Carolina at Indianapolis, Detroit at
Baltimore, Seattle at Denver, and Washington at Dallas, also on
Sunday; and Pittsburgh at Jacksonville on Monday night.
	   In the AFC, all six playoffs berths are decided, with division
winners Denver and the New York Jets set for first-round byes.
Jacksonville, winner of the Central, will be at home next weekend
against New England or Buffalo, while Miami owns the other
postseason spot.
	   If the Dolphins (10-5) win Sunday, they get the No. 4 seed and
will be home on New Year's weekend _ probably Saturday _ to play an
AFC East rival. The Patriots (9-6) will be that team if they also
win this Sunday or if the Bills (9-6) lose. A Buffalo win and New
England loss sends the Bills to Miami and the Pats to Jacksonville.
	   New England gets the fourth seed with a win and a Miami loss,
while Buffalo can't finish higher than fifth overall and definitely
will open the playoffs on the road.
	   In the NFC, Minnesota and Atlanta won their divisions and have
byes. Dallas took the East and will play next weekend against the
team that qualifies for the sixth spot.
	   Green Bay (10-5) will face San Francisco (11-4) in the other
wild-card game. The 49ers get to be the host of that contest if
they beat St. Louis or the Packers lose at Chicago. Otherwise, the
game will be at Lambeau Field.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Christmas Eve riot at an
overcrowded juvenile detention facility in Brazil has left one
youth dead and nearly two dozen injured, officials said Friday.
	   About 75 inmates overpowered several guards at the state-run
Tatuape juvenile detention center in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest
city.
	   The rioters then set fire to the facility and were quickly
engulfed in flames. One youth burned to death while 23 others were
hospitalized with serious burns. There were no escapes.
	   Tatuape guards have complained that there is only one guard per
20 juveniles and that the center built for 3,000 youths houses
4,000.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A 16-ton marijuana shipment destined for
Central America was seized in a warehouse on Colombia's pacific
coast, police said Friday.
	   It was the third major drug seizure in Colombia this month.
	   The drugs, packed in blocks and hidden in 110 metal drums, were
discovered during a pre-dawn raid in Buenaventura, an important
port located 210 miles (350 kilometers) west of the capital,
Bogota. The 55-gallon (209-liter) barrels were marked as containing
a powder used for cleaning swimming pools.
	   Police said they arrested two people who attempted to bribe
officers.
	   The shipment was headed for Honduras, one of several Central
American countries used as a stopping off point for drugs heading
to the United States, they said.
	   On Monday, police seized 66 pounds (30 kilograms) of heroin in
northern Guajira state, calling it the biggest heroin bust ever in
Colombia. On Dec. 4 authorities in the Caribbean port of Cartagena
seized more than seven tons of cocaine.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Police arrested four suspects in
the killings of a Brazilian congresswoman and three of her
relatives, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Ceci Cunha, 48, a two-term congresswoman with the government's
Brazilian Social Democratic Party, was killed Dec. 16 outside her
sister's house in Maceio, the capital of the northeastern state of
Alagoas, about 1,000 miles (1,600 kms) northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
	   Cunha, her husband, sister-in-law and her sister's mother-in-law
were gunned down after five men burst into the home firing shotguns
and pistols.
	   Two of the suspects have confessed that they were hired by
Cunha's political rival, Talvane Albuquerque, the Rio daily O Globo
reported Friday. Police have not released the names of the suspects
in order not to alert others they believe are involved in the
crime.
	   Albuquerque, a federal congressman, denies any involvement and
says he is the victim of a ``political ambush.''
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez
got stuck in an elevator for a half-hour while visiting a
children's hospital in downtown Caracas, his spokesman said Friday.
	   Chavez's security agents rushed to his aid after the elevator
carrying him and his wife, Marisabel, stalled Thursday between the
third and fourth floors, said spokesman Martin Pacheco.
	   ``After getting out, he said this demonstrated the dramatic
situation in which Venezuelan hospitals find themselves,'' Pacheco
said.
	   Chavez, a former coup leader who was elected president Dec. 6,
has said revamping Venezuela's crumbling health care system will be
a priority of his administration that takes office Feb. 2.

	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) _ A convicted cop killer wanted in
connection with nine murders in Puerto Rico has been arrested and
faces extradition, police said.
	   Larry Llanos Walker, 25, had been a fugitive since January when
he walked away from a work-release facility in San Juan where he
was completing a sentencing on a drug possession charge.
	   He was arrested as he walked out of a Schenectady home on
Wednesday, police said.
	   Schenectady police were contacted Wednesday by New York City
detectives who said Walker was a suspect in a Dec. 17 stickup in
Manhattan. Within hours of the 5 p.m. arrest Wednesday, New York
City police came to Schenectady to take Walker into custody, police
said.
	   NYPD detectives said Walker was dropped as a suspect after the
victim failed to identify him during a lineup. However, Walker
remained in custody Thursday in New York, awaiting extradition to
Puerto Rico.
	   The details of the nine murders could not be obtained late
Thursday. Police said Walker is only a suspect in those killings,
according to the Albany Times-Union.
	   Walker, at age 14, was sentenced to 20 years for killing
off-duty Rio Grande Police Officer Rafael Rivera Hernandez on May
16, 1989. Walker was freed after serving five years because he
committed the crime as a juvenile.
	   He later served time for robbery and drug possession and escaped
while serving time for a 1997 weapons possession conviction.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A rebel attack on the highland city of
Kuito killed and wounded dozens of people, some sheltering in a
Roman Catholic church, but Christmas service in the town went ahead
Friday during a lull in the shelling, church workers said.

heaviest rebel attack on the besieged city since fighting between
UNITA rebels and the government flared anew early this month, the
private Radio Eclesia reported.
	   Nine of the dead were killed when mortar fire hit a Roman
Catholic church in Kuito's outskirts, the Portuguese news agency

Christmas services were held in this church.

Newspaper: Pinochet flies in military priest from Santiago for Mass
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Chilean army priest flown in from Santiago took
confession and performed a private Mass at Christmas for former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, The Times newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The paper said that the general, 83, had also hosted a house
party for three of his children, Jacqueline, Veronica and Marco
Antonio, and more than 20 grandchildren, in two houses on the
exclusive Wentworth estate southwest of London.
	   Under bail conditions imposed by a British court Pinochet is
living in one house on the estate.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on charges of murder and
torture during his 1973-90 rule. He is fighting a bid to extradite
him to Spain.
	   Pinochet's family wanted ''to make it as much like a normal
Christmas in Chile as possible,'' the newspaper quoted Ivan
Moreira, a right-wing Chilean lawmaker and friend of Pinochet, as
saying. Moreira said he planned to pay a visit to Pinochet on
Christmas Day, the newspaper said.
	   On Wednesday, a British judge ruled that Pinochet could leave
his house detention if he needs urgent medical care, but refused
Pinochet permission to attend Christmas Mass at a local church.
	   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police. The victims
allegedly include expatriated Spaniards.
	   The House of Lords is to review Pinochet's immunity appeal Jan.

 &UR; Eds: Includes items on the Beatles, Queen Elizabeth II, Quentin
Crisp, Bill Cosby, Woody Harrelson, Elton John, and Jesse Ventura.
Some items have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Beatles' long and winding road traveled
again to Hollywood's Walk of Fame, where a star reappeared on
Christmas morning.
	   ``It was done in the spirit of giving,'' Johnny Grant,
Hollywood's honorary mayor, said Friday. ``Santa and I thought it
was time to respond to the Beatles fans' request for a chance to
honor the Fab Four.''
	   Grant said the Beatles got a star in 1994, but it was removed a
few weeks later under pressure from Capitol Records, who said a
ceremony should be held with a band member present.
	   Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr declined to
appear for such an event, so Grant finally decided to go ahead
anyway. ``The star has been in my office for a long time,'' he
said.
	   The star appeared without fanfare overnight next to Elvis
Presley's, at the gateway to the famed boulevard, he said.
	   John Lennon, who was shot to death in 1980 in New York City, has
a star near the landmark Capitol Records building.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II believes you can never be too
old to give good advice.
	   ``It is not always easy for those in their teens or twenties to
believe that someone of my age _ of the older generation _ might
have something useful to say to them,'' the 72-year-old queen said
in a Christmas broadcast Friday.
	   ``But I would say that my mother has much to say to me. Indeed,
her vigor and enjoyment of life is a great example of how to close
the so-called generation gap,'' she said.
	   The 10-minute message showed video footage of all generations of
the royal family at work and play. It highlighted moments from the
Queen Mother Elizabeth's 98th birthday and Prince Charles' 50th
birthday party to 14-year-old Prince Harry's arrival at Eton
College, one of Britain's most prestigious boarding schools.
	   The format was considered an attempt to appeal to the younger
generation as well as older people.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Quentin Crisp is celebrating his 90th birthday
on Christmas Day by embracing what he usually avoids _ work.
	   ``I never, never work,'' the writer and actor said in Friday's
Daily News. ``Work does age you.''
	   That hasn't stopped Crisp from reviving his one-man show, ``An
Evening With Quentin Crisp,'' at the Intar Theater. The show will
run through Jan. 31.
	   The eccentric Englishman, whose autobiography, ``The Naked Civil
Servant,'' was adapted for television, says the only city where
he's ever received totally bad reviews is San Francisco.
	   ``They thought I went up and down the breadth of the land
issuing manifestos. When they found out I never mentioned
homosexuality at all, their love for me died in an instant,'' said
Crisp, who is gay.
	   ``I'm afraid I also lost the love of the entire homosexual
community when I said that Princess Diana was trash and got what
she deserved,'' he says. ``She was Lady Diana before she was
Princess Diana, so she knew that royal marriages are never about
love.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A friend of Bill Cosby's son has sued the
National Enquirer, alleging the tabloid defamed him in two articles
that claimed he argued with Ennis the night he was murdered.
	   Phil Caputo played basketball with Ennis Cosby on Jan. 17, 1997,
hours before the 27-year-old son of the entertainer was killed
during a holdup along a highway.
	   The Enquirer reported that ``Cosby quarreled with a close friend
who accused him of having an affair with the pal's longtime lover''
and that Caputo told police ``that he questioned Ennis and asked
him if he had been sleeping with (the woman),'' according to the
complaint filed Wednesday.
	   Caputo said both statements are wrong and that the articles hurt
his reputation. He is seeking unspecified damages.
	   The tabloid refused to run a correction, the complaint said.
	   Steve Coz, editor in chief of National Enquirer said: ``It's
unbelievable that this is the thanks the Enquirer gets for helping
solve the Ennis Cosby murder case.''
	   Mikail Markhasev, 19, was convicted of the murder and is serving
a life sentence without parole.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Woody Harrelson is bringing his Woody Boyd
character back to life and back into the life of Dr. Frasier Crane.
	   Kelsey Grammer, star of ``Frasier,'' reunites with his favorite
``Cheers'' bartender in an episode set to air in the United States
on Feb. 4.
	   ``That show (``Cheers'') was like a constant picnic,'' Grammer
said in Thursday's USA Today. ``Working with Woody is like going on
a picnic again.''
	   Harrelson rehearsed this week for the episode, which will be the
first televised reunion between the fictional characters since the
end of ``Cheers.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Elton John paved his yellow brick road with
gold this year.
	   John had the biggest-grossing domestic concert act of the year,
taking in more than dlrs 40.6 million during his 53-show tour,
according to a year-end tally by Performance magazine, a concert
industry trade publication.
	   New-age star Yanni grossed dlrs 40.5 million in 101 shows, while
Eric Clapton (dlrs 34.4 million, 43 shows), Garth Brooks (dlrs 33.9
million, 98 shows), and Janet Jackson (dlrs 33.3 million, 60 shows)
rounded out the top five.
	   Grosses for the top 50 shows of 1998 broke the dlrs 800 million
mark, up from the 1997 total of dlrs 781 million.
	   ``That's mostly because ticket prices went up,'' said Leiann
Simpson, associate editor of Performance.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BLOOMINGTON, Minnesota (AP) _ Minnesota's governor-elect, former
professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, is releasing a ``political
action figure.''
	   Ventura says his new doll will reach stores this spring. The
action figure, with a shaved head and bulging muscles about to rip
the seams of his dark suit, is expected to sell for dlrs 19 to dlrs
24, with most profits going to charity.
	   During Ventura's campaign for governor, one ad depicted two boys
playing with a Ventura doll. One of the boys has the doll rail
against Evil Special Interest Man.

<TEXT>
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ Three adventurers trying to make the first
nonstop round-the-world flight in a balloon abandoned their quest,
ditching in the shark-infested waters off Honolulu a little more
than halfway through their journey.
	   Coast Guard helicopters hoisted them from the water Friday in
good condition and high spirits.
	   The men _ British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire
Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ quit seven days into
their journey after they lost the high-altitude, high-speed winds
they needed to carry them eastward across the Pacific to North
America. They had gotten caught in a low-pressure ``trough'' and
feared they would be stuck there for a week.
	   ``We're glad to be alive,'' Branson said. ``We thought we were
going to make it all the way, but we hit a brick wall of bad
weather.''
	   They lowered the 272-foot-high (83-meter), combination helium
and hot-air balloon and let it hit the Pacific Ocean about 10 miles
(16 kms) north of the island of Oahu, where the craft bounced
across the water in three- to four-foot (1 to 1.3-meter) seas for
miles (kilometers) because the explosive bolts that were supposed
to cut the balloon loose from the crew capsule had been frozen by
the cold and didn't work.
	   ``We bounced a lot on the water. It must have been 50 times
until we finally dug in,'' Fossett said.
	   Once the capsule settled in the water, they climbed out the
escape hatches in the top and jumped off the back as the balloon
continued to pull the craft through the water.
	   The men, wearing their survival suits, were in the water no more
than 10 minutes before they were hoisted in baskets aboard two
Coast Guard helicopters, Fossett said.
	   In a thank-you call to the operations control room in London,
Branson said: ``It was a ridiculous way to spend your Christmas Day
but it was certainly exciting.''
	   Lindstrand said he has ditched many aircraft in the past, but
``this was the worst. It was horrendous.''
	   Fossett, who was forced to ditch in the Pacific during an
attempt to circle the globe earlier this year, described the
landing as ``pretty smooth.''
	   Fossett said if the landing system had been operating correctly
they could have touched down in Hawaii.
	   ``But if you are going to be dragged on a landing, you are much
better off doing it in the water,'' he said.
	   The craft was not immediately recovered, but Fossett said plans
were under way to salvage at least the capsule and the equipment
aboard.
	   All three balloonists have made a total of 11 attempts at a
nonstop flight around globe, some of which ended in near tragedy.
	   This time, as the balloon was landing, Fossett said, he was
thinking ``about the fact that I've made three attempts to fly
round the world just in 1998 and it's getting pretty
discouraging.''
	   ``I think it's time to go sailing,'' Fossett said.
	   The men were brought ashore at Barbers Point, about 10 miles (16
kms) west of Honolulu. U.S. customs inspectors were waiting to meet
them and have them sign the declaration forms required of all those
entering the United States.
	   A stretch limousine from the Hilton Hawaiian Village showed up
to take them to the Waikiki resort hotel. It also brought along the
makings of a continental breakfast.
	   The balloon voyage began on Dec. 18 in Marrakech, Morocco, and,
if successful, would have ended in Western Europe. The crew had
hoped to reach North America sometime Friday, flying over southern
Canada or Washington state. They covered 12,500 miles (20,100 kms)
before giving up.
	   ``We were not told for 15 minutes whether they were alive, dead
or injured,'' project director Mike Kendrick said from London. ``I
know it is a failure, but it is a glorious failure.''
	   Balloon pilots cannot steer or control their speed with any
precision, relying instead on extremely fast, high-altitude winds
to carry them around the globe. They navigate by changing the lift
of the balloon to ascend or descend into different wind currents.
	   After racing across the Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (320
kph), the adventurers' balloon got sucked into a low-pressure
system. They maneuvered the craft up and down between 6,000 feet
(1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) to try to find a fast
easterly wind. But the best they could do was a 16 mph (26 kph)
wind.
	   ``In the middle of the night we decided it was a hopeless
situation,'' Fossett said. ``If we had kept going, it would have
left us too far away from land for an easy pickup.''
	   Had the balloonists had made the American West Coast, they would
have broken the balloon distance record that Fossett set on an
attempt to circumnavigate the globe earlier this year.
	   During the journey, the team secured permission from 97
countries to cross their airspace. Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea refused permission. The crew also had some tense moments when
they passed over China farther north than the balloon had been
authorized to fly.
	   Branson was ready for another attempt.
	   ``We've finally cracked everything in the technology,'' he said.
``We'll buck up ourselves and start again.''

Doull rips through the Indian top order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand swing bowler Simon
Doull cut through India's batting order to have the tourists in
trouble at lunch on the opening day of the second test at the Basin
Reserve Saturday.
	   Doull claimed 4-20 in 10 overs and reduced India to 16 for four.
Sachin Tendulkar hammered an exhilarating 41 and captain Mohammad
Azharuddin made 29 to guide India to 91 for four at the break.
	   India won the toss but was in immediate trouble.
	   Doull, ruled out of the abandoned first test with an injured
calf muscle, grabbed 4-7 in 27 balls, making full use of a damp
pitch offering lavish sideways movement.
	   Doull, playing in his 25th test, began the Indian slide by
removing opener Navjot Sidhu with the last ball of his first over.
	   Sidhu (0) playing in his 50th test, drove loosely to give first
slip Stephen Fleming a simple catch.
	   Rahul Dravid (0) survived six nervous deliveries and was pinned
down on the crease by an inswinger.
	   Vice-captain Ajay Jadeja (10) and left hander Saurav Ganguly (5)
played and missed six overs between them, but soon fell in the
space of nine balls.
	   Jadeja left a ball which cut back into his stumps and Ganguly
edged an out-swinger to give wicketkeeper Adam Parore a catch in
front of first slip.
	   Tendulkar's innings included six boundaries while Azharuddin hit
five boundaries in his 75-minutes stay at the crease.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ Three adventurers trying to make the first
nonstop round-the-world flight in a balloon abandoned their quest,
ditching in the shark-infested waters off Honolulu a little more
than halfway through their journey. Coast Guard helicopters hoisted
them to safety Friday in good condition and high spirits. The men _
British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett
and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ quit seven days into their journey
after they lost the high-speed winds they needed to carry them
eastward across the Pacific to North America. Branson says he's
glad to be alive and ready to try again. (BALLOON QUEST)
	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The head of an international
monitoring team in Kosovo appealed to both rebel and Serb forces
Friday to avert a return to full-scale war. William Walker met with
a rebel commander in a Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold during a
lull in a second day of fighting in northern Kosovo. He also
planned talks with Serb commanders as part of his bid to end a Serb
offensive that reportedly killed at least nine ethnic Albanians.
The fighting poses the gravest threat yet to the Oct. 12 agreement
that brought a tenuous halt to months of combat between ruling
Serbs and separatist guerrillas in the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A rebel attack on the highland city of
Kuito killed and wounded dozens of people but Christmas services
went ahead Friday during a lull before fighting resumed. It was the
heaviest rebel attack on the besieged city since fighting between
UNITA rebels and the government flared anew early this month,
undermining a 1994 peace accord. Thirty people were killed and 37
were wounded Thursday, according to the private Radio Eclesia. Nine
of the dead were killed when mortar fire hit a Roman Catholic
church in Kuito's outskirts, the Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted
military sources as saying. (ANGOLA-FIGHTING)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an influential
voice among Senate Democrats, has come out in favor of censuring
President Bill Clinton, lending momentum to the Democrats' drive to
avoid an impeachment trial in the Senate. Moynihan, a New York
Democrat, who had not previously revealed his position, did so
Friday in a published report. Administration officials quickly
expressed new hope for ``a bipartisan solution'' that would avoid
Clinton's removal through a Senate trial. As the Senate prepares to
consider charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, other
senators including Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, agreed there
is increasing bipartisan support for a censure.
(US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebels pushed through thick jungle
toward Freetown and threatened to overrun the capital on New Year's
Day, a rebel general said Friday. Sam Bockarie said the rebels
captured the provincial town of Makeni, about 60 miles (100 kms)
northeast of the capital, and were battling for Kenema, a
diamond-mining town about 60 miles (100 kms) to the southeast.
Refugees have poured into Freetown this week after fighting
intensified between rebel forces and Nigerian-led West African
intervention troops. The rebels _ gunmen from a junta ousted
earlier this year and renegade fighters _ have demanded the release
of rebel leader Foday Sankoh and talks with the government. (SIERRA

Warren Hegg coming in to take over the gloves for a surprise debut.
	   Veteran seamer Angus Fraser also got a surprise recall, ahead of
youngster Alex Tudor, as part of a four-pronged pace attack.
	   Australia has an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the five-test series.
	   Australia: Mark Taylor (captain), Michael Slater, Justin Langer,
Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Ian Healy, Damien Fleming,

Jerusalem snapshot: the day reflects city's melange of faiths

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cold winter sunshine splashed the yellow stones
of Jerusalem's walled Old City at the intersection of the Via
Dolorosa and El-Wad Street, a jostling, noisy crossroad of faiths.
	   While Christians celebrated Christmas on Friday, Muslims were
marking the first prayer-and-rest day of their holy month of
Ramadan, and Jews were preparing to usher in the Sabbath at
sundown.
	   The Old City street corner scene on this day, with its vegetable
vendors, police and souvenir sellers, was also a snapshot of the
three great religions that have deep and indelible roots here.
	   Under the watchful eyes of armed guards, pale young students in
skullcaps streamed out of a yeshiva, or Jewish seminary, blinking
in the sudden burst of bright sunlight. Just outside the yeshiva's
doorway, a bearded Islamic cleric appealed for donations for
charity, and Muslim passers-by dropped coins onto a well-worn
prayer rug at his feet.
	   Only steps away, Christian pilgrims clustered around a tour
guide as he gestured toward the spot _ marked by a stain on the
curving stone wall _ where Christian tradition says Simon was made
to help Jesus carry his cross. Shopkeeper Hassan Nashishibi, a
Palestinian Muslim, beckoned tourists toward his store, filled with
crucifixes and olive-wood Nativity scenes.
	   ``Wow,'' marveled Georges Pereda, a visitor from Paris, as he
surveyed the scene. ``Muslims, Jews, Christians _ everyone is
here.''
	   Jerusalem _ particularly its Old City, which was captured by
Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war _ has always embodied
soaring spirituality and relentless realpolitik. Its crowded
confines are home to dozens of holy sites, many of them focal
points for the larger tensions that tear at Israel and the
Palestinian lands.
	   One such flashpoint is the hilltop revered by Muslims as the
Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, home to Al Aqsa and Dome of
the Rock mosques. Jews call it the Temple Mount; in biblical times,
the first and second Jewish temples stood there.
	   On Friday _ the first Muslim Sabbath since the start last week
of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast from dawn till dusk _ more
than 150,000 faithful packed the compound for noontime prayers.
	   In the hours beforehand, Old City streets flowed with a human
river of worshippers bound for Al Aqsa, the women in headscarves
and many of the men in long robes. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers
with M-16 rifles lined the narrow streets and guarded the
compound's entryway.
	   For Friday prayers during Ramadan, Israel relaxed the strict
rules that normally keep most West Bank Palestinians out of
Jerusalem. But men between 16 and 35 _ the age group from which
ringleaders of violent stone-throwing clashes are most likely to be
drawn _ were kept away.
	   At Al Aqsa, anger was running high at the United States and
Britain over last week's bombardment of Iraq. Ikrema Sabri, the
mufti of Jerusalem, or its highest-ranking Islamic clergyman,
preached a fiery sermon reflecting the discontent.
	   ``We tell the Americans and the British government that Muslims
will not kneel down for them!'' he told the enormous crowd of
worshippers. ``Allahu akbar _ God is great!'' came the roared
response.
	   Just below, in the Old City's Jewish quarter, last-minute
preparations for the Jewish Sabbath were under way _ shopping,
cleaning, cooking. Delicious smells drifted out from behind barred
windows.
	   With sundown and the start of the Sabbath, the enormous
yellow-flagstone plaza facing the Western Wall _ Judaism's most
sacred site _ was filled with Jews who came to pray, sing and
dance.
	   In dozens of Christian churches scattered throughout Jerusalem,
the day began with joyful Christmas services. Church bells rang out
and chants and carols could be heard through the Old City's stone
streets, mingling with the wail of the Muslim call to prayer.
	   Not all the city's Christians were celebrating. Its large
contingent of Eastern rite churches, including Armenians, Russians,
and Greek Orthodox, observe Christmas in January.
	   The holiday's passing was a reminder of what likely will be a
growing worry in coming months, with the final countdown to the
millennium. Israeli authorities fear that Jerusalem increasingly
will become a magnet for not only the faithful, but also the
mentally unhinged.
	   Already, there are about a dozen cases each year of what
psychiatrists call ``Jerusalem Syndrome,'' in which visitors to the
city are seized with the conviction they are biblical figures or on
a mission from God.
	   Israeli police last month began searching for members of a
Denver doomsday cult called Concerned Christians, some of whom
already have arrived in the country. The cult's leader, Monte Kim
Miller, has said he will die in Jerusalem in December 1999 and be
resurrected three days later.

<TEXT>
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ Ben Kelly ran 93 yards for a touchdown on the
opening kickoff and Colorado scored on four of six Oregon
turnovers, before withstanding a fourth-quarter rally to beat the
No. 21 Oregon Ducks 51-43 Friday in college football's Aloha Bowl.
	   Quarterback Mike Moschetti threw touchdown passes of 72 yards to
Darrin Chiaverini, 58 yards to Marcus Stiggers, 20 yards to Daniel
Graham and 5 yards to Javon Green to set an Aloha Bowl record for
most touchdown passes and lead the Buffaloes (8-4) to victory in
the school's 1,000th game.
	   Damon Wheeler had a 52-yard interception return for a TD for
Colorado and Jeremy Aldrich kicked field goals of 48, 41 and 23
yards to set a bowl record for most field goals as the teams
combined for the most points in the 17-year history of the game.
	   Running back Derien Latimer had three touchdowns for Oregon
(8-4). Quarterback Akili Smith scored on a 1-yard run and passed
for second-half scores of 9 yards to Jed Weaver and 42 yards to
Donald Haynes.
	   Smith's touchdown to Haynes cut the Colorado lead to 51-43 with
5:55 to play. The Ducks stopped Colorado on a fourth-and-2 on the
next series, taking over at their own 43 with 3:11 to play. But the
Buffaloes' defense held Oregon on fourth down and ran out the clock
for the win.
	   Moschetti and Smith were named the game's most valuable players.
	   The 94 points scored by both teams break's the bowl's record of
81 points scored in 1995, when Kansas beat UCLA 51-30. The 51
points scored by Colorado ties the record for most points by one
team set by Kansas and matched by Washington last year.

Newspaper: Rogue trader costs U.S. firm more than dlrs 8 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A trader with a Chicago-based company lost more
than dlrs 8 million in an unauthorized transaction on a London
financial exchange, The Independent reported Saturday.
	   The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange,
known as LIFFE, has warned its members not to trade with Griffin
Trading Co., the newspaper said.
	   It said the company was in default, meaning it may not be able
to meet its debt, following the transaction.
	   The newspaper did not give an exact figure for the losses, say
when the deal took place or provide any details on the trader.
	   Griffin Trading was closed for Christmas on Friday, and
officials did not immediately return a message.
	   ``What is known is there was a trader in London that cleared

	   Quoting unidentified sources, the newspaper said the trader had
lost the money on German derivatives, a complex and high-risk
financial instrument.
	   LIFFE is one of Europe's largest derivatives markets. The
newspaper said it declined to comment.

Cyclone Cora batters Pacific islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Wellington, New Zealand (AP) _ A small fishing boat with six
people on board was missing as Cyclone Cora began battering the
Pacific island nation of Tonga on Saturday, Tongan police said.
	   The 7-meter (yard) boat was missing in high seas off the central
Ha'apai group of islands.
	   A police spokesman said there had been few reports of other
damage so far.
	   ``People are moving away from the lowlands,'' the unidentified
spokesman said on New Zealand National Radio. ``We've received a
lot of rain so far and flooding will be a problem there.''
	   The cyclone is battering the main island of Tongatapu and the
Ha'apai chain with wind gusts of up to 100 mph (160kph).
	   The Meteorological Service of New Zealand said on Saturday that
the cyclone was moving south-southeast at about 15 knots.
	   Southern and western parts of the Ha'apai group, Tongatapu and
'Eua are expected to bear the brunt of the cyclone.
	   The Service forecast winds between storm force and hurricane
force, and predicted coastal flooding from heavy seas.

Cuba agrees to let Catholic leader broadcast Christmas message

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuba granted the Roman Catholic church a rare
Christmas wish on Friday: authorization to send a national holiday
greeting over government-controlled radio.
	   Cardinal Jaime Ortega, Cuba's top Catholic leader, received
permission to read the message Christmas afternoon over the music
station called Radio Musical Nacional, government and church
sources confirmed.
	   The authorization was a sign of continued warming relations
between Fidel Castro's government and the church nearly one year
after Pope John Paul II visited the communist island.
	   The return of Christmas as a permanent holiday ``is a joy for
the church and for the Cuban people,'' Ortega said in the 15-minute
message.
	   ``Now let us hope that it doesn't become a day of an imported
Santa Claus,'' echoing the concerns expressed by church and
Communist Party leaders alike that the day could become quickly
commercialized.
	   ``Let us not talk of beautiful festivities but of Jesus
Christ.''
	   The government's rare authorization of a nationally broadcast
message by the Catholic leader came a month after the government
declared that Christmas Day would become an official permanent
holiday. It made Christmas a one day holiday last year as a favor
to the pope before his January 1998 visit.
	   Access to the official media has been one of the church's
leading demands and was granted on a limited basis before and
during the papal visit, which was covered extensively by government
broadcasts.
	   Ortega had asked the government for permission to send a radio
message that would explain to Cubans the Christian meaning of
Christmas.
	   During his message, Ortega read passages from the Gospel of St.
Luke, recounting the story of Jesus Christ's birth.
	   Cubans have embraced the idea of having another day off, but the
resurgent celebrations remain largely secular.
	   Most families in the capital celebrated by decorating a small
artificial Christmas tree in their home and sharing quiet holiday
meals of roast pork with their families.
	   Still, as last year, hundreds crowded churches for midnight
Christmas Eve services _ a tradition that has grown in recent
years.
	   Early Christmas morning, most residents of Havana seemed to be
celebrating the holiday by sleeping late. The capital's streets
were more quiet than an average Sunday.
	   Ortega and other church leaders in recent days have emphasized
the need to recapture the religious traditions of the holiday,
largely forgotten here during the nearly three decades that
Christmas was abolished.
	   Although the government declared itself atheist in 1962,
Christmas remained an official holiday in Cuba until 1969, when the
government was throwing its resources into an unsuccessful effort
to harvest 10 million metric tons of sugar.
	   The government argued that holidays interfered with the harvest.
	   In late November, the Communist Party said mechanization had
reduced the need for manpower in the sugar harvest and reinstated
the holiday.
	   In 1976, Cuba's constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and
in 1991, the Communists dropped its ban on religious believers. A
year later, Cuba declared itself a secular rather than an atheist
state.

Australia wins toss but rain delays start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no play possible in first session &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian captain Mark Taylor won
the toss and sent England into bat on a grassy wicket at the
Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday.
	   But heavy, persistent rain prevented any play before lunch on
the opening morning of the fourth test and there was no sign that
the bad weather would lift in the afternoon.
	   When the test eventually gets underway Australian fast bowler
Matthew Nicholson and England wicketkeeper Warren Hegg will make
their test debuts.
	   Taylor made utility bowler Colin Miller his 12th man while
England dropped batsman John Crawley and off-spinner Peter Such.
	   England's Alec Stewart gets a reprieve from his triple
responsibilities of captaincy, batting and wicketkeeping with Hegg
coming in to take over the gloves.
	   Veteran seamer Angus Fraser got a surprise recall, ahead of
youngster Alex Tudor, as part of a four-pronged pace attack.
	   Australia has an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the five-test series.
	   Australia: Mark Taylor (captain), Michael Slater, Justin Langer,
Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Ian Healy, Damien Fleming,
Stuart MacGill, Matthew Nicholson, Glenn McGrath. 12th man: Colin
Miller.
	   England: Alec Stewart (captain), Michael Atherton, Nasser
Hussain, Mark Butcher, Mark Ramprakash, Graeme Hick, Warren Hegg,
Dean Headley, Darren Gough, Angus Fraser, Alan Mullally. 12th man:
John Crawley.

Govt to probe tennis abuse claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The government will investigate claims
that female tennis players had been subjected to starvation diets
and verbal abuse at the Australian Institute of Sport.
	   The News Limited newspaper group reported Saturday that at least
34 women awarded scholarships at the AIS tennis program said the
training regime destroyed their careers.
	   Players interviewed were involved from the program's inception
in 1981 until 1995. Some players said they were under such pressure
to lose weight they developed eating disorders.
	   One of Australia's most promising youngsters Brenda Catton, who
played at Wimbledon, said she vomited before most matches after
becoming bulimic.
	   A spokesman for Kelly, said the minister would be seeking a full
report on the allegations.
	   ``The minister will be requiring more information about these
matters and she'll be wanting to determine whether these
allegations have any truth to them and whether they have any
currency,'' the spokesman said. ``She will then determine if any
action needs to be taken.''
	   Australia has several well ranked men's players including
Patrick Rafter and Mark Philippoussis, who fought out the U.S. Open
final this year.
	   But the female players have failed to reach the standard of the
men over the past decade.

U.S. diplomat urges both sides to step back from all-out war

	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Kosovo teetering on the brink
of a return to all-out war, a top U.S. diplomat has visited the
latest outbreak of fighting and urged both sides to step back from
further confrontation before it's too late.
	   William Walker met with an ethnic Albanian rebel commander
during a lull in the second day of renewed fighting Friday in
northern Kosovo. He said he also hoped to talk with Serb commanders
as part of his bid to end the latest Serb offensive.
	   The Serb attack poses the gravest threat yet to the Oct. 12
agreement that halted months of violence between Serbs and
guerrillas trying to gain independence for the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province in Serbia.
	   ``This is the tensest period since the agreement was signed,''
said Walker, head of an unarmed force charged with monitoring the
accord. The observer mission is organized by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Walker said the force _ set to increase from 600 to 2,000 in the
coming weeks _ would not be pulled out in the face of increased
danger.
	   ``More verifiers are the answer to violence,'' he told
reporters.
	   A day after the Serbs launched their crackdown just west of the
northern town of Podujevo, the rattle of gunfire echoed through the
area.
	   But OSCE spokesman Jorgen Grunnet said there was a lot less
activity than Thursday, when Serb forces backed by artillery and
dozens of tanks swept into the area in what they said was a
response to the killing of a policeman earlier in the week.
	   Two columns of Yugoslav military vehicles, each consisting of
several tanks and armored personnel carriers, returned to their
base late Friday, Grunnet said, although it wasn't clear if the
clashes were over.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said late Thursday it would
``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means available.''
However, the KLA regional commander Walker met with insisted that
his forces were not firing unless fired on.
	   The attack against six villages north of the province's capital,
Pristina, sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills. The ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said at least nine people
were killed and many others wounded Thursday.
	   Bozidar Filic, the spokesman for Serb police in Kosovo, said the
renewed fighting was against rebels in the Lapastica region ``who
have built up a whole system of fortifications, used for their
attacks against police and the civilians.''
	   Army tanks could be seen filling in trenches dug by the KLA
around Lapastica, the village that houses the rebels' regional
command post.
	   ``The terrorists attacked us, and we responded in an adequate
manner, liquidating a number of them,'' Filic said.
	   The United States, France and the European Union have warned
both sides not to continue the violence. Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov on Friday warned the West against using force to halt
the latest violence.
	   In October, NATO prepared airstrikes against the Serbs as
punishment for their crackdown began last February in which
hundreds died and some 300,000 were forced to flee their homes. The
NATO attacks were put on hold after the cease-fire was reached and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pulled out some of his
forces.

Holland's Medieval forts now charming hotels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With TRAV-Cozy Castles-Tips &QL;

<TEXT>
	   WITTEM, Netherlands (AP) _ At dusk, when cooing birds whir
wildly over the towering turrets of moated castles, medieval Europe
comes alive again.
	   Nestled in forest glens and quiet villages far from windmills,
wooden shoe factories and other tourist traps, Holland's best-kept
secrets are its romantic castles. Dozens of them dot the flat
landscape, evoking days of yore.
	   If France's Medieval blockbusters such as Carcassonne awe with
their forbidding facades, and Ireland's ruins rot dolefully, then
Dutch castles charm with the fairy-tale magic of a Disneyland.
	   Reflecting the Dutch penchant for modesty, these castles aren't
nearly as large or garish as their counterparts elsewhere in
Europe. In fact, as castles go, they're downright cozy.
	   With their dormers, rotund towers, moats and drawbridges,
castles first appeared in the Netherlands in the 12th century. In
their heyday, up to 3,000 graced this small country.
	   Ravaged by wars, theft and the simple passage of time, only
about 100 still remain, ranging from authentic Medieval structures
to contemporary restorations with original ground plans.
	   Visitors looking for a taste of Europe in the Middle Ages can
expect all the lore but none of the gore. The brutality of Medieval
life is lost in these castles' pristine grounds and freshly painted
shutters.
	   But don't be fooled by their diminutive size. When it comes to
patrician pomp on the inside, the Dutch abandon their modesty and
flaunt shamelessly. Many of these castles are refurbished with
antique furniture, paintings and tapestries culled from the
country's rich art heritage.
	   Muiden Castle, just 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Amsterdam,
even presents live falconry demonstrations, showing how Medieval
Nimrods hunted with hawks.
	   A few castles are still inhabited by aristocrats, but most are
open to the public and showcased as museums. During World War II,
the stately Doornenburg Castle, situated near the German border,
was turned into a regional Nazi headquarters. It was bombed by the
Allies and rebuilt after the war.
	   For a memorable experience, try spending a night in one of the
handful of castles that have been converted into hotels, such as
the petit Wittem Castle in the castle-dotted southern Dutch
province of Limburg.
	   Against a backdrop of gentle hills and a skyline of lone church
spires, the moated castle was a knights' seat with a history dating
back to 1100.
	   These days, its stony appearance conceals a warm and intimate
interior where guests are pampered in rustic but elegant salon and
dining rooms. It has 12 bedrooms, including two in its chubby
tower.
	   Although the castle boasts lavishly decorated bedrooms, the two
tower rooms are surprisingly bare and lackluster. Renovations are
slated to begin in January.
	   For dinner, guests are first ushered into the oak-beamed salon
for an aperitif. Classical music wafts in the background, the
recordings occasionally drowned out by the lilting laughter of
guests.
	   The evening continues in the intimate dining room where guests
are served multicourse dinners by the expert Dutch chef Marcel
Bisselink which usually feature game such as hare, venison or
salmon.
	   All that fine food and rustic elegance doesn't come cheap. An
overnight stay, dinner and breakfast for two people at Wittem will
cost about 600 guilders (dlrs 300).
	   Beyond your means? Fret not. In this staunchly egalitarian
country, it's no surprise to find several castles-turned-hostels
for budget-minded travelers.
	   Westhove Castle, located on the southwestern flank of the
Netherlands in the province of Zeeland, is tucked into a nature
reserve a short walk from the sandy beaches known _ perhaps
somewhat pretentiously _ as the Zeeland Riviera.
	   Sitting on an idyllic spot, the 13th-century castle has a moat
and four turrets jutting into the sky. Close by there's even a
winding creek and a little stone bridge to complete the lyrical
landscape.
	   The only sound to jolt the tranquility is the roaring of the
waves at high tide.
	   Admittedly, the hostel's dormitories and shared bathrooms aren't
for everyone. Its somewhat shabby interior is also a major letdown
when compared to the splendor of its facade.
	   But when bed and breakfast cost only about 30 guilders (dlrs
15), slumming it in a medieval castle can still be a memorable
experience.
	   Ask for one of the tower dormitories. You'll spend the night
peeking through narrow lookout windows _ and fall asleep dreaming
of gallant knights and fair damsels.

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   INFORMATION: For a brochure on Dutch castles and their opening
hours, contact the Dutch Castles Association at (31-34) 357-8995,
or visit its Dutch-language Web site: www.kastelen.nl.
	   Dutch castles tend to have erratic opening hours, depending on
the season, so it's best to call and confirm before you set out.
Most offer guided tours, but a few are happy to let visitors roam
on their own and get lost in their labyrinthian interior.
	    &UR; ___
	   CASTLE HOPPING: Many castles are located around the central
Dutch city of Utrecht, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from
Amsterdam:
	   _ De Haar Castle, the country's biggest: Kasteellaan 1,
Haarzuilens, (31-30) 677-3804.
	   _ Zuylen Castle, Tournooiveld 1, Oud-Zuylen, (31-30) 244-0255.
	   _ Even more convenient to Amsterdam is Muiden Castle, whose
moats make it look like it came right out of a story book. Located
only 15 kilometers (10 miles) from the Dutch capital, this castle
also offers live falconry demonstrations. Herengracht 1, Muiden,
(31-29) 426-1325.
	    &UR; ___
	   CASTLE HOTELS: Limburg province has a few castles that have been
transformed into restaurants and hotels, offering ``gastronomic

list, call the Foundation of Monument Houses in Limburg, (31-47)
535-7800.
	    &UR; ___
	   CASTLE CHIC : Wittem Castle, Wittemer Allee 3, Wittem, (31-43)
450-1208.
	   The hamlet of Wittem is about 245 kilometers (150 miles) from
Amsterdam and 15 kilometers (10 miles) from Maastricht, not far
from Germany and Belgium.
	   Wittem Castle is open all year. The standard room for two is 230
guilders (dlrs 115), and the tower room is 295 guilders (dlrs 148).
	   Its proprietors insist overnight guests must have dinner in the
castle restaurant, which features game such as hare, venison and
salmon. The cheaper of two fixed-priced menus costs 97.50 guilders
(dlrs 49); a la carte main dishes start at 52 guilders (dlrs 27).
For dessert, try the decadent dome-shaped chocolate cream cake with
caramel ice cream and meringue.
	   Breakfast, which is 30 guilders (dlrs 15), includes freshly
squeezed orange juice, cheese, cold cuts, eggs and a basket of
bread.
	    &UR; ___
	   CASTLE CHEAP: Westhove Castle Youth Hostel, Duinvlietweg 8,
Domburg, (31-11) 858-1254.
	   This castle, which has 112 beds, is about 250 kilometers (155
miles) from Amsterdam and 13 kilometers (8 miles) from the medieval
city of Middelburg, the capital of Zeeland province.
	   The hostel is close to pristine, sandy beaches and quaint
seaside villages. There are also many cycling and walking trails
nearby. The hostel's friendly staff can arrange package trips and
offer other tourist information.
	   The hostel is open every day from mid-March through October.
From November to mid-March, it is only open on weekends, except for
groups.
	   Bed and breakfast costs between 28 and 37.40 guilders (dlrs 14

the International Hostel Association.
	   Ask for tower room 11, which has 6 beds and narrow look-out
windows. The hostel also has smaller rooms with 4 beds.
	   Dinner costs 17 guilders (dlrs 8), but unless you want the
hostel grub of soup, salad and schnitzel, head for Middelburg where
restaurants are aplenty.

	   PARIS (AP) _ For the first time since the French Revolution,
King Louis XIV's sumptuous abode in Versailles opens to the public
this year for a New Year's Eve party fit for the Sun King.
	   Fireworks, recitals, dancing and gourmet delicacies like the
ones served at Louis' 17th-century court are guaranteed to make
``Le Bal du Roy,'' or Royal Ball, a unique _ and costly _
alternative to traditional New Year's Eve entertainment.
	   ``It's a chance to experience the magic and history of the
world's most beautiful chateau, a place built to entertain foreign
heads of state and to show off the grandeur of France,'' said
Xavier Morestel, a French history buff who came up with the idea.
	   ``We wanted to offer something cultural, something more than
just a sequins and feathers-style cabaret experience.''
	   It's open to the public, sort of. Not everyone can afford to
shell out 8,000 francs (dlrs 1,400) for this seven-hour trip in
formal attire into France's regal past.
	   Morestel says about 600 guests, including actress Stefanie
Powers, former auto mogul Lee Iacocca and Prince Henri d'Orleans,
pretender to the French throne, have signed up for this year's ball
_ a dress rehearsal for an even grander, more lavish celebration
planned for 2,000 guests on Millennium eve.
	   That once-in-a-lifetime gala will run about 12,000 francs (dlrs
2,150), not including transportation or lodging.
	   Morestel says a ``substantial'' portion of the proceeds from
both events will go towards renovating the chateau.
	   This year's entertainment includes a tour of the royal
apartments, a recital in the Royal Chapel where French kings
traditionally prayed on New Year's Eve, and a gourmet meal created
by Gerard Vie, the two-star chef of Les Trois Marches in
Versailles.
	   His menu is rich by today's standards _ foie gras, lobster
medallions, chicken breast in white butter sauce with Alba
truffles, pistachio profiteroles with red fruit coulis.
	   But it pales in comparison to the culinary orgies commonplace in
Louis XIV's court.
	   ``Each royal banquet used to feature at least 120 different
dishes that required thousands of servants to prepare, bring in and
serve,'' Morestel says. ``But people only took tiny tastes.''
	   He said Versailles has never had a proper kitchen, and still
doesn't today.
	   Fresh produce comes right from Versailles' centuries-old
``potager du roy,'' or royal vegetable garden.
	   Costumed actors and musicians will evoke the arts that thrived
under the patronage of Louis and his descendants, and recall famous
receptions held for the Ambassadors of Siam and Persia, as well as
the one given for Benjamin Franklin by King Louis XVI and
Marie-Antoinette.
	   Two of the private royal suites will feature a harpsichord
player and harpist, strumming out favorite royal melodies.

	   DENVER (AP) _ John Weller steps into a plush corner room in a
downtown brick building, turns off his cell phone, slips out of his
clothes and stretches out on a long, narrow table.
	   He deeply inhales soothing aromas and listens to soft music
playing on a compact stereo while a mix of warm oil and water
streams from an overhead glass container onto his forehead,
spilling across his brow.
	   Then, a massage therapist works the week's frustration out of
his muscles, leaving him relaxed and ready for the weekend.
	   Weller says his visits to Spa Universaire, a day spa in lower
downtown Denver, are ``my favorite hour and a half of the whole
week. It's the one time where I take care of myself.
	   ``It definitely makes you feel better. It makes you feel more
centered, more grounded.''
	   Weller, who at 34 typically works 80-hour weeks at Cherry Creek
Mortgage Co., adds, ``My income has gone up 10 times since I've
been doing that.''
	   Across America, business executives, attorneys and working
professionals such as Weller are turning to spa treatments to
rejuvenate the mind and body.
	   During the 1990s, the spa industry's marked growth has been
fueled by the growing middle-age population weighed down by stress
and aching muscles and bones.
	   ``They're not going gracefully toward old age,'' says Thad
Hyland, general manager of the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa in Ojai,
California. ``They're going to fight, just like they did at work in
the 1980s.''
	   Although there are no hard financial statistics on the industry,
insiders believe it generates dlrs 1 billion or more in sales every
year. Men comprise about one-fourth of spa customers.
	   The overall number of spas has surpassed 1,000, up 47 percent
from 1997, says Jane Segerburg, president of the International Spa
and Fitness Association.
	   Today's spas are vastly different from the stereotypical fat
farms, where women spent a week or two dieting and undergoing
beauty treatments.
	   Now, spas emphasize holistic health and medicinal benefits of
alternative therapies, much like the thermal water spas founded in
Europe hundreds of years ago.
	   Spa owners say their goals are to promote better health with
treatments and tips clients may use at home.
	   Adam Broderick, who owns a day spa in Richfield, Connecticut,
says, ``People are starting to look in the mirror and go, 'Wow. I
need to take better care of myself.' Or,'I get up out of bed in the
morning, my bones ache. A massage would be really helpful.'''
	   There are three types of spas: destination spas, such as the
renowned Golden Door in Escondido, California; hotels and resorts
that offer spa facilities, and day spas, which offer services for
30 minutes to a day in urban settings.
	   Treatments use water, color, sound, light, aromas and even hot
stones. They range from beauty sessions to massages, facials, body
wraps, steam and hydrotherapy.
	   Body wraps can be made from dozens of exotic ingredients, such
as Australian tea tree seaweed, Swiss alpine mountain herbs, flower
essences and Dead Sea salts.
	   Prices run from as little as dlrs 30 for a facial and dlrs 60
for a massage to several thousand dollars for a multiday stay at a
destination spa.
	   At Adam Broderick Imaging Group in Richfield, Connecticut, a
client may begin a day of treatment with a massage or manicure,
then a facial, reflexology, hydrotherapy or a salt treatment to
exfoliate the skin and stimulate circulation.
	   At Hills Health Ranch near 100 Mile House, Canada, patrons take
long hikes, cross-country ski sojourns or horseback rides through
the wilderness, followed by a massage.
	   At the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa, guests use a fitness center or
dabble in creative arts, such as mountain hikes, sketch lessons,
herbal gardening and wreath-making. There also is a labyrinth where
they may meditate amid rocks and herbs.
	   The inn recently added nighttime treatments, such as the ``sleep
tight'' service: a massage and a warm robe to return to the room,
where herbal tea is waiting. It costs about dlrs 80.
	   Since the spa opened in December 1997, occupancy is up 10
percent at the golf resort, Hyland says.
	   ``You can't depend on a good martini anymore, or a great steak
to make your property,'' he says. ``You've got to have a lot more
than that and the spa is definitely the beginning of that.''
	   Spas also offer services to couples. Broderick, for example, has
a Valentine's Day package that features soaking in a Japanese tub,
individual massages and a light dinner accompanied by champagne.
	   The fastest growing segment of the market is the day spa, in
easy-access areas such as office buildings, department stores and
strip malls.
	   ``People are time paupers,'' Broderick says. ``They feel better
when they're doing more than one thing. And so I do find that
clients really have just embraced the day spa concept because they
can get the benefit of spa experiences without that commitment of
time.''
	   At Spa Universaire, President Caren Griffin maintains a
nongender atmosphere, which draws nearly as many men as women to
intimate theme-based settings: the Safari Room, the Taj Mahal, the
Rain Forest Room and the Pacific Rim Room. Each features music,
aromas and designs that reflect the region.
	   Men comprise about 40 percent of her business, which has 300 to
400 clients a month, she says.
	   ``We do not use the beauty word,'' she says. ``It's balance.
It's health.''
	   Jan Thomas, 40, drops by Spa Universaire regularly to
``disconnect'' from her 80-hour-a-week public relations job. ``I
like to come someplace where I can relax completely,'' she says.
``This is a reminder there is more to life.''

Fugitive South Korean businessman arrested on his way to North
</HEADLINE>
Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police charged a businessman and his
girlfriend Saturday with trying to defect to communist North Korea
to avoid fraud charges at home.
	   Businessman Kim Hak-hee, 48, and his girlfriend Lee Soo-ok, 39,
who fled South Korea in 1993, met North Korean embassy officials in
Singapore on Dec. 14 to arrange their defection through Beijing,
authorities said.
	   Kim and Lee were captured Tuesday by Interpol in the Kuala
Lumpur airport while stopping for a transit flight for Beijing, and
where extradited to South Korea, police said.
	   The two Koreas remain bitter enemies after their 1950-53 Korean
War ended without a peace treaty. It is illegal for citizens from
the two Koreas to enter the other side without government
permission.
	   Charged of fraud at home, Kim had been chased across Asia by
South Korean authorities and Interpol. Kim and Lee fled to
Indonesia in 1993 after Kim's small trading company went bankrupt.
	   About 200 North Koreans have escaped to South Korea in the past
three years, reporting widespread hunger in the isolated country.
But it is rare for a South Korean to defect to the North.

John F. Kennedy exhibit coming to Florida museum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ The world's largest known private
collection of John F. Kennedy artifacts will go on display a year
sooner than originally planned, according to officials of the
Florida International Museum.
	   ``John F. Kennedy: The Exhibition'' will open to the public Nov.
12, 1999, the museum announced.
	   ``There is so much excitement and momentum surrounding this
collection that we thought we could at least have it open on a
temporary basis,'' said Wayne Atherholt, the museum's marketing
director.
	   Instead of opening as a permanent display on the museum's third
floor, as originally planned, the collection will be treated as
though it were a traveling exhibit opening on the first floor.
	   The collection's owner is Maryland resident Robert White.
	   Last month, when announcing plans for a permanent Kennedy
exhibit, project supporters said they would lobby the state
Legislature and private donors for dlrs 10 million to house the
collection.

 &UR; Survey finds San Franciscans eclectic in food choices
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ It's a mixed feedbag for San Francisco
diners, according to the 1999 Zagat survey.
	   Mexican food ran away with the top four honors for the best
deals, French restaurants took the top five honors for food, while
the top three all-around favorite restaurants were New American,
Californian and French in that order.
	   And the No. 1 favorite restaurant of San Franciscans _ Nancy
Oakes' Boulevard _ isn't even in San Francisco, but in the Napa
Valley. In the No. 2 spot was Wolfgang Puck's Postrio, and No. 3
was French Laundry, another Napa Valley eatery that claimed the top
spot for food.
	   The other Frenchies that won the first five top food spots
following French Laundry were La Folie, Masa's, Ritz-Carlton Dining
Room and Chez Panisse.
	   Costs for eating out in San Francisco rose 9 percent over last
year, bringing the average cost for dinner, one drink and tip up to
dlrs 28.49, compared to dlrs 21.60 for the U.S. average. San
Francisco ranks only behind New York in average cost and in average
cost for the 20 most expensive restaurants, with New York weighing
in at dlrs 60.56, compared to San Francisco's dlrs 58.20.
	   San Francisco outstripped New York at dlrs 12.58 in average cost
of the 20 best value restaurants. New York's average in that
category was dlrs 10.59, while the U.S. average was dlrs 10.83.
	   The Zagat survey was based on reviews submitted by 2,345 Bay
Area diners who ate at 766 restaurants

 &UR; Cost of lodging for millennium New Year's Eve is soaring
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ If you're wondering what you're doing New Year's
Eve next year, you better make up your mind fast. Costs are going
through the roof.
	   An Internet site that books rental lodging says it collected
data from 75,000 vacation units and found prices for the millennium
New Year are already 1.8 times the normal rates.
	   Steve Murch, president and CEO of Rezworks, the Seattle-based

Government to probe tennis abuse claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds title, first name in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The government will investigate claims
that female tennis players had been subjected to starvation diets
and verbal abuse at the Australian Institute of Sport.
	   The News Limited newspaper group reported Saturday that at least
34 women awarded scholarships at the AIS tennis program said the
training regime destroyed their careers.
	   Players interviewed were involved from the program's inception
in 1981 until 1995. Some players said they were under such pressure
to lose weight they developed eating disorders.
	   One of Australia's most promising youngsters Brenda Catton, who
played at Wimbledon, said she vomited before most matches after
becoming bulimic.
	   A spokesman for Sport Minister Jackie Kelly said the minister
would be seeking a full report on the allegations.
	   ``The minister will be requiring more information about these
matters and she'll be wanting to determine whether these
allegations have any truth to them and whether they have any
currency,'' the spokesman said. ``She will then determine if any
action needs to be taken.''
	   Australia has several well ranked men's players including
Patrick Rafter and Mark Philippoussis, who fought out the U.S. Open
final this year.
	   But the female players have failed to reach the standard of the
men over the past decade.

Flyers' Renberg has shoulder injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Philadelphia Flyers forward Mikael Renberg
is expected to miss one to two weeks because of a left shoulder
separation.
	   The Flyers announced Thursday that the injury happened during
the Flyers' 2-1 win Wednesday night in Boston. At first, the injury
was thought to be a sprain.
	   Although the Flyers' medical staff hasn't evaluated Renberg, the
Bruins' medical staff gave an initial estimate that he wouldn't be
able to play for one to two weeks. Renberg went to Tampa, Florida,
to spend Christmas with his family before the Flyers could examine
him.
	   Renberg is expected be examined by Flyers team doctors on
Saturday when he joins his teammates in Chicago.
	   ``I've had this happen to me before,'' Renberg said. ``And they
said I would miss a week, but I was usually OK the next game. So,
we'll see.''
	   Renberg has one goal and one assist in five games for the Flyers
since being traded back to Philadelphia from the Lightning.
	   ``It's frustrating,'' Renberg said. ``I finally get a chance to
come back and play for the team I want, and I get hurt.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Khmer Rouge leaders considered
the main architects of the group's reign of terror in the 1970s
have announced they are willing to defect to the government.
	   In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk read over national radio
Saturday, Prime Minister Hun Sen praised the defection of nominal
Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan and the rebel movement's political
chief, Nuon Chea.
	   ``I would like to warmly welcome the two personalities and I
hope this decision made by the two personalities will become a
mobilization of strength for national reconstruction and peace,''
Hun Sen wrote to the king.
	   The two defectors were key players in the Khmer Rouge's brutal
1975-79 rule in Cambodia. As many as 2 million people died of
starvation, disease and executions when the Maoist guerrillas
forced the population into massive agricultural labor camps.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have said in the
past that they wanted the two captured and tried for genocide and
crimes against humanity. It was unclear whether the defection meant
the Cambodian government would not pursue charged against them.
	   Both of the Khmer Rouge leaders, who have surfaced in the former
rebel town of Pailin in Cambodia's rugged northwest, sent letters
to Hun Sen announcing they had broken away from guerrilla army
chief Ta Mok.
	   ``I have no other request except a request to be allowed to live
as a simple citizen,'' Khieu Samphan wrote in a copy of the letter
obtained by The Associated Press.
	   The offer of defection comes just weeks after Khmer Rouge chief
of staff Khem Ngun and seven other generals surrendered and
returned to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh for the first time in
19 years to meet government officials.
	   That surrender dealt a death blow to the guerrilla group. Still

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A train rammed into a bus at a crossing
in eastern India Saturday, killing 10 people and injuring five
others, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Railway officials said impatient bus passengers, who had been
waiting for an ``all clear'' signal at the crossing, snatched the
keys from the guard and forcibly opened the gate to pass through,
the Press Trust of India reported.
	   But while the bus was crossing the rail tracks, a freight train
came at full speed and crashed into the bus. All the victims were
bus passengers.

Tamil rebels suffer boat tragedy, 12 killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VAVUNIYA, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A motorboat carrying 12 Tamil Tiger
rebels, including two top ranking local guerrilla leaders, capsized
in the sea after an accident, rebel radio said Friday.
	   The Voice of Tigers radio monitored in the northern city of
Vavuniya said two lieutenant colonels were among the dead. It gave
no other details and did not say when or exactly where the accident
took place.
	   Military officials in Vavuniya, 210 kilometers (130 miles) north
of Colombo, said explosives being carried by the rebels may have
detonated prematurely. The rebels often use boats to attack Sri
Lankan navy positions.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland in north and
east Sri Lanka, accusing the Sinhalese majority of oppressing the
Tamil minority.
	   While not all Tamils embrace the rebels' extreme solution, many
feel they are denied opportunity by the Sinhalese, who dominate the
government and military. The government denies the charge and says
Tamils have equal rights.

Syl Apps, Hockey Hall of Fame member, dies at 83
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Ontario (AP) _ Syl Apps, a Hockey Hall of Fame member,
parliamentarian and philanthropist, has died at age 83.
	   Apps died at his home in Kingston on Thursday.
	   Born C.J. Sylvanus Apps in Paris, Ontario, Apps was an
exceptional athlete at McMaster University, where he captained the
football team to an inter-collegiate title in 1936. A two-time
Canadian champion pole vaulter, Apps was the British Empire
champion in 1934 and placed sixth at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.
	   That year, Apps joined the Toronto Maple Leafs. He led the team
in scoring and was the first winner of the Calder Trophy as the
NHL's rookie of the year. He played seven seasons with the Leafs
before enlisting in the Canadian Army. He also played three years
after his return from World War II, retiring after the 1947-48
season.
	   Known as a modest, quiet individual, Apps was captain of the
Leafs for most of his career, which he finished with 201 goals and
432 points in 423 games. He also had 25 goals and 54 points in 59
career playoff games.
	   In addition to the Calder, Apps won the Lady Byng Trophy in 1942
for gentlemanly play. He was twice a first-team and three times a
second-team all-star center and played on three Stanley Cup
champion teams.
	   Apps was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. In 1996,
the Ontario Sports Legends Hall of Fame named a trophy after him,
which recognized Ontario's athlete of the year.
	   Apps first ran for public office in 1940, narrowly losing a bid
for a federal seat. He was named Ontario Athletic Commissioner in
1946 and for 11 years, 1963-74, Apps was a Conservative member of
the provincial parliament and served in Ontario's cabinet.
	   Apps was married to Mary Josephine and they had five children:
Joanne, Robert, Carol, Sylvannus Jr., and Janet.
	   Syl Jr., had a nine-year NHL career with the New York Rangers,
Pittsburgh Penguins and the Los Angeles Kings. A grandson, Darren
Barber, won an Olympic gold medal in 1992 as part of Canada's eight
rowing crew.

Armed inmates hold hostages in Mexican prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Ten inmates overpowered guards and held about
12 hostages at a prison filled with Christmas visitors Friday
afternoon, authorities said.
	   Details of the disturbance at the Reclusorio Sur were not
immediately clear. The government news agency Notimex said the
inmates started a riot and managed to disarm some guards. It said
they were asking for their freedom in exchange for the hostages.
	   Among the hostages were prison doctors and nurses, said Luis
Alberto Silva, a Red Cross official. There were no reports of
visitors being taken hostage.
	   In the hours after the hostages were taken, about 200 adults and
more than 150 children who had been visiting the prison were
evacuated, most with their eyes swollen and teary because of tear
gas used by police, Notimex reported.
	   Notimex, citing unofficial sources, said two people had been
killed, but Silva said he had no knowledge of deaths. He said eight
people were treated for minor injuries.
	   More than 600 police surrounded the prison Friday evening,
Notimex said. But officials did not have control of the prison.

Tough times in striking Mexican copper town eased by stranger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANANEA, Mexico (AP) _ An anonymous stranger living 350 miles
(550 kms) away wanted to send Christmas to the children of this
copper-mining town, where 2,000 miners have been on strike since
mid-November.
	   Art _ the only name he would give _ said he had read about the
hardship the strike was producing.
	   ``It touched my heart,'' he said. ``I'm a Christian and I
thought it would be the right thing to do.''
	   First he and his wife of 25 years and their three children spent
two days scouring stores for nearly dlrs 10,000 worth of toys _
920, to be exact.
	   Then he loaded them aboard a fruit truck driven by some men from
this community of about 25,000.
	   The children were to get the toys during a noon celebration
Friday. Asked earlier what they thought Christmas would be like,
and they had answered in one word: ``Triste,'' the Spanish word for
sad.
	   Not only the children were sad.
	   Carla Canedo, a miner's wife waiting in a line for a food
basket, said her family's gas and electricity was about to be shut
off.
	   When her 4-year-old son asked what Santa Claus would bring, she
said, ``I told him, `Nothing, my son. Your daddy's not working.'''
	   Strikes are nothing new in this town where copper has provided
jobs for nearly 100 years. In 1906, seven years after the mine was
founded, workers struck to demand a minimum wage, an end to child
labor and that Mexican workers' pay equal that of the mine's
American workers.
	   The strike was put down, but it helped give rise to the Mexican
revolution four years later. Workers struck for four months in
1983. Bankruptcy closed the mine in 1989. There were work stoppages
in 1993, 1995 and early this year.
	   Once a quasi-governmental enterprise, the mine was sold recently
to Grupo Mexico as part of the government's privatization program.
	   Mexicana de Cananea subsidizes the cost of gas and electricity
in many miners' homes. Miners and their families pay only a penny a
month to use a company medical clinic. They still receive the
benefits while on strike. The company also provides workers with
soccer fields, pools and social clubs.
	   Miners take home an average of dlrs 120 a week, more than double
what a factory worker makes.
	   But workers say they fear the gains they've made will disappear
under the new ownership.
	   Jose Rodriguez Correa, a spokesman for Mexicana de Cananea, said
the mine operated inefficiently when it was government-owned.
Without government subsidies now that it is in private hands, it
must be restructured, he said.
	   This year the company added equipment and told workers they'd
have to increase their output.
	   When the union didn't agree to the revised production quotas,
the company withdrew the new equipment and said it planned to lay
off 135 workers.
	   Negotiations between the mine and the workers have broken down
and won't resume at least until after the holidays.
	   In Tucson, Arizona, Art reluctantly explained what led to his
gesture.
	   He could relate to the strikers, the 45-year-old said: When he
moved to Arizona 20 years ago, his first job was at a copper mine
in San Manuel.
	   ``I've always had compassion for Mexico,'' he said, insisting on
anonymity. ``They are so close to us. We have so much and they have
so little. And even when they work they only get dlrs 100 a week.''
	   Now in real estate, ``I'm blessed,'' he said. ``I've had a good
year. I felt in my spirit that the Lord said do this.''

Sketches of Khmer Rouge leaders Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Khmer Rouge
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Two of the last principal leaders of the Khmer Rouge, Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea, have expressed a willingness to defect to
the Cambodian government. That leaves only military chief Ta Mok at
large.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   KHIEU SAMPHAN _ The best-known Khmer Rouge intellectual, whose
polished manners helped him become its public face. He is
considered a moderate in the group.
	   Khieu Samphan was the official Khmer Rouge leader for years,
though real power remained with Pol Pot, who died of a heart attack
in April months after he was purged, and Ta Mok.
	   Born the son of a provincial judge in 1931, Khieu Samphan won a
scholarship to study in Paris, where he became involved in
communist politics.
	   His 1959 doctoral thesis is considered a blueprint of what would
become the basis of Khmer Rouge economic policy _ collectivization
of agriculture and economic self-reliance.
	   Elected as a left-wing member of the National Assembly in 1962
and 1966, he disappeared into the jungles in 1967 to escape a purge
against the left-wing, and joined the little-known Khmer Rouge.
	   Despite little military experience, Khieu Samphan was the
official commander in chief of the Khmer Rouge forces that seized
Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975. He was named head of state the
following year.
	   A Vietnamese invasion toppled the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979,
but the group fought a guerrilla war until 1996.

	   NUON CHEA _ The Khmer Rouge deputy secretary-general, Nuon Chea
was known as Brother Number Two, after Pol Pot.
	   He remains a sinister, shadowy figure, even in a movement
renowned for paranoia and secrecy. One of the few details known
about his personal life is his fondness for fish paste.
	   In May 1975, a month after the Khmer Rouge seized power, Nuon
Chea laid out the group's policy hallmarks _ destroying every
vestige of a market economy and killing suspected traitors.
	   Nuon Chea was born in 1927 into a prosperous family in
Battambang province. Unlike some of his better-known comrades, Nuon
Chea was not introduced to communism in France, but as a member of
the Communist Party of Thailand.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TA MOK _ Ta Mok toppled Pol Pot as leader of the last Khmer
Rouge faction in 1997 when Pol Pot tried to stop peace talks with
the government.
	   Ta Mok became known as ``The Butcher'' for his bloody purges of
perceived traitors during Khmer Rouge rule. He also led massacres
of ethnic Vietnamese civilians in the early 1990s.
	   A Buddhist monk in his youth, Ta Mok joined the resistance
against French rule of Cambodia in the 1940s and was an early
adherent of the communist party developed by Pol Pot.
	   Ta Mok lost a leg to a land mine in the early 1980s while
directing guerrilla warfare against Vietnamese forces then propping
up the Cambodian government.
	   Since the death of Pol Pot, efforts to bring Khmer Rouge leaders
to justice had focused on Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan,
though it often appeared the government was willing to cut a deal
with the last two.
	   Ta Mok's bloodthirsty reputation could make a bargain with him
politically impossible.

China frets over crime and suicide among its `little emperors'

	   BEIJING (AP) _ The writer called himself the ``rotten kid.'' His
appeals to the Beijing Evening News struck a nerve among Chinese
disturbed by the rise in problem juveniles, prompting a flood of
letters from anguished parents and children.
	   ``I'm one of those so-called good kids, because my schoolwork is
pretty good,'' wrote one youngster. ``After school, I smoke, drink
and get into fights, but nobody punishes me because I'm a good
student. I know I'm a bad kid, but my parents are blinded by my
good grades. I hope someone will come save us.''
	   Rising juvenile crime, suicides and other behavioral problems
have many Chinese questioning the wisdom of the government's policy
of controlling population growth by limiting most urban families to
one child.
	   In just a single generation, five-child extended families have
shrunk to single-child nuclear families in the cities.
	   Some ``little emperors'' end up smothered by the attentions of
their well-meaning parents. Others are left on their own with
little supervision or emotional support.
	   ``The one-child policy is a method, but it is a hopeless method.
The cost is very high,'' said Chen Yiyun, an expert on families at
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ``But we are also having
the same problems as in the West, so we can't blame everything on
the one-child policy.''
	   The rising juvenile crime rate _ minors account for at least
two-thirds of all those arrested _ and the gravity of crimes
committed by children barely into their teens has shocked many
Chinese.
	   The problem was considered serious enough for an executive
committee of the National People's Congress to pass a law last
April on juvenile delinquency.
	   The tendency of parents and grandparents to pamper and
overprotect their single offspring has long prompted jokes about
teen-agers who don't know how to wash their own backs, let alone do
laundry.
	   Reports in the official media reflect more alarming trends.
	   A gang of more than 30 teen-agers in the central city of Xi'an
committed dozens of armed robberies and rapes over the past few
years. The youngest, an 11-year-old, participated in four gang
rapes, police said.
	   The boy was ``cute and lovable, with a very sweet smile,''
according to a report in the official newspaper Legal Daily. He
also belonged to the gang's core, partly because he had access to a
car and often drove his cohorts around town.
	   Another gang member was the son of a government official and a
student with excellent grades who extorted money from his
classmates.
	   The gang members' status as only children was only one factor
behind their behavior, Gao Chengge, a psychologist at the Yifu
Hospital in Xi'an, said in a telephone interview. Rising divorce
rates and intensifying economic pressures that keep many parents
too busy with work to spend time with their children are also to
blame, she said.
	   China's ban on private gun ownership has helped prevent the
widespread firearms use like that which has plagued American
cities, but state media report many killings by children.
	   In one case, a 14-year-old was charged with strangling his
10-year-old cousin after kidnapping the boy to demand ransom from
his uncle in order to pay a debt of 12,000 yuan, or about dlrs
1,450.
	   In another, a 15-year-old slammed a brick on the head of an
11-year-old, dragged her into his house and beat her before dumping
her in a manure pile, where she suffocated.
	   A 16-year-old was beaten to death by five boys after an argument
over 10 cents worth of soda and gum. The chief suspect is a
13-year-old who had dropped out of elementary school.
	   The ``rotten kid'' letters drew hundreds of responses from
alienated youths, worried Chinese parents and educators during the
two months the Evening News ran the weekly series earlier this
year.
	   Parents expressed their frustrations at not knowing how to
communicate with their children, or how to get them to study.
	   Children poured out their own troubles: Parents with no time to
talk to their children or so preoccupied with school performance
they disregard the youngsters' feelings.
	   ``I never go home a minute earlier than I have to, because I
feel I have nothing to say to my family. Our views and thoughts are
totally different,'' wrote a 16-year-old named Lingling. ``I may
seem well behaved, but I'm not.''
	   Schools are trying to counter the problem with ethics and
morality classes for children and by promoting awareness of mental
health issues among parents and teachers.
	   Children need more than just book learning, said Fang Ge, an
education psychologist.
	   ``People need to pay attention not only to intelligence but to
other qualities, such as a sense of responsibility, confidence and
independence. Children need social skills as well as education,''
Fang said.
	   In many cases, problems arise not because of a lack of
attention, but because parents tend to be overprotective, said Fang
Liluo, a psychiatrist who often counsels families.
	   ``The children are too cherished. Each parent believes, `My
child must be the best,' and loads too many expectations on the
child,'' Fang said.
	   Such children are perpetually immature, she said. ``They can't
endure mistakes, are easily frustrated and unable to deal with
problems.''
	   Reports from around the country indicate a surge in the use of
tranquilizers by adolescents unable to sleep due to anxiety over
school.
	   The Beijing Youth Daily surveyed middle school students and said
one-third of those questioned admitted to having thought about
suicide at least once or twice. One-tenth had thought about it
often.
