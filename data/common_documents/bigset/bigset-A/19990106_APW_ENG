<HEADLINE> Gun Gifts to Samaranch Exceed $2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The retail value of the arsenal given by  
Salt Lake Olympics boosters to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
exceeds $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said today he didn't want to insult the city by  
refusing the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, Utah is a state where guns are very popular,'' he  
said at a news conference in Zurich, Switzerland. ``I have visited 
Salt Lake City twice and I got a gun both times. I took it to 
Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, two rifles and a shotgun, all made by Browning Arms of  
Mountain Green, Utah, have been identified as going to Samaranch 
and there also may have been a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials say such gift-giving to the leader of the IOC is  
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchange of gifts on the occasion of visits by the IOC  
president is customary and it has almost become a matter of 
protocol to do so,'' said Francois Carrard, the IOC's director 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he sees no problem in accepting the gifts,  
despite IOC rules that impose a $150 limit on gifts to committee 
members. He said the limit doesn't apply to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The limit is for the members who participate in the  
elections,'' he said. ``Now, I do not take part in the voting and 
the elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune de Geneve today quoted Samaranch as saying, ``I went  
to the American city twice before it was granted the 2002 Winter 
Games. On these occasions I did indeed receive a .22 Long Rifle and 
a Browning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do remember very clearly the inscription on the case: `To  
President Juan Antonio Samaranch on behalf of the population of 
Salt Lake City.' These gifts were put down in a register, as is 
required by our internal rules. They are in my office in Lausanne 
and I am in a position to show them to any of my visitors,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Samaranch said the two guns were in the  
Olympic Museum at IOC headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard's comment was in response to a report Tuesday in The  
Salt Lake Tribune that Samaranch received two guns worth $1,000 
from the Salt Lake bid committee a month before Salt Lake won the 
right to host the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said in another copyright story today that another  
Browning rifle also went to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said Samaranch was given a rifle in a case with an  
engraved plaque that read: ``Presented to President Juan Antonio 
Samaranch from the Browning Arms Co. on behalf of the people of 
Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That rifle apparently was sent to the Salt Lake City bid  
committee in Lillehammer, Norway, during the 1994 Winter Olympics 
and was delivered by Browning's distributor in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning billed the bid committee $1,250.75 for the rifle.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Browning disclosed the bid committee bought nearly  
$10,000 worth of rifles, firearms and cases at wholesale prices 
from July 1993 to May 1995, one month before Salt Lake City was 
selected as host to the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning has been searching its records since receiving  
inquiries about firearms sold to the bid committee. So far, its 
search has come upon four shotguns and five rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Other guns that went to Samaranch were a Browning ``Gold''  
semiautomatic shotgun with an estimated retail value of $475 and a 
``Euro Bolt'' bolt-action rifle with an estimated retail value of 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard also said a Browning pistol had been sent to Samaranch,  
but Browning spokesman Travis Hall said late Tuesday that the 
company was still searching for an invoice on a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also reportedly received a Ute Indian headdress and a  
quilt from Salt Lake bid officials worth thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's confirmation of the delivery of the Browning guns to  
Samaranch's office came amid investigations into claims that local 
Olympic officials bribed IOC members for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has acknowledged funding  
scholarships for at least six relatives of IOC members, providing 
free medical care, including cosmetic surgery, to visiting IOC 
members, and handing out lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the bribery scandal broke, Samaranch announced  
that the IOC would investigate and expel members found extorting 
favors from bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said today that the guns from Utah will be part of that IOC  
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said he isn't concerned about his future or that  
of the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will stay to the very last day of my mandate. We will do  
whatever is necessary to clean up whatever must be cleaned up,'' he 
said. ``Nevertheless, life goes on, and the Olympic movement has 
been very important over a century and it will stay on the same 
level.''

<HEADLINE> Cox Journey: From Golf to Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Bryan Cox remembers the July afternoon  
when he was sweating on a golf course in St. Louis and his beeper 
went off. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, he would ignore it and continue his game.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a 911 page,'' he said, ``so I knew it was important.''  
</P>
<P>
	The message was to call New York Jets coach Bill Parcells. At  
first, Cox was inclined to finish the front nine. Instead, he made 
the call that would lead him back to the NFL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells was eager to replace linebacker Marvin Jones, who had  
wrecked his knee in practice. And Parcells wanted Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was No. 1 player on our short list at any position that we  
thought could help the team,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was reluctant to return to the game. He played poorly for a  
pitiful Chicago Bears team in 1997. He had been fined enough money 
by the league, the Bears or the Dolphins (his previous team) to buy 
a membership at Augusta National. He was soured on the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked myself, `Do I want to do this,' '' Cox said Wednesday  
as the Jets prepared for Sunday's playoff game with Jacksonville. 
``I had made up my mind I was retiring and it would have to be 
absolutely the right environment. I could think of a couple of 
situations that I could work in, but did I want to?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly didn't need to. Cox has invested his earnings well.  
He didn't feel any regret about his playing career. He was fine 
without football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm financially secure, I attained a lot of things in this  
league from an individual standpoint,'' Cox said. ``It was not 
about ego. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also wanted to have no doubts that I'd go out the way I  
wanted to go out. The only thing I am chasing now is to go out on 
my terms, not go out on their terms or with them saying, `We don't 
want you anymore.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the biggest thing that brought me back, the bitter  
taste. I was on a sorry team with a sorry organization and I wanted 
to end it on a positive note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the end isn't so visible. After signing with the Jets for  
$500,000 for 1998, he renegotiated a two-year deal through 2000 for 
$2.2 million after becoming a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He's played superbly and been a force in the locker room for the  
resurgent Jets, who finished 12-4 this season, won the AFC East and 
allowed the second-fewest points in the NFL, one behind leader 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox played a major role.  
</P>
<P>
	``He brought a lot to the defense,'' All-Pro linebacker Mo Lewis  
said. ``I think he is our defensive MVP. He comes from the middle 
to the (weakside linebacker) and even end and tackle -- all the 
things they've asked him to do. It's a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's vocal, a leader who makes plays and has elevated his game  
and all of our games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having reached all his individual goals as a pro, Cox said there  
is one thing left. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team goal, obviously,'' he said. ``The Super Bowl. The  
championship. I want to reach the pinnacle as a team.''

<HEADLINE> Moseley-Braun To Advise on Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun has taken a  
part-time job to help promote a U.S. Department of Education effort 
to raise money for crumbling schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The job will involve ``talking to people outside the traditional  
education arena,'' such as architects and business owners, to rally 
support for refurbishing the nation's schools, Department of 
Education spokeswoman Julie Green said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to ``engage the entire country'' in understanding  
and supporting the need to improve school facilities, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley appointed  
Moseley-Braun on Tuesday as a $56-an-hour part time adviser on 
efforts to increase federal spending for school construction. The 
Chicago Democrat made education a central issue in her failed bid 
for re-election last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be my goal to put a reality check on the issue of  
crumbling schools, to let people know that it is a problem of 
national scope, it is a problem that affects every community and it 
is a problem in which every American has a stake in the solution,'' 
Moseley-Braun said in a telephone interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	While in the Senate, Moseley-Braun was one of the leading  
supporters of the Clinton administration's failed efforts to pass a 
bill that would provide $22 billion to build and modernize 5,000 
schools nationwide over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun, the first black woman elected to the Senate, was  
defeated by Republican Peter Fitzgerald.

<HEADLINE>  China To Spend More on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's cash-strapped government will be reaching  
even deeper into its overstretched pockets this year as the country 
struggles to spend its way out of recession, the finance minister 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes to stimulate consumer and industrial demand  
and stave off the economic malaise that has afflicted the rest of 
Asia by spending more on river embankments, irrigation projects, 
roads and other infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost lagging exports, tax rebates and preferential  
incentives for foreign investors also are to be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	Such policies could push China's 1999 budget deficit above the  
Finance Ministry's initial estimate of $12.75 billion, Finance 
Minister Xiang Huaicheng said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by the ministry acknowledged that while  
heavy spending in the second half of last year helped keep economic 
growth at a respectable 7.8 percent, ``the internal and external 
economic situations in 1999 leave no room for optimism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Export growth was likely to be low, or perhaps negative;  
state-owned enterprises continued to perform poorly and the Asian 
economic crisis was still ``biting and aggravating,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	China has looked to its underdeveloped domestic markets,  
particularly in rural regions, as potential sources of pent-up 
demand -- but consumers fearful of losing their jobs were not in a 
mood to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conventional consumer goods have lost much of their glamor and  
the demand for new ones has yet to come. Consumer prices remain 
low, but people tend toward saving more than usual,'' the ministry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Communist Party has made land and water conservation  
a top priority for 1999. Xiang said the government also was 
devising ways to eliminate or substitute taxes for arbitrary fees 
imposed by local governments that have caused much conflict in many 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiang admitted that such projects would strain national coffers.  
</P>
<P>
	To help finance such efforts, as well as its three-year program  
to steer $1.2 trillion toward infrastructure and construction 
projects, the government plans to float about $38 billion in 
domestic bonds this year, Xiang said. China also hoped to offer a 
sovereign debt issue overseas.

<HEADLINE> David Boston Heads to NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- David Boston, a second-team All-American  
who caught more passes than anyone else at Ohio State, announced 
today he will give up his senior season to make himself available 
for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1992 draft, coach John Cooper has lost 10  
underclassmen who left early for the pros. And it may get worse 
because linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer is also considering passing up 
orgoing his final season of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his three seasons, Boston picked up Ohio State records  
for receptions in a game (14), season (85) and career (191), 
receiving yards in a season (1,435) and career (2,855) and 
touchdown catches in a career (34). 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman, he caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Joe  
Germaine with 19 seconds left in the 1997 Rose Bowl to give the 
Buckeyes a 20-17 victory over second-ranked Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston said he is ready for a new challenge and began to think  
about whether to turn pro after Ohio State's Sugar Bowl victory 
over Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his decision ``after a lot of soul searching and indepth  
conversation with family and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said he had counseled Boston not to turn pro.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I thought he was making the right decision by leaving, I'd  
tell him to leave,'' Cooper said. ``I think he needs to come back. 
I think David can win the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's top 
receiver. ... This guy can win the Heisman Trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston had said he would not base his decision on the graduation  
of Germaine, one of the nation's most accurate passers. Most of his 
85 catches this season for 1,435 yards were thrown by Germaine. He 
also had said he would not return just for the personal glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to come back just to try to win the Biletnikoff  
Award,'' Boston said after the bowl game. ``I'm having a lot of fun 
right now. College football is great. I enjoy playing with the 
Buckeyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With several other top receivers already available in the draft,  
Cooper had wondered if it would be worth it financially for Boston 
to make the jump a year early. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not going to be the first guy taken at your  
position, then why should you come out?'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus Dispatch said that Katzenmoyer, the 1997 Butkus  
Award winner as the nation's best linebacker, reportedly met with 
OSU defensive coordinator Fred Pagac Tuesday night to discuss his 
options. Katzenmoyer had yet to set up a news conference to 
announce what he will do next season. 
</P>
<P>
	All underclassmen entering the draft are required by the NFL to  
do so by Friday.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll at 17 in Indonesia Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from anti-military  
riots in Indonesia has risen to at least 17, all of them civilians, 
a human rights group said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people died of their injuries Tuesday in a hospital in Aceh  
province, where riots broke out last weekend after soldiers raided 
suspected hideouts of separatist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	All the victims were shot, said Yacob Hamzah of the Iskandar  
Muda Legal Aid Institute, a non-governmental organization in the 
coastal city of Lhokseumawe. Some families buried their loved ones 
without notifying authorities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers had fired on rioters who attacked police and military  
posts in Lhokseumawe and other towns on Sunday. The military 
accused rebels of using women and children as shields and shooting 
at officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The military recently ended a campaign against rebels of the  
Free Aceh movement, which has been fighting for an Islamic state 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The armed forces withdrew some troops from Aceh in a more  
conciliatory approach following the May ouster of authoritarian 
President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	However, violence escalated last month when villagers and  
suspected rebels in the province on the northern end of Sumatra 
island killed seven soldiers and kidnapped two others. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four prisoners in Aceh who escaped after rioters attacked  
a jail remained at large. Only one has been recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
	Yacob said 11 civilians were fatally shot in Lhokseumawe while  
six others were killed in outlying villages. 
</P>
<P>
	The military said 10 people died. It had said that one army  
officer was also killed, but later denied the report.

	Witnesses Debated for Clinton Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's still no decision on whether witnesses  
will testify at the impeacment trial of President Clinton in the 
senate. But congressional officials said today House Republican 
prosecutors want testimony from Monica Lewinsky, presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan and possibly presidential secretary Betty 
Currie. Senate Democrats oppose having any witnesses called to 
testify, and leaders of the two parties haggled throughout the day 
over the guidelines for the first presidential impeachment trial 
since Andrew Johnson sat in the White House in 1868.

snapped up shares in high-tech and big-name companies in extremely 
heavy trading. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 233.78 to 
close at 9,544.97, surpassing the previous high of 9,374.27 set 
Nov. 23. NYSE advancers led decliners 2,013-1,117. The Nasdaq

the United States and the U.N. commission that searched for illegal

Rubin said, it was not done with the purpose of undermining 
President Saddam Hussein's government. They also shared technology 
as part of the effort to inspect suspect sites and possibly uncover 
hidden caches of biological and chemical weapons, Rubin said. 
Newspaper reports have suggested that UNSCOM helped eavesdrop on 
sensitive Iraqi government communications.

	Gun Industry Accused of Negligence  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing handgun manufacturers of  
letting guns fall into criminals' hands went to trial today with 
relatives of seven shooting victims using a legal strategy that 
proved so effective against Big Tobacco. The case is being closely 
watched by several cities that are trying to recover the costs of 
gun violence. The class-action lawsuit was brought in 1995 by 
Freddie Hamilton, whose son was gunned down in 1993, and other 
relatives of shooting victims. It seeks unspecified damages from an 
industry that generates sales of $2 billion to $3 billion a year.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Midwesterners and Great Lakes residents got a

latest round of snow. Even travel was a little easier for the first 
time since the weekend snowstorm, which canceled hundreds of 
airline flights and stalled thousands of passengers. Cold, snow and 
slippery roads had claimed at least 102 lives along the path of the 
huge weekend storm that rolled from the Plains across the Midwest

	NEW YORK (AP) -- While major corporations and government agencies  
race to prepare their computer systems for the year 2000, one-third 
of small business owners plan to do nothing, a new study shows. 
Some of the holdouts say the expense and the time required to 
upgrade systems and software is too heavy a burden for a small 
business to bear. About 1.5 million owners of small businesses said 
they haven't taken any action to prevent the millennium bug, 
according to the study by the National Federation of Independent 
Business.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Coating catheters with antibiotics can greatly  
reduce a major source of infection among hospital patients, 
researchers say. Catheters are extremely thin, flexible tubes used 
to introduce drugs, anesthesia or food into a patient via a blood 
vessel. From 150,000 to 200,000 Americans are infected each year 
when germs are accidentally introduced into the bloodstream by a 
catheter. An estimated 25 percent die.

	106th Congress Convenes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A self-effacing former high school teacher  
will be elected Speaker of the House when the 106th Congress opens 
today. Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., succeeds Newt Gingrich. Hastert 
will then deliver the oath of office to the other 221 Republicans, 
211 Democrats and one Democratic-leaning independent. Chosen 
unanimously by Republicans to lead the party, Hastert says he'll 
work to end the partisan combat that held up key bills in the last 
session and hurt the Republicans at the polls.

	Clinton Trial To Begin Tomorrow  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate GOP leaders are struggling for  
agreement among themselves and with Democrats on how to proceed 
when President Clinton's impeachment trial begins tomorrow. Much 
remains unsettled, from whether there will be witnesses to the 
length of the proceedings. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist will 
preside over the first impeachment trial of a president in 130 
years. The White House signaled this week it would present an 
aggressive defense if the Senate conducted a full-blown trial.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and British warplanes patrolling the

administration says. Western planes patrolled the northern and 
southern Iraqi skies today without incident, said U.S. defense 
officials. ``It just seems pretty unpredictable,'' Lt. Col. Rick 
Craig, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said of Iraq's 
airspace challenges.

Ngun, who led the surrender of the last Khmer Rouge army remnants 
in December, said the government would be seen as reneging on a 
recent defection deal with the men who ruled between 1975 and 1979, 
causing the deaths of up to 2 million people.

The rift began when Berra was fired as New York's manager only 16

	Congress Starts Its New Term  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 106th Congress opened today with a new  
House speaker promising a more bipartisan spirit and a Senate 
impeachment trial sure to make that difficult. At the stroke of 
noon EST the House and Senate were called to order to start a 
two-year session in which the Republican hold on power is one of 
the narrowest in history. The first order of business for the House 
is election of the new speaker - Dennis Hastert of Illinois.

	Senators Mull Impeach Details  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said  
today his party opposes calling witnesses for President Clinton's 
impeachment trial before the Senate and urged House prosecutors to 
stay out of the dispute. ``We didn't involve ourselves in their 
proceedings and it is very disturbing that they now seem to be 
intent on involving themselves in ours,'' Daschle said of the House 
prosecutors after meeting with Senate Democrats before the 106th 
Congress was sworn in.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration today projected a budget  
surplus of more than $76 billion for this year. ``We can say the

president, convening a White House ceremony to tout the figure, 
immediately squelched any speculation that the extra revenue would 
be used to cut taxes.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA and the players' union reached an

save what's left of the season. After a secret all-night bargaining 
session between commissioner David Stern and union head Billy 
Hunter, the deal was struck sometime around 6 a.m. -- just 29 hours 
before the league's Board of Governors was set to vote on canceling 
the remainder of the season. A season of about 50 games will begin 
the first week of February, according to a source close to the

a main government office building and burning down the city's 
police station while terrified residents huddled indoors, witnesses

<HEADLINE> NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA and the players' union reached an  
agreement in principle today to end the 6-month-old lockout and 
save what's left of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	After a secret all-night bargaining session between commissioner  
David Stern and union head Billy Hunter, the deal was struck 
sometime around 6 a.m. -- just 29 hours before the league's Board of 
Governors was set to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	A season of about 50 games will begin the first week of  
February, according to a source close to the talks who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval is still needed from the owners and the players, and  
the process of selling the deal to those constituencies began 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was presented to the negotiating committees for  
both sides. If the committees approve it, it will be presented to 
the full union membership this afternoon, an NBA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors will meet Thursday to vote on  
the agreement. It still must be put on paper and ratified before 
the lockout officially will be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of revenues in the fourth,  
fifth and sixth years of the agreement, a source close to the talks 
told The Associated Press. The NBA has an option for a seventh 
year, and the players would get 57 percent if it is exercised. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide an  
estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone won. Both sides lost on it,'' Indiana  
Pacers guard Fred Hoiberg said today. ``I think it will take some 
time to get the game back to where it was. Hopefully, we can get 
back to work soon and put a good product on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Stern had said chances of a settlement were  
better than 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a scale of one to 10, I'd make it a five-plus,'' Stern said  
on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors had scheduled a meeting for 11  
a.m. Thursday, and Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik had 
said they would recommend canceling the rest of the season if no 
agreement had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players began arriving in New York on Tuesday for a  
scheduled vote on whether to support the position of their 
negotiating committee, which had recommended that players reject 
the owners' final offer. At least 200 players had been expected to 
show up for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners' last proposal had guaranteed that would continue.  
The union had wanted higher salaries for the so-called lower- and 
middle-class players. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides made compromises in the end.  
</P>
<P>
	The league wanted a $12.25 million maximum salary for players  
with at least 10 years' experience, while the union wanted $15 
million. The sides had been tens of millions of dollars apart on 
the percentage of total revenues to be devoted to salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern presented the owners' final offer to the union in Denver  
1 1/2 weeks ago. He had been pushing for a player vote ever since, and 
the union finally agreed to one after the owners' negotiating 
committee voted 9-0 Monday to reject the union's final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, in effect since July 1, caused the NBA to miss  
games because of a labor dispute for the first time in its history. 
The first three months of the season had been scrapped and players 
had lost about $500 million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said  
Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz. ``Neither side is coming out of 
this thing looking good.''

	PALESTINE, Ark. (AP) -- Marvell High's girls basketball team  
trailed by 32 points after one quarter and the margin only got 
wider. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 63 at the half and the final was Palestine-Wheatley 123  
Marvell 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Patriots led 34-2 after one period, 65-2 at the half  
and 91-6 after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do?'' said Palestine-Wheatley coach Beverly Bass.  
``You can't tell your girls not to play or not to try. I'll admit, 
we didn't play very well, but by the second half and leading by 100 
points, my girls had stopped taking the game seriously. They were 
just goofing around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight game in which the Lady Patriots  
topped the 100-point mark. They beat Earle 100-34 before the 
Christmas break. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Erica Smith led the way against Marvell with 26  
points. Melanie Baker scored 23 and five other players were in 
double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Erica could have scored 75 points if I had left her in,'' Bass  
said. ``They (Marvell) wouldn't even come out and guard her. She 
would stand and motion for them to come out.''

<HEADLINE> Aides: White House Wants Early Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is developing a trial strategy  
to force an early vote to show that the Senate cannot muster the 
two-thirds majority required to convict President Clinton, 
presidential advisers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisers said the goal is to give Clinton's defenders a  
potent political weapon in case Republicans press ahead with a plan 
to present witnesses and evidence at a lengthy trial that the 
public has indicated it does not want. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we show the two-thirds is not there, the message is it's  
just a show trial with no chance of conviction. And every day we 
can remind the public of that,'' said one White House official, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Much depends on the format the Republican Senate majority  
chooses for the first trial of president in 130 years and what 
rules are put in place. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called 
Wednesday night for a ``full trial'' with details still to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton faces two articles of impeachment accusing him of  
perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice in his 
efforts to conceal an affair with former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential advisers said a ``test vote'' could be forced in  
several ways. If the Senate adopts rules used in past impeachment 
trials, a motion for such a sentiment could be approved by a simple 
majority -- 51 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	One White House official said presidential lawyers have  
discussed presenting, at the start of the trial, a comprehensive, 
single motion to dismiss the case against Clinton on a variety of 
grounds -- that the case doesn't meet the constitutional test of 
``high crimes and misdemeanors'', that the evidence doesn't support 
the charges, and possibly that the articles were improperly 
approved by a lame-duck House. 
</P>
<P>
	If that motion isn't made or kept from a vote, an outside  
adviser to the White House said, a Democratic senator could make a 
motion to table or adjourn the trial before evidence is presented. 
</P>
<P>
	This adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the test  
vote has become a key part of an evolving White House strategy. 
Losing the vote isn't a concern as long as 34 or more senators -- 
enough to block conviction -- support the motion, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see such a vote as a de facto end to any trial, a de facto  
acquittal if you will,'' the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who support a full trial with witnesses already have  
a well-honed argument for going forward; it's unfair to predict how 
senators will vote until they've heard all the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to read a cold record, an un-cross-examined  
record, and another thing to listen to the witness, to hear them 
cross-examined, to find out the holes in their stories,'' Sen. Rick 
Santorum, R-Pa., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential aides, however, are banking that public approval of  
Clinton's job performance and public opposition to a trial will 
work to Clinton's favor once a test vote on the Senate floor shows 
there aren't enough votes to convict. 
</P>
<P>
	The unfolding events suggest a trial, whatever the format, will  
hinge less on legal maneuvering than political gamesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, the White House is being careful to avoid any  
suggestion it is trying to pressure the Senate. ``The president is 
looking for a process that is fair, bipartisan and expeditious. ... 
We'll prefer to let the Senate do its business and let the Senate 
know on an informal basis,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In private, White House lawyers are developing a lengthy and  
aggressive legal defense if the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The test vote emerged from a plan that was developed by Sens.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and floated 
by Lott a week ago. When conservatives objected to the test vote 
and possible move to censure, Lott capitulated.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded  
heavily Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock 
Market, and American Stock Exchange.

<P>
 *Walt Disney Co. rose 3/8 to 30 15/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The stock lagged the Dow Jones industrials until the last few  
minutes of trading, when a flood of index-related purchases pushed 
it higher. Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Eisner said 
Wednesday new initiatives dragged down earnings in 1998. In a 
letter to shareholders and Disney employees, Eisner said 1998 was a 
``tough year'' for Disney's live action movie business, despite 
such successes as its remake of ``The Parent Trap'' and 
``Armageddon.''

<P>
	The companies extended for three years their agreement to resell  
each other's products. EMC makes computer storage systems, and

</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch upgraded steel stocks. Meanwhile, the Clinton  
administration missed a congressional deadline to produce a plan to 
combat steel imports. Industry officials and members of Congress 
said the delay reflected divisions within the administration over 
two camps -- one arguing for tough protectionist measures and 
another arguing that such measures would sabotage Washington's 
efforts to help countries hurt by the global financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Editor Sues Rocker Over Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The executive editor of Spin magazine has filed  
a $24 million lawsuit charging that two bodyguards for shock rocker 
Marilyn Manson beat him after the cross-dressing star threatened 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Marks, 37, said he was slammed against a wall and choked  
in a dressing room backstage at Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom 
following Manson's Nov. 23 heavy metal rock performance there. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the assault, Manson, whose real name is Brian  
Warner, warned that ``he could kill Marks, his whole family, and 
everyone he knew,'' according to papers Marks filed Monday in 
Manhattan's State Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	After the bodyguards released him, Manson told Marks, ``That's  
what you get when you disrespect me,'' the court papers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson's lawyer, Paul Cambria, denied that attack happened.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our investigations show all of these accusations to be totally  
groundless,'' he said. ``The witnesses sharply dispute Mr. Marks' 
account of what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marks suggested that the attack stemmed from his magazine's  
decision to drop its tentative plan to feature Manson on Spin's 
January 1999 cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks filed a complaint with police. Police and Marks' lawyer,  
Edward Davis, said the complaint is under investigation and no one 
has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson is on tour this month in Japan, New Zealand and  
Australia, his website says. The website also contains a statement 
that accuses Spin of bad faith and says the magazine does not 
respect musicians and their fans. It does not refer to the alleged 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks' lawsuit names Manson, his record companies -- Interscope  
Records Inc. and Nothing Records Ltd.; and the as yet unidentified 
agency that hired the two bodyguards. The lawsuit asks $1 million 
in compensatory damages and $5 million punitive damages from each 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokespeople for the record companies refused to comment on the  
suit.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Assistant Coach Is Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Idaho assistant football coach Dionicio  
Monarrez Jr. is being fired for his involvement in a drunken melee 
following the Vandals' 42-35 Humanitarian Bowl victory over 
Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	School president Robert Hoover said today the the second-year  
defensive line coach was notified on Tuesday that he will be on 
administrative leave through the end of his contract in June and 
the contract will not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The termination decision was made after Boise police said they  
would not file charges against Monarrez for what they initially 
said was his apparent attempt to obstruct officers trying to break 
up the disturbance in downtown Boise early last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to apologize to the Boise community and the people of  
Idaho for the involvement of the individuals affiliated with the 
University of Idaho who were at the center of attention of this 
most unfortunate incident,'' Hoover said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested freshman nose guard Wil Beck and charged him  
with illegal consumption of alcohol, disorderly conduct and 
resisting and obstructing arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested was junior offensive lineman Keith Cosseboom, who  
was charged with fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were released and returned to Moscow last week.  
</P>
<P>
	No action is contemplated by the school against the other four  
players at the scene, Hoover said, because ``the facts and the 
knowledge we have suggest that none of the others were involved in 
any criminal activity.''

<HEADLINE> Reducing C-Sections May Be Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Aggressive efforts to lower the number of Caesarean sections in  
the United States could lead to more injuries and deaths among 
mothers and babies, obstetricians warned today in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion piece, four doctors at Harvard teaching hospitals  
in Boston said that pressure from HMOs and policymakers is leading 
some doctors to encourage women to try vaginal delivery even when 
the risks are higher than those of a C-section. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstetricians said they are concerned about an increase in  
uterine ruptures, as well as injuries to babies caused by vacuum 
devices and forceps used during difficult labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration recently reported a tiny but  
growing number of head injuries and deaths of babies caused by 
vacuum devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Uterine ruptures also are increasing, according to data from  
four states. Serious uterine rupture during labor, which usually 
occurs in women with previous C-sections, can lead to brain damage 
or death for the baby and loss of the uterus or death for the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some parts of the country, some people have tried to  
mandate a trial of labor and not given women the option of a repeat 
Caesarean delivery,'' said Dr. Benjamin Sachs, chairman of 
obstetrics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ``There is 
enormous apprehension in the medical community about these mandates 
and approaches, for safety reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors especially criticized a campaign coordinated by the  
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to bring the nation's 
C-section rate down to 15 percent by 2000, from a high of 25 
percent in 1988. In 1995, five years after the goal was announced, 
the rate was 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting a 15 percent target is an ``authoritarian approach to  
health care delivery,'' the obstetricians wrote. ``It implies that 
women should have no say in their own care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Thompson, a spokesman for the Department of Health and  
Human Services, said the 15 percent goal was based on consultation 
with hundreds of groups, and is only a target, not a quota. He said 
studies have shown that hospitals can lower the C-section rate 
without compromising safety. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that studies show vaginal deliveries are  
safer than C-sections for most women, though vaginal deliveries are 
slightly riskier in women with a previous Caesarean. Also, women 
who deliver vaginally spend much less time in the hospital and 
generally recover more quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 15 percent goal has led health maintenance  
organizations to put a lot of pressure on hospitals to keep the 
number of Caesareans down, said Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, chief of 
obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, another one of the 
doctors who wrote the opinion piece. He said a low C-section rate 
is considered the ``gold standard'' of a maternity ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Many HMOs discourage C-sections by paying doctors the same  
amount for vaginal and Caesarean deliveries. Others pay a flat fee 
per mother, regardless of how complicated the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some HMOs consider a hospital's C-section rate when deciding  
whether to include it in their networks, and doctors consider it 
when deciding where to refer patients, the obstetricians said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists did not  
sign on to the 15 percent goal ``because there is no adequate 
science upon which to recommend an ideal national Caesarean rate,'' 
according to the organization's director of practice activities, 
Dr. Stanley Zinberg.

<HEADLINE> Deal Sought on 'Full' Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans hope to compel testimony by  
Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and other witnesses at President 
Clinton's trial, lawmakers said Wednesday. White House officials 
made an unexpected night visit to the Capitol to discuss ground 
rules for the first presidential impeachment proceedings in 130 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the opening day of the 106th Congress, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., expressed optimism that agreement was near on 
a procedure for a ``full trial ... and votes on articles of 
impeachment at the end of the process.'' One GOP source, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said it would probably be February at 
the earliest before votes are taken on the president's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats vowed opposition to any plan to call witnesses, and  
insisted they had not been presented with a written proposal for 
conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	By a vote of the GOP-controlled House last year, the nation's  
42nd president stands accused of two articles of impeachment 
alleging perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with 
attempts to conceal his sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	A largely ceremonial opening for the trial was set for Thursday,  
when Chief Justice William Rehnquist is expected in the Senate 
chamber to swear in senators as jurors for an event unseen since 
Andrew Johnson sat in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	That timetable set the stage for a flurry of discussions during  
the day involving a rotating cast of Democrats and Republicans in 
the Senate, House Republicans and -- late on a frigid night -- a 
quartet of administration officials, including White House counsel 
Charles Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences among the groups were considerable.  
</P>
<P>
	At one point during the day, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,  
D-S.D., said there was ``universal, unanimous opposition to 
witnesses'' among Democrats. And in polite but unmistakable terms, 
he urged members of the House to butt out of the Senate's business. 
``We didn't involve ourselves in their proceedings and it is very 
disturbing that they now seem to be intent on involving themselves 
in ours,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee said that in  
addition to Lewinsky and Jordan, presidential secretary Betty 
Currie was likely to be on any witness list the House impeachment 
team draws up. Linda Tripp, the woman who surreptitiously taped 
numerous conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, was not, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, the emerging proposal was to give each side 
in the trial -- the House and the White House -- three to five days 
to present evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of 
that time, a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or 
either side could seek permission to summon witnesses. The Senate 
would have to approve each witness to be called by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would set final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back. 
</P>
<P>
	Well after dark Wednesday, in Lott's remote hideaway in the  
Capitol, a small group of House and Senate Republicans met with a 
few Senate Democrats to review the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	A short while later, Ruff, White House special counsel Gregory  
Craig and two other White House emissaries made the trip to the 
Capitol to meet with senators of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, officials said earlier they were developing  
a strategy designed to force an early Senate test vote to 
demonstrate there is not the two-thirds majority required to force 
Clinton's removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we show the two-thirds is not there, the message is it's  
just a show trial with no chance of conviction. And every day we 
can remind the public of that,'' said one White House official, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in charge of the House team, met  
privately with Lott, seeking permission to call witnesses -- despite 
the strong opposition of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans had earlier discussed a witness list as long  
as 15 names, several congressional sources said. It was not clear 
precisely how Hyde framed his request to Lott, or even whether the 
two men discussed prospective witnesses by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority leader spoke more in terms of five to seven  
witnesses, Republican sources added. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Lott said that if agreement is reached to call  
witnesses, he would want each side to justify the need for each 
person summoned and for the Senate to vote on whether to hear that 
particular person. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations came as lawmakers took the constitutional oath  
of office, some laying claim to their hard-earned seats for the 
first time. Vice President Al Gore administered the oath in Senate, 
after which lawmakers, families and guests repaired to private 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans and Democrats alike brought their  
young children into the chamber for the opening-day ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, conservative Republican Rep. J. Dennis Hastert of  
Illinois -- a genial former wrestling coach from a congressional 
district in the nation's heartland -- was elected the new speaker in 
place of the harder-edged Newt Gingrich. Hastert's supporters were 
readily identifiable by the lapel pins they wore bearing the 
inscription, ``The coach is my speaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's impeachment trumped the other events of the day.  
And only the barest of details had been settled. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Republicans had decided they wanted to  
have testimony from Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern 
whose affair with Clinton triggered an independent counsel 
investigation and subsequent impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. said Ms. Lewinsky should be  
questioned ``in limited fashion, but we don't have to go into all 
the (sexual) details.'' Much of the questioning could be on 
obstruction of justice issues, such as the attempt to find her a 
job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers said Jordan, a friend of the president who had  
contact with both him and Ms. Lewinsky, was also on the list. As 
for Mrs. Tripp, one Republican said her tapes would make her 
testimony unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women who filed affidavits in connection with the Paula  
Jones lawsuit against Clinton might also be asked to testify, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., indicated that he might want to  
hear from onetime presidential adviser Dick Morris about Clinton's 
state of mind when he asked Morris for a poll on Americans' opinion 
of his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In a postscript to last year's debate in the House, lawmakers  
voted 223-198, largely along party lines, to authorize Hyde to 
press the case against Clinton in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde is expected to formally present the articles of impeachment  
in the Senate on Thursday. A few hours later, Rehnquist will enter 
the chamber and be sworn in to preside over the trial, his oath 
probably administered by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the Senate 
president pro tem. Rehnquist would then administer an oath to all 
100 senators, who will sit as a jury to rule on Clinton's fate.

<HEADLINE> Senators Struggle on Trial Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Republicans struggled for an agreement on  
how to proceed with President Clinton's impeachment trial, Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle said today his party opposes calling 
witnesses and urged House prosecutors to stay out of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't involve ourselves in their proceedings and it is  
very disturbing that they now seem to be intent on involving 
themselves in ours,'' Daschle said of the House prosecutors after 
meeting with Senate Democrats before the 106th Congress was sworn 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle referred to demands by House Judiciary Committee  
chairman Henry Hyde and the 12 other GOP lawmakers named as 
prosecutors that witnesses be called. ``We are not prepared to 
accept any witnesses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But one House prosecutor dismissed the criticism. ``It is  
certainly appropriate for us to present our views on what it will 
take to present the case. ... It is a very strange thing to have a 
trial with no witnesses,'' Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle's counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
continued his efforts to develop a consensus among Republicans on 
how long the trial should last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't give you a magic date,'' the Mississippi Republican  
told reporters before ducking into a caucus of GOP senators. ``All 
kinds of variables are coming into play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I keep trying to convey to people, we may not know  
the absolute answer until we get started.'' All that is certain is 
that the trial will begin Thursday with the ceremonial swearing-in 
of senators as jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart voiced ``some  
obvious frustrations that we don't know what the procedures will 
be.'' The president, he said, ``is anxious to get this resolved 
quickly and fairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also this morning, a senior Democrat cautioned he could vote to  
remove Clinton from office. ``I could go either way based on the 
evidence as I've seen it or heard it. And I've followed it pretty 
closely,'' Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W. Va., said in an interview on the 
C-Span cable TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	More than six of 10 Americans in a CBS News poll say they think  
a full trial of President Clinton is not necessary and almost that 
many, 60 percent, think a full trial would have a serious negative 
impact on the country. Only a third think the president's actions 
are serious enough to warrant his being impeached and removed from 
office, according to the poll conducted Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond establishing a date to formally open the historic perjury  
and obstruction of justice trial, nearly everything else is 
unsettled -- from whether there will be witnesses to the length of 
the proceedings. Each party's members met in caucuses this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be done not only expeditiously, but fairly,'' Lott  
said Tuesday after meeting with Senate Democratic leader Tom 
Daschle and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who will preside 
over the first impeachment trial of a president in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some two weeks after a House vote made Clinton just the second  
impeached president in history, Congress members take their seats 
today with the trial at the top of their agenda. In the House, one 
of the first orders of business will be to reappoint the 13 House 
Republicans who will serve as prosecutors in the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle told reporters Tuesday that starting the trial without a  
defined plan for proceeding would be an ``invitation to a prolonged 
process that would take weeks if not months, probably months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the uncertainty leaves the president's lawyers  
``in the position of preparing for all eventualities. In general, 
we'd like to know which direction we're going in, but we understand 
the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House signaled this week it would present an  
aggressive defense if the Senate conducted a full-blown trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh criticism surfaced among Republicans on Tuesday over the  
bipartisan plan for a proceeding as short as a week -- a proposal 
mostly favored by Democrats looking for a vote to censure the 
president rather than remove him from office. The likelihood of a 
longer trial, meanwhile, grew -- with some senators predicting it 
could last well into next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not at all worried about a two-to-three-week process that  
could take us into mid-February,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, 
a member of the GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Senate sources who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
Lott said in closed-door meetings during the day that after 
Thursday's largely ceremonial events, he wants opening arguments 
presented the following Monday by representatives of the House and 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said he envisioned giving each side three or four days to  
present its evidence. Each could then submit a list of witnesses 
for the Senate to subpoena, subject to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daschle, who agreed the ceremonial opening was likely for  
Thursday, told reporters his preference was for no witnesses. He 
added he wants a vote on censuring the president after an expected 
rejection of the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the 13 House Republicans who will act as prosecutors  
in the Senate trial gave their take on the debate during a meeting 
Tuesday night. No consensus was reached on just whom to call as 
witnesses, said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. But he estimated that 
the House would need two or three weeks in the trial just to 
present its case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved articles of impeachment on Dec. 19, alleging  
that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice as part of a 
months-long campaign to cover up his sexual relationship with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Dow Has Record Close / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ,	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged Wednesday, pushing the Dow  
industrials up more than 200 points to climb above 9,500 for the 
first time ever and shattering other records as investors snapped 
up shares in high-tech and big-name companies in extremely heavy 
trading.	   Investors continued to shower the market with new cash from 
yearend bonuses and proceeds of stock sales made at the end of 1998 
for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that heartened traders and analysts, Tuesday's  
shopping spree in computer-related stocks expanded to nearly all 
big companies with well-known names. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 233.78, or by 2.5 percent,  
to close at 9,544.97, convincingly shooting by the previous high of 
9,374.27 set Nov. 23. In its climb above 9,500, the Dow also 
rocketed past the 9,400 level for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index and Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500-stock list both had big gains to top records reached 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 27.58 to 1,272.36, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 69.38 to 2,320.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,013 up, 1,117 down and 441 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 977.33 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
773.65 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 11.10 at 611.01, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 9.26 to 701.47. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.71 to 427.80.  
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was close to 1 billion  
shares, and more than 1.2 billion shares changed hands on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after a dramatic summer swoon that saw the Dow flirt with  
7,400, Wall Street's best-known indicator ended 1998 with a 16.1 
percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P and Nasdaq indexes did even better, marking an  
unprecedented fourth straight year of double-digit gains. Low 
interest rates and negligible inflation have brightened the outlook 
for an extension of the eight-year economic expansion.

<HEADLINE> 2 Biographies Planned on First Lady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's turbulent marriage and  
her political partnership with the president will be under the 
microscope in dueling biographies by Pulitzer Prize-winner Carl 
Bernstein and best-selling author Gail Sheehy. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect Mrs. Clinton sit down and talk with the  
authors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she will do any interviews. At some point there  
is speculation about whether she will write a book, and frankly, 
she would be the best source for her book,'' Mrs. Clinton's 
spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein, whose Watergate work with Bob Woodward in The  
Washington Post helped bring down President Nixon, has signed a 
deal with Alfred A. Knopf. Sheehy, author of the bestseller 
``Passages,'' is expected to announce a deal by next week, said her 
agent, Lynn Nesbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Both work as contributing writers to Vanity Fair magazine.  
</P>
<P>
	In the race to publish, Sheehy appears to have the jump on  
Bernstein with a 15,000-word article exploring the Clintons' 
marriage in Vanity Fair's February issue, which hit newsstands 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Relying on interviews with family, friends, unnamed associates,  
aides and lawyers and previous interviews with Mrs. Clinton, Sheehy 
characterized the first lady as a woman with two identities: a 
moral Methodist and a radical feminist. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have helped Mrs. Clinton with her marriage and her public  
life, says Sheehy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her life strategy, decided long ago, was to take the raw  
material of a brilliant, emotionally battered child with a good 
heart and a desperate ambition and shape him into a political 
star.... It took a Hillary to raise a president,'' Sheehy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Clintons moved to the White House, Sheehy wrote that  
``Hillary believed that, at last, Bill would be more or less 
exclusively hers. If not because of a change of heart, then because 
of diminished opportunity. She told friends they had grown closer 
than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when the allegations of sexual improprieties arose,  
``Hillary adopted a Valkyrian battle mode in order to save her 
marriage. Presumably, she learned not only to rationalize, but even 
to capitalize on her husband's weaknesses,'' the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	The article speculated that Clinton would fight to keep his  
marriage, quoting Betsy Wright, who was Clinton's chief of staff 
while he was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``That man would lie down and kill himself before he would let  
her leave,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehy's book is due out in a year at most, Nesbit said.  
Bernstein said he has just started the research and would not 
speculate on a publication date nor would he discuss the terms of 
the book deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I've always done, and I really believe is  
that books speak for themselves. The last thing I would do is talk 
about what's going to be in a book that I haven't even written,'' 
he said. ``We are in the early stages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehy has written nine books and also has contributed to New  
York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein is the author of ``All the President's Men,'' ``The  
Final Days,'' and ``His Holiness: John Paul II and the Hidden 
History of Our Time,'' which he co-authored with Marco Politi.

<HEADLINE> Pork Producers Meet With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Plummeting pork prices probably will stabilize  
soon, but it will take hog farmers a long time to recover from the 
lowest prices in four decades, experts say, 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a dozen pork producers met Tuesday with President Clinton  
and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are being driven off the precious land entrusted to our  
care,'' said Herman Schumacher, a producer and auctioneer from 
Herreid, S.D. ``Third, fourth and fifth generation farmers and 
ranchers are being left with as little as the shirt on our back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the meeting were Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,  
D-S.D., and several other lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate hearing Tuesday to discuss low livestock prices in  
general, was dominated by talk of hog prices, which have dropped as 
low as $8 to $10 a hundredweight in recent weeks, down from $46.50 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Those low prices are expected to end sometime this summer, said  
John D. Lawrence, an economics professor at Iowa State University, 
who said prices will begin to move upward sometime next month. 
However, he said it will take a major debt restructuring for 
farmers to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The damage caused by the losses. . . will leave a lasting  
legacy on surviving producers and the industry,'' Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dunn, the Agriculture Department's undersecretary for  
marketing and regulatory programs, had a similar view, saying the 
oversupply problem that led to a glut of pork seems to be dropping. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Dunn said the U.S. hog inventory on Dec. 1 was  
62.2 million head, 2 percent above the 1997 level. Still, Dunn said 
the amount was a 2 percent decrease from the September level. 
</P>
<P>
	``A corresponding reduction . . . is expected during the fall  
marketing period if producers follow through with their 
intentions,'' Dunn said. ``We are hopeful that this decline in 
inventories is a signal the situation is beginning to stabilize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn said prices have improved since USDA announced last month  
it would buy $65 million worth of pork to help prices as well as 
form a Pork Crisis Task Force and defer some loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both cash and futures prices have strengthened since USDA  
began to take action,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Set To Vote on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of doomsday came the faintest flicker  
of hope. 
</P>
<P>
	With players arriving in town for an important vote on the  
future of their careers, commissioner David Stern uttered a few 
fleeting words of optimism Tuesday night by saying the chances of 
an NBA lockout settlement are slightly better than 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a scale of one to 10, I'd make it a five-plus,'' Stern said  
on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the source and his six-month history of gloom and  
doom, it was a rare instance of Stern admitting that things may not 
be as hopeless they seem. 
</P>
<P>
	A critical factor will be time, and there isn't much left.  
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors has scheduled a meeting for  
Thursday morning, and Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik 
have said they will recommend canceling the rest of the season if 
no agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of business today was a vote among players on  
whether to support the position of their negotiating committee, 
which has recommended not accepting the owners' final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 200 players were expected to show up for the vote,  
scheduled for a Manhattan office building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put it to the test,'' union president Patrick  
Ewing said, ``but we're going to make sure they stand by their 
negotiating committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the players vote to support the committee's recommendation,  
the union would then ask the commissioner and the owners to resume 
collective bargaining negotiations tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	If the players reject the committee's recommendation, the union  
would be expected to put the owners' final offer to an actual 
ratification vote. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was making any educated predictions as to how the players  
would vote. In fact, the union itself was undecided whether to have 
a secret ballot or an open vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players are going to do what's best for them, but it's our  
job to reassure them that on a long-term basis this is a bad 
deal,'' said Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat, a member of the 
union's negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come to the conclusion that the league's last proposal  
was not beneficial to the masses, and it's important for us to 
deliver that message to our colleagues and for them to make a 
decision from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league expected the players to hold a ratification vote  
instead of a referendum on the committee's recommendation. The 
balloting is open to all 400 or so players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to us more like a bargaining tactic than an example  
of union democracy,'' NBA chief legal counsel Jeffrey Mishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners' proposal would guarantee that NBA players remain the  
highest paid in professional sports, but the union wants higher 
salaries for the so-called lower- and middle-class players. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants a $12.25 million maximum salary for players  
with at least 10 years' experience, while the union wants $15 
million. The sides also remain tens of millions of dollars apart on 
the percentage of total revenues to be devoted to salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting them to vote in support of the position  
promoted by the negotiating committee,'' union director Billy 
Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	One who won't be voting is Rony Seikaly of the New Jersey Nets,  
who feels the players should leave the decision in the hands of the 
negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the owners' way of stonewalling us has worked,''  
Seikaly said. ``Players are starting to panic. The union is 
somewhat breaking because of all this. I thought we were going to 
be together, but I'm not sure if we are anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isiah Thomas, who has been on both sides of the labor-management  
relationship, said between 30-40 players have asked him to get 
involved. The former Detroit Pistons star, who was president of the 
union and later general manager of the Toronto Raptors, said he 
would do ``whatever they want me to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are confused about what's taking place,'' Thomas said  
of the vote. ``They're voting on the season but I don't know if the 
way they are doing it is proper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owners' final offer was presented to the union by Stern in  
Denver 1 1/2 weeks ago. Stern has been pushing for a player vote ever 
since, and the union finally agreed to one after the owners' 
negotiating committee voted 9-0 Monday to reject the union's final 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave the union only 36 hours to set up a full membership  
meeting, and some players called the league office to ask where the 
vote was being held because they couldn't get any answers from the 
union's beleaguered office staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trust those guys; they've done a good job,'' said Avery  
Johnson of the San Antonio Spurs. ``But there comes a time when you 
have to make yourself heard, whether by voice or by ink. The 
question is whether or not we can live with a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement somehow is finalized, a season of 45 to 50 games  
would begin sometime around the first week of February. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't make any sense why we're not playing,''  
Mavericks guard Hubert Davis said. ``I've talked to a lot of NBA 
guys, and a lot of guys said they'll take (the offer). Hopefully 
everyone will wake up and see how lucky we are and get back on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, in effect since July 1, has caused the NBA to miss  
games because of a labor dispute for the first time in its history. 
So far, the first three months of the season have been scrapped and 
players have lost about $500 million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Board of Governors votes to cancel the rest of the  
season, the NBA will become the first major professional sports 
league to lose an entire season to a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said  
Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz, who does not plan to vote and is in 
favor of accepting the owners' final offer. ``Neither side is 
coming out of this thing looking good.''

<HEADLINE> New House Offers Special Talents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Among the 434 citizens taking the oath of  
office today as members of the 106th House of Representatives are 
singers, scientists and a riverboat captain, not to mention a 
``Jeopardy'' champion and four Mr. Smiths. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a diverse group -- fewer lawyers than in the past and slight  
increases in the numbers of blacks, women, Hispanics and 
Asian-Americans. More than 80 percent are married. One boasts of 34 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest is 28-year-old Rep. Harold Ford Jr. of Tennessee,  
who was elected in 1996. The oldest is Rep. George Brown Jr., 78, 
of California. There's also a soccer mom, a former welfare mom, and 
a rapper-wannabe who intones: ``Snatch the future back from the 
night. Let the mothers lead the fight!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Phelps of Illinois is a gospel singer and Rep. Debbie  
Stabenow of Michigan once sang folk songs in coffeehouses. 
Minnesota has a congressman, Rep. Gil Gutknecht, who went to 
auctioneering school and one, Rep. James Oberstar, who speaks 
Creole. Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona is fluent in Mandarin Chinese. 
An inventor and scientist, Rep. Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, holds 
about 20 patents, mostly for breathing devices used by 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mary Bono of California is a gymnast and practices martial  
arts. Ukrainian folk art fascinates Rep. Bob Schaffer of Colorado. 
Rep. Don Sherwood of Pennsylvania raises and shows Belgian horses. 
Rep. Rush Holt of New Jersey is a five-time champion of 
``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Major Owens of New York has a passion for poems and  
raps he sometimes performs on the House floor. ``Fat cats want to 
buy your soul,'' raps Owens. ``Saving the children is the mothers' 
role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress by the numbers offers some insight:  
</P>
<P>
	--Of the 434 members, there are 222 Republicans, 211 Democrats  
and one independent. (The remaining seat, vacated by former House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, has not been filled.) 
</P>
<P>
	--The chamber has 58 women, 39 blacks, 20 Hispanics and five  
Asian-Americans. In the last House, there were 56 women, 38 blacks, 
19 Hispanics and four Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Overall, about 84 percent are married. Eighty-eight percent of  
the men, but only 59 percent of the women, have spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Together, the representatives have more than 1,070 children.  
Rep. Ron Packard of California says he's a grandpa to 34. Dr. Tom 
Coburn, who represents Oklahoma, says he's delivered nearly 3,000 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 65 percent are natives of the states they represent. A  
dozen were born abroad. Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan is from the 
Netherlands and now represents Holland, Mich. He keeps wooden shoes 
in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond demographics, there are tales of how they entered  
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Brady of Pennsylvania says he got his start in politics  
in 1965 when a committeeman failed to fix a burned-out street light 
outside his mother's home. Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana says he was 
inspired to enter politics at age 14 when he heard former President 
Reagan deliver a speech. Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington says she 
got her start as a Reagan volunteer. She even named one of her sons 
``Reagan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their occupations and backgrounds are varied -- some  
unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt of New Jersey and Rep. Vernon Ehlers of Michigan are both  
physicists. Holt is a Democrat; Ehlers is a Republican. Holt says 
they joke about having a bipartisan physics caucus ``if we can find 
a room with a chalkboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Don Young of Alaska, a former riverboat captain, claims to  
be the only licensed mariner in Congress. Rep. Judy Biggert of 
Illinois used to coach a school soccer team. Rep. Lynn Woolsey of 
California spent three years on welfare as a working mother. Rep. 
Christopher Cox of California helped provide an English version of 
the Russian newspaper Pravda. Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois 
co-founded Illinois' Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the millionaires is Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of  
Wisconsin, who won $250,000 in 1997 with a $1 lottery ticket he 
bought in Washington. ``Well, one of my jobs is to bring money from 
D.C. back to the state of Wisconsin, but I didn't ever think it 
would be this way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the House have an estimated 120 graduate degrees.  
About 40 percent graduated from law school, but there used to be 
more, says Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar. The number of 
representatives with business or banking backgrounds has risen, he 
says. But the number of veterans is falling. According to 
Congressional Quarterly, only 31 percent spent time in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find that extremely important,'' Ornstein says. ``Veterans  
tend to be more concerned about America's role in the world,'' he 
says. ``At least it's on their radar screen.''

<HEADLINE>  David Boston Heads to NFL Draft </HEADLINE>

<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- David Boston, a second-team All-American  
who caught more passes than anyone else at Ohio State, announced 
today he will give up his senior season to make himself available 
for the NFL draft. 
</P>

	Since the 1992 draft, coach John Cooper has lost 10  
underclassmen who left early for the pros. And it may get worse

	Through his three seasons, Boston picked up Ohio State records  
for receptions in a game (14), season (85) and career (191), 
receiving yards in a season (1,435) and career (2,855) and 
touchdown catches in a career (34).

Germaine with 19 seconds left in the 1997 Rose Bowl to give the

I think David can win the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's top 
receiver. ... This guy can win the Heisman Trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston had said he would not base his decision on the graduation  
of Germaine, one of the nation's most accurate passers. Most of his 
85 catches this season for 1,435 yards were thrown by Germaine. He 
also had said he would not return just for the personal glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to come back just to try to win the Biletnikoff

right now. College football is great. I enjoy playing with the 
Buckeyes.'' 
</P>
<P>

Cooper had wondered if it would be worth it financially for Boston

<HEADLINE>  David Boston Heads to NFL Draft </HEADLINE>

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- David Boston, a second-team All-American  
who caught more passes than anyone else at Ohio State, announced 
today he will give up his senior season to make himself available

<HEADLINE> China Backs Beijing's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese sports officials are giving their OK for  
Beijing to bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics, saying that holding 
the games in China would help bring East and West closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing was narrowly defeated by Sydney for the right to play  
host to the 2000 Olympics, partly because of concerns over China's 
human rights abuses. Stung by the defeat, China did not bid for the 
2004 games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chinese capital now joins Toronto as the frontrunners in  
an already crowded race for the 2008 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's bid was unanimously approved today by the 75 members  
of the Chinese Olympic Committee, a committee statement said. The 
committee and the city will submit the bid to the International 
Olympic Committee in early February. The IOC will choose a host 
city in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	China's human rights abuses and its spotty record on drug use in  
sports could again become factors in Beijing's bid. Communist Party 
leaders are in the midst of a broad crackdown on dissent that has 
seen at least nine dissidents sentenced in recent weeks to lengthy 
jail terms or spells in labor and detention camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Olympic officials said human rights should not be an  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``All countries have human rights problems,'' said Shao Shiwei,  
a committee official. 
</P>
<P>
	Shao said Beijing would make ``major repairs'' to its sporting  
facilities and build new ones and was working to clean up its air -- 
an issue he identified as a potential problem in its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The air pollution is quite terrible,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Formal approval of Beijing's application comes amid a severe  
government crackdown on dissent that has seen at least nine 
dissidents sentenced in recent weeks to lengthy jail terms or 
spells in labor and detention camps. 
</P>
<P>
	But in promoting Beijing's application, Chinese sports officials  
said China was ready for the games and vowed to create the 
conditions necessary for a successful bid. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rapidly developing nation of 1.3 billion people, China's  
``international influence is increasing by the day and is playing 
an increasingly important role in international affairs and in 
popularizing the Olympic movement,'' said Wu Shaozu, head of the 
Chinese Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	China also is politically stable and its sports abilities ``have  
improved markedly.'' he said. ``We already possess the conditions 
for hosting the Olympic Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding the Olympic Games in China will benefit cultural  
exchange and blending between East and West and benefit the global 
development of the Olympic movement,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Beijing and Toronto, other cities bidding for the  
games are Osaka, Japan; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Buenos Aires, 
Argentina; Istanbul, Turkey; Paris, France; and Seville, Spain. 
Cairo is also weighing a possible bid. Olympic committees have 
until February 2000 to officially bid for the 2008 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	If Beijing beats Toronto, it could have a major impact on the  
race for 2012. The United States is planning a bid for 2012, but it 
would have little chance of winning if the 2008 games go to Toronto 
because the IOC is unlikely to award the games to North America 
twice in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Jingmin, a vice mayor of Beijing, promised that the city of  
12 million people would speed up building work to make its bid more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beijing is a famous cultural city with an ancient history of  
3,000 years. Modernization is increasing its vigor and energy,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's ``international influence is increasing by the day and  
is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs 
and in popularizing the Olympic movement,'' Chinese Olympic 
Committee chairman Wu Shaozu said. ``We already possess the 
conditions for hosting the Olympic Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding the Olympic Games in China will benefit cultural  
exchange and blending between East and West and benefit the global 
development of the Olympic movement,'' Wu said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	While some Chinese privately express reservations about the cost  
of an Olympics, reaction on the street was overwhelmingly positive. 
People said hosting the games would boost the economy and sports 
and China's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have got the games a long time ago,'' said Song  
Jinling, an army officer. ``China used to be called `the sick man 
of Asia.' This shows that is absolutely no longer the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yu Wende, a pedicab driver, looked forward to the money Olympic  
visitors would bring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots of foreigners will come to China. But if they are held  
overseas, not many of us can go,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Projects $76B Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration today projected a budget  
surplus of more than $76 billion for this year. ``We can say the 
era of big deficits is over,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, convening a White House ceremony to tout the  
figure, immediately squelched any speculation that the extra 
revenue would be used to cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like any family with long-term financial needs and a little  
more earnings than we expected, we can't go out and spend the 
surplus today. We have to plan for the future,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we consider any new spending or tax cuts, first we must  
set this surplus aside until we save Social Security for the 21st 
century.'' He also cited ``investment needs'' in education and 
health research. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's Office of Management and Budget released  
its latest forecast for fiscal 1999, bringing the projected size of 
the surplus -- for the budget year ending Sept. 30 -- closer to 
congressional estimates of about $80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's newest estimate is significantly higher  
than its analysis last year, which estimated a fiscal 1999 surplus 
of $54.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can say the era of big deficits is over. We are now  
entering the second year of an era of surpluses,'' Clinton said. He 
noted that when he took office in 1993, the fiscal 1999 projections 
were for a $404 billion deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office is due to release its own  
projections later this month, in advance of the president's annual 
budget submission to Congress. In its August update, CBO was even 
more optimistic than the president's budget analysts, projecting an 
$80 billion surplus for fiscal 1999.

<HEADLINE> Royal Opera House Hits Hard Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- As Britain's Royal Opera House remains shrouded in  
scaffolding for an extensive and long-overdue renovation, its 
renowned ballet and opera companies can't help but wonder if the 
sound they're hearing is the fat lady singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Crippled by a nagging financial crisis, the opera house -- made  
up of the Royal Ballet and Royal Opera -- has been sapped by mass 
resignations and blasted by Parliament as arrogant and elitist. 
</P>
<P>
	It has grappled with unions over working conditions, and just  
replaced its chief executive for the third time in less than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, its board must ponder the most recent wave of red ink  
resulting from trying to stage ballet and opera performances on the 
road while the theater is closed for remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
	To put it succinctly, the Royal Opera House is in a royal mess.  
And things are not going to get better any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opera house is on the front page these days, and for all  
the wrong reasons,'' observed Richard Morrison of The Times, who 
has been writing about the institution for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Theaters on the Covent Garden site have been home to opera since  
1732, with some of the most important productions in opera history 
getting their English debuts there. In the 18th century, Handel 
wrote several operas and oratorios especially for the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the marriage of the opera and ballet companies under the  
umbrella of the Royal Opera House in 1946, the list of performers 
having graced the Covent Garden stage reads like a who's-who of 
20th-century arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballet legends Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn danced together  
there for the first time in the 1960s, and the theater's walls have 
reverberated with the exalted voices of opera superstars Maria 
Callas, Joan Sutherland, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have triumphantly toured the world time and time  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	These are dark days, though, and the crisis at hand has led to  
drastic measures to keep the artistic companies afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Board chairman Colin Southgate, appointed in February after the  
previous board resigned en masse, was the person who dropped the 
big bomb: He canceled most opera and ballet productions next year 
and cut the performance schedule for up to five years after the 
theater reopens in December 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket prices and salaries will be slashed, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``The days for fudging are long passed,'' Southgate said in  
announcing the radical plan in September. ``The board is sad at the 
pain this will cause to our work force, but only a total 
restructuring will achieve real results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gloom deepened the next month when 11-year musical director  
Bernard Haitink resigned in protest over the cutbacks, along with 
the Royal Ballet's premier attraction, dancer Tetsuya ``Teddy'' 
Kumakawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballet company now has threatened to defect and form an  
independent troupe. 
</P>
<P>
	So how did all this happen?  
</P>
<P>
	That's what Prime Minister Tony Blair's government wanted to  
know, since the Royal Opera House had received more than $170 
million in Arts Council subsidies since 1992 but continued to 
report steep deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigative report by a Parliament committee concluded the  
problems were mismanagement, irresponsibility, incompetence and 
snobbery. It accused opera house leaders of wildly optimistic 
planning and allowing directors of productions to spend without 
restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Royal Opera House is now at the lowest point in its long  
and distinguished history,'' the report proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	On their way out, board members blamed previous management for  
the problems. They also criticized the government for underfunding 
the opera house and arts in general for years, pointing to the 
richer subsidies enjoyed by arts organizations in other European 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers didn't want to hear it. They called for lower ticket  
prices, operas and ballets with wider public appeal and, 
especially, a new director with good business sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would prefer to see the house run by a philistine with the  
requisite financial acumen than by the succession of opera and 
ballet lovers who have brought a great and valuable institution to 
its knees,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Running the house actually will be a job for two directors now.  
</P>
<P>
	An artistic director still is being sought, but the house's new  
executive chief is Michael Kaiser, a former management consultant 
who gave up a successful business career to run a small ballet 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to become executive director of American Ballet  
Theater in New York, leading a remarkable financial turnaround 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a group of people that has gone through a war, and I  
want to give them hope,'' said Kaiser, the first American to run a 
major British arts organization. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Opera House struggles to regain its footing, the $362  
million renovation project continues at its 140-year-old Covent 
Garden home base, the first major renovation in a century, partly 
funded by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt the Victorian-era landmark will be even more impressive  
when it opens next year, with its additional seats, backstage 
reconstruction and air-conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The good health of its companies, however, remains far less  
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it has to survive now,'' said The Times' Morrison.  
``The country has invested so much money in it. Plus, there's the 
legacy of the 50 years of the Royal Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it has to survive. It's just a question of in what  
form.''

<HEADLINE> Both Sides in NBA Give Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Sports Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite the bitterness, insults and divisiveness  
that permeated the lockout, David Stern and Billy Hunter beat 
doomsday - if only by a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	They had had enough; it was time to cut their losses. It was  
that simple. 
</P>
<P>
	The two main combatants locked themselves inside the NBA's Fifth  
Avenue office and put an end to the lockout - just 29 hours before 
the Board of Governors would have done it for them by canceling 
what was left of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern walked away with unprecedented concessions for his owners;  
Hunter walked away with a bigger chunk of revenue for his players; 
and the game of professional basketball survived the greatest 
threat ever to its existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You started thinking there will never be an NBA again,''  
Chicago's Steve Kerr said. ``After six months, it was like there is 
not going to be a deal, these guys will never get it done. I was 
pleasantly shocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all best buddies again.''  
</P>
<P>
	That may be stretching it, but at least they're on the path  
toward reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a fight unlike anything the NBA had ever experienced --  
a commissioner determined to bring fiscal sanity to his sport and a 
union director trying to keep his splintered constituency together. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night, each was just hours away from a huge loss.  
</P>
<P>
	Stern was about to lose a legacy. No longer would he be the  
person who made the NBA, rather the one who ruined it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was about to lose his union. There was talk of Isiah  
Thomas waiting in the wings to attempt a hostile takeover, and 
players were demanding a settlement -- any settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who saw Stern on Tuesday night said there was a distinct  
sense of serenity to the man, as though he knew the end was finally 
near. He had been a lightning rod for criticism during the lockout, 
and six months of absorbing shots had caused him to lose his 
considerable temper regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who saw Hunter that night noticed that he slipped out the  
door and into a freight elevator at the union's office without 
saying a word to anyone. Besieged from all sides, with players, 
agents and his own staff questioning his strategy, and with his 
support flagging, Hunter knew it was time to settle. 
</P>
<P>
	One major obstacle was Stern's stubbornness, and on this night  
the commissioner was finally ready to give in. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter gave up his demand for 57 percent of revenues, the figure  
players received in 1997-98. The figure owners had come to abhor. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern stopped insisting on 53 percent, making a concession he  
knew would make several of the owners recoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The magic number was 55, which seemed obvious all along, and the  
rest of the compromises soon fell into place: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rookies will be tied to their teams for five years now,  
instead of the old system of three years. Never again will anyone 
have the kind of leverage Kevin Garnett used two summers ago to 
wrangle a mind-boggling $126 million extension out of the Minnesota 
Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The so-called middle-class of players will benefit from two  
different salary cap exceptions that allow teams already over the 
cap to pay more than $1 million to players who previously would 
have had to settle for the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the remaining compromises merely involved splitting the  
differences or going down a checklist and saying, ``You take that, 
I'll take this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a matter of hours, a deal was done.  
</P>
<P>
	And just a few hours later, it was ratified.  
</P>
<P>
	Outside the General Motors building, where the players had  
gathered at the offices of their law firm, it was a surreal sight 
as hundreds of office workers and pedestrians crowded around 
players, asking for autographs and celebrating the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Donald Trump had to fight his way through the throngs in  
the lobby as a euphoric rush swept through the crowd when word of 
the settlement spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see the reaction from all the people out here,'' union  
president Patrick Ewing said. ``Everybody's ready for the NBA to 
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way Stern and Hunter felt the night before.  
</P>
<P>
	And that's how they managed to avoid doomsday.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Haley Gives 49ers a Defensive Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers acted out of  
desperation in returning Charles Haley from a two-year retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	It's worked out better than anybody expected, with Haley's  
career and San Francisco's season still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just fun for me right now,'' he said. ``I don't feel like  
I have to carry the weight of the team or do spectacular things. 
All I have to do is be there to help guys, maybe relieve them. It's 
about Charles Haley trying to fit in a role, not Charles trying to 
make waves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once one of the league's most feared pass rushers before being  
slowed by injury, Haley's second chance with the 49ers came as a 
result of the defensive line's injury-riddled state. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley, 35, was on the field for 31 snaps in San Francisco's  
30-27 NFC wild-card win Sunday over the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	He exerted pressure on Brett Favre, forcing him into a  
third-quarter interception, provided run support with two tackles 
and even dropped into pass coverage a couple times when the 49ers 
called zone blitzes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles did a tremendous job,'' said Atlanta coach Dan Reeves,  
whose Falcons (14-2) are home against the 49ers (13-4) Saturday in 
a divisional playoff. ``He was a factor. You have to account for 
him. He's a smart player. If he's healthy, he's an impact football 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haley, the only player in NFL history to win five Super Bowl  
rings, spent 11 years in the league -- the first six with the 49ers. 
San Francisco lost patience with his erratic off-field behavior and 
his sometimes volatile mood swings and traded him to Dallas prior 
to the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Back problems that led to three operations caught up with him in  
1996, when he had only one sack. He was out of the game the past 
two seasons, though San Francisco nearly signed him last September 
when he worked out impressively for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Former general manager Dwight Clark ultimately vetoed Haley's  
signing back then, partly because of concerns about his back and 
partly because of his volatile history, which included run-ins with 
Steve Young and former coach George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of injuries to the defensive line and a feeble pass rush  
-- San Francisco had just five sacks in its last four regular season 
games -- changed the 49ers' mind. 
</P>
<P>
	With ends Chris Doleman and Roy Barker both playing hurt and  
tackle Bryant Young out for the season with a broken right leg, 
defensive assistant Bill McPherson last week suggested the 49ers 
call on Haley. 
</P>
<P>
	After some initial skepticism, San Francisco coach Steve  
Mariucci also bought into the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	He discussed Haley's addition with interim general manager John  
McVay and a group of veterans, including Young, and after everyone 
endorsed the plan, Haley was summoned from his home last Friday to 
join the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Junior Bryant said Haley's addition allowed the  
49ers to rotate players throughout Sunday's game against the 
Packers. He said that would be a crucial again Saturday, when the 
49ers must contend with the Falcons' Jamal Anderson, who rushed for 
an NFC-high 1,846 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``While he may have been a little rusty, he ran around and gave  
us some juice,'' Mariucci said. ``He gave us some fresh legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haley badly wanted one more chance to play.  
</P>
<P>
	``In my heart, I wanted to go out a winner,'' he said. ``When I  
got hurt, my back was out and there was just a void in me. I wanted 
to walk out of the game saying, `Hey, I gave it all I had, and I 
don't want no more,' not that other people could say, `He can't 
give no more.' I wanted to be able to say that.''

<HEADLINE> Yale Professor Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A Yale professor charged with child  
pornography has pleaded innocent to sexually assaulting a 
13-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Lasaga, 49, did not speak during his brief court  
appearance Tuesday. Lasaga, who is free on $250,000 bond, also 
faces federal child pornography charges for allegedly using his 
campus computer to collect obscene materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the geology and geophysics professor in  
December. He was charged with two counts of sexual assault, risk of 
injury to a minor and promoting a minor in an obscene performance. 
</P>
<P>
	WTNH-TV, citing police sources it did not identify, reported  
that Lasaga met the victim through a tutoring program for 
inner-city schoolchildren. The station said the boy appears in an 
obscene videotape that authorities seized from Lasaga. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasaga, who has been on Yale's staff since 1984, is on  
indefinite paid leave from the university. His arrest came after a 
graduate student noticed someone using Lasaga's computer password 
had downloaded child pornography from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	William F. Dow, Lasaga's lawyer, said the professor ``has the  
support of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like all cases, these are allegations. Just because someone  
made a claim doesn't mean there's any truth to it.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks At Record Highs; Dow Up 200 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were in record high territory at midday,  
as investors continued to pour cash rinto the market. The Dow 
industrials, Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's composite indexes were 
all at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
150.88 at 9,462.07, handily beating its previous closing record 
high of 9,374.27 set on Nov. 23. By 2 p.m. EST, The Dow had gained 
more than 200 on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 19.45 at 1,264.23, on  
track to set its second consecutive record. The technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index was up 55.59 at 2,306.86, the fourth record 
in as many trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices moved higher as investors continued to shower the market  
with new cash from yearend bonuses and sales late last year. In a 
move that heartened traders and analysts, they were expanding 
Tuesday's shopping spree in computer-related stocks to nearly all 
big companies with well-known names. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Dow industrial components were led higher by General  
Motors, up 3 5/8 at 78 1/4, American Express, up 3 1/4 at 102 9/16, and IBM, 
up 3 at 192 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Only consumer stocks were lower among the Dow components.  
Coca-Cola was off 7/16 at 68 1/8. Disney was down 1/2 at 30 1/16 after 
chairman Michael Eisner said in a letter to shareholders that new 
initiatives had dragged down the entertainment company's earnings 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a strong 9-to-5 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at 441 
million shares and up sharply from Tuesday's pace of 302.28 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The breadth of the rally caught traders' attention and fueled  
optimism that it could continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are starting to say, `well,' this is much more  
significant here, there's a lot better participation,'' said 
William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald in 
Stamford, Conn. ``I see no end, in the nearterm, in sight and it's 
going to be very difficult to determine where the bubble gets 
pricked, or how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, the Commerce Department said sales of new  
single-family homes soared 7.6 percent to a record in November, 
propelled by low interest rates, unseasonable warmth and a strong 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Deal Sought on 'Full' Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans hope to compel testimony by  
Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and other witnesses at President 
Clinton's trial, lawmakers said Wednesday as Senate leaders sparred 
over guidelines for the nation's first presidential impeachment 
proceedings in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the opening day of the 106th Congress, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., expressed optimism that agreement was near on 
a procedure for a ``full trial ... and votes on articles of 
impeachment at the end of the process.'' One GOP source, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said it would probably be February at 
the earliest before votes are taken on the president's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats vowed opposition to any plan to call witnesses, and  
insisted they had not been presented with a written proposal for 
Clinton's trial. By a vote of the GOP-controlled House last year, 
the nation's 42nd president stands accused of two articles of 
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice in 
connection with attempts to conceal his sexual relationship with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point during the day, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,  
D-S.D., said there was ``universal, unanimous opposition to 
witnesses'' among Democrats. And in polite but unmistakable terms, 
he urged members of the House to butt out of the Senate's business. 
``We didn't involve ourselves in their proceedings and it is very 
disturbing that they now seem to be intent on involving themselves 
in ours,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A largely ceremonial opening for the trial was set for Thursday,  
when Chief Justice William Rehnquist is expected in the Senate 
chamber to swear in senators as jurors for the first presidential 
impeachment trial since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee said that in  
addition to Lewinsky and Jordan, presidential secretary Betty 
Currie was likely to be on any witness list the House impeachment 
team draws up. Linda Tripp, the woman who surreptitiously taped 
numerous conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, was not, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, the emerging proposal was to give each side 
in the trial -- the House and the White House -- three to five days 
to present evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of 
that time, a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or 
either side could seek permission to summon witnesses. The Senate 
would have to approve each witness to be called by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would set final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back. 
</P>
<P>
	Well after dark Wednesday, in Lott's remote hideaway in the  
Capitol, a small group of House and Senate Republicans met with a 
few Senate Democrats to review the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, officials said they were developing a  
strategy designed to force an early Senate test vote to demonstrate 
there is not the two-thirds majority required to force Clinton's 
removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we show the two-thirds is not there, the message is it's  
just a show trial with no chance of conviction. And every day we 
can remind the public of that,'' said one White House official, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in charge of the House team, met  
privately with Lott, seeking permission to call witnesses -- despite 
the strong opposition of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans had earlier discussed a witness list as long  
as 15 names, several congressional sources said. It was not clear 
precisely how Hyde framed his request to Lott, or even whether the 
two men discussed prospective witnesses by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority leader spoke more in terms of five to seven  
witnesses, Republican sources added. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Lott said that if agreement is reached to call  
witnesses, he would want each side to justify the need for each 
person summoned and for the Senate to vote on whether to hear that 
particular person. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations came as lawmakers took the constitutional oath  
of office, some laying claim to their hard-earned seats for the 
first time. Vice President Al Gore administered the oath in Senate, 
after which lawmakers, families and guests repaired to private 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans and Democrats alike brought their  
young children into the chamber for the opening-day ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, conservative Republican Rep. J. Dennis Hastert of  
Illinois -- a genial former wrestling coach from a congressional 
district in the nation's heartland -- was elected the new speaker in 
place of the harder-edged Newt Gingrich. Hastert's supporters were 
readily identifiable by the lapel pins they wore bearing the 
inscription, ``The coach is my speaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's impeachment trumped the other events of the day.  
And only the barest of details had been settled. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Republicans had decided they wanted to  
have testimony from Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern 
whose affair with Clinton triggered an independent counsel 
investigation and subsequent impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. said Ms. Lewinsky should be  
questioned ``in limited fashion, but we don't have to go into all 
the (sexual) details.'' Much of the questioning could be on 
obstruction of justice issues, such as the attempt to find her a 
job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers said Jordan, a friend of the president who had  
contact with both him and Ms. Lewinsky, was also on the list. As 
for Mrs. Tripp, one Republican said her tapes would make her 
testimony unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women who filed affidavits in connection with the Paula  
Jones lawsuit against Clinton might also be asked to testify, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., indicated that he might want to  
hear from onetime presidential adviser Dick Morris about Clinton's 
state of mind when he asked Morris for a poll on Americans' opinion 
of his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In a postscript to last year's debate in the House, lawmakers  
voted 223-198, largely along party lines, to authorize Hyde to 
press the case against Clinton in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde is expected to formally present the articles of impeachment  
in the Senate on Thursday. A few hours later, Rehnquist will enter 
the chamber and be sworn in to preside over the trial, his oath 
probably administered by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the Senate 
president pro tem. Rehnquist would then administer an oath to all 
100 senators, who will sit as a jury to rule on Clinton's fate.

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Magnets Ease Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A preliminary study suggests there may be  
something to one popular folk remedy -- magnets really might ease 
pain in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	More research is needed, agree the physician who conducted the  
small study and an outside observer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Weintraub, a neurologist at the New York Medical  
College in Valhalla, said a group of patients with chronic foot 
pain reported improvement after wearing pads equipped with 
low-intensity magnets. 
</P>
<P>
	His study in this month's American Journal of Pain Management  
runs counter to studies that had failed to show any beneficial 
effect from magnets, which have been used for centuries on various 
ailments but without scientific proof they actually did any good. 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub began his four-month study in July 1997, using 24  
patients with chronic pain caused by diabetes as well as other 
ailments. The tests were conducted at his office in Briarcliff 
Manor and at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow. Nineteen 
patients completed the study. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first month, each person was given a pad equipped with  
magnets for one foot and a nonmagnetized pad for the other foot, 
and told to wear them 24 hours a day. They were not told which pad 
was which, and after the first month the pads were switched. 
</P>
<P>
	They described their pain levels twice daily using a five-point  
scale. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the study, nine of the 10 diabetics reported less  
pain by an average of a full point. Three of the nine nondiabetics 
had a similar result. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 millions diabetics are subject to painful burning  
sensations, numbness and tingling in the feet and hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub's study is ``a tremendous breakthrough,'' said Dr.  
Paul Rosch, president of the American Institute of Stress in 
Yonkers. Rosch, who has written about the history of magnet 
therapy, cautioned that more work is needed. ``We don't know the 
mechanism by which this works. It's all trial and error,'' he said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, ``from a statistical point of view, the sampling is  
very small. But it does work, '' he said, adding that he would now 
try the method on his own patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub also said that because his study used a relatively  
small group, it must be regarded as preliminary to further 
research.

<HEADLINE> Water Main Breaks Leave D.C. Icy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It probably would have been easier to slide  
than drive to work for many in the nation's capital Wednesday as 
authorities battled water main breaks that coated local streets 
with ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most troublesome was an eight-inch break that created  
slippery roads and snarled traffic throughout the day in the heart 
of the city's central business district. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials blamed the more than 50 breaks on temperatures in the  
single digits, old pipes and a dry summer that caused soil-shifting 
to twist the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just overwhelmed,'' said Bill Bank, spokesman for the  
District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation left motorists in a foul mood as work routines and  
schedules were disrupted. ``It has really hurt my business. People 
are missing their appointments, and I can't make any money,'' said 
taxi driver Salmon Getachew, who estimated it took him twice as 
long as usual to navigate downtown traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Three bus routes along K Street, a major downtown thoroughfare,  
were running about 25 minutes behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Bicycle messengers seemed to be taking it in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	``We ride around the traffic,'' said Durwin Davis. He avoids icy  
roads by riding on sidewalks. ``Having a bicycle is definitely an 
advantage today,'' Davis said, ``except for the cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Water and Sewer Authority brought in three outside crews to  
help repair breaks, Bank said. He said it would cost the city a lot 
but could now say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional officials said this January has had more breaks in the  
first week, 43, than any in recent years. About 1,200 miles of 
water distribution pipes interlace Washington's underground, the 
pipes averaging 50 to 60 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally we'd replace the old ones,'' the Water and Sewer  
Authority's Bank said. But he added that would be impractical: 
``You'd have to remove the city.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Young Keeps Faith in Owens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young knew better than to give  
up on Terrell Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can drop five, 10 balls in a row and I don't care. He's  
going to get the next one,'' Young said. ``He was ready for the 
next ball. It (losing faith in Owens) didn't even go through my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the ``next ball'' was a 25-yard touchdown pass  
with three seconds remaining that put the San Francisco 49ers 
(13-4) into Saturday's NFC divisional playoff at Atlanta (14-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was in awe,'' fellow receiver Jerry Rice said.  
``When Steve threw the ball down there, I saw Terrell go up and it 
was like the world just stopped for a second. I'm sure that catch 
is going to go down, just like the one that Dwight Clark caught. It 
couldn't happen to a better guy. This guy, he works hard and he's 
been very productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Young threaded the pass between three defenders, and  
before Owens made the leaping goal-line grab in traffic in Sunday's 
30-27 wild-card win over Green Bay, the third-year receiver 
struggled through a horrific outing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was stunning because Owens had excelled throughout the  
regular season, teaming with Rice and J.J. Stokes to form a 
daunting triple threat at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Owens fumbled after his first catch and he also dropped  
four passes, including one that would have given San Francisco a 
crucial first down in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it was nerves,'' receivers coach Larry Kirksey  
said. ``He was trying so hard to make something happen every time 
he touched the ball. Because of that, he was knocking the ball down 
a couple times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens agreed he made the mistake of trying too hard.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was just too hyped for the game,'' said Owens, who  
during the regular season had 67 receptions for 1,097 yards and 14 
touchdowns, all personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a game I'd been thinking about since last year, when we  
lost to them in the NFC championship. It's kind of ironic because 
last year, I left the field crying and this year I still left the 
field crying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was enjoyable. I've celebrated long enough. It's time to  
get that out of my mind. It's hard to get rid of the thought with 
all that happened, with the media and the replays, but my focus, 
our focus, is on the Falcons now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Owens has the attention of the Falcons, who beat San  
Francisco 31-19 in the most recent meeting between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's that guy they've been looking for to be the John Taylor,  
where you can't focus so much on Rice,'' Falcons safety Eugene 
Robinson said. ``But that passing game has three bona fide 
receivers. The thing that makes it go is Steve Young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, meanwhile, has been bothered for the last several weeks by  
a partially torn ligament in his right knee. Rice, who missed most 
of last season with two serious injuries to his left knee, said he 
still expects to play even though he appears to lack some of his 
explosiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been in rehabilitation for a year and a  
half,'' said Rice, who banged the right knee Nov. 15 on the 
artificial turf at the Georgia Dome. ``It's something that really 
has slowed me down a lot, but don't tell them that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm going to line up, yes, and hopefully the soreness is  
gone and I can just go out and have some fun.''

<HEADLINE> Weather Boosts Grains; Soybeans Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices surged on indications the cold and heavy  
snow in the Midwest is hindering the movement of wheat to market. 
Also pushing prices higher is talk the Russians may be about to 
enter the market for a sizable amount of U.S. wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in wheat is giving a boost to corn futures prices.  
The frigid weather in the Midwest also is expected to increase 
demand by cattle ranchers for feed grain, which also is helping 
corn prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices are higher as dry conditions continue in  
the soybean crop areas of southern Brazil and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery was 3 1/4 cents higher at $2.83 1/2 a bushel;  
March corn was 1 3/4 cents higher at $2.19 a bushel; March oats were 3/4 
cent higher at $1.09 1/2 a bushel; January soybeans were 1 3/4 cents 
higher at $5.51 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and pork futures prices were higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange as the snow and cold in the central 
states is expected to hinder the growth of hogs and cattle.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Misses Steel Plan Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of a House panel on trade warned  
President Clinton on Wednesday not to let politics influence his 
delayed strategy for curbing steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration missed Tuesday's deadline for issuing a  
report Congress requested about how to combat the rising tide of 
imported steel. Sources have indicated that a draft of the report 
is largely an update that stops short of outlining new policy 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Philip M. Crane, R-Ill., the chairman of the House Ways and  
Means subcommittee on trade, said he hoped the report's delay does 
not open the door for union interests to change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``On an issue this critical to millions of U.S. workers and  
consumers and the U.S. and global economy, I urge you to stand firm 
by not putting politics before principle in your decision-making,'' 
Crane wrote Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Asian economic crisis, imports into the  
United States reached record levels in 1998, resulting in thousands 
of layoffs and other cutbacks at steel mills across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen steel producers and their unions already have filed  
formal trade complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil, accusing 
them of illegally flooding the U.S. market with steel products at 
prices dramatically below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the steel industry, saying more jobs could be lost by the  
time rulings come out this summer, also has asked the 
administration to initiate other forms of relief, including reviews 
that could lead to quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend that fulfilling the industry's request could  
undercut the administration's desire to promote free trade 
globally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share a common agenda to boost jobs and economic growth  
here at home by opening markets for U.S. goods and services 
overseas,'' Crane said. ``We must remember that any action we take 
will set an example to troubled economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials insisted that the steel report could  
still come out this week. Officials attributed the delay to 
Clinton's desire to consult more fully with members of Congress. 
Clinton said he had a two-hour meeting on the issue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has strong support on Capitol Hill among  
steel-state lawmakers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the chairman of the Senate Steel  
Caucus, criticized the administration's inaction Wednesday. He said 
he would proposal legislation to allow courts to step in to block 
imports sold below market value. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't stopped all the steel from coming in,'' Specter  
said of administration officials. ``They have the authority to stop 
it (through such means as) quotas. They haven't done that.''

<HEADLINE> Candle Fires, Deaths Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Once reserved for special dinners and holidays,  
candles are seemingly everywhere these days -- in specialty stores 
and supermarkets that sell everything from pumpkin-scented sticks 
to colorful votives. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity may have a price. Statistics show a significant  
rise in fires, damage and death caused by candles, according to the 
Quincy-based National Fire Protection Association, which began 
compiling statistics on such blazes in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people think you just light them and blow them out,''  
said Jenny Manuche, owner of the Candlewood shop in Swampscott. 
``People don't seem to realize they're dealing with fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candles were blamed for 9,930 fires, 126 civilian deaths and  
$170.6 million in property damage nationwide in 1996, the most 
recent year for which statistics are available, the association 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That represents a 82 percent increase from the 5,460  
candle-caused fires in 1990, when numbers were at their lowest. 
That year there were 89 deaths and $62.5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no conclusive evidence explaining the rise in candle  
blazes, but fire experts and those in the candle industry say the 
potential for misuse has grown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have candles everywhere -- pillar candles, votive candles,  
candles in glass jars, candles to disguise bad odors. It's become 
part of our way of life,'' said Jennifer Mieth of the Massachusetts 
Department of Fire Services. ``Aromatherapy -- who ever heard about 
that in the '70s?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five years, the candle industry has seen sales grow  
at a rate of 10 percent to 15 percent annually, and is now a $2 
billion a year business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last 10 years or so, there's been a shift toward  
people using scented candles as part of everyday home life,'' said 
Tim O'Brien, spokesman for the Deerfield-based Yankee Candle 
Company, which had sales exceeding $175 million last year. 
``They're not just for special occasions anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candles now come in nearly every imaginable shape and scent,  
with fragrances like ``Spiced Pumpkin'' and ``Storm Watch'' filling 
more and more homes. Candle fires most often start when flames are 
left unattended. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Tuesday, a 9-year-old Louisiana boy died in a house fire  
that began when a candle fell onto a bed, igniting the bedspread. 
An Oklahoma man was killed in a New Year's Day house fire 
apparently started by a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	In Naples, Fla., a man who gave a gardenia-scented candle to his  
cancer-stricken friend last month died when the flame ignited the 
woman's mattress, burning her mobile home and trapping him inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unattended candles are really dangerous,'' said Lawrence Fire  
Chief Richard Shafer. ``It's nice to enjoy the candle, but don't 
leave it alone.''

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA and the players' union reached an  
agreement today to end the 6-month-old lockout and save what's left 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	After a secret all-night bargaining session between commissioner  
David Stern and union head Billy Hunter, the deal was struck 
sometime around 6 a.m. -- just 29 hours before the league's Board of 
Governors was set to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners' and players' negotiating committees recommended  
approving the deal, sources told The Associated Press. The players 
approved it 179-5 in a ratification vote at the union's law office 
this afternoon, a union spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A season of about 50 games will begin the first week of  
February. The six-year deal, with an NBA option for a seventh year, 
still must be put on paper and ratified before the lockout 
officially ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors will meet Thursday to vote on  
it, and the NBA will have no comment until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable,'' Milwaukee Bucks coach  
George Karl said. ``It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach. 
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I 
love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of revenues in the fourth,  
fifth and sixth years of the agreement, sources told the AP. 
Players would get 57 percent if the league exercises its option for 
the seventh year. In the first three years, there is no limit on 
the percentage of revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also means Michael Jordan must now decide whether  
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said. 
``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows  
any player to sign for 105 percent of his previous salary. That 
means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, could get about 
$34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can offer him anything close to that amount.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to six years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The annual allowable salary increases will be 12 percent for  
players with so-called Larry Bird rights -- those free agents 
re-signed by a team without regard to the salary cap -- and 10 
percent for others. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Changes to free agency timing rules will be phased in, with  
free agents counting 200, 250 or 300 percent against their old 
team's salary cap until that team re-signs them or renounces their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, although the exact amounts weren't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	No professional sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary  
before, but the NBA had been pushing for one throughout the 
lockout. The union initially refused, then suggested a luxury tax 
be charged to any owner who signed a player for more than $15 
million. The league kept holding out, and eventually the players 
relented. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is finalized and the lockout is lifted, it will  
unleash a three- to four-week frenzy of activity with teams 
scrambling to fill rosters, make trades and sign some of the 200 
free agents on the market while also holding abbreviated training 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have eight months of NBA basketball squeezed  
into four months, with trades and signings,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman,  
Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, Rod Strickland and Damon 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it will be very busy,'' said agent Mark  
Bartelstein. ``We've got a lot of free agents, so we've got to find 
them homes and teams. Get other guys into camps. Get up and 
rolling. I'm sure I'll probably talk to a lot of teams today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide an  
estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone won. Both sides lost on it,'' Indiana  
Pacers guard Fred Hoiberg said. ``I think it will take some time to 
get the game back to where it was. Hopefully, we can get back to 
work soon and put a good product on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors had scheduled a meeting for 11  
a.m. Thursday, and Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik had 
said they would recommend canceling the rest of the season if an 
agreement wasn't reached. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players began arriving in New York on Tuesday for a  
scheduled vote on whether to support the position of their 
negotiating committee, which had recommended that players reject 
the owners' final offer. At least 200 players had been expected to 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The league already had an offer on the table allowing the union  
to reopen the agreement if any other sport's average salary 
surpasses that of NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, in effect since July 1, caused the NBA to miss  
games because of a labor dispute for the first time in its history. 
The first three months of the season had been scrapped and players 
had lost about $500 million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said  
Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz. ``Neither side is coming out of 
this thing looking good.''

<HEADLINE> Phillips To Cut 1,400 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) -- Citing the continuing slump in the  
oil industry, Phillips Petroleum Co. is eliminating about 1,400 
jobs, or about 8.1 percent of its work force, in a bid to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The employment cuts announced today include 850 in the United  
States and 550 from foreign operations. About 400 jobs are expected 
to be cut in Bartlesville, the company's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beginning next week, we'll begin to notify employees,''  
spokesman Rob Phillips said today. ``We'll continue the process 
several months before the 1,400 positions are eliminated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company employes 17,200 worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Allen, chairman and chief executive, said the cost-cutting  
effort is expected to produce annual savings of about $230 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the job eliminations, the company said it has  
reduced its capital expenditures budget for 1999 to $1.5 billion. 
That is about $650 million, or 31 percent, lower than in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the reduction will primarily affect its  
exploration and production segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said that once a joint venture between Phillips and  
Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. is completed, more cost reductions 
will be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies are combining to create a new company, Diamond  
66, with more than 12,000 gas stations and convenience stores in 36 
states and Canada. Phillips previously announced job cuts as a 
result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said Phillips expects to report a loss for the fourth  
quarter of 1998, primarily due to anticipated special charges due 
to low prices and margins. The charges include after-tax estimates 
of $222 million for oil and gas property impairments; $71 million 
for the write-off of costs associated with the Tyonek Deep prospect 
in Kenai, Alaska; and $46 million of severance costs.

	Details of Clinton Trial Discussed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials made an unexpected visit  
tonight to the Capitol to discuss ground rules for the presidential 
impeachment proceedings. Earlier today, Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott expressed optimism that agreement was near on a 
procedure for a ``full trial.'' Lawmakers said that House 
Republicans hope to compel testimony by Monica Lewinsky, Vernon 
Jordan and other witnesses at President Clinton's trial. Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Democrats were unanimously opposed 
to calling witnesses.

	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu poses  
a danger to Israel, a key newcomer to Israeli politics declared 
today as he formally launched his campaign to become Israel's next 
leader. Former army chief Amnon Lipkin-Shahak staked out centrist 
positions on most issues and said he would try to heal the deep 
rifts in Israeli society. Polls suggest that, despite his charm and 
an impressive 36-year military record, Lipkin-Shahak faces a tough 
battle. He is entering an already crowded field of nearly a dozen 
contenders.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The 6-month-old NBA lockout finally came to an  
end today after an all-night bargaining session between 
commissioner David Stern and players union head Billy Hunter. The 
season will begin in the first week of February, with teams playing 
about 50 games each, some 30 fewer than a normal season. The 
agreement was reached just 29 hours before the NBA Board of 
Governors was to vote on canceling the remainder of the season.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A top aide to the man accused of masterminding  
the U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa was indicted today, joining 11 
others accused of a conspiracy against the United States. Mamdouh 
Mahmud Salim was indicted by a grand jury in U.S. Court in 
Manhattan. Salim, alleged to be the finance chief for Osama bin 
Laden, was brought last month to the United States, three months 
after his arrest in Germany on a U.S. warrant charging him with 
murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction in an 
international plot to kill Americans.

	US Says It Shared Iraq Intelligence

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State Department Spokesman James Rubin  
acknowledges there was ``intelligence sharing'' on Iraq with the 
special U.N. weapons team. But Rubin said it was not done with the 
purpose of undermining President Saddam Hussein's government. They 
also shared technology as part of the effort to inspect suspect 
sites and possibly uncover hidden caches of biological and chemical 
weapons, Rubin said. Newspaper reports have suggested that UNSCOM 
helped eavesdrop on sensitive Iraqi government communications.

	No Deaths on US Airlines in '98  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after the ValuJet and TWA 800  
crashes raised questions about safety, U.S. airlines closed out 
1998 with a little noticed milestone: None of their 615 million 
passengers died in an accident. It appears to be the first year 
since the dawn of commercial aviation for such an achievement. In 
1998, no passenger died in an accident involving a scheduled U.S. 
commercial airplane anywhere in the world.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Declining prices and a robust economy led  
Americans to buy 15.6 million cars and light trucks last year, the 
most in 13 years and the second highest total ever, based on 
automakers' final results released today. For the year, foreign 
automakers made the biggest gains: Asian companies were up 4 
percent while the Europeans, which have the smallest share of the 
U.S. market, improved 29 percent. GM, Ford and the American 
products of DaimlerChrysler combined for just a 1 percent increase.

No. 10 St. John's. Johnny Hemsley added 19 points as the Hurricanes 
(9-2, 3-0 Big East) held off a frenzied comeback attempt by the Red 
Storm (12-3, 3-1), who had a nine-game winning streak snapped. Ron 
Artest and Bootsy Thornton scored 17 points each for St. John's.

<HEADLINE> Tougher Va. Right-to-Die law Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A state lawmaker who unsuccessfully fought  
a woman's bid to end the life of her brain-damaged husband is 
planning legislation that would toughen Virginia's right-to-die 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	State Del. Robert Marshall, a Republican, is expected to  
introduce legislation next week that he says would have saved Hugh 
Finn's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn, a former Louisville television news anchorman, suffered  
severe brain damage in a 1995 car accident. He died Oct. 9 in a 
Manassas nursing home, eight days after his wife, Michele, had his 
feeding tube withdrawn. She had been told that Finn was in a 
persistent vegetative state and would never regain consciousness or 
any higher brain function. 
</P>
<P>
	Her decision was legal. But Hugh Finn's family, Marshall and  
even Gov. Jim Gilmore went to court to make Mrs. Finn keep the 
feeding tube in. The courts sided with Mrs. Finn. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill promoted by Marshall would establish a clinical  
designation called a minimally conscious state for people who 
showed signs of consciousness, however small. Food and water could 
not be withheld from people in such a state. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also give other relatives veto power over the  
primary guardian's decisions and set guidelines for the steps that 
must be followed to declare someone in a persistent vegetative 
state.

<HEADLINE> Imports Flood U.S. Steel Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has missed a  
congressional deadline for coming up with a plan to combat a rising 
flood of imported steel into the United States in the wake of the 
Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials insisted that the report could still  
come out this week. They explained the reason for the delay was a 
desire by President Clinton to consult more fully with members of 
Congress interested in the issue before releasing the report. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry officials and members of Congress said the delay  
reflected divisions within the administration over two camps -- one 
arguing for tough protectionist measures sought by the industry and 
its union and an opposing camp that is arguing that such measures 
would run counter to the administration's efforts to help countries 
hurt by the global financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., inserted language in the budget bill  
last fall ordering the administration to tell Congress by Tuesday 
what its plans were to cope with the sharp rise in steel imports 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	One administration official, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said the report in its present form is about 20 pages 
long and essentially is a status report showing what actions have 
been taken so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., has been urging the  
administration to initiate its own steel protection cases against a 
larger number of countries than the three cases filed by the 
industry against Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers expressed unhappiness Tuesday about the missed  
deadline and the indications the administration will shy away from 
more dramatic steps to curb imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not interested in a status report because I already know  
where we have been and where we are. I want this report to show 
where we are going,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said unless the administration takes  
more aggressive action, ``it sends a signal to the rest of the 
world to let dumping continue, which would be very damaging to the 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been split between a desire to help a key  
domestic industry and union workers whose jobs are endangered and 
concerns that raising protectionist barriers would represent a 
setback for hardhit Asian nations and Russia. These nations are 
hoping to boost sales in the huge U.S. market to cope with severe 
recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade deficit is expected to set records this year and  
next because the Asian economic crisis has cut into American 
exports of manufactured goods and farm products while boosting 
imports, in part because the currency devaluations in many 
countries have made foreign products cheaper for U.S. consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for action out of the administration, not  
reports,'' said William Klinefelter, Washington representative of 
the United Steelworkers of America union. He said 5,000 
steelworkers have already gotten layoff notices and another 20,000 
are working reduced hours because of increased imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has until Feb. 12 to issue a preliminary  
ruling in the original dumping cases. Many expect the industry will 
file its own cases against more countries if, as expected, Commerce 
issues a favorable ruling next month.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator Rules for Don Nelson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An arbitrator has ruled in favor of former  
coach Don Nelson in a $1.56 million dispute over his firing by the 
Golden State Warriors in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The case also shed new light on the team's controversial trade  
of forward Chris Webber that season, a move blamed on Nelson's poor 
relationship with the player. 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitrator, Lance Liebman, a Columbia law professor  
appointed by the NBA, ruled Tuesday that money Nelson was paid at 
the time of his firing was for work he had already done in the 
previous two years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors contended the payments were for the next three  
years and that Nelson had to repay them out of his earnings from 
his next job as coach of the New York Knicks. Nelson was fired by 
the Knicks in March 1996, was hired by the Dallas Mavericks as 
general manager in February 1997 and also became their coach last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired as coach and GM of the Warriors in February 1995  
after a season-long slump marked by the team's inability to sign 
Webber, a star rookie for Golden State the previous season. Before 
Nelson's firing, Webber was traded to Washington for forward Tom 
Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices, a deal that failed 
to revive the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	During the arbitration hearing, Nelson testified that the team's  
official reason for the trade -- animosity between him and Webber, 
and the new owner's decision to back the coach over the player -- 
was false. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, according to a transcript, Nelson said Webber would  
have signed for $53 million over seven years, but owner Chris Cohan 
drew the line at $50 million and instead ordered a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson testified the trade he initially worked out with  
Washington would have brought the Warriors rookie forward Juwann 
Howard, in addition to Gugliotta and a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great deal because I considered both of those players  
better than Webber,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Webber, who had veto rights, objected to the trade  
because he wanted to play with Howard, his former college teammate 
at Michigan. Nelson said he advised Cohan to ``hold his feet to the 
fire'' and insist on Howard but Cohan refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said the Warriors ordered him to take the blame for the  
Webber situation at a news conference announcing the trade. He 
argued that the order violated his contract and entitled him to 
keep the money he was paid at the time of his firing -- $562,000 in 
salary payments and a $1 million lump sum. The payments brought his 
earnings to $3.6 million for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitrator did not rule on the breach-of-contract claim and  
instead decided that the $1 million amounted to a buyout of the 
contract, which could have been extended for another three years. 
The end of the legal relationship between Nelson and the Warriors 
also eliminated any requirement that he repay them from his 
earnings elsewhere over that period, Liebman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warriors spokesman Raymond Ridder said the team had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Nelson's lawyer, John D. O'Connor, said Nelson was gratified by  
the ruling but regretted the public misperception of the causes of 
the Warriors' decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don continues to love the Bay area and its fans, and feels he  
could have brought them a championship if he had been permitted a 
reasonable degree of control over this situation,'' O'Connor said 
in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Atypical End to Atypical Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- These weren't your typical union workers coming  
to ratify a contract. Then again, it wasn't a typical lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 NBA players descended through a sea of cameras,  
tourists and workers on lunch break Wednesday to learn details of 
the proposed deal that brought an end to a nasty six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The players wore white furs, leather jackets and diamond stud  
earrings along with the big blue buttons urging unity between the 
NBA and the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans squealed at the sight of Shaquille O'Neal and Charles  
Barkley. And commissioner David Stern came to try to heal the 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all family again,'' New Jersey's Jayson Williams said.  
``Guys are wearing buttons with `Solid' written on them, showing 
both sides are together again. This game won't have to go through 
something like this again for seven more years. And hopefully, I'll 
be retired then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players who flew in from all over the country late Tuesday and  
early Wednesday woke up at their hotels expecting to go to their 
union's law office next to the famous FAO Schwarz toy store to vote 
on whether they supported the negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But as they shuttled over to the General Motors Building, where  
the lobby looks less like a union hall and more like Kenny 
Anderson's garage before the lockout forced him to reduce his fleet 
of luxury cars, they began to hear news of a deal from fans and 
taxi radios. 
</P>
<P>
	From the scores of fans desperately seeking autographs from any  
player -- from Kobe Bryant to Austin Croshere -- it appears as if the 
hard feelings over the lockout will end someday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the players know that it will take more than  
rim-rocking dunks and ankle-breaking crossover dribbles to win back 
NBA fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I don't care,'' said one fan while checking out  
his loot of autographs. ``I'll watch because I'm a basketball fan, 
but I'd rather watch college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players don't blame fans who might be bitter about a dispute  
over how to divide $2 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably will be lukewarm at first and some may be  
hostile,'' Chicago's Steve Kerr said. ``I can't blame them one bit. 
They are the ones who suffered the most during this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mood among the players in the 25th-floor conference room was  
calm as they gathered for their ratification vote -- in sharp 
contrast to the divisions that built among factions of players the 
last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a contentious vote over whether players supported  
their union, they voted on whether to approve the new deal. It 
passed, 179-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Williams, one of the union's biggest critics, talked  
peacefully with union president Patrick Ewing and negotiating 
committee member Alonzo Mourning -- whom Williams criticized for the 
union's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the players ratified the proposal, Stern and deputy  
commissioner Russ Granik arrived to begin the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that both sides had to make concessions if we  
wanted to play again,'' said Vancouver's Shareef Abdur-Rahim, a 
second-year player who stands to lose millions of dollars under the 
deal. ``Regardless of how much I make, I'm making more money than I 
could ever without playing. It's good to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the only outward sign of a labor dispute was when  
locked-out ABC technicians tried to disrupt interviews by 
replacement crews by holding flyers in front of cameras and yelling 
``Don't talk to ABC scabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the details of their dispute, because I have my  
own situation to worry about,'' said Phil Barreca, a locked-out ABC 
electrician. ``The levels of money are obviously different, but it 
is still a classic labor dispute.''

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry Has Strong Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- 1998 proved to be a surprisingly strong year for  
the auto industry, as U.S. sales surged with the economy and the 
intense competition that generated deep discounts for new cars and 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans bought 15.6 million cars and light trucks last year,  
the most in 12 years, the third-highest total ever and a 3 percent 
improvement over 1997. Figures released Wednesday also show 
automakers ended the year with a bang, with December sales up 7 
percent compared with the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the last major automakers who reported their results, No.  
1 General Motors Corp., which is still dealing with the effect of 
last summer's strikes on its inventory, managed a 3 percent 
improvement last month. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. both 
posted double-digit gains. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, foreign automakers made the biggest gains: Asian  
companies were up 4 percent while the Europeans, which have the 
smallest share of the U.S. market, improved 29 percent thanks to a 
wide array of new models. GM, Ford Motor Co. and the American 
products of DaimlerChrysler AG combined for just a 1 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The totals were better than anyone anticipated a year ago. The  
15.6 million vehicles sold were third to the 16.3 million in 1986 
and 15.7 million in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous year,'' said Mike DiGiovanni, head of  
market research at GM. ``No one I know forecast that level of 
sales. There's not much to complain about in terms of how the 
industry's performing right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there was cause for concern behind the numbers. Much of the  
increased demand was due to rebates, cut-rate financing and other 
incentives that reduced transaction prices. GM began the rise in 
incentives in April with its ``loyalty coupon'' program for 
previous customers after dismal first-quarter sales results. 
</P>
<P>
	The ploy worked, but incentives remained high the rest of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales in 1998 were more dependent on incentives than sales of  
any of the past three or four years,'' said analyst Susan Jacobs of 
Jacobs &AMP; Associates in Rutherford, N.J. ``The need for incentives 
is flagging some emerging softness in the market, even though the 
economy's strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs noted that the industry placed discounts even on some of  
the vehicles it redesigned for '99 shortly after they were 
introduced in the fall, something that's rarely been done in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reached a point where the ink wasn't even dry on the '99  
price increases before we had incentives,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most automakers are optimistic about 1999. They expect  
sales to be down slightly, but still near the 15 million level 
where they have been for an unprecedented five consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for light trucks, the classification that includes sport  
utility vehicles, pickups and minivans, continued to surge at the 
expense of cars. For the year, truck sales were up 8 percent while 
car sales fell 2 percent. Trucks represented a record 48 percent of 
the market; buyers chose more trucks than cars in November -- the 
first month that has happened. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's truck sales set a company record and surpassed the 2  
million mark for the third consecutive year, despite the 
strikes-related slowdown in production and the fall plant 
changeover for GM's redesigned full-size pickup, its biggest 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes also were blamed for causing GM's market share to  
fall to 29.2 percent from 31.1 percent in 1997. DiGiovanni 
estimated that the strikes cost GM about 1.3 share points last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is producing its new pickups at full speed, but demand has  
been so strong that inventories remain half of what they were a 
year ago, DiGiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker wants to get its market share up to 30 percent in  
the first quarter and has set what it calls a ``stretch goal'' of 
32 percent for the year. ``It will be difficult to attain 32, but 
it gives us a target to shoot for,'' DiGiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's sales increased 19 percent for December and 11 percent  
for the year. Honda was up 6 percent in December and 7 percent for 
the year. Both automakers posted strong gains in sales of their 
SUVs and minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there are indications of a gradual slowdown in '99,  
the sales surge in December fueled one of the industry's best-ever 
yearend closeouts,'' said Yale Gieszl, a Toyota vice president.

<HEADLINE> Black Farmers Get $375M Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Charles Harris sows but he does not always  
reap. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last 16 years he has toiled in his fields of cotton and  
soybeans, concerned about weather, weeds, pests and low prices. At 
53, he said he has developed an irregular heartbeat that doctors 
attribute to worry, and he filed for bankruptcy last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was able to plant his 1998 crop only after the neighbors  
he rents the land from postponed collecting his bills. 
</P>
<P>
	He said not all his colleagues live so close to the edge.  
</P>
<P>
	``White farmers who started when I did are well off. They've  
done well,'' Harris said. ``They went through the same steps as me 
and a lot of them wondered why I wasn't progressing. I know how to 
farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government announced Tuesday that Harris and hundreds of  
other black farmers who say federal officials unfairly denied them 
loans and subsidies because of their race will share $375 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement ends a discrimination lawsuit filed in 1997 and  
scheduled to go to trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, as many as 3,000 farmers would get tax-free  
payments of $50,000 each, and their government debts would be 
forgiven. The average debt for farmers involved in the lawsuit is 
$75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to announce a historic agreement for both the USDA  
and -- I believe -- for our country,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an agreement that will close a painful chapter in USDA's  
history and open a more constructive front in our efforts to see 
this department emerge as the federal civil rights leader in the 
21st century,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Washington gave preliminary approval to the  
deal Tuesday and final approval is expected in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit covers claims from 1983 -- the year the Reagan  
administration disbanded the department's office of civil rights -- 
to 1997, the year after the office was restored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to see this come to a conclusion, but I am not  
happy about the way it concluded,'' said Willie Head, a 
third-generation farmer from Pavo, about 200 miles south of 
Atlanta. ``It's not going to solve our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Head said his award will barely pay off a $42,000 lien on his  
land and buy seed and supplies this year. And he said 
discrimination has already caused many young rural blacks to give 
up on farming. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has devastated me in my career and also the younger  
generation like my son,'' said Head, 44. ``He does not want to farm 
now, so it means there won't be anyone to carry on the legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Head, a business school graduate who grows tobacco and  
vegetables on 150 acres, said his situation is typical among black 
farmers, many of whom have been ``farming with the tips of our 
fingernails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some plaintiffs, hoping for a larger settlement, wanted the case  
to go to trial, but didn't because they feared the Agriculture 
Department would appeal and delay the case for years, Head said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, who are near independent settlements with the  
Agriculture Department or who have documented cases of 
discrimination, can opt out and have their cases settled by an 
arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called the settlement an important step in  
``ongoing efforts to rid the Agriculture Department of 
discriminatory behavior and redress any harm that has been caused 
by past discrimination against African-American family farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Head said the damage has been done. Black farmers shouldn't  
count on government help in the future, he said. Head founded a 
cooperative of black vegetable growers in 1995 and is considering 
starting a black farmer-owned credit union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be dependent on anybody,'' he said. ``We  
don't want our children to be dependent on anybody. We're going to 
have to form our own markets so people will buy from us.''

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Promote Palmer for Head Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Offensive coordinator Chris Palmer of  
the Jacksonville Jaguars isn't allowed to talk about job offers 
that are expected to come his way once the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jacksonville players, however, have no such restrictions --  
or any qualms about hyping him as one of the top head-coaching 
candidates in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone deserves a head coaching job in this league, whether  
it's this year, next year or in years to come, it's Chris Palmer,'' 
Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell said Wednesday. ``He's got a great 
football mind. Players respect him, which is huge, and he always 
gets us ready to go as an offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like all assistants on the Jaguars, Palmer adheres to Tom  
Coughlin's ``One Voice'' rule, which essentially puts a muzzle on 
every coach but Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Palmer, 49, is still something of a mystery to fans  
of the Eagles, Bears, Browns and Ravens, among the teams that have 
expressed interest in him becoming their coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The players like his personality. He can be quite a taskmaster  
on the practice field and in the meeting room, but is also known as 
something of a prankster and a guy who can cut through the tension 
when things get tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pretty laid back,'' said running back Fred Taylor. ``But  
you never know, if he became a head coach, you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uptight about possible distractions as his team prepares for a  
second-round playoff game at the New York Jets, Coughlin has 
basically sent out the message that his assistants are out of 
bounds -- to both media and other teams -- until the playoffs are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know I can't say anything,'' Palmer told a group of  
reporters who cornered him after last Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, offensive coordinators Gary Kubiak of the Broncos and  
Brian Billick of the Vikings have interviewed for the Browns 
vacancy, while Falcons offensive line coach Art Shell is planning 
to go early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their expansion agreement, the Browns are allowed to  
interview assistants whose teams are still in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Jimmy Smith said waiting a week or more to find out  
more about Palmer might be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we go up and get a victory against the Jets, you've got to  
believe he'll get a head-coaching job somewhere,'' Smith said. 
``I'm sure he would rather be preparing for a Super Bowl than 
interviewing for a head-coaching job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer's resume looks like that of a coach ready to take another  
step forward. 
</P>
<P>
	This is his ninth year in the league.  
</P>
<P>
	Since he took over for Kevin Gilbride after the 1996 season, the  
Jaguars have averaged 24 points. That, despite the playing six of 
those games without Brunell. 
</P>
<P>
	Four different quarterbacks -- Rob Johnson, Steve Matthews, Jamie  
Martin and Jonathan Quinn -- have started in his place. The Jaguars 
went 3-2 in those games and averaged 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``That all falls back on Chris Palmer,'' Smith said. ``I mean,  
yeah, we've got good receivers, good offensive linemen, and a good 
running game. But it's totally different when you're talking about 
losing a quarterback. He's done a good job preparing those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer spent three seasons working in the run-and-shoot system  
with the Houston Oilers. From 1993-96, he was at New England. The 
final season he worked as Bill Parcells' quarterbacks coach and 
helped retool Drew Bledsoe's mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the ability to be a head coach,'' Parcells said. ``You  
alter the system somewhat to the people you have, but I think I 
know what (Coughlin) believes. And what you see on the field is 
what he believes in, combined with the intricacies that Chris can 
bring to the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin has been reluctant to comment on the possibility of  
Palmer leaving. Pressed on the topic, however, he endorsed the 
coach he would hate to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very thorough, and he'll be an outstanding coach,''  
Coughlin said. ``He's doing a great job here.''

<HEADLINE> Okla. Executes Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- A twice-convicted murderer who said he  
likely would have killed again had he remained free was executed by 
injection early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Walter Castro Sr., 37, was declared dead at 12:22 a.m. at  
the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. He was the third killer executed 
in Oklahoma in a month and the 14th since the death penalty was 
reinstated in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Juries condemned Castro in the unrelated murders of two women,  
but one death penalty was later overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	He was executed for the April 18, 1983, death of Beulah Grace  
Sissons Cox, 31, near Stillwater. Castro, who was hitchhiking, 
stole her car at gunpoint and later shot her in the head several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	About three months later, Castro stabbed Rhonda Pappan, 29, to  
death while robbing the restaurant she owned in Ponca City. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview, Castro said he isn't sure why he killed  
the women. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't been caught and stopped, I probably would have  
killed someone else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court rejected Castro's last appeal more than a  
month ago, and the state Pardon and Parole Board denied him 
clemency last month.

<HEADLINE>  Plushenko Wins Russia Skating Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Yevgeny Plushenko landed seven triple jumps  
Wednesday to win the Russian Figure Skating Championships, beating 
several rivals who failed to complete quadruple jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old, who was world junior champion last year, failed  
to execute a quad that opened his program, but was perfect on a 
succession of triples. 
</P>
<P>
	He completed his routine with a triple salchow and got mostly  
5.8s from the judges for both technical merit and artistic 
presentation, allowing him to move up from third place after the 
short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko already has qualified for the Grand Prix finals that  
will be held in his hometown of St. Petersburg in March. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Alexei Yagudin finished second, performing seven  
triples, but also failing on a quad. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Urmanov, first after the short program, started his final  
program with a quad, but missed the landing and never fully 
recovered. He finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion, missed all of last season  
with a groin injury, but he made his return this season a rewarding 
one with several strong performances. He won the Cup of Russia, 
finished second at the Goodwill Games and third at Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pairs competition, Olympic silver medalists Yelena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze used a slow but solid routine to 
win their first national title. Ice dance world champions Angelika 
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov won with a new routine, which used 
only drums and percussion instruments.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai To Take Over LG Semicon Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- LG Semicon Co. agreed Wednesday to a  
takeover by rival Hyundai Group that would create the world's 
second-largest computer memory chip maker, government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai and LG, the nation's largest and third largest  
conglomerates, initially agreed in September to merge their 
chip-making subsidiaries but talks had stalled because of a dispute 
over who should take control of the merged company. The merger aims 
to cut out overlapping investments and boost competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	LG chairman Koo Bon-moo backed down Wednesday and agreed to a  
merger led by Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. when he met with 
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, the president's office said in 
a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim considered the planned merger crucial to boosting foreign  
confidence in the country's effort to restructure its bloated 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``To avoid becoming an obstacle in industrial restructuring, we  
have decided to hand over 100 percent of our stake in LG Semicon 
Co. to Hyundai Electronics Industry Co.,'' the LG conglomerate said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The LG parent company currently owns 71 percent of LG Semicon  
through its subsidiaries. The rest of the company is owned by 
minority shareholders, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has urged LG Semicon to accept a U.S. consulting  
firm's recommendation that Hyundai Electronics Industry become the 
majority shareholder in the new entity. 
</P>
<P>
	When LG Semicon refused to accept that recommendation last week  
and even threatened to file a libel suit against 
Massachusetts-based consulting firm Arthur D. Little Inc., 
state-controlled banks held the company responsible for foiling the 
merger and halted fresh loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government further threatened to order banks to call in the  
existing loans also if LG Semicon continued to resist the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The LG-Hyundai merger, if realized, would create a company with  
17 percent of the world memory chip market. South Korea's Samsung 
Electronics Co. is the largest such company, with a 20 percent 
global share. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding  
during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for the country's 
current financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim is urging the nation's top five conglomerates to  
merge or swap some of their overlapping subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> For Bulls, Is It Rebuild or Return? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan's a maybe. Same for Scottie  
Pippen. There aren't even enough guys under contract to hold 
practice. As for the coach, he still has to ditch the 
``in-waiting'' tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to life after the NBA lockout, Chicago Bulls style.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement Wednesday to end the six-month lockout is a relief  
for teams and players alike. For the six-time NBA champions, 
however, it's also a headache. Forget about getting a team in 
shape. The Bulls need to get a team first. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to return to normal business operations,'' Bulls  
spokesman Tom Smithburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	With nine of the 12 players on last year's playoff roster being  
free agents -- Ron Harper is the only starter under contract -- the 
Bulls are at Jordan's mercy. If he decides to come back, Pippen, 
Dennis Rodman and the rest of the gang probably will, too, and make 
a run for their seventh championship of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	But if His Airness decides to trade in his shorts for bad golf  
pants, it means a massive rebuilding effort. And the Bulls aren't 
likely to do that with last year's aging lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bulls have a difficult task. They have to sign 10 guys,  
and who knows who they will be,'' said free agent Steve Kerr, whose 
last-second shot won the Bulls their 1997 championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan all but announced his retirement at a golf tournament in  
July, saying he'd make his final decision when the lockout ended. 
His relationships with Krause and chairman Jerry Reinsdorf are 
strained, and former coach Phil Jackson's departure didn't help. 
Jordan once said he wouldn't play for anyone but Jackson, and 
Pippen said in August he thought both he and Jordan were done in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan is famous for his flip-flops, and he's already backed  
off his nobody-but-Jackson stance. Tim Floyd, Chicago's 
coach-in-waiting, said the Bulls planned to call Jackson one last 
time to ask him to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to go back to talking about Michael first,''  
Floyd said. ``If that does happen, which is the best-case scenario, 
we can really try to put a team together that can contend for a 
seventh championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even his agent, David Falk, said he doesn't know what Jordan  
will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no gut feeling on it,'' he said Wednesday. ``Michael is  
going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants to do and then 
make an informed decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of another championship might be enough to entice  
Jordan's return, and Floyd has promised to keep things just as 
Jackson left them -- right down to the triangle offense and 
punishing defense that have been a trademark of Chicago's 
championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also can offer Jordan more money than anybody else.  
Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows any 
player to sign for 105 percent of his previous salary. That means 
Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, could get about $34.7 
million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember Chicago is not a basketball town -- it's a  
Jordan town,'' said Bob Bilina, a Chicago resident. ``With Jordan 
gone, the United Center will be half full and we will all start 
watching hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has long felt underappreciated by the Bulls because of a  
contract that paid him a paltry $2.7 million last season. He won't 
get any more money from the Bulls, at least not this year, with the 
new contract allowing any team to pay him a maximum of $14 million 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulls can raise that salary 12 percent each following  
year, compared with 10 percent increases from other teams. That 
might not sound like much, but additional 2 percent increases every 
year over, say, five years can add up. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Pippen was a hot commodity when the season ended,  
teams may be more wary of him after he underwent surgery last 
summer to repair herniated discs in his back. He had similar 
surgery 10 years ago, and his back was so bad during the NBA Finals 
that he needed cortisone shots. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Jimmy Sexton, said when Pippen had surgery that it  
shouldn't affect his game, but no one's seen him play since then. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Bulls coach, don't expect Jackson back, no matter how  
many times the Bulls offer him a job. He laughed when Reinsdorf 
said Floyd would be Chicago's new coach if Jackson didn't want the 
job, and his agent, Todd Musburger, has said time and again that if 
Jackson does coach again, it won't be for the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: No Call Yet on Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The basketball world will have to wait to find  
out if Michael Jordan is returning to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said 
today. ``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who led the Bulls to their sixth championship of the  
decade last June, had said he would wait until the end of the 
lockout to announce whether he will retire. 
</P>
<P>
	At 36, Jordan remains the game's best player. He is a free agent  
and can sign with any team, but the Bulls can offer him far more 
money than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new collective bargaining agreement, a  
grandfather clause allows any player to sign for 105 percent of his 
previous salary. That means Jordan, who made about $33 million last 
year, can get about $34.7 million from the Bulls should be choose 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's whereabouts were not immediately known. He has been  
reported to be in the Bahamas recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs to see what the rules of the new agreement are so he  
can see what the big picture looks like,'' Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he expects Jordan to do, Falk relied: ``I have no gut  
feeling on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to make whatever decision makes him happy, and I'll  
support whatever decision he makes,'' Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other members of the Bulls are free agents, including  
Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley and Steve Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has said he would never play for another coach other than  
Phil Jackson, and the Bulls have said they will make one more 
effort to get Jackson to return before handing the coaching job to 
Tim Floyd.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai To Take Over LG Semicon Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- LG Semicon Co. agreed Wednesday to a  
takeover by rival Hyundai Group that would create the world's 
second-largest computer memory chip maker, government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai and LG, the nation's largest and third largest  
conglomerates, initially agreed in September to merge their 
chip-making subsidiaries but talks had stalled because of a dispute 
over who should take control of the merged company. The merger aims 
to cut out overlapping investments and boost competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	LG chairman Koo Bon-moo backed down Wednesday and agreed to a  
merger led by Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. when he met with 
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, the president's office said in 
a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim considered the planned merger crucial to boosting foreign  
confidence in the country's effort to restructure its bloated 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``To avoid becoming an obstacle in industrial restructuring, we  
have decided to hand over 100 percent of our stake in LG Semicon 
Co. to Hyundai Electronics Industry Co.,'' the LG conglomerate said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The LG parent company currently owns 71 percent of LG Semicon  
through its subsidiaries. The rest of the company is owned by 
minority shareholders, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has urged LG Semicon to accept a U.S. consulting  
firm's recommendation that Hyundai Electronics Industry become the 
majority shareholder in the new entity. 
</P>
<P>
	When LG Semicon refused to accept that recommendation last week  
and even threatened to file a libel suit against 
Massachusetts-based consulting firm Arthur D. Little Inc., 
state-controlled banks held the company responsible for foiling the 
merger and halted fresh loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government further threatened to order banks to call in the  
existing loans also if LG Semicon continued to resist the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The LG-Hyundai merger, if realized, would create a company with  
17 percent of the world memory chip market. South Korea's Samsung 
Electronics Co. is the largest such company, with a 20 percent 
global share. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding  
during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for the country's 
current financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim is urging the nation's top five conglomerates to  
merge or swap some of their overlapping subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Cal. Gov. Vows To Clean Up Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In the first state-of-the-state  
address by a Democrat in 16 years, Gov. Gray Davis pledged 
Wednesday to reorganize or even close chronically ailing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said 200 under-performing schools will be selected each  
year to get more money and other help. Those that shape up after 
two years will be eligible for more money. Those not making the 
grade could have administrators fired, teachers reassigned or even 
be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When an NFL coach has one losing season after another, he gets  
replaced. Period. End of the story,'' Davis said. ``I say we should 
be just as decisive when our children's future is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' speech was dominated by proposals for improving  
California's 8,000 public schools, such as $444 million in new 
funding and having parents sign a contract promising to read to 
their children and assist on homework. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also promised to ease traffic, give cities more money to  
hire police officers, control suburban sprawl, stiffen the state 
ban on assault weapons and usher in a new era of ethnic harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ideas were good. We like them. They're Republican ideas.  
We hope the Democratic Legislature will move forward,'' said Rod 
Pacheco, leader of the Assembly's Republican minority. 
</P>
<P>
	For Davis, who ascended Monday from lieutenant governor to  
governor, his speech marked the completion of a journey he embarked 
on in 1975, when he became Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown's chief of 
staff.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Elliott in Top Form in '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- If there is one player on the New York  
Jets that coach Bill Parcells knows how to prod, it's Jumbo 
Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells must have gotten to Elliott very effectively this  
season because the 33-year-old tackle has made his 11th pro season 
one of his best. Elliott has been a key component of an offensive 
line that far exceeded most expectations in helping the Jets go 
12-4 and win the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a young kid playing right tackle (rookie Jason  
Fabini),'' Parcells said of a blocking unit that allowed only 25 
sacks and propelled the team to a club-record 416 points. ``Jumbo 
was probably better than he was last year and he was in terrific 
condition physically, because he worked from January on. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Guard) Matt O'Dywer had a solid year. (Center Kevin) Mawae  
and (guard Todd) Burger came in and did a pretty good job for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott plays the key position of left tackle, although Parcells  
joked that you wouldn't know it, judging from the publicity 
afforded All-Pro tackle Tony Boselli of Jacksonville, Sunday's 
playoff opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reading the papers, I didn't know we had a left tackle, I  
thought only Jacksonville had one,'' Parcells said, his motivating 
motor in fifth gear. ``I thought maybe we were playing with 10 this 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, who made the Pro Bowl with the Giants in 1993, has  
learned to shrug when he hears Parcells' jibes. He didn't make an 
exception on Wednesday when the coach's comments about Boselli were 
relayed to Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes to goad guys a little bit,'' Elliott said. ``He may  
have mentioned a couple of things that were kind of fun. He's not a 
boring, stale coach. He likes to tease and have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he's gone through worse than what Parcells puts him  
through. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Jets were in the midst of their 1-15 season in 1996,  
Elliott took it on the chin from some school kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a school bus going by my house and I was getting  
heckled by a bunch of elementary grade kids,'' he said. ``It 
doesn't get any lower than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's best work probably came in the 1990 postseason, when  
the Giants won the Super Bowl and he manhandled Bruce Smith in that 
game after neutralizing Richard Dent and Charles Haley in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some distant memories of some things that set a high  
standard for him, and don't know if I could put him in that 
category of what he did a few years ago,'' Parcells said. ``He has 
played well. He is solid, keeps things to himself pretty much. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he likes being on a team that is competitive and he enjoys  
playing. He is used to being on a competitive team. In college, he 
was used to that at Michigan and when he came into the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said Elliott is smart and ``never makes mental  
errors.'' Hard work is the reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he is willing to do what he has been willing to do  
in the offseason, he will continue to play effectively,'' Parcells 
said. ``The first time he is not willing to do that, he is at the 
age where you will see a pretty big dropoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott doesn't envision that happening anytime soon. He's not  
thinking about retirement -- or anything much more than the next 
game, the next step toward what he hopes is a second Super Bowl 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I am playing at the same caliber, I will keep  
playing until the foreseeable future,'' he said. ``I like to feel 
over the years that I prided myself on improving every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The little things -- even at this stage in an 11-year career --  
you can get a little better on certain things and certain 
technique.''

<HEADLINE> Fiancee Doubts Track Star's Accuser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A 12-year-old girl who accused former Ohio  
State track star Chris Nelloms of rape changed her story, so she 
should not be believed, the sprinter's fiancee testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tina Smith, also a friend of the alleged victim, took the stand  
for the defense during the third day of Nelloms' trial in 
Montgomery County Common Pleas Court. If convicted of rape or 
sexual penetration, Nelloms faces a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, of Dayton, said she was watching a television show with  
the girl about child sexual abuse on April 9 when the girl first 
made the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said she believed the girl at first, but no longer does.  
</P>
<P>
	``Her story changed numerous times,'' Smith said. ``It was not  
consistent with what she later told detectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the girl told police of additional rapes and  
sodomy. But Smith said the girl earlier denied the sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said she would work to put Nelloms in jail if the rape  
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl has accused Nelloms of raping her eight times at homes  
in Dayton and Lexington, Ky., from 1995 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms, 26, of Trotwood, starred at Ohio State and tried  
unsuccessfully to qualify for the 1996 Olympics in the 200-meter 
dash. In 1993, he placed sixth in the U.S. national championships, 
second in the World University Games and in the top five in six 
major European meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms was indicted in June and charged with eight counts of  
rape of a child, one count each of attempting to commit rape of a 
child and felonious sexual penetration of a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, a doctor who examined the girl testified that  
she showed signs of sexual abuse. Dr. Ralph Hicks said the back of 
the membrane around the girl's vagina was ``markedly diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the most common area where injuries related to sexual  
contact or sexual abuse are seen,'' said Hicks, a pediatrician at 
Children's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Hicks said he could not say how many  
times the girl might have had sexual intercourse.

</P>
<P>
	More than 200 fans gathered on the Hollywood Boulevard sidewalk

</P>
<P>
	Newhart, 69, launched his career in 1959 with his famous comedy  
routine utilizing a one-man, two-way telephone conversation,

<HEADLINE> Q &AMP; A Relating to NBA Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Questions and answers relating to Wednesday's  
settlement of the NBA lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What happens next?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The Board of Governors is expected to approve the agreement  
Thursday, after which the lawyers go to work. It'll take about 10 
days to put the agreement into written form, and then it must be 
signed before the lockout is officially lifted. Teams will then be 
able to make trades, sign free agents and open training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: When will the season start?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Sometime during the first week of February, with teams  
playing about 50 games apiece and the regular season likely 
extended through the end of April. An entirely new schedule will be 
drawn up, and it is uncertain if there will be any inter-conference 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What kind of shape will the players be in?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Some like Karl Malone are already in midseason form, some  
like Shawn Kemp are lugging around an extra 20 pounds of fat. The 
majority will be ready to go after an intense two-week training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Which side blinked?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Both sides. The owners will end up paying out a much larger  
percentage of revenues than they wanted to, while the players will 
no longer be able to earn what the market will bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How late can the season go?  
</P>
<P>
	A: With the start of the playoffs pushed back two weeks, it's  
possible the NBA Finals won't end until July. There is almost no 
chance, however, that the postseason will last past July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Who among the players takes a financial hit?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The players going into the final year of the rookie scale,  
such as Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury, will not be able to get 
new contracts that look anything like the $126 million, six-year 
extension Kevin Garnett got from the Minnesota Timberwolves. If 
Iverson stays with the 76ers and Marbury with the Timberwolves, 
they will be eligible for six-year extensions worth about $73 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Who among the players benefits most?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The veterans who in previous years had been forced to accept  
the league minimum will gain, because so many teams were over the 
salary cap. George McCloud, for example, made $272,500 playing for 
Phoenix last season. This year, the eight-year veteran will make a 
minimum of $725,000. Eric Murdock, who made the minimum for Miami, 
can get a raise of almost $400,000 to his new minimum of $662,500. 
Joe Kleine, who made the minimum for Chicago last season, now must 
make a minimum of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Will the fans come back?  
</P>
<P>
	A: That's up to the fans. Most teams sold their season tickets  
several months ago and have been refunding the money with 6 percent 
interest. As for the fans who usually watch the NBA on television, 
it depends if they have become too comfortable living without their 
pro basketball fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What happens to the Chicago Bulls?  
</P>
<P>
	A: If Michael Jordan decided to return, chances are the Bulls  
will be able to put the same team on the court, with a few minor 
changes. A big factor will be whether Scottie Pippen wants to 
return or to sign as a free agent with some other team. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What's likely to be the next labor dispute in pro sports?  
</P>
<P>
	A: If nothing changes in the current climate for baseball, it's  
possible there could be a lockout during spring training in 2002. 
As for the NBA, its new agreement ensures labor peace through the 
2003-04 season, or the 2004-05 season if the owners exercise an 
option for the seventh year.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Arms Inspectors Helped US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- United Nations weapons inspectors may have  
been used to help collect sensitive Iraqi communications for U.S. 
efforts to undermine Saddam Hussein's regime, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe and The Washington Post quoted anonymous  
sources in today's editions as saying the electronic eavesdropping 
operation allowed U.S. intelligence agents to listen in on secret 
communications among military units responsible for the Iraqi 
leader's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post quoted confidants close to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi  
Annan as saying he is convinced Washington used the operation to 
penetrate the security apparatus protecting Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Los Angeles Times reported today that Annan has  
told key staff members he has no knowledge of the activities 
alleged by the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary-general has become aware of the fact that UNSCOM  
directly facilitated the creation of an intelligence collection 
system for the United States in violation of its mandate,'' one 
Annan adviser told the Post. ``The United Nations cannot be party 
to an operation to overthrow one of its member states. In the most 
fundamental way, that is what's wrong with the UNSCOM operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annan accumulated enough evidence on the eavesdropping, some  
through intermediaries passing on classified U.S. information, to 
ask Richard Butler, head of the weapons inspection team, about the 
reports last month, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to two of the confidants, Butler denied them to Annan.  
The newspaper quoted some Annan advisers as acknowledging that 
Annan would like to pressure Butler to resign in favor of a 
replacement who might win the consent of Iraq and its defenders on 
the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe quoted former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter, a  
former U.S. Marine, as saying, ``We knew a hell of a lot of 
information about presidential security.'' But Ritter said if his 
team found any information related to Hussein's personal safety, 
``we would dump it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we did, we did on our own initiative,'' Ritter said  
on NBC's ``Today.'' ``The United Nations was in total control.'' 
His inspection team, Ritter added, ``was not a party to any effort 
to overthrow the president of Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe said the surveillance equipment allowed U.N.  
inspectors to listen in on radio, cell phone and walkie-talkie 
communications by members of the Iraqi security network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe said Rolf Ekeus, former executive chairman of UNSCOM,  
declined to discuss operational elements of the system, but said 
the program was run and controlled by the United Nations 
inspectors, not the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter told the Globe that changed in March 1998 when the United  
States pressured British and Israeli intelligence to stop 
supporting the U.N. eavesdropping operation and took it over 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. decided this system is too sensitive to be run by  
UNSCOM,'' Ritter told the paper. ``They bulled their way in and 
took it over. Now any data collected by the activity is not being 
assessed by UNSCOM. Now, the U.S. gained 100 percent access and is 
not feeding any of it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of member states have assisted UNSCOM in various  
aspects of its work, and one of those is the United States,'' 
Butler told the Post Tuesday night. ``But as far as I am concerned 
I have always been assiduous in insisting that any assistance given 
to us be strictly related to our disarmament mandate. I have never 
approved of any assistance to any member state which would serve 
their unilateral purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Annan acknowledges that the eavesdropping operation was  
meant in part to aid inspectors looking for weapons of mass 
destruction, he also believes UNSCOM enabled the United States to 
listen in on some of the most sensitive communications of the 
Baghdad regime, his confidants told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, told the Post, ``We've already established that Saddam's 
personal security apparatus and the apparatus that conceals weapons 
of mass destruction are one and the same.'' Distinguishing between 
them would be impossible for intelligence-gathering efforts, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA, State Department and White House declined requests for  
formal comment.

	NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA and the players' union reached an  
agreement today to end the 6-month-old lockout and save what's left 
of the season after a secret all-night bargaining session, The 
Associated Press learned. Approval is still needed from the owners 
and the players, and the process of selling the deal to those 
constituencies began almost immediately. A season of about 50 games 
will begin the first week of February, according to a source close 
to the talks.

	Rebels Attack Sierra Leone Capital  
</P>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rampaging rebel fighters shot  
their way into the heart of Sierra Leone's capital today, capturing 
a main government office building and burning down the city's 
police station while terrified residents huddled indoors, witnesses 
said. It was unclear who -- if anyone -- controlled Freetown. Sierra 
Leonean soldiers and forces of the Nigerian-led intervention force 
that has been fighting the rebels were nowhere to be seen, 
according to witnesses. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Projects $76B Surplus  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration today projected a budget  
surplus of more than $76 billion for this year. ``We can say the 
era of big deficits is over,'' President Clinton said. The 
president, convening a White House ceremony to tout the figure, 
immediately squelched any speculation that the extra revenue would 
be used to cut taxes. 

</P>
<P>
	Senators Mull Impeach Details  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said  
today his party opposes calling witnesses for President Clinton's 
impeachment trial before the Senate and urged House prosecutors to 
stay out of the dispute. ``We didn't involve ourselves in their 
proceedings and it is very disturbing that they now seem to be 
intent on involving themselves in ours,'' Daschle said of the House 
prosecutors after meeting with Senate Democrats before the 106th 
Congress was sworn in.

Speaker, and delivers the oath of office to the other 221 
Republicans, 211 Democrats and one Democratic-leaning independent. 
Chosen unanimously by Republicans to lead the party, Hastert says 
he'll work to end the partisan combat that held up key bills in the 
last session and hurt the Republicans at the polls.

	U.S. Planes To Face Iraqi Defiance  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and British warplanes patrolling the  
``no-fly'' zones over Iraq may well be facing ``a period of 
challenge'' from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the Clinton 
administration says. Western planes patrolled the northern and 
southern Iraqi skies today without incident, said U.S. defense 
officials. ``It just seems pretty unpredictable,'' Lt. Col. Rick 
Craig, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said of Iraq's 
airspace challenges.

today that Cambodia could return to civil war if any attempt is 
made to arrest two senior leaders of the guerrilla movement. Khem 
Ngun, who led the surrender of the last Khmer Rouge army remnants 
in December, said the government would be seen as reneging on a 
recent defection deal with the men who ruled between 1975 and 1979, 
causing the deaths of up to 2 million people.

<HEADLINE> Community Newspaper Holdings Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. has grown in  
just a few years from a plan on paper into a group with the most 
daily newspapers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	While chief executive Ralph J. Martin was on a leave of absence  
from his job as head of Thomson Newspapers in 1994, he envisioned a 
group of small newspapers located near one another. Martin got his 
chance to try out the concept two years later, when 17 Midwestern 
papers became available. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Community Newspaper offers 96 dailies scattered through  
22 states -- with 20 dailies in Texas alone. 
</P>
<P>
	At 96, it surpasses Gannett Co., the largest U.S. publisher in  
terms of circulation with nearly 90 dailies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Mike Reed said the group's object was  
never to become the largest newspaper group in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a goal. It just kind of happened. It kind of stunned  
us. We were just trying to make strategic moves and there were a 
lot of papers available in the last 18 months,'' said Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Community Newspaper's purchases have been funded by the  
Retirement Systems of Alabama -- pension funds belonging to judges, 
teachers and railroad workers. The group even moved its 
headquarters from Kentucky to Birmingham, Ala., at the Retirement 
System's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been our sole lenders since the beginning,'' Martin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has been the spot for its largest growth. The group began  
its push in Texas by ``accident'' when the company bought the 
Mineral Wells Index. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had bought a paper in Oklahoma that came with the paper in  
Mineral Wells. That put us in Texas. It was just availability,'' 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next opportunity to grow came when the Palestine Herald  
Press came on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	But Community Newspaper got its real jump-start in Texas in July  
when it bought eight dailies from the Donrey Media Group. In 
December, Community Newspaper expanded with the purchase of nine 
more Texas dailies from Hollinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Community Newspaper's concentration on smaller dailies is  
reflected in the total circulation of 134,000 for its Texas 
properties, far short of the circulation in Texas of The Hearst 
Corp. and A.H. Belo Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the total daily circulation of the Hearst dailies  
in Texas, which include the Houston Chronicle, is 930,500, 
according to the 1998 Directory of Texas Daily Newspapers. Belo's 
total daily circulation in Texas, which includes The Dallas Morning 
News, is 583,902. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, Community Newspaper's largest paper is the  
(Johnstown, Pa.) Tribune-Democrat, with a circulation of 48,000. 
Several of the papers have a circulation of roughly 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, newspaper groups will make a multiple-paper purchase  
and wind up with assets that can result in a quick profit or that 
don't quite fit their own concept. They will then put them back on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't appear to be the case with Community Newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all newspaper people,'' said Martin. ``This isn't an  
investment scheme. When we buy these papers we buy them to keep. 
It's part of our strategy to buy in clusters. We try to own papers 
in a 40-mile proximity to each other and as many as we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cluster concept allows the small newspapers to share  
services and centralize functions. For example, the papers share 
printing presses, accounting departments and production facilities 
when possible. A publisher or general manager will oversee each 
cluster. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Barlow, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in New  
York, said Community Newspaper's growth was sped by the Hollinger 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Hollinger had so many pieces it was selling, it made it  
easy,'' he said, adding that little information has been available 
on Wall Street because Community Newspaper is a private company 
dealing with small-town publications. ``You get more known if 
you're in the big cities,'' said Barlow.

<HEADLINE> SEC Backs Stricter Nasdaq Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have approved a sweeping  
proposal by the dealers' group that runs the Nasdaq Stock Market to 
tighten disclosure requirements for companies seeking special 
over-the-counter listings of their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by the National Association of Securities Dealers is  
aimed at distancing the nation's second-largest stock market from 
cheap, high-risk stocks, sometimes called ``penny stocks,'' that 
are thinly traded and loosely regulated and have had problems with 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The change could result in the removal of thousands of small and  
speculative stocks from the listings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday approved the  
proposal made a year ago by Nasdaq's parent organization to strip 
from the OTC Bulletin Board, an electronic market of about 6,800 
securities, stocks of any companies that don't file financial 
disclosure statements with the SEC or banking or insurance 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the stocks listed on the Bulletin Board do not submit  
such reports, according to the NASD, which announced the SEC's 
approval on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq runs the Bulletin Board, but its stocks are not actually  
listed on the Nasdaq market because they don't meet Nasdaq listing 
standards or don't file disclosure statements with the SEC. The 
Bulletin Board stocks often are linked with Nasdaq's name, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The new filing requirement for companies will protect investors  
in Bulletin Board stocks by giving them access to companies' 
financial information, the NASD said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thorough and accurate information is the foundation of sound  
investment decisions,'' Frank Zarb, NASD's chairman and chief 
executive officer, said in a statement. He called the move ``a 
major step toward improving the quality'' of the market for 
small-company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman John Heine declined comment on the matter.  
</P>
<P>
	The new requirement also means that the companies will be  
subject to closer oversight by the SEC and other watchdog agencies. 
The filing requirement will be phased in over a 12-month period 
beginning in July and continuing through June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts have said the stocks that are removed could  
still be listed on the so-called Pink Sheets, a less automated 
system not affiliated with Nasdaq -- but would be more difficult to 
trade.

<HEADLINE> Senate Launching Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a solemn moment for President Clinton and  
the nation, the Senate is launching the first presidential 
impeachment trial since the case of Andrew Johnson in 1868. The 
ceremonial opening comes amid intense, last-minute bargaining over 
ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
	With House prosecutors pressing Senate leaders to allow  
testimony from witnesses such as Monica Lewinsky, there were 
increasing indications that a full-blown trial of some weeks' 
duration was in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators today were taking an oath to ``do impartial justice,''  
and Chief Justice William Rehnquist was assuming his role as 
presiding officer for Clinton's trial on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. The 13-member House prosecution team was to 
read the two articles of impeachment on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But beyond those public sessions, the House ``managers'' were  
negotiating for the right to summon a number of witnesses, most 
notably Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose affair 
with Clinton triggered the impeachment investigation, and 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters  
Wednesday that if agreement could be reached to call witnesses, he 
would want the White House and the House to justify the need for 
each person summoned. The Senate also would have to approve each 
witness by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott expressed optimism that agreement was near on a procedure  
for a ``full trial .... and votes on articles of impeachment at the 
end of the process.'' One GOP source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said it would likely be February at the earliest before 
votes were taken on the president's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of senators met Wednesday night with the lead  
House prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and three other 
lawmakers on his team. Then the lawmakers unexpectedly summoned 
four members of the White House legal team to the Capitol to 
discuss proposals for conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who consulted separately Wednesday with Hyde and  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said he expected opening statements 
in the case sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The crucial question was whether to allow witnesses, as demanded  
by the House but opposed by Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, one proposal was to give each side in the 
trial, the House and the White House, three to five days to present 
evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of that time, 
a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or either side 
could seek permission to summon witnesses. The Senate would have to 
approve each witness to be called by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would place final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, one of the House prosecutors, said  
``five to 10 witnesses puts on a case. I suspect we will want 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and others on the prosecution team said the House might try  
to summon women who have provided statements in the Paula Jones 
case ``to the degree they go to obstruction of justice and 
perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky must be called ``because she is right in the middle  
of this,'' Cannon said. But he added that he'd ``never seen Linda 
Tripp as essential,'' referring to Ms. Lewinsky's onetime friend 
who taped their private telephone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a prominent Washington attorney and longtime Clinton  
friend, ``is a player'' and should be summoned, Cannon said. But 
while other prosecutors wanted to call presidential secretary Betty 
Currie, Cannon said he would be reluctant to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the president placed her in a vulnerable position by  
involving her in the Lewinsky affair, adding ``It was a rotten, 
nasty thing to do to a career civil servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other House prosecutors had their own suggestions.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., indicated that he might want to  
hear from onetime presidential adviser Dick Morris about Clinton's 
state of mind when he asked Morris to conduct a poll on Americans' 
opinion of his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to have the opportunity to present 12 to 14  
witnesses,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said Ms. Lewinsky should be  
questioned ``in limited fashion,'' but ``we don't have to go into 
all the (sexual) details. Much of the questioning could be on 
obstruction of justice issues, such as the attempt to find her a 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said if Mrs. Currie ``has a bearing on the case, it's  
important to have the jury hear her testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson added that Jordan was essential because, ``In the  
framework of the obstruction of justice case, I would say he's an 
important witnesses.''

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Defends Receiving Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- The Olympics' top official said  
Wednesday he did nothing wrong by accepting firearms worth more 
than $2,000 as gifts during Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he is routinely  
presented with gifts during his travels and didn't want to insult 
Salt Lake by refusing the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also said he is not covered by IOC restriction on  
gifts because he doesn't vote in the election of host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	He vowed to stay in office through the end of his term in 2001  
and reiterated his promise to clean up the International Olympic 
Committee and expel any members found guilty of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, two rifles and a shotgun, all made by Browning Arms of  
Mountain Green, Utah, have been identified as going to Samaranch, 
and there also may have been a handgun given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I travel I get gifts,'' Samaranch said. ``Of course  
Utah, Salt Lake City, is a state where guns are very popular. I 
have visited Salt Lake City twice and I got a gun both times. I 
took it to Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing the guns ``would have been a real insult,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I see no problem whatsoever since the important gifts I get  
will be placed in the Olympic Museum,'' he said at a news 
conference. ``These weapons -- these two guns -- are in the Olympic 
museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview in the Tribune de Geneve newspaper,  
Samaranch said the guns were in his office in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do remember very clearly the inscription on the case: `To  
President Juan Antonio Samaranch on behalf of the population of 
Salt Lake City,''' he told the newspaper. ``These gifts were put 
down in a register, as is required by our internal rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Samaranch denied that he had violated  
the IOC's own rule prohibiting IOC members from accepting gifts 
with a value of more than $150. 
</P>
<P>
	``This limit is for the members who participate in the  
elections,'' he said. ``I do not take part in the voting and the 
elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members who did vote in the 1995 election which awarded  
the games to Salt Lake City were also allegedly presented with 
firearms during their visits. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said this would be addressed in the IOC investigation  
into whether bribery played a part in Salt Lake's winning bid. The 
inquiry is focusing on a ``scholarship fund'' that provided nearly 
$400,000 in scholarships to 13 people, including six relatives of 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some IOC members were provided with free medical  
care, including cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigative panel is due to present its findings to  
the executive board on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``Possibly we (will) have concrete cases of inappropriate  
behavior, and if this is proven true then we will propose the 
expulsion of these people,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president of the IOC since 1980, said he  
would remain in office until his final term expires in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens, I will stay to the very last day of my  
mandate,'' he said. ``We will do whatever is necessary to clean up 
whatever must be cleaned up. ... Life goes on, and the Olympic 
movement has been very important over a century and it will stay on 
the same level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune reported Tuesday that Samaranch received a  
shotgun and a rifle from the Salt Lake bid committee a month before 
Salt Lake won the right to host the 2002 Winter Games. On 
Wednesday, the paper said that another Browning rifle also went to 
Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said its records showed Browning officials gave  
Samaranch a pistol and a rifle during a visit to his Lausanne 
office. Browning officials said Wednesday they located an invoice 
for a Browning ``High Power'' 9mm handgun that was sold to the Salt 
Lake bid committee in February 1991 for $391.86. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the bid committee did with it, I have no idea,'' said  
Travis Hall, spokesman for Browning.

<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 4  
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Times-Union, Jacksonville, on impeachment:  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's supporters argue he should not be removed  
from office because polls show most Americans are opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure. Let the people vote directly on whether to remove the  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Then let them vote on a major tax cut. Next, on school vouchers.  
</P>
<P>
	After that, let them vote on congressional term limits, a  
balanced budget amendment and abolition of the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show the people favor those things, overwhelmingly. But  
Clinton and his allies are blocking them. 
</P>
<P>
	Why should public opinion be sacred when it agrees with the  
liberals but meaningless when it disagrees? 
</P>
<P>
	Liberals have little use for public opinion. They use the courts  
to overturn election results and decisions by the elected 
representatives of the people. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If liberals now want Congress always to abide by the will of the  
people, fine. Let there be government by opinion poll. 
</P>
<P>
	But let that method prevail in all cases, not just when it  
benefits liberals. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 6  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, on the impeachment trial of President  
Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremonial start of President Clinton's impeachment trial  
has been set. Chief Justice Rehnquist will swear in the senators as 
jurors tomorrow morning. But the substantive questions of how the 
trial will be conducted are still undecided. The reason is that 
some influential Republican senators are blocking the plan of their 
majority leader, Trent Lott, to move the Senate with appropriate 
speed toward a censure verdict that conforms with the public will, 
the evidence against Mr. Clinton and the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Lott's sensible plan for a one-week trial without witnesses  
leading to an expedited procedural vote has been blocked by 
opposition from within his own caucus. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Senators sympathetic to Mr. Lott's goal need to help him cope  
with the difficult assignment of disciplining this irresponsible 
President in a way that does not harm the country more than it 
harms Mr. Clinton. The problem of how to run an impeachment trial 
is bigger than Bill Clinton. The senators need to be bigger than 
Mr. Clinton has been, too. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 3  
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch, on state of the nation:  
</P>
<P>
	Judging by the sex scandal that swamped Washington in 1998,  
turning the nation's highest elected officials into spiteful 
brawlers, one might think that this country is going to, well, 
heck. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing could be further from the truth, according to a detailed  
analysis by Gregg Easterbrook in the The New Republic and other 
sources. For instance, crime is down considerably, as the FBI 
reported a short time ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Accidents have been declining since 1995. The rate of accidental  
death has dropped 12 percent since 1985. Highway fatalities are 
decreasing even though there are more cars, driving faster, on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	In many big cities the decline in downtowns has stopped.  
</P>
<P>
	It's puzzling to learn that only 15 percent of Americans think  
the country is getting better, although overwhelmingly they think 
their own lives are better. 
</P>
<P>
	Why this optimism gap? Maybe because segments of the media tend  
to accentuate the negative. And much news emanates from Washington, 
where the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky-Kenneth Starr saga was so 
degrading and pervasive that most Americans tuned out. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 4  
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News, on five years of NAFTA:  
</P>
<P>
	The North American Free Trade Agreement had a hard birth.  
Opposition to it was so intense that it sometimes seemed as if it 
might die in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turned 5 on Jan. 1. The pact has blossomed into a healthy  
whelp and seems destined for a happy and productive adolescence. 
Its parents, the United States, Canada and Mexico, are right to be 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone is satisfied. Trade unionists,  
protection-minded businessmen and their allies on the environmental 
and political fringes have wanted to smother the child in its 
cradle. To them, it costs U.S. jobs, encourages pollution and 
violates U.S. sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	What nonsense. People should accept North American free trade  
for what it really is: neither savior nor agent of doom but overall 
a boon to its makers. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 5  
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on debut of the euro:  
</P>
<P>
	Monday's launch of the euro, the single currency of an  
economically unified Europe, should be marked as a historic date on 
a par with the collapse of Communism. With the launch of the euro 
... a single unit of exchange suddenly simplifies the financial 
interaction of the European community. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The course of the euro's development could ultimately signal  
that Europe is ready to move closer to political union. Or, it may 
prove to be the high-water mark of that ambitious post-World War II 
socio-political experiment of trying to do by diplomacy what 
succeeding continental powerhouses had failed to do by force of 
arms: unite Europe under a single government or economic system. 
</P>
<P>
	The direction in which the euro changes the course of economic  
history will only become clear in the months and years ahead. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	The Inter-Mountain, Elkins, W.Va., on abortion advertising:  
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of abortion-on-demand are finding out once again that  
they must win over hearts and minds before they can achieve 
significant changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, pro-life groups thought they had found the magic  
bullet in state laws to prohibit partial-birth abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	But almost all of those laws have been overturned in a string of  
state and federal court decisions, as judges fail to draw the same 
distinctions that activists do between early and late-term 
abortions. So now pro-life advocates are turning to Madison 
Avenue-style advertising to advance their cause, and pro-choice 
advocates are responding in kind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caring Foundation, a pro-life group, is eschewing political  
messages in its ads, focusing instead on the woman in crisis and on 
non-abortion options that are available, such as adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, Michigan and Wisconsin, where the group's ads have  
aired on TV for years, laws haven't changed much at all, but the 
abortion rate has dropped significantly. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-choice groups are not leaving the ad campaigns unanswered.  
</P>
<P>
	They are planning ads of their own that will emphasize what they  
see as the ``right to choose'' and dangers of lack of access to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The dueling ad campaigns may be a welcome development in the  
national abortion debate, which was short-circuited by Roe v. Wade 
nearly 26 years ago. ...

	The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on the Endangered Species Act:  
</P>
<P>
	In the 25 years since the Endangered Species Act became law, at  
least this much is clear: The measure that has had such an impact 
in the West is badly in need of change. That may be the one thing 
that all sides in the debate, from environmentalists to the timber 
industry, can agree upon. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, it is unlikely such a change will come about when  
Congress takes up the Endangered Species Act again next year. ... 
Western lawmakers currently lack the clout to accomplish a major 
change in the measure, and Eastern lawmakers who might otherwise be 
persuaded are faced with strong support for the current law by 
constituents who never have felt its impact on everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	Westerners' best hope for crafting the changes many in the  
region agree are needed lies in the chance that someday soon some 
endangered species will be discovered in the Boston-New 
York-Philadelphia-Washington D.C. corridor that causes the kind of 
problems the act has wrought here. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, we know of no such listing looming on the  
horizon. Instead, Oregonians and others in the West must face the 
sad fact that, for now at least, no real help is likely.

	San Jose Mercury News, on California smoking ban:  
</P>
<P>
	It was a widely held opinion one year ago that banning smoking  
in bars was a waste of time. Such a ban would be impossible to 
enforce, critics said. Bartenders would never force people to have 
their beer without a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the first year of California's ban has been a qualified  
success. While a small, vocal group of bar owners and patrons 
openly defies the law, most bars are smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Statewide estimates of compliance range from 68 percent for  
stand-alone bars to 90 percent for combination bar-restaurants. Not 
perfect, but not bad for a law that was supposed to be 
unenforceable. ... 
</P>
<P>
	There will always be holdouts, bars that cater to a smoking  
clientele and refuse to change. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But the law doesn't have to put out every cigarette in every bar  
to be a success. A year ago, it was nearly impossible for 
non-smokers to sit in a bar or work in one without breathing 
cigarette smoke. Today, it's the smokers who have to hunt for a 
place to light up. That's progress.

	The Seattle Times, on the NFL coach firings:  
</P>
<P>
	The timing couldn't be better. As five National Football League  
coaches -- including Dennis Erickson of the Seattle Seahawks -- were 
losing their jobs, it's reported the league has plans to deepen and 
diversify the pool of experienced and qualified candidates for 
head-coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Sunday that the NFL will conduct  
videotape interviews with more than two dozen promising assistant 
coaches, most of them African-American, and make those tapes 
available to teams searching for new leadership. The interviews 
will focus on experience and philosophy, not technical details of 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to team presidents obtained by The New York Times, NFL  
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue explained that the league is attempting 
to identify ``a deep and diverse talent pool'' for head-coach and 
coordinator positions. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a smart move in a league with many outstanding black  
players and assistant coaches but few black head coaches. This 
season three of the 31 NFL teams had black head coaches; one was 
fired on Monday. More telling is that in recent years there have 
been more than two dozen head-coach vacancies, but none has been 
filled by an African-American. ...

	Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Frankfurt, Germany, on the euro:  
</P>
<P>
	The world financial markets greet the euro with strong gains.  
Europe's common currency wins noticeable value compared to the 
dollar on the very first trading day. And the euro is celebrated 
with strong gains on the stock and bond markets as well. No doubt: 
The euro has survived its first baptism by fire. Although much 
changes for the investor and one has to say goodbye to many habits 
he's grown fond of, even the private investor seems to take up the 
euro kindly. ... The European common currency must in the long run 
earn the advance of trust that the markets and investors have 
brought to it. The successful start certainly makes much easier. 
But in the long view the competitiveness of the participating 
economies will determine the value of the euro.

	This a message to the English: the ball is now in your court!  
The euro is waiting for you. The EU and its newborn money need you. 
You have always been highly sceptical toward the construction of 
Europe. You have always been dragging your feet to commit yourself 
to the European design. To you the EU was a ``French idea,'' 
designed and run by a ``continental bureaucracy'' under a ``German 
influence.'' Up till now you were willing to wait on the platform. 
... You are in the habit of waiting for European trains to start 
moving. ... Now the euro is launched, it is time for you to join 
it.

	The Times, London, on the euro:  
</P>
<P>
	In Europe's financial centres this week, the euro has made a  
suave entry. That by no means assures future success. On the 
streets, euro-11 citizens are being exhorted by jubilant 
politicians and glossy brochures to revel in a ``new era for 
Europe.'' So far, so painless; and so abstract. Since consumers 
will go on using their national coinage until 2002, the momentous 
irreversibility of what has just occurred has yet to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
	Never in history has a multinational currency union succeeded.  
The EU has embarked on this unprecedentedly risky experiment with 
only a shallow, largely passive, consensus. Elites may feel more 
``European''; but as 2002 nears and people confront the trauma of 
pulping currencies that form part of their sense of history and 
community, they may turn more, not less nationalist. In the lush 
euro-uplands of political rhetoric, lurk serpents of popular 
resentment ready to bite their masters' heels. It will take many 
years to find out whether these beasts can be truly tamed.

</P>
<P>
	Good and strong, the majority of experts predicted in advance of  
Monday's milestone in economic policy. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The pundits got it right. Against such established currencies as  
the dollar, the Swiss franc and the yen, Europe's newborn single 
currency was able not only to hold its ground but even to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, the successful euro launch lit a rocket under  
prices on the European stock markets on the new year's first day of 
trading. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We must not overvalue the first hours' euro-euphoria. The euro  
will also have its sober, perhaps even sobering, days. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial markets will be firm in putting the European  
currency through a test in the near future. ...

<P>
	Jan. 4  
</P>
<P>
	NRC Handelsblad, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on the euro:  
</P>
<P>
	The euro brings not only quantitative but also qualitative  
changes. The new currency is much more than the sum of its parts. 
The transparency of a single currency will lead to an 
intensification of competition within the internal market of the 
European Union and therefore give an incentive for greater economic 
dynamism in the business world. Besides that, the agreements on 
monetary and budgetary policy force governments to be disciplined. 
The easy way out -- devaluation and rising budget deficits -- which 
have been followed to differing degrees by all European 
governments, has been cut off. The macroeconomic policy of the 
euro-nations is, from today, totally European in perspective. This 
realization has not yet sufficiently sunk in.

Europe. ... Economic and political relations between the two are 
going through a confrontational stage. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The latest incident is a U.S. tax on a ``black list'' of  
European products -- Washington's response to the preferential 
treatment that the European Union gives for bananas coming from 
ex-European colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	These ``sanctions'' could be the prelude to an offensive that  
America seems determined to wage against what it terms as 
``fortress Europe.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. will need to change tariffs in order to draw  
international investment away from the attractive euro zone. This 
could open the way to ``tax wars'' with a potential result far more 
serious than any ``sanctions'' on bananas.

	The Australian Financial Review, Sydney, on impeachment of

</P>
<P>
	The United States Senate convenes today for the historic  
impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. After nearly a year of 
digesting the lurid details of the sex scandal, America and the 
world now have to sit back for possibly six more months while U.S. 
lawmakers try the most powerful man in he world over a private 
consensual sexual act. There still, however, remains an effective 
way to resolve this crisis as soon as possible: a short and 
relatively painless impeachment trial, followed by a harshly worded 
censure of the president. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones may melt, the U.S. dollar may plunge, the Serbs  
may resume their slaughter of Muslims, the Taliban in Afghanistan 
may show itself to be the world's new Khmer Rouge, the Middle East 
peace process may be at the brink of violence, Iraq may continue to 
thumb its nose at the West, and millions of Indonesians, Russians 
and Brazilians may be starving and rioting in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Senate will devote itself to the frantic, fleeting  
encounters between the president and (Monica) Lewinsky, and his 
subsequent lies. In the meantime, the business of serious policy 
making would be set aside until the case is resolved. ...

<P>
	Jan. 6  
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times, London, on impeachment of President  
Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	Washington is returning to work, and to the threat of political  
paralysis. ... As Mr. Clinton confronts the prospect of an imminent 
trial in the Senate, we are little the wiser about the future of 
his presidency. ... What is needed now is a speedy agreement 
between Republicans and Democrats on the conduct of Mr. Clinton's 
trial -- and a similar consensus that the process be as expeditious 
as fairness allows ... 
</P>
<P>
	... As long as Mr. Clinton shows suitable contrition, the  
bipartisan proposal under discussion in recent days offers an 
honorable compromise. This would provide for an abbreviated hearing 
lasting a few days followed by a ``test'' vote. The purpose would 
be to see whether, even if the charges against Mr. Clinton were 
proven, there was a sufficient majority to convict him. ... 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, an early vote would see the Senate address  
from the outset the core issue in this sorry saga. In the end, it 
is about proportionality. Mr. Clinton lied about his relationship 
with Ms. Lewinsky. But is that sufficient cause to depose a 
president?

	Buenos Aires Herald, on Brazil's second-term president:  
</P>
<P>
	In many ways the real inauguration of Brazilian President  
Fernando Henrique Cardoso for his second term was not so much the 
domestic ceremony held with such austerity on New Year's Day as the 
convocation of leading figures from other countries (including the 
presidents of Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru). Even if 
Cardoso inveighed against ``asymmetrical globalization'' (the 
culprit for Brazil's problems), his speech confirmed the departure 
from Brazil's traditional self-image as continent in its own right. 
With the birth of the euro on the same day as Cardoso's 
inauguration showing the way, regional integration has become 
virtually the only vision available in Latin America now that 
democracy and the free market are almost universal.

<P>
	Castro owes so much to the United States! Not merely for the  
sympathy aroused by his rebellion against the corrupt regime of 
Fulgencio Batista which ended with the entry of the rebels in 
Havana 40 years ago. But also because the subsequent anti-Castroism 
and other stupidities of U.S. foreign policy penalized Cubans as 
much as it it helped Castro stay in power for the four decades. ... 
Without the embargo, Castroism would probably not have lasted so 
long. ... Contributions must be made so that the United States ends 
its absurd embargo and reasonable alternatives must be encouraged 
that would lead to a orderly transition to democracy.

<P>
	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Japan's educational reform:  
</P>
<P>
	Over the past century, the public educational system has focused  
on churning out human resources capable of contributing to the 
nation's economic development. In the immediate postwar period, 
legions of `corporate worriers' were needed to rebuild the 
devastated economy. The recovery that ensued engendered a myth that 
happiness lies in joining a leading company, prompting parents to 
thrust their children into the competition to land jobs with such 
firms. ... 
</P>
<P>
	While this has do doubt contributed to Japan's economic success,  
its negative side effects have become apparent. Bullying and 
violence are rampant, and schoolchildren are responsible for some 
horrifying crimes. Not only is the educational system placing too 
great a burden on children, but it is also mass producing people 
incapable of making valuable judgment. ...

<HEADLINE> Cone Mills To Close a Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Cone Mills, the world's largest denim  
fabric maker, is closing its Salisbury plant with 625 employees and 
trimming corporate staff as part of a restructuring plan to boost 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salisbury plant, which produces yarn-dyed fabrics for  
shirts, will begin phasing out production at the plant in early 
March and close it in April, Cone Mills president and chief 
executive John Bakane said Wednesday in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past three years, the company has sustained substantial  
losses at Salisbury,'' the release said. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased production of low priced imports of fabrics similar to  
those produced at the Salisbury plant ``has prevented the plant 
from being competitive,'' the company release said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear this morning if any of the hourly or salaried  
workers at the Salisbury plant will be offered jobs at other Cone 
Mills plants. The company employs more than 6,000 workers at nine 
plants in North Carolina and South Carolina and a joint venture 
plant in Mexico. A call to Cone Mills was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the restructuring plan, Cone Mills will streamline  
product offerings in its sportswear division as well as reorganize 
and trim its corporate administrative staff, Bakane said. The 
apparel products group sales and administrative organizations also 
will be reorganized. It was unclear how many workers will be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone Mills said earnings for the fourth quarter of 1998 will be  
lower than analysts' expectations as a result of the restructuring 
along with reduced denim shipments and yarn-dyed sportswear 
fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring program, expected to be put into place in the  
first quarter, will save the company about $20 million per year, 
Bakane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone Mills shut down four of its North Carolina mills for three  
weeks during the holidays because Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. had 
temporarily stopped making five-pocket jeans and laid off 4,000 
U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone Mills is also the largest commission printer of home  
furnishings fabrics in North America.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton To Seek More Base Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton intends to ask Congress for  
authority to close more U.S. military bases starting in 2001 to 
help offset the cost of military force improvements, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved several rounds of base closings earlier this  
decade but since the last round in 1995 has rejected two attempts 
by the Clinton administration to further shrink the far-flung 
network of bases developed during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will include his base-closure plan in the fiscal 2000  
budget proposal he sends to Congress in February, said Robert Bell, 
senior director of defense programs at the White House's National 
Security Council. Clinton announced last weekend that his budget 
plan will include a $12 billion defense spending increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said it would take about a 10 percent cut in the overall  
U.S. military base structure to make it fit today's smaller 
military, which has shrunk steadily since the end of the Cold War. 
He would not say how many bases Clinton wants to close. 
</P>
<P>
	The key point, Bell said, is that the Pentagon needs to be able  
to cut its costs. ``It's going to be incumbent on Congress to 
cooperate and give us that authority,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without explicit authority from Congress, the Pentagon cannot  
close bases of substantial size. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hopes it can win congressional approval by  
arguing an urgent need to achieve more defense savings and by 
pointing to examples in which communities have turned the setback 
of a base closing into long-term economic gain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, the nation's top military officers pressed the  
case for more base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting rid of the excesses that we have now ... would be very  
beneficial,'' Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said 
the savings could amount to up to $15 billion over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget proposal would include a  
request for Congress to authorize two more rounds of base closings 
starting in 2001. He said the administration is counting on savings 
from new base closures of $2 billion to $3 billion through 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has come under attack from many congressional  
Republicans for allowing the state of readiness of U.S.-based 
troops to deteriorate in recent years. Bell, in remarks to 
reporters at the White House, said one reason for this erosion of 
military readiness is Congress's repeated refusal to allow savings 
from new base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy for them to, just out of spite, or whatever is  
motivating this, decide not to take an obvious source of $2 billion 
or $3 billion in savings,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Defense Secretary William Cohen asked for  
congressional authority for base closings in 2001 and 2005, and in 
1997 he proposed closings in 1999 and 2001. In both cases Congress 
said no. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Congress favor more closures, but many fear a political  
backlash from the economic pain that can be experienced in 
communities dependent on the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been accused by some in Congress of having  
manipulated the 1995 base-closing process for his political 
advantage, particularly with bases in vote-rich California and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on  
Tuesday, the top military brass welcomed Clinton's announcement 
Saturday that he would seek military spending increases of more 
than $100 billion over the next six years in his new budget, 
beginning with a $12 billion boost next year, although they said 
more was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still another $30 billion to $40 billion in  
requirements that are not met,'' said Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he testified, ``it will meet our most critical needs.''  
</P>
<P>
	Republican members of the committee complained that Clinton's  
request was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I desire to add funds to the president's mark,'' said the  
committee's incoming chairman, Sen. John Warner, R-Va. He said the 
difference between what the chiefs wanted and what the president 
was requesting was significant. 
</P>
<P>
	The military chiefs testified in September before the same  
committee that roughly $150 billion in additional spending was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed since we last met,'' Shelton said.

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Mistress Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A prominent lawyer rested his murder  
defense Wednesday, relying on two family members who claimed he 
told them shortly after his mistress disappeared that he could not 
come clean with police without involving another person. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Capano, 49, is a politically connected lawyer accused of  
murdering Anne Marie Fahey, the governor's scheduling secretary, 
and dumping her body at sea because she wanted to end their secret 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano once again brought forward statements in an attempt to  
bolster his story that Ms. Fahey was shot and killed accidentally 
by another of his mistresses on June 27, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's older sister, Marian, and her husband, Lee Ramunno,  
testified that Capano came to them July 4, 1996, and told them he 
had taken Ms. Fahey home after dinner on June 27 -- and never saw 
her again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I can't go to the police because it would involve  
someone else,''' Mrs. Ramunno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano has testified that Deborah MacIntyre accidentally shot  
Ms. Fahey. He said she found the two of them at his house, and, in 
a jealous rage, produced a gun, threatening suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre has denied the story, saying she wasn't even at  
his house that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano said he lunged for the gun and it went off, killing Ms.  
Fahey. Capano says he dumped Ms. Fahey's body at sea the next day 
from his brother's boat to protect himself and Ms. MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not make his version of Ms. Fahey's death public until  
his murder trial began in late October.

<HEADLINE> Temps Rise, but More Snow Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Midwesterners and Great Lakes residents got a break from the  
cold wave Wednesday as they tried to keep up with their latest 
round of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Even travel was a little easier as Detroit Metropolitan Airport  
resumed full operations for the first time since the weekend 
snowstorm, which canceled hundreds of airline flights and stalled 
thousands of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	More snow fell around parts of Michigan, adding to as much as 3  
feet that had already fallen on the state's lakeside snow belts 
since late last week. Schools were closed again in Detroit for 
180,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Several inches of additional flakes in southwestern Michigan,  
along Lake Michigan, put a damper on business Wednesday at the 105 
E Grill in the town of New Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had one customer today. Ate soup,'' co-owner Sophie Faturos  
said. ``Business is very bad. Nobody's out. The whole town is in 
bad shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And more lake-effect flurries settled on Buffalo, N.Y., with 3  
to 6 inches possible by Thursday morning. That was on top of as 
much as 16 inches that fell Tuesday, which followed the foot of 
blowing snow that shut the city down on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow even fell as far south as the Tennessee Valley, with an  
inch accumulating in northern Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was slippery. It was very, very icy,'' Kim Davis said of  
her drive to work in Decatur Ala. ``(But) it was a pretty sight, 
just as white as it could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Tennessee's county school systems were closed  
Wednesday because of snow, freezing rain, sleet and temperatures as 
low as 10 at Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Florida, Lakeland chilled to a record low of 26. In  
neighboring Hillsborough County, volunteers at the Good Samaritan 
Mission in Wimauma distributed blankets and sleeping bags to mostly 
farm workers without heat in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those trailers with broken windows are a very sad situation,  
especially for the elderly and children,'' said volunteer Dora 
Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Cold, snow and slippery roads had claimed at least 102 lives  
along the path of the huge weekend storm that rolled from the 
Plains across the Midwest into Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Bitter cold retreated slightly from the Midwest, as the coldest  
air moved eastward and pushed temperatures in Maine down to 27 
below zero at Clayton Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's low at Chicago was 5 above zero, compared to  
Tuesday's low of 12 below. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Ohio had lows in the teens Wednesday, a marked change  
from Tuesday's reading of 8 below zero at Mansfield, and warmed 
into the upper 20s in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	And even Tuesday's cold wave turned out to have been not quite  
as bad as it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service on Wednesday withdrew a report that  
Savanna, in northwest Illinois, had the all-time record at 37 
below. The reading was not taken by an official observer using 
certified equipment, weather service spokesman Bob Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiping the Savanna reading off the books gave the town of  
Congerville the title for having Illinois' coldest day on record -- 
with a Tuesday morning low of 36 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the morning temperature in the town of 397 people  
was 26 -- above zero.

<HEADLINE> Canada Skier's Career Might Be Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Cary Mullen, one of Canada's top  
downhillers before enduring a rash of injuries, has decided not to 
return to the World Cup ski circuit this season because of a 
concussion suffered during a December fall at Val d'Isere, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``My risk-to-reward ratio is greatly out of balance right now,''  
Mullen said Wednesday. ``I didn't crash very hard and I was quite 
out of it for 10 minutes. It was a wakeup call to me that I wasn't 
as tough as I was before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen, 29, will miss his second consecutive World Cup season  
because of a head injury and admitted he's coming to grips with the 
idea his career may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time I have to consider that option,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never considered it before but now I'm faced with a real  
risk and a risk that might end my career. It's a risk I just can't 
grin and bear and work through. I have to listen to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen is the second Canadian racer lost for the season because  
of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Podivinsky tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left  
knee during training for a World Cup downhill at Val Gardena, 
Italy, just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen missed all last season because of blurred vision and  
dizzy spells resulting from a concussion he suffered in a horrific 
crash at Beaver Creek, Colo., in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to racing this year but banged his head again in a  
spill during a super-G at Aspen, Colo. Mullen seemed healthy after 
that fall, but returned to Canada after suffering another 
concussion at Val d'Isere. 
</P>
<P>
	``In hindsight, I think I came back too soon from (the Aspen)  
injury and I was vulnerable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough battle. I thought I learned a lot from the  
hit last year but made the one mistake in Aspen that re-injured 
things and really sent me backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-year ski team veteran's best season was in 1994, when  
he won a World Cup downhill and was second in two. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen said he's suffering from dizzy spells and ``a real  
throbbing, pounding in my brain.'' He won't resume skiing until at 
least the spring and then will make a decision on his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to win again and I know I'm capable of it,'' Mullen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to get back to 100 percent, gather some  
information, and see how it proceeds.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks At Record Highs; Dow Up 200 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were in record high territory at midday,  
as investors continued to pour cash rinto the market. The Dow 
industrials, Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's composite indexes were 
all at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
150.88 at 9,462.07, handily beating its previous closing record 
high of 9,374.27 set on Nov. 23. By 2 p.m. EST, The Dow had gained 
more than 200 on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 19.45 at 1,264.23, on  
track to set its second consecutive record. The technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index was up 55.59 at 2,306.86, the fourth record 
in as many trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices moved higher as investors continued to shower the market  
with new cash from yearend bonuses and sales late last year. In a 
move that heartened traders and analysts, they were expanding 
Tuesday's shopping spree in computer-related stocks to nearly all 
big companies with well-known names. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Dow industrial components were led higher by General  
Motors, up 3 5/8 at 78 1/4, American Express, up 3 1/4 at 102 9/16, and IBM, 
up 3 at 192 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Only consumer stocks were lower among the Dow components.  
Coca-Cola was off 7/16 at 68 1/8. Disney was down 1/2 at 30 1/16 after 
chairman Michael Eisner said in a letter to shareholders that new 
initiatives had dragged down the entertainment company's earnings 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a strong 9-to-5 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at 441 
million shares and up sharply from Tuesday's pace of 302.28 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The breadth of the rally caught traders' attention and fueled  
optimism that it could continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are starting to say, `well,' this is much more  
significant here, there's a lot better participation,'' said 
William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald in 
Stamford, Conn. ``I see no end, in the nearterm, in sight and it's 
going to be very difficult to determine where the bubble gets 
pricked, or how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, the Commerce Department said sales of new  
single-family homes soared 7.6 percent to a record in November, 
propelled by low interest rates, unseasonable warmth and a strong 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Woodsongs Is International Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- In the genre-obsessed world of modern  
popular music there is no obvious pigeonhole for a band like Ceili 
Rain, a septet that blends elements of Celtic, folk, pop and 
Christian music. 
</P>
<P>
	That was exactly why singer Bob Halligan Jr. and the rest of his  
band were right at home when they showed up to play selections from 
their self-titled album at a recent taping of the Woodsongs 
Old-Time Radio Hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a powerful Celtic record,'' Woodsongs host Michael  
Johnathon told an audience of about 30 crammed into the Planet III 
Recording Studio. ``This is `arena Celtic.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Genre bending and blending may be anathema to major record  
labels, but it's exactly what Johnathon, a folk singer himself, 
wants on his seven-month-old show, which he likes to describe as a 
``global living room concert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Distributed by Johnathon's Lexington-based PoetMan Records USA  
label and the World Radio public network, Woodsongs currently is 
heard on 31 radio stations in the United States, as well as in 
Canada, France, Poland, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to get the audience out of the star system and  
into where real music comes from,'' Johnathon said. ``Real music is 
not pristine and it isn't clean, perfect. It is raw and gritty and 
the best music is made by unknown people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodsongs is taped each Monday evening at Planet III, a  
ramshackle private studio built in the middle of an herb garden, 
just off a busy avenue about a mile from downtown Lexington. 
Audience members line up at the door for free admission 15 minutes 
before the taping; they sit on plastic garden chairs and are 
welcome to help themselves to apple cider and homemade cookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnathon's other guest on the show that featured Ceili Rain was  
singer-songwriter Scott Robinson. Johnathon's introduction of 
Robinson prompted one audience member to break into loud applause 
and cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brought his fan with him,'' Johnathon cracked.  
</P>
<P>
	The show moves quickly and Johnathon makes an affable master of  
ceremonies, mixing songs from the performers, plugs for their 
albums and the Woodsongs website -- ``the only 
folk-American-bluegrass newscast in public radio'' -- and friendly 
banter. 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing Robinson, an acoustic balladeer who had to follow  
the fast-paced music of Ceili Rain, Johnathon recalled going to a 
Judds concert where Garth Brooks was the opening act. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got the same look in your eye as Wynonna did after  
Garth Brooks opened up,'' Johnathon told Robinson, who cradled a 
guitar as he sat in a chair in front of a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson then played a haunting song titled ``A Chance To  
Dream'' -- with the memorable refrain, ``If it weren't for the 
chance to dream of you, I'd never go to sleep'' -- and instructed 
listeners on how to get a copy of his self-produced compact disc, 
``Mellow Drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you see a '92 Prizm with the driver's side door bashed in,  
make the international sign for CD and I'll pull over and sell you 
one,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure our listeners in Holland will appreciate that,''  
Johnathon responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 41, played his first gig on the night of his high  
school graduation but didn't become a full-time musician until 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've run a Japanese restaurant, driven a garbage truck,'' he  
said after the taping. ``I hit 40 and I decided to give it a 
shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chance to play on Woodsongs ``means everything'' to him,  
Robinson said. ``It's sharing music,'' he said. ``Hopefully, people 
will find something to like about your music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Halligan, the front man for Ceili Rain, has long been a part of  
mainstream American pop, writing songs for acts as diverse as KISS, 
Judas Priest, Joan Jett and Cher. And Ceili Rain's songs have been 
recorded and made hits by other artists, including country singer 
Kathy Mattea and Christian artists Rebecca St. James and Eli. 
Halligan said Ceili Rain simply needs to bypass what he calls the 
``gatekeepers'' at the major record labels to find acceptance from 
a wide audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be in the mainstream eventually; it's just going  
to take some time to crack through. The songs are proving 
themselves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like previous appearances on Public Radio International's  
Mountain Stage and World Cafe programs, playing Woodsongs is an 
important opportunity for a band like Ceili Rain, Halligan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very exciting. Any musician likes to work smart, not  
hard, and this is a great opportunity to do that,'' he said. ``You 
can reach thousands of people in one shot, vs. 120 in a club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnathon said he wants Woodsongs to show listeners that music  
is not only a spectator sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, by having a show that is geared around so many  
wonderful, hard-working, reaching-out artists, more people feel 
like they can do it,'' he said. ``Music is not star-system 
dependent. It is dependent only on your willingness to make 
music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sort of a global lesson in how to turn the TV off,''  
he added. ``Not to sound pretentious, but really that's what it is. 
We want people to feel like they can do it.''

<HEADLINE> We're Not Firebugs, We're Artists! </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- At first, the crowd at the opening of a  
recent art exhibit looked like typical well-bred aesthetes, cocking 
their heads and rubbing their chins as they regarded the sculptures 
on display. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they went pagan -- grinning fiercely and cheering as the  
15-foot-tall works were consumed by flames. It was opening night at 
the first European Championships in Fire Sculpture, whose 
combination of the creative and destructive urges is spreading 
through the Continent from its Swedish birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedes can't lay claim to inventing fire, but they're the first  
to codify it as an art form -- not surprisingly, given the 
importance of fire in Swedish culture, from the giant celebratory 
blazes of Midsummer's Eve to the crowns of candles worn by girls on 
Santa Lucia Day in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our weather, you have to have fire to make it through,''  
said Gunnar Carl Nilsson of the Swedish Fire Sculpture Association, 
shivering in the snow-laced exhibition field under a sky already 
black at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibitors weren't just acting out latent adolescent  
pyromaniac tendencies; Nilsson's sponsoring association was at 
pains to point out that at least one member of each competing team 
had to have a genuine college degree in art or five years 
documented experience as a working artist. 
</P>
<P>
	The association knows that good art is more than  
self-indulgence, so it imposes rules: each team had to build its 
sculpture within eight hours, using only straw, twine and wooden 
supports; the sculpture must take no less than five and no more 
than 20 minutes to burn, the rules say, adding sniffily that the 
work should go up ``not like a mere bonfire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a matter of form,'' said Nilsson, a man who combines the  
powerful build of a fireman with the extensive beard of a bohemian. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting that goal is a surprising challenge. Of the nine  
sculptures that were featured in the competition, held in a field 
raked by icy winds, only a couple looked as good burning up as they 
did before the flames -- or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	The work that caught many eyes early on was an elegant sculpture  
by a Polish team that resembled the skeleton of a Viking ship. But 
the thin ropes of straw that made it a striking sight pre-fire, 
made flames burn feebly. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other end of the continuum, the assemblage by Mental  
Istid (Mental Ice Age) of Sweden of three boulderlike masses on 
long poles burned wonderfully and were cleverly constructed to fall 
open as they blazed. But the sculptures were so ugly that you would 
have wanted to set them on fire even if that hadn't been what they 
were built for, just to get rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd favorite -- it even prompted barks from some  
spectators' dogs -- was a French team's work. Intact, it was rather 
Brancusi-like, a heavy mass with pleasing curves. Once afire, the 
panels of which it was composed separated in stages, unpeeling like 
an artichoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a laugh ran through the crowd of about 500, everybody  
seeming to get the joke at once: The sculpture was an artichoke and 
the team called themselves Arti-Chaud (loosely Art and Heat). 
</P>
<P>
	Although the spectators left the hour-long show clearly pleased,  
it's unclear how much of a future fire sculpture will have. The 
artists likely can't go the usual route of getting galleries 
interested in selling their works for high prices: Someone who 
shells out thousands of dollars for a sculpture presumably wants to 
look at it for more than 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Are fire sculptors doomed to poverty and obscurity, then?  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't say that!'' Nilsson laughed. Seriously, he said, he  
thinks organizers of pageants and other outdoor events would be 
perfect customers for this sort of work -- a market ready to get 
hot.

<HEADLINE> Small-Businesses Shun Y2K Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While major corporations and government agencies  
race to prepare their computer systems for the year 2000, one-third 
of small business owners plan to do nothing, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the holdouts say the expense and the time required to  
upgrade systems and software is too heavy a burden for a small 
business to bear. The solution for many is simply to throw their 
computer out and buy a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1.5 million owners of small businesses, from accounting  
firms to restaurants to jewelry makers, said they haven't taken any 
action to prevent the dreaded millennium bug, according to the 
study by the National Federation of Independent Business, a 
small-business trade group 
</P>
<P>
	The year 2000 problem stems from the fact that many computer  
calendars are programmed to recognize just the last two digits of a 
year. Machines that haven't been upgraded are likely to interpret 
Jan. 1, 2000, as Jan. 1, 1900. That could cause massive computer 
failures, lost data, or broken connections with clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Nagle, owner of Eli's Bar and Grill in Minneapolis, isn't  
worried, although he uses computers to track his inventory and 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not flying airplanes or building pacemakers,'' Nagle  
said. ``It's not a major concern.'' Nagle expects to buy a new 
computer some time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagle sounds just like many small-business owners, said William  
Dennis, a senior research fellow at the NFIB. While some feel the 
problem is not serious enough to devote time or money to fixing, 
others aren't sure where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Price, owner of a pipe- and sewer-cleaning business in  
Binghamton, N.Y., said preparing for Y2K is more challenging for a 
small business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a big company, someone on staff is bound to be very  
computer-literate,'' he said. ``I don't have time to be a hacker 
and learn all the intricacies of my computer. If it does what I 
need it to do, I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Price has purchased a new computer with updated  
software, and he plans to buy another new one before Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-nine percent of businesses surveyed said their most  
important software was less than two years old, and another 8 
percent said their software was two to five years old. Most of this 
newer software is Y2K-compatible, or is easy to upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFIB study, conducted in late October, was an update of a  
survey done in April 1998. The study found marked improvement since 
April, with 900,000 respondents saying they had addressed the 
problem between April and October. Another 925,000 business owners 
said they have made plans to upgrade their systems. In all, 
one-third of small businesses have completed their preparations for 
Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFIB estimates one in five small businesses doesn't use a  
computer. But virtually all of them have suppliers or clients who 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smaller businesses do need to watch for the ripple effect from  
other companies they deal with,'' said Shawn Bohner, a vice 
president with Meta Group, a Stamford, Conn., consulting company 
which helps companies deal with Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Vikki Nelson, owner of Jarnel Iron &AMP; Forge in Hagerstown, Md.,  
doesn't require much technology for the wrought-iron and bronze 
fixtures she crafts. She uses her year-old computer for 
recordkeeping and for receiving architectural drawings from 
clients, and she believes she and her clients are ready for Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she worries whether her bank is prepared and whether her  
local utility will be able to supply power when the calendar 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis said the small-business owners who have yet to deal with  
the problem should start scheduling help now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something does go wrong, you will find no one to help you  
on Jan. 2, 2000,'' he said. ``The large firms are lining up the 
talent.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Trial Could Halt Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is a rare moment in Washington: Nobody  
knows if the impeachment drama will freeze the government in 
gridlock while the Senate decides whether the president stays or 
goes or if it will all end quickly in a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	One historian even suggests that lower level officialdom, with  
no one above paying much attention, might seize the initiative. 
That's what happened during a comparable period, from the spring of 
1972 to the summer of 1974, when the capital was embroiled in 
Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	All three branches of the government -- the executive,  
legislative and judicial -- are rarely involved in the same events, 
but President Clinton's impeachment trial ties them together. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will devote maximum energy to defending Clinton.  
The Senate will be conducting a trial. And the Supreme Court is 
certain to notice that its chief justice, William Rehnquist, will 
be across the street, presiding over that trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may not be the outcome at all. Some senators still are  
trying to figure out how to short-circuit the process, to have a 
quick trial that ends with a quick vote. Other senators want 
nothing less than a full-bore trial, with witnesses, 
cross-examination, presidential testimony, the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., suggests a morning-to-evening workday  
until a verdict is rendered. 
</P>
<P>
	During the House impeachment debate last month, stalemate  
scenarios were envisioned, mostly by impeachment opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said a trial could consume  
``perhaps a year.'' Paul Begala, a political adviser to the 
president, predicted that impeachment would lead to chaos. ``This 
is going to make the government shutdown look like a picnic,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government shutdowns were different: In a dispute with  
Clinton, Congress refused to provide money for the everyday 
workings of government. Top officials still came to work, but the 
foot soldiers of government were told to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the foot soldiers will plod on, doing the everyday  
work that needs no guidance from the top. 
</P>
<P>
	The country may not even notice. After all, the country has  
lived for nearly a year with the scandal and has prospered. What 
happens in Washington seems less crucial than it used to. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators say they could operate on a two-track system,  
legislation in the morning, trial in the afternoon. No dice, say 
Democrats. ``How can you have a trial impeaching the president of 
the United States and then, in the afternoon or in the morning, 
say, 'Oh, we're going to do Medicare' or 'Let's now do Social 
Security'?'' asked Sen. John Breaux, D-La., over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Political scientist Stephen Wayne of Georgetown University even  
thinks it is possible that both Clinton and congressional 
Republicans could become productive during a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see a president taking trips, going to disaster areas,  
welcoming children to the White House,'' Wayne said. ``Whatever 
presidents do, we will see the president doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if the Republicans in Congress ``want to demonstrate that  
they are not mean-spirited,'' he said, they could enact something 
like Clinton's forthcoming proposal to gave a tax break to those 
who take care of the long-term disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate historian Donald Ritchie says preoccupation with the  
president's struggle could give a free hand to lower officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalls that in 1974, William Usery Jr., head of the Federal  
Mediation and Conciliation Service,took advantage of President 
Nixon's distraction and ``pushed a very independent-minded and 
progressive labor policy.'' The new president, Gerald Ford, was 
impresssed and made Usery his secretary of labor.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Euro, Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Wednesday,  
propelled by a surge in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also managed a modest recovery against the Japanese  
yen. On Tuesday, the U.S. currency dropped to its lowest level 
against the yen in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	As the stock market reached dizzying new heights, the dollar  
picked up strength against the new European currency, which endured 
its first day of real volatility since its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell below $1.1668, the price at which it began trading  
on currency markets for the first time on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also benefited from President Clinton's announcement  
that the federal government will have a $76 billion surplus this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1592, down  
from $1.1771 late Tuesday. The dollar also was quoted at 112.66 
Japanese yen, up from 111.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were less impressed by the dollar's gains against the  
yen, saying that despite Wednesday's rocky trading, the euro is 
bound to entice more Japanese investments into Europe, which could 
eventually weaken the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a rise in Japanese government bond yields is expected to  
raise long-term rates and narrowing the interest rate gap with the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Judge Asks About AOL Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust case interrupted the trial Wednesday to ask a witness 
about comments by America Online's chairman that its planned deal 
with Netscape won't change Microsoft's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual exchange was a clear illustration of the judge's  
deep unease about how the pending $4.2 billion AOL-Netscape deal 
might affect the competitiveness of the nation's computer industry, 
the main issue in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that the deal, announced in November weeks into  
the Microsoft trial, illustrates that the computer industry remains 
viable and thus suggests that government intervention isn't needed 
to ensure competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interview published Wednesday in The Washington Post,  
AOL Chairman Steve Case said: ``AOL's merger with Netscape has no 
bearing on the Microsoft case. ... I have a lot of respect for 
Microsoft. I continue to live in fear of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the judge's questions, a Microsoft lawyer was  
questioning the government's final witness about AOL's purchase of 
Netscape, which sells browser software that competes directly with 
Microsoft's Windows to let people view information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that, starting in mid-1995, Microsoft  
sought to crush Netscape by using illegal business tactics, in part 
because it feared the popular browser software might one day 
displace the importance of its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Justice Department lawyer David Boies called the  
potential deal's impact on the antitrust case a ``red herring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is the world's largest Internet provider with more than 15  
million subscribers. So, a decision by AOL to distribute Netscape's 
browser software could dramatically boost Netscape's now-flagging 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have some relevance,'' said economist Franklin Fisher  
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the witness, who 
called the deal a ``hopeful sign'' of renewed competition. But he 
said: ``It won't have changed the fact that Microsoft took actions 
to reduce the threat from Netscape's browser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted the  
questioning, saying he read Case's comments, and briefly recessed 
the trial to find a copy of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Case told the newspaper: ``We have no flight of fancy that we  
can dent in any way, shape or form what is a monopoly in the 
operating system business. ... It's hard to imagine that PCs won't 
be the dominant way people connect with the Internet for many years 
to come, and Microsoft has a pretty amazing lock on that 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson read aloud several paragraphs, then turned to the  
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I have of you is ... is this consistent with your  
understanding of what the impact of the consortium will be, insofar 
as developing viable competition?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher replied: ``It certainly is.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is clearly preoccupied with Netscape's purchase. Last  
month, in remarkably candid comments, he said the deal ``might be a 
very significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's purchase must be approved by the Justice Department, and  
the judge agreed last month that Microsoft should be allowed to 
review the merger request. In a letter to the government made 
public Wednesday, a Microsoft lawyer wrote: ``I have not heard from 
you on the subject for more than two weeks and am anxious to move 
this matter along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL currently distributes Microsoft's browser software to its  
subscribers in exchange for Microsoft prominently including AOL's 
software within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Case has indicated he will continue to distribute Microsoft's  
browser to AOL subscribers, but Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
recently said he expects AOL to distribute Netscape ``sooner or 
later to all its online service customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyer questioned Fisher in detail later Wednesday  
about how browser software is distributed. Fisher frequently paused 
to search through four enormous binders of paperwork before 
answering. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial's slow pace clearly irked the judge. ``It's no test of  
his credibility to put him through a memory test,'' he complained 
to the Microsoft attorney.

<HEADLINE> Vikes' Carter Satisfied With Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- By the standards that used to mean a  
lot to Cris Carter, this has been a disappointing season. His worst 
since 1992, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
	He has fewer catches, fewer yards and less of a role in the  
Minnesota Vikings' offense. And he's as happy as he's ever been. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that as an offense and with all the personnel we have,  
we knew that sacrifices would have to take place,'' Carter said 
Wednesday. ``And (offensive coordinator) Brian (Billick) and I 
talked about it even before the season started. I understood that. 
I realized my role has changed somewhat. I'm very happy with my 
role, and so are the other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter wouldn't always have taken such a circumspect view. A  
fierce competitor, he has become well-known for occasional on-field 
outbursts when the Vikings' offense has sputtered. Or, more 
specifically, when it has sputtered while trying to get the ball to 
other people. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was in other seasons, with other objectives. Carter has  
amassed more individual accomplishments over the years than most 
receivers in NFL history. What he doesn't have in the twilight of 
his superlative career is a championship, and he knew from the 
start this would be his best chance. 
</P>
<P>
	He was right, and there has been nothing for any of the Vikings  
to complain about this season, especially on offense. They broke 
the NFL season scoring record, and their 15-1 record was the NFL's 
best during the regular season. They are 15-point favorites to beat 
Arizona (10-7) on Sunday and advance to the NFC championship game 
for the first time since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	And although his numbers are down -- 78 catches for 1,011 yards  
and 12 TDs -- Carter still has been a key figure in Minnesota's 
success, even though he has been bothered most of the season by a 
sore calf. He also was voted to his sixth straight Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a new level of expectation, and with Cris missing one  
game (Chicago on Dec. 6) and being hurt, it's really showed what 
kind of character he has,'' said quarterback Randall Cunningham, 
who has thrown 32 TD passes to Carter during their time together in 
Philadelphia and Minnesota. ``Cris has now gotten to a point in his 
life where he really appreciates everything he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still works hard. He's just an excellent player, one of the  
great players in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers bear that out, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	Carter's 834 receptions are fourth on the NFL's career list, and  
his 101 TD catches are second to Jerry Rice (163). He owns nearly 
every significant Vikings receiving record, including catches, 
yards (8,997) and TDs (82). 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't have the one thing that would matter most, though.  
Matching the most regular season victories in NFL history hasn't 
filled the void of not winning a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick has felt the sharpest sting of Carter's temper over the  
years. A cerebral coordinator who was criticized early in his 
tenure for trying too hard to force diversity on the Vikings' 
offense, Billick and Carter have clashed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The last display, a sideline blowup against the New York Jets  
last season, helped the Vikings decide to bump Billick and 
defensive coordinator Foge Fazio up to the press box for the 
season's final five games. 
</P>
<P>
	The coordinators have been back on the sideline this season, and  
all has been harmonious. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick points to a training camp moment before the 1997 season  
that signaled, for the most part, a more understanding relationship 
with Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He goes, `You know, Brian, whether you realize it or not, you  
and I are married. And neither one of us is going anyplace. There 
is no divorce here,''' Billick said. ``And that meant a lot to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing what was coming this season after the Vikings drafted  
receiver Randy Moss in April, Billick and Carter sat down during 
training camp to talk, as they usually do before each season. This 
time, Billick mapped out what he envisioned as the statistics each 
offensive player would put up this fall, just to show Carter what 
he would gain in team success by giving up some of his own 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at it now, it's amazing how scary on we were,''  
Billick said. ``And I mainly did that for him to see in black and 
white what I thought those numbers were going to be. But he was OK 
with that, and he would be as long as we're producing.''

<HEADLINE>  Receiver Boston To Join Dad in NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- With few school records left to be broken  
and little left to prove, wide receiver David Boston said Wednesday 
he'll pass up his senior season at Ohio State to make himself 
available for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-team All-American from Humble, Texas, said he was  
uncertain when he might be taken, but added, ``I feel I'm a sure 
first-rounder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His presence in the pros will create an interesting problem. His  
father, Byron Boston, is a line judge in his fourth year in the 
league. It will be the first time that the NFL has had to 
reschedule games to prevent an official working games involving his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a unique situation,'' said Dean Blandino, who  
works in the league's officiating division. ``I think what they're 
going to do, he just won't be assigned to any game in which David 
could play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the younger Boston came two days before  
underclassmen must declare their intention to be included in the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State is awaiting word from linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, a  
third-team All-American. Katzenmoyer reportedly has met with Ohio 
State defensive coordinator Fred Pagac and is still mulling his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just ready for a new challenge,'' Boston said during a  
news conference. ``I've accomplished a lot here at Ohio State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston set Ohio State records for receptions in a game (14),  
season (85) and career (191), receiving yards in a season (1,435) 
and career (2,855) and touchdown catches in a career (34). 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman, he caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Joe  
Germaine with 19 seconds left in the 1997 Rose Bowl to give the 
Buckeyes a 20-17 victory over second-ranked Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio State's 24-14 victory over Texas A&AMP;M in this year's  
Sugar Bowl, Boston had 11 catches for 105 yards and was selected as 
the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother said the first time her son brought up playing in the  
NFL was during a visit home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He vaguely mentioned it during the season while watching a pro  
game on TV at home,'' Carolyn Boston said. ``He said something 
like, `It would be awesome to do this.' But I didn't really think 
anything of it. When he approached us again over the holidays, then 
we sat down and talked about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only after the Sugar Bowl victory did Boston begin talking to  
close friends and the Ohio State coaching staff and then sit down 
with his family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough decision,'' he said. ``I had to do a lot  
of thinking this past week. It was a rough week for me.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Figure Welcomes Launch of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Describing the first days of trading in the  
new unified European currency as ``strikingly smooth,'' Michel 
Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary fund, 
welcomed the successful launch of the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is testament, indeed, to the vision, professionalism and  
dedication of all those involved at both the European Union and 
national levels,'' Camdessus said in a statement Wednesday. ``It 
has also been a model of cooperation and partnership between public 
and private sectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in the euro began on Monday. On Wednesday, the euro was  
worth about $1.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said the launch of the euro -- which combines the  
currencies of 11 European nations -- is a ``historic event for 
Europe and for the international monetary system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said if European Monetary Union is to achieve its full  
promise, then the participating nations must meet difficult 
challenges such as balancing their budgets. The nations are France, 
Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Finland, Ireland, Belgium, 
Austria, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said the euro can play ``a key role'' in broadening  
and deepening Europe's capital markets by offering new 
opportunities to ``savers and borrowers the world over.''

<HEADLINE> Carotid Artery May Show Health Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Thickening of the carotid artery walls in the neck is a more  
powerful predictor of a heart attack or stroke in elderly people 
than high cholesterol or high blood pressure, researchers reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in the New England Journal of Medicine used ultrasound  
measurements of the two carotid arteries in people over 65 with no 
history of heart disease or stroke-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultrasound can detect cumulative damage to the blood vessels  
before the patient experiences any symptoms, said the study's lead 
author, Dr. Daniel O'Leary, chairman of radiology at Tufts-New 
England Medical Center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've clearly shown in the older age group that this is the  
single most powerful predictor of future heart attack or stroke,'' 
O'Leary said. ``It's clearly a screening test that ought to be done 
once'' at 65, or possibly earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the United States, claiming  
about 500,000 lives each year. Stroke kills an additional 160,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and  
Blood Institute, which financed the study, said ultrasound has 
great potential to prevent heart attacks and strokes in seemingly 
healthy people. 
</P>
<P>
	``By identifying high-risk patients, ultrasound would allow  
doctors to provide aggressive treatment early,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a Yale University cardiologist, said  
ultrasounds probably should not be given to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholesterol tests and blood pressure readings are cheaper and  
also tell doctors what they should treat, Krumholz said. Obesity, 
lack of exercise and smoking are other major risk factors for which 
treatment is straightforward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not clear to me in most cases (ultrasound) would change  
the way patients are treated,'' he said. ``The tests are probably 
most useful in patients who might have one risk factor, such as 
moderately high cholesterol, when doctors are trying to decide how 
aggressively to treat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two carotid arteries carry blood from the heart to the  
brain. An ultrasound to measure them in the neck costs about $250, 
O'Leary said. The tests are not done routinely now. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 4,476 Medicare recipients with an average  
age of 72. 
</P>
<P>
	None had a history of heart attacks, angina, bypass surgery,  
angioplasty, stroke, or surgery to widen a carotid artery. 
</P>
<P>
	An average of six years later, the 20 percent with the thickest  
artery walls had more than three times the risk of suffering a 
heart attack or stroke as the 20 percent with the thinnest artery 
walls, even after other risk factors such as high cholesterol, 
diabetes and smoking were taken into account.

<HEADLINE> Miami Hopes Tanner Lessens DL Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- There was no one happier on the Miami  
Dolphins than Zach Thomas when teammate Tim Bowens ended his 
contract dispute in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability of Bowens to tie up two opposing blockers has been a  
key to Thomas leading the team in tackles each of his three seasons 
in Miami. Thomas has averaged 163 tackles during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Miami's All-Pro linebacker is hoping Barron Tanner can do  
the job just as well when the Dolphins visit Denver for Saturday's 
AFC divisional playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping B.T. does the same thing,'' Thomas said Wednesday.  
``I think we'll be all right. B.T. plays half the game anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowens, Miami's only Pro Bowl selection, became the second Miami  
defensive lineman in as many weeks to suffer a season-ending injury 
when he tore a biceps muscle in the Dolphins' 24-17 wild-card win 
over Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	One week earlier, pass-rushing end Jason Taylor broke his  
collarbone against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to Miami's stockpiling of defensive linemen, the  
Dolphins still will have a full rotation against Denver. Coach 
Jimmy Johnson has kept nine defensive linemen on the roster all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a smart move by us,'' said Shane Burton, who will  
start his second consecutive game at left end. ``Now it's paying 
off at the end when it's most crucial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most teams, losing two top linemen would be crippling.  
Buffalo played just five defensive linemen last week, hampered even 
further when nose tackle Ted Washington wore down in the second 
half. He was on the sideline catching his breath when the Dolphins 
scored what turned out to be the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's desperation went so far as to bring Charles  
Haley out of retirement. Nearly three years after winning helping 
Dallas win the 1996 Super Bowl for his fifth championship ring, he 
played several downs in the 49ers' victory over Green Bay last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's situation means playing time for Daniel Stubbs, a  
10-year veteran who played with two Super Bowl winners with San 
Francisco and had nine sacks for Miami in 1996. He's been active 
for just five games this year, but has ample experience in the 
Dolphins' system. 
</P>
<P>
	``That helps,'' end Trace Armstrong, Miami's pass-rush  
specialist, said. ``That's the whole line of reasoning in keeping 
nine. Injuries happen. When they do, we have somebody in there that 
knows the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins still were forced to do some shuffling, with right  
tackle Daryl Gardener the only lineman to remain in the same spot. 
Rookie starter Kenny Mixon shifted to Taylor's right end position 
from the left. Burton moved in at left end, and Tanner makes his 
first career start. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton can spell Gardener or Tanner inside on passing downs.  
Armstrong, Stubbs and rookie swingman Lorenzo Bromell fill out the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the revamped lineup can bottle up Denver's 2,000-yard  
rusher, Terrell Davis, the way Miami did last month remains to be 
seen. Davis was held to 29 yards in the Dolphins' 31-21 victory 
Dec. 21, and the Broncos are looking forward to reasserting 
superiority up front. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got players missing right now, and I'm sure they'll try  
to take advantage of that,'' Mixon said. ``We'll try to do it the 
same way we did the first time. We've already shown we can play 
with these guys.''

<HEADLINE> Time for Jordan To Decide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The end of the lockout signals more than the  
chance for players to pull on their shorts, lace up their shoes and 
just play ball in an abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's time for the game's greatest and most important player to  
make a decision that will affect this season and perhaps many to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	Does Michael Jordan return or does he retire?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not placing any odds on what M.J. might do, what he ain't  
going to do,'' Ron Harper, Jordan's friend and teammate, said after 
NBA players ratified a new deal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever choice Michael Jordan makes will be best for him and  
what he wants to do in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's return for a 14th season could mean more than just a  
shot at a seventh title for the Chicago Bulls. It would certainly 
give a league with a tarnished reputation a player who disgusted 
fans still want to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	TV ratings and advertising dollars will be impacted by Jordan's  
return or departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lockout probably won't have any effect on the ratings  
until the postseason,'' said Steve Grubbs of BBDO Worldwide 
Advertising. ``Michael Jordan's return may have a bigger impact 
than anything. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has delayed until after the lockout giving his final word  
on whether he will retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he might keep everyone guessing for another couple of  
weeks while he enjoys more time on a sun-splashed golf course. He 
was reported Wednesday to be playing in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	He might, as his buddy Charles Barkley predicted last month,  
walk away from the game he has ruled. A second retirement, this one 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
	He could, as his brother suggested in November, be enticed by a  
short season and return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no gut feeling on it,'' agent David Falk said Wednesday  
from New York as players -- his famous client not among them -- 
gathered to approve the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision. I'm not certain what his 
time frame is,'' Falk added. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two months shy of his 36th birthday, Jordan is a free  
agent who can sign with any team. But none could pay him as much as 
the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, a grandfather clause allows any player to  
re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous salary. That 
means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, could get about 
$34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to go about talking about Michael first,'' Bulls  
coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd said. ``If that does happen, which is 
the best-case scenario, we can really try to put a team together 
than can contend for a seventh championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan owns 10 scoring titles, five MVP awards, six NBA Finals  
MVPs and the highest playoff scoring average in history. Along with 
Muhammad Ali, he's the most recognizable athlete in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league could survive without him, but it would really be a  
setback,'' said Bulls center Bill Wennington, also a free agent. 
``People love to watch him play. I love to watch him play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right after the Bulls won their sixth title last June, Jordan  
reflected on a life without the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't miss it at all, as much as you may think,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I may have some (nostalgia) when it comes back to this  
time of the season, but I've got enough memories to suffice and 
overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have another life. And I know I have to get to it at some  
point in time. Hopefully the fans and the people understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some scenarios:  
</P>
<P>
	--HE STAYS: A shortened season of 50 games would be easier  
physically and mentally, creating a shorter path to another 
championship. The abbreviated season -- if the one played out in the 
NHL in 1995 following labor strife is an indication -- would be one 
of the most competitive ever because every game would mean more. 
That type of basketball is what Jordan relishes most, where every 
game has playoff ramifications. And why leave when he's still the 
best player in the game, even as he approaches 36? 
</P>
<P>
	--HE GOES: He's fed up with the haggling after all he's done for  
the game, including an early role in the negotiations, and ready to 
move on. He said he wouldn't play for any coach except Phil 
Jackson, but backed off and said he'd play for anyone he wanted. 
Floyd might not be that coach. In a rushed three-week training camp 
with unsettled rosters, there would be little time for Jordan and 
Floyd to get used to each another. Scottie Pippen's future will 
also be a factor. And it would be difficult for Jordan to top his 
performance in the Game 6 last June against Utah: a driving basket 
to get the Bulls close, a steal from Karl Malone and then a 
game-winning shot. Vintage. A fitting way to leave. He's got golf 
and business to satisfy his competitive cravings. Money? Need you 
ask?

<HEADLINE>  Receiver Boston To Join Dad in NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- With few school records left to be broken  
and little left to prove, wide receiver David Boston said Wednesday 
he'll pass up his senior season at Ohio State to make himself 
available for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-team All-American from Humble, Texas, said he was  
uncertain when he might be taken, but added, ``I feel I'm a sure 
first-rounder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His presence in the pros will create an interesting problem. His  
father, Byron Boston, is a line judge in his fourth year in the 
league. It will be the first time that the NFL has had to 
reschedule games to prevent an official working games involving his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a unique situation,'' said Dean Blandino, who  
works in the league's officiating division. ``I think what they're 
going to do, he just won't be assigned to any game in which David 
could play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the younger Boston came two days before  
underclassmen must declare their intention to be included in the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State is awaiting word from linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, a  
third-team All-American. Katzenmoyer reportedly has met with Ohio 
State defensive coordinator Fred Pagac and is still mulling his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just ready for a new challenge,'' Boston said during a  
news conference. ``I've accomplished a lot here at Ohio State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston set Ohio State records for receptions in a game (14),  
season (85) and career (191), receiving yards in a season (1,435) 
and career (2,855) and touchdown catches in a career (34). 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman, he caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Joe  
Germaine with 19 seconds left in the 1997 Rose Bowl to give the 
Buckeyes a 20-17 victory over second-ranked Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio State's 24-14 victory over Texas A&AMP;M in this year's  
Sugar Bowl, Boston had 11 catches for 105 yards and was selected as 
the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother said the first time her son brought up playing in the  
NFL was during a visit home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He vaguely mentioned it during the season while watching a pro  
game on TV at home,'' Carolyn Boston said. ``He said something 
like, `It would be awesome to do this.' But I didn't really think 
anything of it. When he approached us again over the holidays, then 
we sat down and talked about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only after the Sugar Bowl victory did Boston begin talking to  
close friends and the Ohio State coaching staff and then sit down 
with his family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough decision,'' he said. ``I had to do a lot  
of thinking this past week. It was a rough week for me.''

<HEADLINE> Rose To Coach in Independent League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pete Rose is returning to baseball, as  
a hitting instructor for an independent minor league team that 
isn't covered by the ban imposed on baseball's hit king in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Portner, owner of the expansion Sacramento Steelheads of  
the Western League, said Tuesday that Rose had turned down an offer 
to manage the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	But Portner said Rose agreed to sign a personal services  
contract that will include participating in three to four days of 
hitting clinics for Steelhead players in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose will also throw out the first pitch at the Steelheads home  
opener on May 28 and make a variety of other appearances during the 
team's 90-game schedule, Portner added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do a Pete Rose golf tournament for charity in  
Sacramento, an evening with season ticket holders with Pete Rose 
and baseball clinics for kids of Sacramento, things like that,'' 
Portner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the amount of money that will be paid to Rose had not  
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to put together a list of all the things I would like  
him to do and we will package it all up to determine the value of 
it,'' Portner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was banned from baseball in 1989 by then-commissioner Bart  
Giamatti for allegedly betting on games while managing the 
Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's banishment does not extend to the Western League, which  
operates outside of Major League Baseball's farm system and is 
roughly equivalent to Class A minor league ball. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 24-year playing career, Rose set records for most  
hits, games played and at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Portner said Rose decided that he had too many other commitments  
to manage the Steelheads this season, but Portner said he would ask 
Rose to manage the team next year.

<HEADLINE> NY Heroine Honored in Two Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSABLE FORKS, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman who hid and protected her  
badly beaten neighbor after a violent, two hour sexual assault will 
be honored by two nearby Adirondack towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniella Smith, 24, was watching television with her children  
Nov. 21 when her 64-year-old neighbor banged on her window. The 
woman was naked, terrified and bleeding heavily from a gash on her 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith wrapped the woman in a blanket, bandaged her wound with  
towels and hid her in the kitchen at the back of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a telephone, Smith ran outside to get help when she was  
approached by John L. Rouse, the man charged with the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times on three occasions, Smith told Rouse the woman had  
run off. When the man finally drove away, Smith rushed to a 
neighbor's home to use the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daniella is a true hero,'' Thomas Douglas, supervisor of Jay  
Town, about 120 miles north of Albany, said Tuesday. ``I think she 
saved the life of a human being who wouldn't have stood much of a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rouse, 26, was arrested and charged with rape, robbery and  
possession of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay officials have scheduled a ceremony to honor Smith on  
Thursday. The nearby town of Black Brook has planned a similar 
honor for later in the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a beacon of hope. Usually, people run away when  
something like this happens,'' Black Brook Town Supervisor Steve 
Godlweski said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that I deserve all this,'' Smith said. ``I did  
what I was supposed to do, and I would do it again. I'm hoping if 
something ever happened to me, someone would help.''

<HEADLINE> Antibiotics-Coated Catheters Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coating catheters with antibiotics can greatly reduce a major  
source of infection among hospital patients, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Catheters are extremely thin, flexible tubes used to introduce  
drugs, anesthesia or food into a patient via a blood vessel. They 
may be used for a few hours or remain in place for weeks during 
treatment for heart disease, cancer and other major diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	From 150,000 to 200,000 Americans are infected each year when  
germs are accidentally introduced into the bloodstream by a 
catheter. An estimated 25 percent die. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers are experimenting with bonding antibacterial  
agents to catheters to try to cut the rate of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine compared  
catheters saturated inside and out with the antibiotics minocycline 
and rifampin to catheters coated on the outside only with two 
antibacterial agents -- chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one catheter-related infection occurred among the 350  
patients who got catheters impregnated with minocycline and 
rifampin, compared with 13 among the 370 patients who got catheters 
coated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Both types of catheters led to lower infection rates than other  
studies have found in catheters without antibacterial agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Dr. Rabih Darouiche of Baylor College of  
Medicine in Houston and Dr. Issam Raad of the University of Texas 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The two men invented the technology 
for impregnating catheters with minocycline and rifampin and earn 
royalties as a result.

<HEADLINE> Autoworkers' Profit-Share Could Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A strong market and automakers' cost cutting  
measures could equal record profit-sharing payments for U.S. 
autoworkers in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a great year for profit-sharing,'' Thomas  
Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler unit, told 
The Detroit News for a story Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler's profit-sharing checks averaged $4,600 last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Record North American profits of $3.6 billion through September  
and a 1.1 percent gain in U.S. sales last year are boosting 
prospects that Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. workers will see bonuses 
topping 1997's record $4,400. 
</P>
<P>
	However, General Motors Corp.'s 1998 profit-sharing payments  
will be ``significantly impacted'' by the United Auto Worker's 
54-day strikes last summer, Ronald Zarrella, president of GM-North 
America, told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Other payments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Workers at Toyota Motors Corp.'s Georgetown, Ky., plants  
collected record 1998 bonuses of $2,600, up from $2,300 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 10,000 workers at Honda Motor Co. plants in central Ohio  
received record checks of $4,519 in November, up from $4,306 in 
1997.

holiday bonuses of $1,800 each.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Chandler Finally a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Sure, the Atlanta Falcons were in desperate  
need of a quarterback for the 1997 season. But Chris Chandler? 
</P>
<P>
	The guy was nothing more than an injury waiting to happen, so  
fragile that he was nicknamed ``Chris Chandelier.'' There had to be 
a reason he bounced around to five teams in his first nine seasons, 
suffering the ultimate ignominy of being cut by the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers during a 3-13 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one really knew the story about Chris,'' running back Jamal  
Anderson said, remembering when he heard the Falcons acquired 
Chandler in a trade almost two years ago. ``When he arrives here, 
we're all like, `We traded for him? He's going to be our 
quarterback?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, at least the Falcons didn't have to give up a whole lot to  
pry Chandler away from the then-Houston Oilers. A couple of low 
draft picks -- one in the fourth round, the other in the sixth -- was 
all it took. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, it only took one workout for Chandler to convince Anderson  
and receiver Terance Mathis that he was quarterback who could 
finally lead the Falcons to the NFL's promised land. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff George was here before him, so we were used to a  
quarterback who had a great arm,'' Anderson said. ``When Chris 
comes in and starts throwing the ball around, me and Terance are 
like, `Whoa! What's happening here? There are other teams who 
didn't want this guy? We love him.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves, who engineered the steal -- uh, make that deal  
-- with the Oilers, thought he was getting an adequate quarterback 
who could hold down the starting job until somebody better came 
along. Instead, he wound up with a full-fledged star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around some great ones -- John Elway, Roger Staubach,  
Danny White, Phil Simms -- but I don't think I've ever seen a 
quarterback who is any more accurate throwing the ball, 
particularly deep,'' Reeves said. ``He was definitely underrated by 
me. I had no idea that Chris was as good a football players as he 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A mere 10 years into his career, Chandler became an overnight  
sensation with the Falcons, leading them to respectability last 
season and the NFC West championship this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Anderson, he is probably the most integral component  
of Atlanta's greatest year ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of satisfaction,'' said Chandler, who leads the  
Falcons (14-2) into an NFC divisional playoff against San Francisco 
on Saturday. ``I'm in a situation where I feel like everything I've 
gotten in this league, I've really had to earn. I haven't had a lot 
given to me. It's very rewarding to be in this situation I'm in 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was the second-rated quarterback in the NFL last  
season, earning his first Pro Bowl appearance despite a series of 
injuries that knocked him out of four games and kept him out of two 
others altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons saw enough to build their team around the  
33-year-old Chandler, signing him to a four-year, $25 million 
contract extension that will keep him in Atlanta through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, despite missing two more games because of injuries,  
Chandler showed it was a wise investment. He was voted to another 
Pro Bowl over stars such as Brett Favre and Troy Aikman, throwing 
for 3,154 yards and 25 touchdowns, both career highs. Chandler also 
had the highest rating of his career (100.9), ranking fourth in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a great fit for us,'' Reeves said. ``He loves  
what we're doing and we love to construct our offense around what 
he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to displaying one of the league's strongest, most  
accurate arms, Chandler has taken great strides to dispel the 
perception that he's too fragile to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, he seems to be a little too courageous for his own  
good, stubbornly refusing to get rid of the ball until the last 
possible second and subjecting himself to some brutal hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while I might hold on to the ball a little bit  
and take a hit or two that maybe I shouldn't,'' Chandler conceded. 
``But when you start looking at the rush, that's when you start 
throwing interceptions. And those are even worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons gave up 53 sacks this season, a total exceeded by  
only five other teams. Chandler was on the receiving end of all but 
eight, but he shows no willingness to change his style. 
</P>
<P>
	``On some of the touchdowns he's thrown, you can see after he  
releases the ball that he's just getting smashed,'' Mathis said. 
``But he'd rather sit in there to make the play and suffer the 
consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons can live with that.

<HEADLINE> Aides: White House Wants Early Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking a weapon in the court of public  
opinion, White House advisers are discussing a strategy to stage an 
early vote in the Senate to show that the two-thirds majority 
required to remove President Clinton from office doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential advisers said such a vote, even if it failed, would  
give Clinton's defenders a potent political weapon if Republicans 
press ahead with a plan to present witnesses and evidence at a 
lengthy trial that the public has indicated it does not want. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we show the two-thirds is not there, the message is it's  
just a show trial with no chance of conviction. And every day we 
can remind the public of that,'' said one White House official, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Much depends on the format the Republican Senate majority  
chooses for the first trial of president in 130 years and what 
rules are put in place. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called 
Wednesday night for a ``full trial'' with details still to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton faces two articles of impeachment accusing him of  
perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice in his 
efforts to conceal an affair with former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential advisers said while no final decisions have been  
made, a ``test vote'' could be forced in several ways. If the 
Senate adopts rules used in past impeachment trials, a motion for 
such a sentiment could be approved by a simple majority -- 51 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	One White House official said presidential lawyers have  
discussed presenting, at the start of the trial, a comprehensive, 
single motion to dismiss the case against Clinton on a variety of 
grounds -- that the case doesn't meet the constitutional test of 
``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' that the evidence doesn't support 
the charges, and possibly that the articles were improperly 
approved by a lame-duck House. 
</P>
<P>
	If that motion isn't made or it is kept from a vote, an outside  
adviser to the White House said, a Democratic senator could make a 
motion to table or adjourn the trial before evidence is presented. 
</P>
<P>
	This adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the test  
vote has become a key part of an evolving White House strategy. 
Losing the vote isn't a concern as long as 34 or more senators -- 
enough to block conviction -- support the motion, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see such a vote as a de facto end to any trial, a de facto  
acquittal if you will,'' the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who support a full trial with witnesses already have  
a well-honed argument for going forward; it's unfair to predict how 
senators will vote until they've heard all the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to read a cold record, an un-cross-examined  
record, and another thing to listen to the witness, to hear them 
cross-examined, to find out the holes in their stories,'' Sen. Rick 
Santorum, R-Pa., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential aides, however, are banking that public approval of  
Clinton's job performance and public opposition to a trial will 
work to Clinton's favor once a test vote on the Senate floor shows 
there aren't enough votes to convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, the White House is being careful to avoid any  
suggestion it is trying to pressure the Senate. ``The president is 
looking for a process that is fair, bipartisan and expeditious,'' 
press secretary Joe Lockhart said Wednesday. ``We'll prefer to let 
the Senate do its business and let the Senate know on an informal 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In private, White House lawyers are developing a lengthy and  
aggressive legal defense if the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The test vote emerged from a plan that was developed by Sens.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and floated 
by Lott a week ago.

<HEADLINE> Surprise Witness in Del. Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A mistress of a wealthy lawyer on trial  
for murder sped into her driveway in late June 1996 and let out a 
``gut-wrenching sob,'' a neighbor of the woman testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Kim Johnson's surprise testimony Tuesday may bolster  
the defense of Thomas Capano, who claims it was his jealous 
mistress, Deborah MacIntyre -- and not he -- who is to blame for the 
June 27, 1996 killing of Anne Marie Fahey. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano has said that after Ms. Fahey was accidentally shot at  
his home, he sent Ms. MacIntyre home and began preparing to dispose 
of Ms. Fahey's body to protect himself and his lover. Ms. MacIntyre 
denies the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Johnson couldn't remember the exact night she saw  
Ms. MacIntyre's car come speeding into her driveway, she said it 
was about 11:45 p.m. -- which matches Capano's story -- and that it 
was a night in late June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Ms. MacIntyre stumbled from her car and issued a  
``gut-wrenching sob'' before running into her house. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, Mrs. Johnson said, ``a terrible sort of an anguished sob  
as she sort of fell out of the car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, is accused of murdering Ms. Fahey, the governor's  
scheduling secretary, and burying her body at sea. Prosecutors say 
he killed her because she wanted to end their secret affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano maintains that Ms. MacIntyre found him and Ms. Fahey  
together at his house and accidentally fired a gunshot that killed 
the young woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Johnson said she only approached defense lawyer Eugene  
Maurer about two weeks ago with her story, after she saw reports of 
Capano's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she does not know the Capanos and only knows Ms.  
MacIntyre because the woman's daughter used to baby sit for her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Ferris Wharton attempted to discredit Mrs. Johnson's  
testimony by noting that she could not remember the day and refused 
to allow investigators -- who learned of her story Monday night -- to 
see the bedroom from which she said she saw Ms. MacIntyre drive up.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Clinton Aide Gets Investment Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Erskine Bowles, a former White House chief of  
staff, has joined Forstmann Little as a general partner with a 
significant ownership position in the New York investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, Bowles returned to his former investment firm  
Carousel Capital in North Carolina after deciding against 
campaigning for governor of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowles will continue as a partner with Carousel Capital, the  
firm he co-founded in 1996 with Nelson Schwab. Bowles, who left the 
White House in October because he wanted to spend more time in 
North Carolina, will have to split his time between his home state 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new alliance with Forstmann Little, Carousel will focus  
on medium-size investments and Forstmann Little will pursue larger 
companies. Forstmann Little, which owns companies like Gulfstream 
Aerospace, General Instrument, and Dr. Pepper, will put $50 million 
into Carousel Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Carousel's current investors include Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank  
of America and First Union, as well as more than 60 corporate chief 
executives. Carousel Capital has investments in companies such as 
Critical Care Concepts Inc. and ManagedCareUSA Inc.

<HEADLINE> Text of Speaker Hastert's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of remarks prepared for delivery Wednesday by Rep. Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., on his election as speaker of the House: 
</P>
<P>
	To you, the members of the 106th Congress, to my family, friends  
and constituents, I say thank you. This is not a job I sought, but 
it is one I embrace with determination and enthusiasm. In the next 
few minutes I will share with you how I plan to carry out the job 
you have given me. 
</P>
<P>
	First, let me take a moment to say goodbye to a member of this  
House who has made history. Newt, this institution has been forever 
transformed by your presence. For years to come, all Americans will 
benefit from the changes you have championed -- a balanced budget, 
welfare reform, tax relief. In fact, this week families all over 
America are beginning to calculate their taxes and, to help them, 
they will find a child tax credit made possible by the Congress you 
led. Thank you, Newt. Good luck. And God bless you in your new 
endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	Those of you here in this House know me, but ``Hastert'' is not  
exactly a household name across America, so our fellow citizens 
deserve to know who I am and what I'm going to do. What I am is a 
former high school teacher, a wrestling and football coach, small 
businessman and state legislator. For the last 12 years I have been 
a member of this House. I am indebted to the people of the 14th 
District of Illinois who have continued to send me here to 
represent them. I believe in limited government, but when 
government does act, it must be for the good of the people. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving in this body is a privilege, not a right, and each of us  
was sent here to conduct the people's business. I intend to get 
down to business. That means formulating, debating and voting on 
legislation that addresses the problems the American people want 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the turbulent days behind us, debate on the merits often gave  
way to personal attacks. Some here have felt slighted, insulted or 
ignored. That is wrong, and that will change. 
</P>
<P>
	Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness.  
They can be found in an environment in which we trust one another's 
word; where we generate heat and passion, but where we recognize 
that each member is equally important to our overall mission of 
improving the life of the American people. In short, I believe all 
of us -- regardless of party -- can respect one another, even as we 
fiercely disagree on particular issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of people who find ways to work together across the  
political fence, let me bring the analogy to a personal level. Two 
good Illinois friends of mine, George Ryan, the Republican 
governor-elect, and Richard Daley, the Democratic mayor of Chicago, 
are in the visitor's gallery and I'll ask them to stand to be 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know me well will tell you I am true to my word. To me  
a commitment is a commitment. What you see and hear today is what 
you will see and hear tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows me better than my family. My wife, Jean, and our  
sons, Josh and Ethan, are here today. They are my reason for being. 
Jean helps me keep my feet on the ground. She and the boys are my 
daily reminder that home is on the Fox River, not the Potomac 
River. To Jean, Josh and Ethan, thank you for everything. I love 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teacher, I explained the story of America year after year.  
I soon came to realize that it was a story, but a story that keeps 
changing, for we Americans are a restless people. We like to tackle 
and solve problems. And we are constantly renewing our nation -- 
experimenting and creating new ways of doing thing. I like to work 
against a backdrop of American basics: freedom, liberty, 
responsibility, opportunity. You can count on me to be a workhorse. 
</P>
<P>
	My experience as a football and wrestling coach taught me some  
other lessons that apply here. A good coach knows when to step back 
and let others shine in the spotlight. President Reagan for years 
had a plaque in his office that said it all: ``There is no limit to 
what can be accomplished if you don't mind who gets the credit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A good coach doesn't rely on only a few star players. Everyone  
on the squad has something to offer. You never get to the finals 
without a well-rounded team. Above all, a coach worth his salt will 
instill in his team a sense of fair play, camaraderie, respect for 
the game and for the opposition. Without those, victory is hollow, 
and defeat represents opportunities lost. I've found this to be 
true around here, too. 
</P>
<P>
	So, where do we go from here?  
</P>
<P>
	Some media pundits say that we'll have two years of stalemate  
because the Republican majority is so small. Some say that a White 
House bent on revenge will not give us a moment's peace. And some 
say the minority in this House will prevent passage of serious 
legislation so they can later claim this was a ``do-nothing'' 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington is a town of rumors, guesses and speculation, so none  
of this comes as a surprise. But none of it needs to come true. 
That is, if we really respect the voters who sent us here. 
</P>
<P>
	To my Republican colleagues, I say: It is time to put forward  
the major elements of our legislative program. We will succeed or 
fail depending upon how sensible a program we offer. 
</P>
<P>
	To my Democratic colleagues, I say: I will meet you halfway,  
maybe more so on occasion, but cooperation is a two-way street, and 
I expect you to meet me halfway, too. The president and a number of 
Democrats here in the House have been saying it is time to address 
several issues head-on. I'll buy that, but I think we should agree 
that stalemate is not an option; solutions are. 
</P>
<P>
	To all my colleagues, I say: We must get our job done, and done  
now. We have an obligation to pass all the appropriation bills by 
this summer, and we will not leave this chamber until we do. 
</P>
<P>
	I intend to be a good listener, but I want to hear ideas and the  
debate that flows from them. I will have a low tolerance for 
campaign speeches masquerading as debate, whatever the source. Our 
country faces four big challenges which we must address. Not next 
month, or next year, or the year after that, but now. Each 
challenge involves an element of our security. 
</P>
<P>
	First is retirement and health security. Both our Social  
Security and Medicare programs will run into brick walls in a few 
years if we don't do something about them now. We must make sure 
that Social Security is there for those who depend upon it and 
those who expect to. We must also consider options for younger 
workers so they can look forward to an even brighter retirement. 
Nearly a year ago, President Clinton came here to give his State of 
the Union address. He called for reform of Social Security. This 
year, I invite him to return to give us his reform plan. He has my 
assurance that it will be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, we must insure a secure future for America's children by  
insisting that every child has a good school in a safe environment. 
In my 16 years as a teacher, I learned that most of the decisions 
having to do with education are best left to the people closest to 
the situation: parents, teachers and local school boards. What 
should the federal government's role be? It should be to see that 
as many education dollars as possible go directly to the 
classrooms, where they will do the most good. 
</P>
<P>
	Next is economic security. In the early '80s we adopted policies  
that laid the foundation for long-term growth. Except for one brief 
period, that growth has continued ever since, and we want our 
economy to keep right on growing. Toward that end, it is time for 
us in Congress to put a microscope to the ways the government takes 
money from our fellow citizens and how it spends it. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a culture here in Washington that has grown  
unchallenged for too long. It combines three notions. One is that 
government has a prior claim to the earnings of all Americans, as 
if they worked for the government and not the other way around. 
Another notion is that a government program, once begun, will never 
end. The third notion is that every program must grow with each 
passing year. Well, to borrow a musical line, it isn't necessarily 
so. At least it won't be if I have anything to say about it. We 
must measure every dollar we spend by this criterion: Is it really 
necessary? 
</P>
<P>
	This is important. For most Americans, money doesn't come easy.  
I know. When I was a kid, to make ends meet, my dad had a feed 
business and worked nights in a restaurant. My mom raised chickens 
and sold the eggs. When tax time came around, our family really 
felt it. What we need is a leaner, more efficient government, along 
with tax policies that spur and sustain growth by giving tax relief 
to all working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, there is the challenge of America's security in a world  
of danger and uncertainty. Without it, the other elements of our 
security will not be possible. We no longer worry about Soviet 
nuclear bombs raining down on us. Today, there are different 
worries: the sudden violence of a terrorist bomb; the silent threat 
of biological weapons; or the rogue state that aims a deadly 
missile at one of our cities. We need a defense capability that 
matches these turn-of-the-century threats. We have asked the men 
and women of our armed forces to take on assignments in many 
corners of the earth. Yet, we have not been giving them the best 
equipment or preparation they need to match all those assignments. 
That must be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	These are not Democratic or Republican issues. They are American  
issues. We should be able to reach agreement quickly on the goals. 
Yes, we will argue about the means, but if we are in earnest about 
our responsibilities, we will find common ground and get the job 
done. In the process, we will build the people's faith in the 
United States Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	As a classroom teacher and coach I learned the value of brevity.  
I learned that it is work, not talk, that wins championships. In 
closing, I want you to know I am proud to have been chosen by you 
to be your speaker. There is a big job ahead for all of us, so I 
ask that God bless this House as we move forward together. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, let us bring an end to talk and get to work. I recognize  
the dean of the House, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Dingell, my 
friend and colleague from the Commerce Committee, whose common 
sense and fairness I admire. He will administer oath of office.

<HEADLINE> Jury To Mull Anti-Abortion Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In a case that opens on Thursday, a jury  
will decide whether an anti-abortion Web site that reads like a 
wanted poster -- with names and addresses of ``baby butchers'' -- is 
constitutionally protected speech or an invitation to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood, a clinic and five doctors are suing the  
creators of a site called The Nuremberg Files for millions in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sites like Nuremberg are a threat to doctors because the  
anti-abortion movement in the United States follows up on threats 
like that with violence,'' said Bonnie Jones, a lawyer at New 
York's Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. ``These are not 
words in isolation. They are typically followed up with murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs are suing under the 1994 Freedom of Access to  
Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it illegal to incite violence 
against abortion doctors and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	While the law has been used often against people who have  
firebombed clinics or attacked doctors, this case, filed in 1995, 
is believed to be the first not to result from a violent 
confrontation or a direct, person-to-person threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuremberg Files feature photos of mangled fetuses and  
drawings of dripping blood. A headline blares: ``ABORTIONISTS: the 
baby butchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What follows are the names of hundreds of doctors who perform  
abortions, clinic owners and workers, and judges. In some cases, 
the site lists doctors' vital statistics and the names of their 
children. It invites readers to send in photos, videotapes and 
background data on doctors, their cars, their houses, their friends 
and their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Four doctors and two clinic workers killed by anti-abortion  
activists since 1993 are crossed off, including most recently Dr. 
Barnett Slepian, who was killed by a sniper in his kitchen Oct. 23 
near Buffalo, N.Y. Those wounded are shaded in gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see the doctors they've crossed off. You tell me, is  
that free speech or intimidation?'' said Dr. Ray Guggenheim, a 
retired Portland obstetrician whose name appeared on the list. ``It 
tends to make you think twice about what you believe in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Site creator Neal Horsley, a 54-year-old computer programmer  
from Carrollton, Ga., said the purpose of The Nuremberg Files is to 
build a dossier on abortion doctors in hopes of providing evidence 
against them if they are ever put on trial, as Nazi war criminals 
were at Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection in the lawsuit begins Thursday, and authorities  
in Portland are tightening security at the federal courthouse. U.S. 
District Judge Robert E. Jones issued a gag order barring all sides 
from discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, defendant Michael Bray argued that The Nuremberg Files  
are a form of political protest and that the lawsuit is an attempt 
to stifle debate. Other defendants include the American Coalition 
of Life Advocates, an umbrella group for several anti-abortion 
groups, and Advocates for Life Ministries, a radical Portland-based 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bray, a Reformed Lutheran pastor from Bowie, Md., spent nearly  
four years in prison for setting fires to clinics in the 1980s. He 
also wrote an anti-abortion book called ``A Time to Kill.'' He said 
a victory for Planned Parenthood could backfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are blocked of public protests, then people are left  
saying, `What are we going to do?''' Bray said. ``It leaves only 
one option: the covert use of force -- vandalism, blowing up places 
and terminating doctors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Henderson, a lawyer who has represented Bray in other cases,  
said that the plaintiffs have no case unless they can prove the 
anti-abortion forces intended to cause harm. Previous awards in 
cases brought under the clinic access law have averaged only a few 
thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to see the Constitution perverted by the claim that  
posting names and addresses alone on the Internet is cause for 
incitement,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Smolla, a First Amendment specialist at the University of  
Richmond law school, noted that the site goes further than just 
listing names. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask what is the ideological purpose for including  
all the detail,'' Smolla said. ``It seems that the information adds 
little if anything to the political debate but does provide very 
practical advice for someone who wants to commit murder.''

<HEADLINE> Three Old Pals Head for Cooperstown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball's Hall of Fame Class of 1999 -- Nolan  
Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount -- spent a lifetime competing 
against each other, one firing fastballs, the other two trying to 
time them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday as the three posed in Hall of Fame shirts and hats,  
they recalled the duels, the good moments and the bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I faced Nolan, he was with California,'' Brett  
said. ``I was batting seventh, behind Jim Wohlford. He hit Jim in 
the ribs and the ball seemed to stick there for a minute before it 
fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim was trying to breathe and he couldn't. Then I came up and  
took three pitches, three strikes. That was good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pitches were all fastballs because that was what Ryan threw,  
the pitch he rode to 324 victories and a record seven no-hitters 
and 5,714 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, who had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 20-year career  
with the Kansas City Royals, went 29-for-101 lifetime against Ryan. 
That was better than Yount, who had 3,142 career hits but only 16 
in 69 swings against Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I faced both of them when they were rookies,'' Ryan said. ``I  
remember Robin was only 18 but he choked up and stood up on the 
plate. You couldn't intimidate him. He'd hang in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount frowned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't intimidated?'' he said. ``I must have hid it well. It  
took three or four years for me to catch up with that fastball. If 
you didn't turn it up a notch, you were in big trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan and Brett, who won three batting championships, were each  
named on more than 98 percent of the 497 ballots cast by 10-year 
members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's 98.79 percent was the second-highest in history, trailing  
only Tom Seaver's 98.84 in 1992. Brett received 98.19 percent, 
trailing only Seaver, Ryan and Ty Cobb's 98.23 in 1936's first 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryan-Brett-Yount rookie sweep marked the first time three  
first-year candidates had been elected since Cobb, Babe Ruth, 
Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson comprised the 
first class at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, in Kansas City, and Yount, in Milwaukee, spent their  
entire careers in small markets -- something that may not be 
possible in the current baseball economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the end of his career, Yount said he thought about leaving  
the Brewers. He had been to just one World Series, batting .414 in 
the seven-game loss to St. Louis in 1982. He wanted a chance at 
another postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came close to leaving Milwaukee after 1989,'' he said. ``I  
was a free agent, not sure how much longer I would play. I was

<P>
	Yount was inundated by mail pleading with him to stay. It  
affected his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pressure to stay,'' he said. ``The more I

much the people of Wisconsin wanted me to stay was the deciding 
factor.'' 
</P>

	Ryan never got a chance to stay with his first team, the New  
York Mets. After four spotty seasons, he was traded to California 
and launched one of the greatest power-pitching careers in baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 324 wins and 5,714 strikeouts hadn't gotten him into the  
Hall of Fame, the seven no-hitters certainly would have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably pitched better games when things didn't go as  
well,'' he said of the no-hitters. ``I wasn't a no-hit pitcher 
coming up. I pitched one in Little League and one in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I pitched the first one against Kansas City, no one was  
more surprised than me. The second and third time through the 
batting order, the advantage is with the hitters because they've 
seen you pitch and they have a better feel for what you're throwing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one in 1973 against Detroit, warming up everything was  
going right. I could put the ball right where I wanted it. I said 
to Tom Morgan, the pitching coach, `If I ever pitch another one,

<HEADLINE> Feds To Fine Brokerages $15 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Closing a five-year-old case in which big Wall  
Street firms were accused of cheating investors out of billions of 
dollars, federal regulators plan to fine two dozen major brokerages 
a total of $15 million for alleged price-rigging on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The fines are part of an industrywide settlement which the  
Securities and Exchange Commission has been negotiating with the 
brokerages for months. The settlement involves many of Wall 
Street's biggest names -- including PaineWebber Group Inc., J.P. 
Morgan &AMP; Co., Salomon Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; 
Co., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The landmark case goes back to 1994, when the SEC and the  
Justice Department alleged that major dealers on the electronic 
Nasdaq market conspired in a form of price-fixing that cost 
ordinary investors billions on their stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, an attorney representing investors who earlier won  
$910 million from the brokerage firms lauded the SEC's anticipated 
action. But another private securities lawyer -- who wasn't directly 
involved in the case -- called the $15 million in fines 
``meaningless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, first reported in Wednesday's Wall Street  
Journal, the SEC also plans to bring civil charges against some 50 
individual traders for the brokerages, seeking to temporarily 
suspend them from the securities business. The brokerage firms and 
the traders will neither admit nor deny wrongdoing, sources 
familiar with the settlement terms confirmed, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement expected to be announced next week, the  
brokerages with the most alleged violations would pay higher fines, 
with as many as six of them paying more than $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see that the SEC is doing this,'' said Robert  
Skirnick, an attorney representing investors who sued the 
brokerages in a 1994 class action and won $910 million from 30 
firms in a settlement a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the largest ever for such a civil antitrust suit,  
according to legal experts, and Skirnick suggested Wednesday that 
it lit a fire under the federal regulators to pursue enforcement 
action against the brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's anticipated settlement ``is a vivid example of the  
value of private class-action'' lawsuits, he said in a telephone 
interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Singer, another private securities attorney, said the  
expected $15 million in fines against the giant brokerages is 
``meaningless'' and comes too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a problem with the SEC's resolution of this  
case,'' said Singer. Although he wasn't involved in this case, 
Singer has represented aggrieved investors complaining against 
brokerage firms and, in other cases, the firms themselves. He was 
also once a staff attorney for National Association of Securities 
Dealers, the self-policing body that operates the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude of the nearly $1 billion class-action settlement  
means the regulators should have gotten more from the same 
brokerage firms, he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker declined comment on the  
anticipated settlement, as did spokesmen for several of the Wall 
Street firms involved. Jay Fastow, an attorney who represents the 
brokerages, didn't return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In making its original case, the SEC charged that major Nasdaq  
dealers harassed or refused to trade with others who tried to offer 
investors a better price for a stock. Other times, the powerful 
dealers allegedly colluded in a form of price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers delayed reporting major trades when it could hurt their  
stock holdings, the SEC said. Calling themselves ``friendly 
competitors,'' dealers swapped trading plans or important company 
news before the public found out. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 civil antitrust settlement with the Justice  
Department, 24 of the 37 brokerages agreed to improve their 
compliance procedures and tape-record some phone calls made and 
received by traders. The Wall Street firms, which neither admitted 
nor denied wrongdoing, were not fined. 
</P>
<P>
	In its own settlement with the SEC in 1996, the National  
Association of Securities Dealers similarly did not admit or deny 
wrongdoing. The SEC censured the dealers' group, saying it broke 
federal securities laws and its own rules in failing to enforce the 
rules on the Nasdaq, the nation's second-largest stock market. The 
NASD agreed to spend $100 million over five years to improve market 
surveillance.

<HEADLINE> Mom of Wyo. Slay Suspect Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Police have found no link between Cindy  
Dixon's apparent death from hypothermia and her son's pending trial 
for the murder of Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	However, authorities are still investigating the woman's death  
as a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how obvious it is we'll look at it until we can  
prove to ourselves it is not,'' Sgt. Michael Garcia said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dixon, the mother of defendant Russell Henderson, was found  
dead Sunday along a two-lane road north of Laramie. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both age 21, are accused of  
beating and robbing Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, 
on Oct. 7 and tying him to a split-rail fence outside Laramie. 
Shepard, 21, died five days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Albany County Sheriff's Sgt. Rob Graham, Ms. Dixon  
was last seen about 7 p.m. Saturday stumbling from a bar in 
downtown Laramie. Her body was found about 12 miles away by a 
passerby around 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dixon was wearing a short, pink nylon jacket over a shirt  
and jeans in subzero wind chill. She apparently died of hypothermia 
about 1,000 feet from a house driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every indication was there will be some alcohol involved,  
which of course lowers your ability to handle cold air,'' Graham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have questioned Henderson's stepfather, Charles E.  
Dixon Jr., who has been convicted three times for beating his wife. 
Police say there is no indication Ms. Dixon had been beaten before 
her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon was charged with two counts of battery for allegedly  
beating Mrs. Dixon on Nov. 4. His preliminary hearing on the latest 
charges was postponed on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda McMurtrey waited on the Dixons during lunch about 1 p.m.  
Saturday at Foster's Country Corner Motel. She said the couple had 
not been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just seemed like anybody else,'' McMurtrey said. ``They  
weren't arguing or anything, they were just having lunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and McKinney are scheduled to go on trial later this  
year and could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at a November hearing indicated Shepard may have been  
targeted because he was gay. The attack brought condemnation from 
President Clinton and calls for tougher hate-crime laws.

<HEADLINE>  Apple's iMac Sports Four New Colors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The iMac personal computer, which some say  
helped save Apple Computer Inc.'s life, looks more like a Lifesaver 
than even before. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual-looking translucent desktop now comes in five bright  
colors, from strawberry red to original teal, that are sure to 
further stand out on store shelves from traditional beige machines. 
</P>
<P>
	But are the popular new iMacs a one-product wonder, or can they  
help the company take a major bite again out of the market soundly 
controlled by Windows-based desktop machines? 
</P>
<P>
	With the iMac less than five months old, this year may prove  
crucial in deciding that question. As former Apple chief evangelist 
Guy Kawasaki notes, design alone can't help Apple sustain the 1980s 
revolution Apple spurred by simplifying the way computers interact 
with people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The iMac is an amazing marketing-industrial design type  
success,'' said Kawasaki, who had the important Apple job of 
prodding developers to write new software programs for the Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, What is the revolution? You can only design  
and redesign Apple so much,'' Kawasaki said in an interview this 
week at his Silicon Valley office, where he runs a business that 
helps match start-ups with venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Apple is trying to improve the substance of its  
computers as well. 
</P>
<P>
	At the MacWorld show here on Tuesday, Apple lowered the price of  
the iMac by $100 to $1,200 and boosted its processing power and 
storage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also introduced new versions of its G3 computer line for  
professionals that cost less, sport more power and include a 
uniquely designed lever that allows users to easily open up the 
computer case to add memory or other features. 
</P>
<P>
	And Apple began selling ``server'' software that enables  
businesses and schools to link Macs into a network of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves, along with the new color choices, could attract new  
users and help Apple expand a profitable niche among design 
professionals and schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	For now at least, Apple appears to be on a roll. And the iMac,  
also available in tangerine-orange, lime-green and grape-purple, is 
clearly part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, said Apple expected  
to report its fifth consecutive profitable quarter next Wednesday, 
furthering its recent recovery from two years of losses. He would 
not give the size of the profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that people want to collect all five'' colors, Jobs  
joked in his keynote speech, to the applause and whoops of 
thousands of Apple Macintosh fans at the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple has sold 800,000 iMacs since it was introduced on Aug. 15,  
making it the No. 1-selling PC at retail last November. That's 
still a fraction of the estimated 35 million to 40 million PCs sold 
worldwide over the same period. But Apple said 45 percent of iMac 
buyers were new Mac users, including first-time computer buyers and 
some former Windows users. 
</P>
<P>
	That success helped buoy the spirits of MacWorld attendees, who  
were too busy cheering Jobs' keynote speech to debate Apple's 
long-term prospects in an industry dominated by Windows machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Mac user, it's encouraging to have Steve Jobs at the  
helm. It's his baby and he's not going to let it suffer,'' said 
Norm Daniels, who creates promotional videos for Home Lake 
Christian Camps, a youth camp in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers worried that stores may have a tough time  
stocking all the new iMac colors, but Jobs said in an interview 
after the keynote speech that wasn't a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose colors that we thought reflected the spirit of the  
product,'' Jobs said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers May Act in Olympics Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Kevin Garn, majority leader of the Utah  
House, says that lawmakers might step up their oversight of Olympic 
organizers if they don't ``clean up their own mess'' from the 
bribery scandal enveloping the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP leaders heard from irate colleagues before Gov. Mike  
Leavitt this week urged the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's board 
of trustees to have those involved in the probes take a temporary 
leave during a quartet of bribery investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a push from some legislators to go even farther,''  
Utah House Speaker Marty Stephens said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strategy for now is to wait and see how SLOC's board  
reacts on Jan. 14 when it takes up Leavitt's proposal. The 
legislature's Republican leadership supports Leavitt's 
recommendation as a way to keep preparations for the Olympics on 
track and quickly deal with the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these guys make an effort to clean up their own mess and  
get this back on track, then there won't be a reaction,'' Garn said 
of SLOC officials. ``If they don't, we will see more legislators 
wanting more oversight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's winning bid to host the 2002 Winter Games has been  
tainted since revelations surfaced in November that bid officials 
gave scholarships, free medical care, guns and other expensive 
perks to visiting International Olympic Committee members. The 
scandal has also prompted calls for reform within the Olympic 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations into Salt Lake's bid have been launched by the  
federal Department of Justice, the IOC, the U.S. Olympic Committee 
and an ethics panel for SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens declined to disclose what ideas for changes he has  
heard. But Garn said there are discussions of increasing the number 
of legislators on the Utah Sports Advisory Committee, which keeps 
tabs on the Olympic preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	And House Minority Leader Dave Jones plans to file a bill  
requiring SLOC to itemize and publicly disclose its past and 
present financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this won't be needed,'' Jones said. ``My hope is that  
SLOC will say, `Here is the key to the records, now have at 'em.''' 
</P>
<P>
	While the cost of staging the Olympics has been estimated at  
more than $1.4 billion, the state is liable for any shortfalls. 
Organizers also have pledged to pay back $59 million taxpayers paid 
to build ski jumps, bobsled tracks and ice skating rinks. 
</P>
<P>
	With that much financial exposure, lawmakers said they are  
justified in demanding that SLOC, which is legally a private 
entity, clean up its act and keep policymakers and the public 
apprised of its progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Garn and other legislators said the most prudent approach is to  
see how SLOC reacts to the governor's proposal and then wait until 
the results of the investigations are known before deciding if new 
laws should be enacted that would more aggressively monitor SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the probes are expected to be wrapped up during the 45  
days the 53rd Legislature is in session beginning Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers agree they have to be careful not to overstep their  
role and slow down preparations for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we do agree on is that the Legislature doesn't have  
a management role in the Olympics,'' Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if they don't take any action regarding the Olympics,  
lawmakers can be expected to at least vent their feelings about a 
scandal that many believe has tarnished Utah's reputation around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said if SLOC is invited to brief lawmakers during the  
session, organizers can expect ``a crisp and courteous reception.

<HEADLINE> World Cup, Olympics Won't Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- International soccer's governing body  
assured the IOC today that it would not stage the World Cup in the 
same year as the Summer Olympics if soccer's showcase tournament 
becomes a biennial event. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made by FIFA president Sepp Blatter after a  
meeting with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, FIFA maintained its opposition to the IOC's  
policy on punishment for drug use, but agreed to reconsider easing 
the eligibility limit for soccer players in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter announced last weekend that he wanted to hold the World  
Cup every two years instead of four, a move which would put the 
tournament in direct competition with the Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we go to a (cycle) of two years we will not play the same  
years as the summer Olympic Games,'' Blatter told a news 
conference. ``First and foremost it is a matter of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said there would be ``two losers'' if the World Cup  
and Olympics were held in the same years. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter did not say exactly how the World Cups would be  
scheduled. He would not specify whether the tournament would be 
held in odd years rather than even years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Summer Olympics are held every four years. The next games  
are in Sydney in 2000, followed by Athens in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The next World Cup is scheduled for 2002 in Japan and South  
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrators Picked for JFK Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former U.S. appellate judge and a former  
solicitor general were named Wednesday to determine how much the 
government should pay heirs of Abraham Zapruder for his film of 
President Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlin M. Adams, a former judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of  
Appeals, will chair the three-man panel. Adams served as 
independent counsel from 1990 to 1995 for the prosecution of 
influence-peddling allegations against officials of the Reagan 
administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
	The other panel members are former Solicitor General Walter  
Dellinger and Washington lawyer Kenneth R. Feinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, the Justice Department and Zapruder's heirs,  
represented by LMH Co., agreed to let an arbitration panel set a 
price not to exceed $30 million for the 26-second film of Kennedy's 
assassination in a Dallas motorcade on Nov. 22, 1963,. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is expected to compensate the family for the  
film, but Zapruder's heirs would keep the copyright and retain 
control of its use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department selected Dellinger, and the LMH Co.  
selected Feinberg. Dellinger and Feinberg selected Adams to chair 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a law professor at Duke University, Dellinger served as  
assistant attorney general for legal counsel and then as acting 
solicitor general during the Clinton administration. 
</P>

	Dow Closes At Record 9,544.97  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged today, pushing the Dow industrials  
up more than 200 points to climb above 9,500 for the first time 
ever as investors snapped up shares in high-tech and big-name 
companies in extremely heavy trading. Investors continued to shower 
the market with new cash from year-end bonuses and proceeds of 
stock sales made at the end of 1998 for tax purposes. Yesterday's 
shopping spree in computer-related stocks expanded to nearly all 
big companies with well-known names. The Dow Jones industrial 
average rose 233.78, or by 2.5 percent, to close at 9,544.97, 
convincingly shooting by the previous high of 9,374.27 set Nov. 23. 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index and Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500-stock list both had big gains to top records reached yesterday. 
The Nasdaq was up 69.38 to 2,320.65.

	New Home Sales Surge To Record  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home purchases surged 7.6 percent to a  
record high in November and, even without December's figure, 1998 
already is the best year for new home sales since the government 
began tracking them 35 years ago. The boom -- and shopping for 
trimmings such as furniture and appliances -- is helping the U.S. 
economy weather spillover on American factories and farms from the 
global economic slump. According to economist Robert Barr of Fannie 
Mae, housing construction -- which represents only about 4 percent 
of the nation's economic output -- accounted for roughly a seventh 
of last year's growth.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will  
hold talks next week with the head of China's central bank during a 
trip to Asia that will also include a meeting with Hong Kong's 
chief executive. Greenspan will be in Hong Kong for a meeting of 
the Bank for International Settlements on Monday and while there 
will meet with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, the Fed said in a 
brief statement today. The Bank for International Settlements is 
often referred to as the central banker for central banks, helping 
to coordinate international monetary matters. Its regular meetings 
are normally held at BIS headquarters in Switzerland. The Hong Kong 
discussions will be held at the BIS' new office in Hong Kong.

	Microsoft Judge Asks About AOL Deal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust case interrupted the trial today to ask a witness about 
comments by America Online's chairman that its planned deal with 
Netscape won't change Microsoft's dominance. The unusual exchange 
was a clear illustration of the judge's deep unease about how the 
pending $4.2 billion AOL-Netscape deal might affect the 
competitiveness of the nation's computer industry, the main issue 
in the trial. Microsoft argues that the deal, announced weeks into 
the Microsoft trial, illustrates that the computer industry remains 
viable and thus suggests that government intervention isn't needed 
to ensure competition. But in an interview published today in The 
Washington Post, AOL Chairman Steve Case said: ``AOL's merger with 
Netscape has no bearing on the Microsoft case. ... I have a lot of 
respect for Microsoft. I continue to live in fear of them.''

	New Postal Rates Take Effect Sunday  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cost of sending most letters will rise by  
a penny to 33 cents on Sunday despite a four-year run of strong 
profits by the U.S. Postal Service. Postal officials said the 
increase is needed because rising costs are eating into income -- 
that a small increase was needed to maintain quality customer and 
delivery service. It will also cost more to mail newspapers, 
magazines and most packages. But the price of mailing heavier 
letters will fall.

currency were ``strikingly smooth.'' Trading in the euro began on 
Monday. Today, the euro was worth about $1.16. Camdessus said the 
euro can play ``a key role'' in broadening and deepening Europe's 
capital markets by offering new opportunities to ``savers and 
borrowers the world over.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA's best-known cheerleaders worked bar  
mitzvahs instead of ballgames. Around dormant arenas, empty sports 
bars closed early and parking attendants sat in vacant lots. These 
hardships, felt in small doses around the country, are the most 
significant economic effects of the 6-month NBA lockout that will 
end with an agreement reached today. Economists said that while the 
lockout may have caused steep losses for individuals and small 
businesses, the overall economic impact wasn't significant.

powers of arrest and interrogation, state media said today. China 
launched the crackdown in July to stop a multibillion-dollar flood 
of cheap, illegal imports ranging from cars to sugar that are 
undercutting Chinese producers. It has 6,000 police officers in 19 
offices nationwide, the China Daily newspaper said. An additional 
4,000 officers and 23 offices are to be added by the end of June.

<HEADLINE> SEC Backs Stricter Nasdaq Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have approved a sweeping  
proposal by the dealers' group that runs the Nasdaq Stock Market to 
tighten disclosure requirements for companies seeking special 
over-the-counter listings of their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The change could result in the removal of thousands of small and  
speculative stocks from the listings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday approved the  
proposal made a year ago by the National Association of Securities 
Dealers to strip from the OTC Bulletin Board, an electronic market 
of about 6,800 securities, stocks of any companies that don't file 
financial disclosure statements with the SEC or banking or 
insurance regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the stocks listed on the Bulletin Board do not submit  
such reports, according to the NASD, which announced the SEC's 
approval on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Nasdaq's parent organization is aimed at distancing  
the nation's second-largest stock market from cheap, high-risk 
stocks, sometimes called ``penny stocks,'' that are thinly traded 
and loosely regulated and have had problems with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq runs the Bulletin Board, but its stocks are not actually  
listed on the Nasdaq market because they don't meet Nasdaq listing 
standards or don't file disclosure statements with the SEC. The 
Bulletin Board stocks often are linked with Nasdaq's name, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The new filing requirement for companies will protect investors  
in Bulletin Board stocks by giving them access to companies' 
financial information, the NASD said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thorough and accurate information is the foundation of sound  
investment decisions,'' Frank Zarb, NASD's chairman and chief 
executive officer, said in a statement. He called the move ``a 
major step toward improving the quality'' of the market for 
small-company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirement also means that the companies will be  
subject to closer oversight by the SEC and other watchdog agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing requirement will be phased in over a 12-month period  
beginning in July and continuing through June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman John Heine declined comment on the matter.  
</P>
<P>
	The stocks to be dropped under the proposal also include many  
special shares of foreign companies. As of April 1998, foreign 
securities had to be fully registered with the SEC to remain listed 
on the Bulletin Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts have said the stocks that are removed could  
still be listed on the so-called Pink Sheets, a less automated 
system not affiliated with Nasdaq -- but would be more difficult to 
trade.

<HEADLINE> Statue of Liberty Gets Nod for Coin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans prefer the Statue of Liberty over  
Sacagawea for the new dollar coin planned for next year, according 
to a survey conducted for the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five percent of respondents age 18 or older said they  
preferred the Statue of Liberty, vs. 27 percent selecting 
Sacagawea, according to a draft of a GAO report obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a Treasury Department official said the results of the  
poll conducted for the congressional watchdog agency would not 
change Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's choice of subject for the 
gold-colored coin scheduled to replace the Susan B. Anthony dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the recommendation of an advisory panel, Rubin decided  
the coin will depict Sacagawea, the teen-age Shoshone girl who 
along with her infant son accompanied explorers Meriwether Lewis 
and William Clark to the Pacific Ocean in 1804. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this month, Rubin is expected to select the final design  
from among three submitted by sculptor Glenna Goodacre of Santa Fe, 
N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe once a design is finalized ... the public will  
embrace it and be proud of the depiction on the coin,'' said 
Assistant Treasury Secretary Howard Schloss. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., who sponsored the dollar-coin  
legislation and had pushed strongly for the Statue of Liberty as 
its subject, acknowledged the design selection process is ``pretty 
far along and I doubt it's reversible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if it's not used now, I would hope it can be used on some  
other circulating coin in the future,'' he said. ``More people 
around the world associate America with the Statue of Liberty than 
anything I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the survey, a majority or respondents favored the  
statue, regardless of age, gender, income or region of residence. 
Eighty-one percent said they felt very or somewhat strongly about 
their preference. 
</P>
<P>
	Those favoring the statue said it was a familiar symbol of the  
United States and freedom. Those favoring Sacagawea said her image 
would honor American Indians, that her trek across the Rocky 
Mountains was part of history and that her image would be a change 
from other coins, which depict former presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,014 randomly selected adults was  
conducted Nov 18-22 for the GAO by International Communications 
Research of Media, Pa. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Pushes Up on Purchase Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were sharply higher Wednesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade on news the U.S. Agriculture Department is 
increasing wheat purchases for its donor program by one million 
metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength of wheat futures gave a boost to corn and soybean  
futures prices, while silver futures surged, pork was up the daily 
limit, and palladium and frozen concentrated orange juice futures 
slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	When the USDA announced the creation of its donor program last  
year, it committed to purchasing 2.5 million metric tons of wheat. 
In October, the government agency made a 1.5 million metric ton 
wheat donation to Russia. With Tuesday's announcement, the 
program's total now stands at five million metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical factors also helped push wheat futures higher, as buy  
orders were triggered when prices reached $2.83 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength of wheat gave a boost to corn futures prices. The  
corn rally also was technical in nature as funds that sold their 
positions as the market declined in recent trading sessions entered 
the market to cover their losses. Also giving corn futures a boost 
were beliefs the cold weather in the Midwest will prompt increased 
demand for feed grains from cattle ranchers and hog producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were higher because of continued dryness  
in South America. Rain has not fallen for days in the soybean crop 
areas of southern Brazil and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery was 7 1/4 cents higher at $2.87 1/2 a bushel;  
March corn was 6 1/2 cents higher at $2.23 3/4 a bushel; March oats were 
3 1/2 cents higher at $1.12 1/4 a bushel; January soybeans were 4 1/4 cents 
higher at $5.53 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and pork futures prices settled higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather continues to be a concern of the market, with the cold  
and snow in parts of the Plains states and the Midwest expected to 
adversely affect the growth of hogs and cattle. Higher cash prices 
also contributed to the rise in pork belly and hog futures prices, 
both up the daily limit. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were 1.50 cents higher at 62.17 cents a  
pound; January feeder cattle were 1.50 cents higher at 71.67 cents 
a pound; February lean hogs were 2 cents higher at 34.72 cents a 
pound; February pork bellies were 3 cents higher at 47.05 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices fell on the New  
York Cotton Exchange as the market reacted with disappointment to 
news overnight cold did not adversely affect the Florida citrus 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures prices have been trending lower in recent  
trading despite the current crop being smaller than last year's, 
according to analyst Judith Ganes of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. However, 
the small crop is being offset by record inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	March orange jucie was 2.90 cents lower at $1.020 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures prices surged and palladium futures prices  
declined on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures rose as hedge funds and speculators entered the  
market to take advantage of oversold conditions, according to 
analyst James Steel of Refco. However, silver lost about a third of 
its gains as trade houses sold into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	February silver was 12.5 cents higher at $5.129 a troy ounce;  
February gold was 70 cents higher at $288.50 a troy ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures prices continue to suffer from the settlement  
of the strike at South Africa's Anglo American Platinum Corp. that 
resulted from a wage dispute with the National Union of 
Mineworkers. Reduced buying of palladium by the Japanese, due to 
that nation's economic problems, also is hurting palladium prices. 
</P>
<P>
	March palladium was $9.80 lower at $318.95 a troy ounce; January  
platinum was $1.30 lower at $355.80 a troy ounce.

<HEADLINE> New Season, New Course, More Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Walking up the 18th fairway of the  
Plantation Course, Davis Love III felt the warm sun on his face, 
took a breath of the Pacific Ocean air and was ready to hit the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like the old times at the Kapalua International during the  
offseason. But this time, he played nine more holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was the Mercedes Championships signs around the course  
that got his attention. Perhaps it was the sight of David Duval, 
Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara and the rest of the players who had to 
win a PGA Tour event last year to qualify for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the case, it didn't take Love long to realize this  
wasn't another week on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different feeling,'' he said. ``It's the start  
of the year, official money. I'm sure it's going to be a little 
more serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: They will be playing for some serious  
money this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercedes Championship kicks off a 1999 season in which total  
prize money will be about $134 million, an increase of nearly 40 
percent from last year when golf had three players go over $2 
million and 26 players earn at least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone can win that much alone in one of the three World Golf  
Championship events that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With new purses and new tournaments, those make it more  
exciting,'' said U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen. ``If you work hard 
this year and go out with a good attitude, you can do something for 
yourself. This has the potential to be an incredible year for 
somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts this week after one of the shortest offseasons in  
any sport -- after all, it was just three weeks ago that the 
International drummed the Americans in the Presidents Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson is the defending champion of the winners-only  
Mercedes, which has had a purse increase typical of many PGA Tour 
events -- from $1.7 million last year to $2.6 million, with $468,000 
going to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the only change.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mercedes has moved to a new location for the fourth time in  
its 46-year history, from La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, Calif., to 
Kapalua, a resort course that used to be the home of a silly season 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the first time, the PGA Tour will be televised live  
(ESPN) in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that will be good,'' Couples said. ``Get home from  
work, turn on the tube and we're on -- especially since a lot of 
those states just got a foot or two of snow, and they'll see us 
playing in 80 degrees. I'd watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What they'll see are 30 players trying to get a jumpstart on  
what figures to be the biggest year ever in golf. Five of the '98 
winners decided not to play -- Ernie Els just got married and Lee 
Westwood is about to get married; Hal Sutton's wife is expecting 
twins any day; Olin Browne is recovering from arm surgery, and Nick 
Price usually doesn't make the around-the-world trip from South 
Africa -- even with this much money on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, there will be plenty of tournaments this year with  
big-time purses -- only three regular tournaments had a $2.5 million 
purse last year, while all but seven will offer at least that much 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money isn't something you think about when you're playing,  
but it's awfully nice when you're done,'' said Duval, the leading 
money-winner a year ago with nearly $2.6 million. ``Conceivably, by 
the time you get to the U.S. Open, there might be a player with $3 1/2 
million if he wins the right events. He could take off for the 
summer and say, 'See you at the Tour Championship.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Love and Couples have won twice at Kapalua, while Jim Furyk  
took the unofficial event here three years ago. There have been 
some subtle changes on the course -- three greens have been 
flattened to accommodate typically blustery winds off the coast of 
Maui. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest adjustment of all might be the attitude.  
</P>
<P>
	``The hard thing is, the week ends Wednesday afternoon,''  
Couples said. ``During the invitational (in November), it was six 
days of fun on the beach. You could be leading the tournament and 
start on the 10th hole Saturday at 7 a.m. But by 11:30, you're done 
and on the beach having a good time. That's what that tournament 
was all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a fun week. But it will be no fun if I finish in  
28th place.''

<HEADLINE> Explaining Some Lockout Jargon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Explanations for some of the terms commonly used in the NBA  
lockout: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Salary cap: The amount of money each team can spend on  
salaries. It was $26.9 million last season and should be about $31 
million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Larry Bird exception: Allows teams to exceed the salary cap to  
retain their own free agents. Rule was adopted so the Boston

<HEADLINE> Whitaker Returns to Tough Opponent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After spending most of the last 14 months  
fighting a drug problem, Pernell Whitaker is taking on another 
tough foe when he returns to the ring next month against undefeated 
IBF welterweight champion Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kid is a great fighter, he is a world champion,'' Whitaker  
said of Trinidad at a news conference Wednesday to announce the 
Feb. 20 title fight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	But Whitaker, 42-2-1 with 17 KOs, says he would have it no other  
way for his first fight since beating Russian Andre Pestriaev on 
Oct, 17, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all I know how to do is fight big fights,'' said  
Whitaker, a former lightweight, junior lightweight and welterweight 
champion, who failed a drug after beating Pestriaev. ``What good 
would it have been for me to go in there and knock somebody out in 
the first round, what good is that? What good would that have been 
for me in a comeback fight?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, 35, failed a second drug test last February and spent  
a month in a rehabilitation clinic. But throughout the long fight 
to get back in the ring, Whitaker never thought he wouldn't fight 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had no doubts in my mind that I would get the  
opportunity to prove that I am the best pound for pound fighter in 
the world again,'' Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	And that is what he promised he will do against the hard-hitting  
Trinidad, 33-0 with 29 KOs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to do the same thing that I have been doing my  
entire 14 years (pro career) and that is win and put on a great 
show,'' Whitaker said. ``I will not have any reason not to put on a 
spectacular show.''

<HEADLINE> Temps Rise, but More Snow Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Midwesterners and Great Lakes residents got a break from the  
cold wave Wednesday as they tried to keep up with their latest 
round of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Even travel was a little easier as Detroit Metropolitan Airport  
resumed full operations for the first time since the weekend 
snowstorm, which canceled hundreds of airline flights and stalled 
thousands of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	More snow fell around parts of Michigan, adding to as much as 3  
feet that had already fallen on the state's lakeside snow belts 
since late last week. Schools were closed again in Detroit for 
180,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Several inches of additional flakes in southwestern Michigan,  
along Lake Michigan, put a damper on business Wednesday at the 105 
E Grill in the town of New Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had one customer today. Ate soup,'' co-owner Sophie Faturos  
said. ``Business is very bad. Nobody's out. The whole town is in 
bad shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And more lake-effect flurries settled on Buffalo, N.Y., with 3  
to 6 inches possible by Thursday morning. That was on top of as 
much as 16 inches that fell Tuesday, which followed the foot of 
blowing snow that shut the city down on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow even fell as far south as the Tennessee Valley, with an  
inch accumulating in northern Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was slippery. It was very, very icy,'' Kim Davis said of  
her drive to work in Decatur Ala. ``(But) it was a pretty sight, 
just as white as it could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Tennessee's county school systems were closed  
Wednesday because of snow, freezing rain, sleet and temperatures as 
low as 10 at Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Florida, Lakeland chilled to a record low of 26. In  
neighboring Hillsborough County, volunteers at the Good Samaritan 
Mission in Wimauma distributed blankets and sleeping bags to mostly 
farm workers without heat in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those trailers with broken windows are a very sad situation,  
especially for the elderly and children,'' said volunteer Dora 
Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Cold, snow and slippery roads had claimed at least 102 lives  
along the path of the huge weekend storm that rolled from the 
Plains across the Midwest into Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Bitter cold retreated slightly from the Midwest, as the coldest  
air moved eastward and pushed temperatures in Maine down to 27 
below zero at Clayton Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's low at Chicago was 5 above zero, compared to  
Tuesday's low of 12 below. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Ohio had lows in the teens Wednesday, a marked change  
from Tuesday's reading of 8 below zero at Mansfield, and warmed 
into the upper 20s in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	And even Tuesday's cold wave turned out to have been not quite  
as bad as it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service on Wednesday withdrew a report that  
Savanna, in northwest Illinois, had the all-time record at 37 
below. The reading was not taken by an official observer using 
certified equipment, weather service spokesman Bob Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiping the Savanna reading off the books gave the town of  
Congerville the title for having Illinois' coldest day on record -- 
with a Tuesday morning low of 36 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the morning temperature in the town of 397 people  
was 26 -- above zero.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Vermeil Gets Brass' Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A day after his five-hour West Coast meeting  
with St. Louis Rams president John Shaw, Dick Vermeil was back on 
the job and contemplating the changes that must be made to turn 
around the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said Wednesday the pow wow in Los Angeles was anything  
but the summit showdown some had speculated it would be. He 
received a vote of confidence a week before the Rams ended a 4-12 
season to return for the third year of a five-year, $9 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``No ultimatums, nothing,'' Vermeil said. ``I didn't expect  
ultimatums. It went as well as it could go for only winning four 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Vermeil, the NFL's worst team of the 1990s has continued a  
downward spiral. The Rams were 7-9 in 1995, their first year in St. 
Louis, 6-10 in 1996 and 5-11 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The major points of the meeting, according to Shaw, were that  
Vermeil would make more coaching staff changes, bring in 
quarterback competition for Tony Banks and attempt to further 
upgrade the team through free agency. Shaw said the Rams would 
attempt to re-sign many of their own unrestricted free agents, but 
others on his staff feel the team should clean house. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of business might be the staff, whom he meets  
with on Thursday. Vermeil fired offensive coordinator Jerry Rhome 
the day after the season, and offensive line coach Jim Hanifan and 
wide receivers coach Dick Coury could be on their way out as well, 
although Vermeil said he doesn't expect any more immediate 
switches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a specific timetable on it, I really don't,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said Mike White, the assistant head coach and  
quarterbacks coach last season, is the only in-house candidate to 
possibly replace Rhome. 
</P>
<P>
	An area where the Rams seemingly need an overhaul is discipline.  
A handful of players missed team return flights from road games and 
were fined token amounts instead of benched. Then four prominent 
players: linebacker Roman Phifer, cornerback Todd Lyght, offensive 
tackle Orlando Pace and linebacker Eric Hill, skipped the final 
team meeting. Wide receiver Isaac Bruce was late to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether there would be repercussions, Vermeil angrily  
responded: ``Are you kidding me? You're (expletive) right there 
will be repercussions. How's that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't specify what sanctions would be taken.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could do anything,'' Vermeil said. ``Anything is a  
possibility. I gave them my respect and I expected to get it in 
return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Vermeil said the walkouts nearly ruined five days off  
after the season at his 100-acre ranch in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a shot in the back for me,'' he said. ``I took it  
personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil, known in St. Louis for being tough in practices and  
soft everywhere else, said he'll be a lot more hardnosed in all 
areas next season. He said nose tackle Joe Phillips, who complained 
about long workouts in training camp, would not be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a real compassion for the guys that play this game, and  
I can't change that,'' he said. ``But I'm aware that maybe you can 
care too much. You have to approach things with a little harder 
shell.''

<HEADLINE>  George Brett Goes to Cooperstown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A television camera roving the crowd at  
Fenway Park during the 1967 World Series happened upon an excited 
14-year-old with a wide grin and a fabulous destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello, I'm Ken Brett's little brother, George,'' America heard  
him say. 
</P>
<P>
	And now -- 31 years, 3,154 hits, three batting titles, two World  
Series appearances and one notorious wad of pine tar later -- Ken 
Brett's little brother is saying hello again -- to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Brett clearly deserves a special place in the annals of  
major league baseball history,'' said American League president 
Gene Budig, a close friend. ``Very few were as gifted and tenacious 
as George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the Hall of Fame on Tuesday with Nolan Ryan  
and Robin Yount. Brett, 13th on the career hits list with 3,154, 
made it with 98.19 percent of the vote, the fourth-highest total 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was flabbergasted,'' Brett said of his vote total. ``It just  
knocked me on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best player in the history of the Kansas City Royals was not  
even supposed to be the best in his family. That distinction 
belonged to Ken, five years older and a can't-miss prospect with a 
dominating fastball when the Red Sox brought him up in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ken's little brother was an instant success after the Royals  
elevated him to stay in 1974 as a wide-ranging third baseman who 
threw right and batted left. A devoted student of hitting coach 
Charlie Lau, he batted .333 in 1976 to win his first batting title 
and begin a string of 13 straight All-Star appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	When he retired after the 1993 season, he had a .305 lifetime  
average and, reflecting his uncanny knack for rising to the 
occasion, a .337 postseason mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would get out there and work so long and hard, he had  
blisters on his hands,'' said Denny Matthews, the Royals' radio 
voice since 1969. ``He would be out there at 2:30 in the afternoon 
working in the hot sun. Then he'd go 3-for-4 and people would say, 
`Gee, what a natural hitter.''' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the great clutch hitters of his era, Brett's statistics  
over 20-plus years, all with the Royals, project an elegant 
symmetry with more than 5,000 total bases, 3,000 hits, 1,500 runs, 
1,500 RBIs, 1,000 extra-base hits, 600 doubles, 300 home runs, 200 
stolen bases and 100 triples. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard work and mental toughness are what made George Brett  
great,'' Royals general manager Herk Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the history of major-league baseball, no other man had 3,000  
hits, 300 home runs, 600 doubles and 100 triples while also 
stealing 200 bases. Besides Brett, only Hank Aaron, Stan Musial, 
Willie Mays, Carl Yastrzemski, Al Kaline, Eddie Murray and Dave 
Winfield combined 300 homers with 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose is the only player with more doubles than Brett's 665  
who's not in the Hall of Fame. And Aaron and Mays are the only 
others with 3,000 hits, 300 home runs and 200 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett stands alone as the only man to win batting titles in  
three decades ('76, '80, '90). And his .390 average in 1980 -- just 
five hits shy of .400 -- is the highest in the majors in 57 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stands as an icon in Kansas City and throughout the Midwest  
where there is a legion of Royals fans,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett's most brilliant year and game may have come in 1985 when  
he won his first Gold Glove, finished second in the batting race 
with a .335 average, led the league with a club-record .585 
slugging percentage and came within two intentional walks of tying 
Ted Williams' AL record. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after the Royals fell behind Toronto two games to none in  
the seven-game playoffs, Brett kept his team alive in game three 
with two home runs, a double, a single and a spectacular defensive 
play as the Royals rallied 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the most amazing game for any position player I've  
ever seen,'' Matthews said. ``George simply willed the Royals to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His most famous game was on a July afternoon in Yankee Stadium  
in 1983 when New York manager Billy Martin howled that the bat he'd 
just used to hit a go-ahead home run off Rich Gossage had pine tar 
too far up the handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires called him out. But later, AL president Lee MacPhail  
upheld the Royals' protest. When he's inducted into the Hall of 
Fame this summer, the pine tar bat will be there waiting for him.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Follow Dollar Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices rose Wednesday for the  
first time in four sessions as the dollar gained ground against the 
yen and euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32  
point, or $6.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.16 from 5.20 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds fell early in the session as U.S. stocks rose to record  
highs. A rising stock market competes with bonds for investors' 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But bond prices later moved up as the U.S. dollar gained against  
the yen and euro, boosting the the appeal of dollar-dominated 
investments for foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up between 3/32 and 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities were 
up 7/32 to 1/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.87 
points to 1,318.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.45 percent as the  
discount fell 0.02 point to 4.35 percent from late Tuesday. 
Six-month yields were 4.53 percent, as the discount fell 0.03 point 
from the auction to 4.38 percent. One-year yields were 4.51 percent 
as the discount fell 0.03 point from late Tuesday to 4.32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 3.50 percent from 4.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 19/32 from 124 7/16. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.18 percent Wednesday from 5.17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Former ValuJet Names New Top Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- AirTran Holdings Inc. , the parent company  
of the airline formerly known as ValuJet, appointed an airline 
industry veteran to be the struggling discount carrier's next 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph B. Leonard, most recently president and CEO of  
AlliedSignal's aerospace marketing unit, has worked 25 years as an 
airline executive for Northwest, Eastern and American airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	D. Joseph Corr, current CEO and president of the Orlando-based  
AirTran, will return to Houston to run his company, D. Joseph Corr 
Inc., which specializes in turning around troubled companies. 
Robert D. Swenson, the company's chairman, will remain on AirTran's 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard is a native of Augusta, Ga., and holds a bachelor of  
science degree from Auburn University. He began his career as a 
test engineer at Boeing. Joining AlliedSignal in 1993, he was 
credited with improving customer satisfaction for the aerospace 
unit and leading growth strategy for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	During his two years at AirTran, Corr tried to move former  
ValuJet from under the shadow of the 1996 crash of Flight 592, 
which killed 110 people near Miami, and shut down the airline for 
three months. He merged the airline with another carrier, changed 
the airline's name, moved its headquarters out of Atlanta and 
brought in a new management team. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the airline continued to struggle.  
</P>
<P>
	AirTran reported a third-quarter loss of $10.9 million, or 17  
cents a share. The company furloughed dozens of workers in October 
but brought them back in December. The airline was threatened with 
random walkouts by its flight attendants before a new contract was 
reached in September. The airline flew most of 1998 at only about 
60 percent capacity.

<HEADLINE>  More Small SUVs Headed to Showrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- One has a global positioning system and a roof of  
tinted amber glass. Another features a lift-out picnic table and on 
its own can disable side air bags when a small child -- or no one, 
for that matter -- is in the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound unreal? Guess again, say automakers who unveiled such  
innovations Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	At the media preview, many automakers offered up compact,  
car-based sport utility vehicles aimed more at styling about town 
than off-road exploring. 
</P>
<P>
	In one so-called hybrid vehicle melding attributes of SUVs,  
sedans and minivans, Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln-Mercury division 
introduced its unconventional ``my.'' To its manufacturer, the 
five-door, bulbous concept car represents a ``go-anywhere, 
do-anything'' vehicle that further blurs the distinction between a 
car and SUV. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, Hyundai Motor Co. pulled the wraps off its  
first sport ute: The Santa Fe, a concept vehicle the Korean 
automaker bills as the ``big little SUV,'' complete with the 
removal picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed interest in station wagons as SUV/minivan wannabes  
also was evident. General Motors Corp.'s Saab unit announced it was 
reentering the station wagon segment with its 9-5, which the 
Swedish automaker plans to market as a sporty alternative to bigger 
minivans or SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	And Subaru, the Japanese automaker that re-established itself in  
the United States by marketing wagons and cars as ``hybrid utility 
vehicles'' with all-wheel-drive and SUV-like cladding, unveiled the 
redesigned Outback wagon and sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford wouldn't speculate when the ``my'' could reach showrooms,  
saying that would depend on reaction to its features, such as rear 
doors that open toward the back and four bucket seats -- the rear 
two able to fold down for an expanded cargo area. 
</P>
<P>
	A mouse-like ball controls instrumentation of the vehicle, which  
has a six-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive. It also has a global 
positioning system, and even a roof of amber glass and similarly 
tinted windows, which Ford describes as built-in sunglasses for the 
occupants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's something that sets this vehicle apart,'' said J  
Mays, Ford's design chief. ``It gives passengers in 'my' an 
open-air feeling without being exposed to the elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai plans to turn the Santa Fe into a production model that  
will reach U.S. showrooms in late spring 2000 as a compact SUV with 
four- or six-cylinder engines and two- or all-wheel drive. It bears 
style cues from the Tiburon coupe and Sonata sedan, and shares many 
of the Sonata's major parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai expects the Santa Fe to compete with Honda's popular  
CR-V and Toyota's RAV4 and be priced under $20,000 fully equipped. 
Hyundai anticipates selling 20,000 to 25,000 Santa Fes next year, 
targeting buyers ages 18 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish automaker Saab expects to begin production of its 9-5  
wagon in May. It was displayed with two mountain bikes strapped to 
its luggage rack. 
</P>
<P>
	The wedge-shaped wagon features a turbocharged engine and an  
illuminated cargo area with a foldable shelf and slide-out floor. 
Saab expects the 9-5 to fetch $35,000 to $40,000 for each of the 
4,000 vehicles the company expects to sell in its first year in 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a cargo standpoint, it offers more than an SUV or  
minivan,'' said Joel Manby, SAAB Cars USA Inc.'s president, adding 
the target consumer could include ``housewives who want to get out 
of that minivan image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other unveilings Tuesday included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Lexus I.S., a small sports sedan it plans to begin selling  
here in summer 2000. The North American version of the I.S. -- it 
will have a different name when it goes on sale here -- will differ 
little from the version already on sale in Japan and Europe. It 
will have a V6 powering the rear wheels, and compete with the BMW 
3-series and Audi A4 sport sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mazda's concept version of its next-generation minivan that it  
plans to produce later this year. The redesigned MPV is about the 
same size as the old version that Mazda stopped selling last year, 
but Mazda says it's designed to be lighter and more nimble than its 
predecessor and competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The MPV will come with a 170-horsepower V6 and seating for  
eight. The rear seats fold into the floorboard and can be flipped 
over 90 degrees for tailgating. Prices were not announced.

<HEADLINE>  Plushenko Wins Russia Skating Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Yevgeny Plushenko landed seven triple jumps  
Wednesday to win the Russian Figure Skating Championships, beating 
several rivals who failed to complete quadruple jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old, who was world junior champion last year, failed  
to execute a quad that opened his program, but was perfect on a 
succession of triples. 
</P>
<P>
	He completed his routine with a triple salchow and got mostly  
5.8s from the judges for both technical merit and artistic 
presentation, allowing him to move up from third place after the 
short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko already has qualified for the Grand Prix finals that  
will be held in his hometown of St. Petersburg in March. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Alexei Yagudin finished second, performing seven  
triples, but also failing on a quad. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Urmanov, first after the short program, started his final  
program with a quad, but missed the landing and never fully 
recovered. He finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion, missed all of last season  
with a groin injury, but he made his return this season a rewarding 
one with several strong performances. He won the Cup of Russia, 
finished second at the Goodwill Games and third at Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pairs competition, Olympic silver medalists Yelena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze used a slow but solid routine to 
win their first national title. Ice dance world champions Angelika 
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov won with a new routine, which used 
only drums and percussion instruments.

<HEADLINE> Plutonium Found in Nev. Groundwater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Traces of plutonium from a test blast in Nevada migrated nearly  
a mile through groundwater, according to a study that prompted the 
government to take another look at the risks be posed by an 
underground nuclear waste storage site. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists said the amount of radioactivity that can move this  
way is too small to endanger the public. The U.S. Energy 
Department, in reassessing the risks of the government's proposed 
waste site beneath Nevada's Yucca Mountain, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, it was commonly believed that significant  
amounts of plutonium would not move through groundwater because the 
element dissolves at a very low rate and attaches strongly to any 
rocks it touches. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature,  
researchers confirmed suspicions that plutonium can hitch a ride on 
colloids, or particles of debris suspended in water. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in  
California and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico looked 
at a 30-year-old nuclear blast that reached below the water table 
on the Nevada Test Site, where the United States has conducted 828 
underground nuclear tests between 1956 and 1992. The site is 70 
miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists found minute amounts of plutonium -- measurable  
only by the most sensitive equipment -- in test wells nearly a mile 
away from the blast, and concluded that the plutonium had flowed 
downstream on colloids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shown there is a new potential pathway that has been  
suggested before, but never definitely shown. The question is what 
the maximum amount is that you could move. We don't know that,'' 
said Annie Kersting, a Lawrence Livermore scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department wants to build a nuclear waste repository  
at Yucca Mountain, about 90 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The 
government has already spent $2.2 billion in 15 years of research 
in hopes of entombing 80,000 tons of used reactor fuel that will 
remain deadly for 300,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The department took the latest findings into account and  
concluded that the seepage wouldn't happen for 10,000 to 100,000 
years, and even then, the escaped radiation would be less than the 
background amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not rates that would bust any kind of standards. We  
see no impact,'' said Abe Van Luik, senior technical advisor for 
performance assessment for the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Honeyman, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines,  
said the very nature of colloids -- their extremely small size and 
low concentrations -- assure that they would never move large 
amounts of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The radioactivity is so low that it probably is not of  
significance for adverse human health effects,'' he said. 
``Conceptually, you can think of colloids being like a conveyor 
belt. The belt is really not turning very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department's conclusions did not satisfy Bob Loux,  
executive director of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects in the 
Nevada governor's office. He said he believes containers holding 
the waste will fail much more quickly than the government estimates 
and allow unknown quantities of contaminants to escape within 500 
years.

<HEADLINE> SEC Poised To Fine Brokerages $15M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are poised to fine two  
dozen big Wall Street firms a total of $15 million for alleged 
price-rigging on the Nasdaq Stock Market, sources familiar with the 
settlement talks said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney representing investors who earlier won $910 million  
from the brokerage firms lauded the anticipated action by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. But another private securities 
lawyer -- who wasn't directly involved in the case -- called the $15 
million in fines ``meaningless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industrywide settlement, which the market watchdog agency  
has been negotiating with the brokerages for months, involves many 
of Wall Street's biggest names -- including PaineWebber Group Inc., 
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Salomon Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
&AMP; Co., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the final chapter of a landmark case stretching back to  
1994, when the SEC and the Justice Department alleged that major 
dealers on the electronic Nasdaq market conspired in a form of 
price-fixing that cost ordinary investors billions of dollars on 
their stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, first reported in Wednesday's Wall Street  
Journal, the SEC also plans to bring civil charges against some 50 
individual traders for the brokerages, seeking to temporarily 
suspend them from the securities business. The brokerage firms and 
the traders will neither admit nor deny wrongdoing, sources 
familiar with the settlement terms confirmed, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement expected to be announced next week, the  
brokerages with the most alleged violations would pay higher fines, 
with as many as six of them paying more than $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see that the SEC is doing this,'' said Robert  
Skirnick, an attorney representing investors who sued the 
brokerages in a 1994 class action and won $910 million from 30 
firms in a settlement a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the largest ever for such a civil antitrust suit,  
according to legal experts, and Skirnick suggested Wednesday that 
it lit a fire under the federal regulators to pursue enforcement 
action against the brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's anticipated settlement ``is a vivid example of the  
value of private class-action'' lawsuits, he said in a telephone 
interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Singer, another private securities attorney, said the  
expected $15 million in fines against the giant brokerages is 
``meaningless'' and comes too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a problem with the SEC's resolution of this  
case,'' said Singer. Although he wasn't involved in this case, 
Singer has represented aggrieved investors complaining against 
brokerage firms and, in other cases, the firms themselves. He was 
also once a staff attorney for National Association of Securities 
Dealers, the self-policing body that operates the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude of the nearly $1 billion class-action settlement  
means the regulators should have gotten more from the same 
brokerage firms, he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker declined comment on the  
anticipated settlement, as did spokesmen for several of the Wall 
Street firms involved. Jay Fastow, an attorney who represents the 
brokerages, didn't return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In making its original case, the SEC charged that major Nasdaq  
dealers harassed or refused to trade with others who tried to offer 
investors a better price for a stock. Other times, the powerful 
dealers allegedly colluded in a form of price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers delayed reporting major trades when it could hurt their  
stock holdings, the SEC said. Calling themselves ``friendly 
competitors,'' dealers swapped trading plans or important company 
news before the public found out. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 civil antitrust settlement with the Justice  
Department, 24 of the 37 brokerages agreed to improve their 
compliance procedures and tape-record some phone calls made and 
received by traders. The Wall Street firms, which neither admitted 
nor denied wrongdoing, were not fined. 
</P>
<P>
	In its own settlement with the SEC in 1996, the National  
Association of Securities Dealers similarly did not admit or deny 
wrongdoing. The SEC censured the dealers' group, saying it broke 
federal securities laws and its own rules in failing to enforce the 
rules on the Nasdaq, the nation's second-largest stock market. The 
NASD agreed to spend $100 million over five years to improve market 
surveillance.

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal Changes Aerospace Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Aerospace and automotive technology giant  
AlliedSignal is realigning its aerospace businesses to cut costs 
and improve service to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morris Township-based company said Wednesday it expects to  
save $30 million to $50 million annually through the 
reorganization, which should be completed by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're realigning to simplify the methods and processes we use  
to serve the customers,'' said company spokesman Tom Crane. ``We 
think it will help us to stay competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some layoffs, primarily of administrative staff at company  
facilities elsewhere, are possible once the realignment is 
completed, but AlliedSignal does not yet know the number or 
locations of jobs to be cut, Crane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are unrelated to the company's failed attempt last  
fall at a $10 billion hostile takeover of AMP Inc. of Harrisburg, 
Pa., the world's biggest maker of electrical conductors, according 
to Crane. 
</P>
<P>
	He said AlliedSignal now has numerous systems within its  
aerospace segment for handling customer orders, production and 
delivery. Under the realignment, which follows an ongoing study by 
Frederick Poses, president and chief operating officer, all 
segments of the aerospace division will use a single streamlined 
production system. 
</P>
<P>
	The aerospace segment makes products ranging from jet engines  
and electronic and avionics controls to wheels, brakes and 
environmental control systems for commercial, corporate and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal, which also makes turbochargers and other  
automotive products, chemicals, fibers, plastics and advanced 
materials, employs 70,500 people worldwide and has annual sales of 
about $15 billion and profits of about $1.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Balloonists Wait for China's OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- United States-based balloonists said  
Wednesday they would delay their around-the-world bid because they 
lack permission to fly over China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spirit of Peace team had said weather conditions favor a  
weekend launch. But the crew backed off that statement as it 
continues trying to reassure China it would honor flight 
restrictions, spokesman Tom Garrity said. 
</P>
<P>
	China suspended permission for balloonists to cross its airspace  
more than a week ago after another team drifted off course during a 
failed attempt. British tycoon Richard Branson and his teammates 
later splashed down off Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Circumnavigating the globe nonstop in a balloon is one of the  
last great unattained aviation milestones. Anheuser-Busch is 
offering a $1 million prize to the first team that accomplishes 
that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spirit of Peace's 19-story balloon is one of several teams  
awaiting favorable launch conditions, including solo Chicago 
balloonist Kevin Uliassi and a Swiss group.

<HEADLINE> McVeigh Seeks Review of Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Timothy McVeigh asked the Supreme Court on  
Wednesday to review his conviction and death sentence in the 
Oklahoma City bombing, saying his trial was tainted by a juror who 
prejudged the case and by news reports that he had confessed to his 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous appeals court ruling that upheld McVeigh's conviction  
sends the message that ``the rules of law may be applied on a 
sliding scale when the crime is unspeakable and public outrage is 
great,'' his lawyers told the nation's highest court in a written 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had ``unpredecented publicity'' and the pre-trial  
reports that he had confessed to his lawyers ``made the threat to 
fair trial rights extraordinary,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of murder, conspiracy and weapons-related  
charges in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The blast killed 168 people and 
injured more than 500 others. McVeigh received a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
decided last September that there was no misconduct when a juror 
commented on McVeigh's guilt before his trial was over. The panel 
said the juror's comments were ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial in 1997, an alternate juror told a court clerk  
that jurors discussed which of them would decide the case and which 
would serve as alternates, and that one juror said: ``It wouldn't 
be very hard. I think we all know what the verdict should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh's appeal said the trial judge should have questioned the  
juror or held a hearing on whether the juror was biased. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said prospective jurors should have been asked  
whether reports of a confession by McVeigh caused them to be biased 
against him. Four jurors indicated in pre-trial questioning that 
they had seen such reports. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh's lawyers also said prospective jurors should have been  
asked whether they had any opinions about what sentence should be 
imposed if he were convicted of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge's repeated admonishments to jurors to keep an  
open mind were not enough to ensure an unbiased jury, the appeal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The district court had a duty to insure that Mr. McVeigh  
received a fair trial'' but subordinated that duty to a desire to 
begin the trial on the scheduled date, the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Supreme Court lets stand the lower courts' decision that  
jurors need not be asked whether they had predetermined the 
sentence in the case, ``we risk having an 'Oklahoma City bombing 
case' exception to the rule of law,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is McVeigh vs. U.S., 98-7500.

<HEADLINE> Flynt Promises More Capitol Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Politicians are talking about being ``Larry  
Flynted,'' and Rep. Bob Livingston warns darkly of 
``government-by-Larry Flynt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, Flynt, the self-described ``pornographer, pundit and  
social outcast,'' is being taken seriously on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	As senators get ready to put President Clinton on trial, the  
Hustler magazine publisher is threatening to serve up a second 
helping of the kind of scandal that drove Livingston to resign from 
the House. Flynt has hinted only that his next target is a ``big 
fish'' Republican in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign to unmask what Flynt calls hypocrisy in the Clinton  
investigation is shaking up more than politicians. Some political 
experts fear that in driving the public discourse to new lows, 
Flynt will deepen cynicism about the impeachment process and 
government in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is dangerous to democracy,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a  
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University. ``It's 
dangerous to the First Amendment and it only adds to the cynicism 
we see out there. This is sexual bounty hunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a man who made his name with a hard-core sex magazine  
that once pictured a woman being put through a meat grinder, a man 
who went to the Supreme Court over a magazine spoof ad suggesting 
the Rev. Jerry Falwell lost his virginity to his mother in an 
outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, who is 56 and has been in a wheelchair since an  
assassination attempt in 1978, won the Supreme Court fight. He 
gained a shred of legitimacy in some eyes when the 1996 movie ``The 
People vs. Larry Flynt,'' portrayed him as a First Amendment hero. 
And now he is making waves on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, a Louisiana Republican who was about to take over as  
speaker of the House, turned down the gavel and said he would 
resign from Congress in six months after admitting he had had 
adulterous affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt had flushed Livingston out after putting an advertisement  
in The Washington Post offering to pay up to $1 million for 
verifiable information on adultery by members of Congress or other 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt said he will hold a news conference next week to make his  
latest disclosure. He described his next victim as a GOP House 
member who has been a strong critic of Clinton in the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is really a gem,'' Flynt said. ``We've got enough to  
go on now, but we are waiting for an affidavit from his ex-wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that he will probably name a third politician later next  
week, and that he is paying between $3.5 million and $4 million to 
a number of women who responded to his ad. At some point he will 
publish details not in Hustler, but in a one-time magazine called 
``The Flynt Report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, scandal-mongering goes back to the beginning of the  
republic,'' said Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at 
the University of California at San Diego. ``But now it is on this 
huge financial scale. It's a sign of the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt's previous forays into mainstream celebrity have included  
offering a $1 million reward for new information in the 
assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther 
King. In the 1984 trial of automaker John Z. DeLorean, he released 
a government videotape of DeLorean with a suitcase full of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting that paralyzed Flynt from the waist down was blamed  
on a man incensed by an interracial photo spread in Hustler. The 
same white gunman also admitted shooting and wounding Vernon 
Jordan, the Washington lawyer and Clinton confidant who is a key 
figure in the Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always wanted to be a political player,'' said Paul  
Krassner, who did a brief stint as Hustler publisher in 1978 and 
now runs the alternative paper The Realist in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to play a part in politics and in the culture of the  
country,'' Krassner said, ``and he got what he wanted. But he paid 
a very high price for it.''

<HEADLINE> Couch To Leave Kentucky for NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- As a child, Tim Couch idolized San  
Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. He could soon be playing 
for the man who caught Montana's most famous pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch will pass up his senior year at Kentucky for the riches  
awaiting him in the NFL, The Associated Press learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's early entry into the draft clears the way for the  
expansion Cleveland Browns and general manager Dwight Clark -- the 
man who made ``The Catch'' -- to make the passing phenom the top 
pick in this spring's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely coming out'' in the draft, a source familiar  
with the situation said, confirming earlier reports that Couch had 
decided to turn pro. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was to announce his decision at a news conference  
Thursday. Kentucky said coach Hal Mumme would attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch has impressed scouts with his 6-foot-5, 225-pound size,  
accuracy, touch and experience in Kentucky's pro-style passing 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for 4,275 yards and 36 touchdowns this season in  
leading the Wildcats (7-5) to their first seven-win season since 
1984 and their first New Year's Day bowl appearance since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday is the deadline for underclassmen to declare for April's  
draft and Couch was just one of several top players set to leave 
school early. Also declaring for the draft Wednesday were this 
season's Outland Trophy winner, UCLA tackle Kris Farris, West 
Virginia tailback Amos Zereoue and Ohio State wide receiver David 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Shaun Alexander, Alabama's leading rusher,  
announced that he would pass on the draft and remain in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, a native of Hyden, Ky., set national passing records in  
high school and confounded conventional wisdom by staying in-state 
for college, passing up scholarship offers from traditional powers 
like Florida, Tennessee and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling his freshman season in then-coach Bill Curry's  
conservative offense, Couch blossomed under Mumme and his ``Air 
Raid'' offense, throwing for 73 touchdowns and more than 8,500 
yards over the last two seasons. He finished fourth in the 
balloting for this season's Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch insisted during the 1998 season that he had not yet made  
up his mind whether to go to the NFL or return to Lexington for his 
senior year. In his most recent meeting with reporters, following 
Kentucky's 26-14 loss in the Outback Bowl on New Year's Day, Couch 
said he was ``50-50'' on whether to turn pro or stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he could be headed to Cleveland, where Browns president  
Carmen Policy has said he would take a ``franchise quarterback'' 
with the top pick if one were available. 
</P>
<P>
	Farris, the UCLA standout honored as the nation's top interior  
lineman, said he took about six months to decide to leave early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident this is the best decision for me at this  
time,'' Farris, a 6-foot-9, 315-pound junior, said. ``The Outland 
Trophy really helped my decision, I'm not going to lie about it. 
Injury wasn't really a big concern. I just felt like this was the 
best time to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farris said a significant factor in his decision was the fact  
that since he sat out his freshman year, many players in his class, 
including quarterback Cade McNown, have completed their 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``These have been the best years of my life,'' Farris said. ``I  
don't feel like I belong here anymore. It's time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue said he decided to declare after consulting with his  
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given this decision a great deal of thought,'' he said in  
a statement released by the school. ``After a lot of research and 
consideration, I finalized my decision over the holidays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue is West Virginia's career rushing leader with 4,086  
yards and the Big East's top career rusher with 3,907 yards, not 
including bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be pulling for him on the next level,'' coach Don  
Nehlen said. ``Amos is a great back and he's done a great job for 
us over the past three years. We won't forget him. All we have to 
do is open our record book and Amos is everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue followed up a 1,505-yard season a year ago with 1,430  
yards and 13 touchdowns in his junior season, sixth best in 
Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, a second-team All-American who holds most Ohio State  
receiving records, will create an interesting problem in the pros. 
His father, Byron Boston, is a line judge in his fourth year in the 
league. It will be the first time that the NFL has had to 
reschedule games to prevent an official working games involving his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just ready for a new challenge,'' Boston said. ``I've  
accomplished a lot here at Ohio State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through his three seasons, Boston piled up Ohio State records  
for receptions in a game (14), season (85) and career (191), 
receiving yards in a season (1,435) and career (2,855) and 
touchdown catches in a career (34). 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough decision,'' he said. ``I had to do a lot  
of thinking this past week. It was a rough week for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he was staying in school because he was enjoying  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I wanted to do is be happy wherever I am,'' he  
said. ``If I go to the NFL, I've got to be a grownup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he talked with both Cincinnati and Cleveland, and  
was told he would go ``very high'' in the draft if he came out 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, Alexander decided, ``I want to have fun.''

	106th Congress Convenes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 106th Congress opens today with a new  
House speaker promising a more bipartisan spirit and a Senate 
impeachment trial sure to make that difficult. In its first order 
of business today, the House will elect Rep. Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker. Hastert will then 
deliver the oath of office to the other 221 Republicans, 211 
Democrats and one Democratic-leaning independent. In the Senate, 
Republicans, led by Trent Lott of Mississippi, return with the same 
55-45 majority, still well short of the 60 votes needed to overcome 
minority filibusters. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Trial To Begin Tomorrow  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate GOP leaders are struggling for  
agreement with Democrats on how to proceed when President Clinton's 
impeachment trial begins tomorrow. Beyond establishing a date to 
formally open the historic perjury and obstruction of justice 
trial, nearly everything else is unsettled -- from whether there 
will be witnesses to the length of the proceedings. At the White 
House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the uncertainty leaves the 
president's lawyers ``in the position of preparing for all 
eventualities.'' 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Inspectors Said To Aid U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has evidence  
indicating that United Nations weapons inspectors helped collect 
sensitive Iraqi communications for U.S. efforts to undermine Saddam 
Hussein's regime, The Washington Post reported in today's editions. 
The Post quoted confidants close to Annan as saying he is convinced 
that Washington used the eavesdropping operation to penetrate the 
security apparatus protecting the Iraqi president. Annan 
accumulated enough evidence on the eavesdropping, some through 
intermediaries passing on classified U.S. information, to ask 
Richard Butler, head of the weapons inspection team, about the 
reports last month, the Post said.

	Turkish Lawmaker Drops Premier Bid  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- An independent lawmaker asked to form  
Turkey's next government announced today that he is dropping his 
bid after losing the support of potential allies. Yalim Erez, who 
had hoped to become Turkey's next prime minister, suffered a major 
setback in the deeply divided Parliament on Monday when former 
premier Tansu Ciller said she would not support him. Turkey has 
been dealing with a government crisis since Nov. 25, when a 
center-right coalition collapsed because of a mafia and corruption 
scandal.

<P>
	Report Cites Harassment of Homeless  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In dealing with the homeless, ``meanness'' is  
driving out compassion as cities across the country call in the 
police, an advocacy group's report contends. Local police forces 
are tightening restrictions on sleeping and begging in public 
places, according to yesterday's report by the National Law Center 
on Homelessness and Poverty. And police sweeps are driving some 
homeless people from their haunts altogether, it says. The report 
said many cities are bent on ``criminalizing homelessness'' and are 
failing to take advantage of existing constructive methods to treat 
homeless people for physical and mental problems.

as investors disagreed over whether the figures were in line with 
their expectations. The Seattle-based company reported that its 
quarterly sales more than tripled from a year ago to about $250 
million, well above most forecasts. But some analysts were still 
disappointed since they had quietly hoped for an even bigger rise 
in sales during the quarter, to about $300 million.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBA commissioner David Stern uttered a few words  
of optimism last night by saying the chances of a lockout 
settlement are slightly better than 50-50. A critical factor will 
be time, and there isn't much left. The league's Board of Governors 
has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow morning, and Stern and deputy 
commissioner Russ Granik have said they will recommend canceling 
the rest of the season if no agreement is reached. The first order 
of business today was a vote among players on whether to support 
the position of their negotiating committee, which has recommended 
not accepting the owners' final offer.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Hebron Tweaks Hamstring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- First came a relatively easy regular season  
finale. Then came a bye week. As the playoffs approached, the 
Denver Broncos were getting healthy, which seemed too good to be 
true. 
</P>
<P>
	It was.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, kick returner and backup running back Vaughn  
Hebron injured a hamstring, leaving his status uncertain for 
Saturday's AFC divisional playoff game against the Miami Dolphins 
in Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown in a regular  
season game against the Dolphins on Dec. 21 -- the first kickoff 
return for a touchdown by a Denver player in 26 years. Twice this 
season, Hebron was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vaughn had a pulled hamstring when we were going through  
special teams,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ``I don't know how bad 
it is. We'll just have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hebron can't play, Derek Loville would replace him on kickoff  
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the Broncos are in reasonably good shape.  
</P>
<P>
	NFL rushing champion Terrell Davis will start, possibly wearing  
a flak jacket to protect his sore ribs. Davis wore the protective 
device in practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wore a flak jacket all through college and in a number of  
games last year, mostly to prevent any further injury,'' Shanahan 
said. ``So I don't think it will bother him much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appears likely that defensive end Neil Smith (abdominal  
muscle) and strong safety Eric Brown (groin) will play. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since being fined $15,000 by the NFL for failing to report  
quarterback John Elway's rib injury prior to a game on Nov. 8, the 
Broncos have placed on their weekly injury list every player 
requiring treatment, no matter how minor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, they listed 19 players, all of them probable.  
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan promised that Hebron's name would be added to the list  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the only guy who wasn't on there,'' Shanahan  
joked. ``Just my luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's practice was held in sunshine and 54-degree  
temperatures. A mild snowstorm was forecast for the Denver area on 
Friday, but the weather was expected to improve for Saturday, with 
game-time conditions expected to be in the upper 30s with partly 
cloudy skies.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The governor of Brazil's third  
wealthiest state said Wednesday that he would suspend the state's 
debt payments to the federal government because of a lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Itamar Franco of Minas Gerais state, in a written  
statement, said he made the decision because of an ``absolute lack 
of money'' in state coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision breaks an agreement reached by Franco's predecessor  
and the federal government in 1997 to roll over some $15 billion of 
debt over 30 years at reduced interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the accord, Minas Gerais had been paying the federal  
government around $67 million a month, or between 11 percent and 13 
percent of its monthly revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar agreements were signed with 24 of Brazil's 27 states.

others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred on a winding dirt road that stretches from  
Tarija, 590 miles south of La Paz, to Tupiza, an Andean farming 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what caused the accident, but most  
buses that run the 93 mile route are old, often overloaded and 
travel high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many died while being rushed to hospitals in Tarija. Rough  
terrain kept police from recovering all the bodies.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A Guatemalan court Wednesday delayed plans  
for a referendum on constitutional reforms that were required as 
part of an agreement that ended Guatemala's 36-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitutional Court called for a hearing to be held in 15  
days to consider objections raised by a group of constitutional 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendments, approved by congress in October, would expand  
the rights of indigenous people, strengthen the judicial system, 
scale back the military's powers and create a new national police 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	No date had been set for the referendum, but it was expected to  
be held early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers' group, the Center for the Defense of the  
Constitution, argued that congress committed procedural errors in 
approving the amendments and also said the 47 articles in the 
reform package should be presented to voters individually, rather 
than all at once. 
</P>
<P>
	The war between leftist guerrillas and a series of  
military-backed right-wing governments ended in December 1996 with 
a U.N.-supervised peace agreement.

                       *Charles Francis Adams    	
</P>
<P>
	DOVER, Mass. (AP) -- Charles Francis Adams, retired chairman of  
the Raytheon Co. and a descendant of Presidents John Adams and John 
Quincy Adams, died Tuesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams was the great-great-great grandson of John Adams, the  
great-great grandson of John Quincy Adams and the son of Charles 
Francis Adams, who served as secretary of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	He was president of Raytheon, a defense and commercial

	BOSTON (AP) -- George W. Bates, a newsman who started delivering  
papers as a boy and rose to the rank of managing editor at the

<P>
	Bates joined The Tennessean of Nashville as a sports reporter,  
and in 1959 went to The Miami Herald as a news editor.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michel Petrucciani, an acclaimed jazz pianist  
who waged a lifelong battle against a crippling disease that 
stunted his growth and made his bones dangerously brittle, died 
Wednesday at 36. He was being treated for a lung infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The French-born musician won a wide following with his technical  
mastery, skillful improvisation and sense of harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder known  
as ``glass bone disease,'' he lived a fragile existence. He was 
only 3 feet tall and his pianos had to be fitted with pedal 
extensions. He often had to be carried from the piano bench because 
his bones were so brittle. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrucciani made his professional debut at 13 at an outdoor jazz  
festival in France, and put out his first album, ``Flash,'' when he 
was 16. He was inspired by greats like Duke Ellington and jazz 
pianist Bill Evans, and by his father, jazz guitarist Antoine 
Petrucciani. 
</P>
<P>
	He recorded more than a dozen albums, including ``Promenade With  
Duke,'' an homage to Ellington; ``Pianism'' (1986); ``Michel Plays 
Petrucciani'' (1988); and ``The Best of Michel Petrucciani -- The 
Blue Note Years'' (1994), a compilation of his seven years with the 
Blue Note jazz label.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Joyce Swan, a former publisher of the  
Minneapolis Star and Minneapolis Tribune, died Saturday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Swan, who spent nearly 40 years working with the Minneapolis  
Star and Minneapolis Tribune, began as a sales promotion manager at 
the Star in 1939. By 1944, he was named publisher of the 
Minneapolis Times. After the Times was folded into the Star and 
Tribune papers, Swan was named a vice president of the company that 
owned both papers. He was named publisher of the newspapers in 
1961. The Star and Tribune merged in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the panel instrumental in bringing the  
Minnesota Twins baseball team, then the Washington Senators, to the 
town in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Swan retired in 1968 but remained on the Star and Tribune board  
of directors until 1977. He later became president of the Rapid 
City Journal, a Montana newspaper and a Kansas television station, 
all owned by the Star and Tribune. His son, James, succeeded him as 
president of the Rapid City newspaper in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	He also worked at The Des Moines Register and Tribune in Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a son and daughter, several grandchildren and  
great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky, Jordan May Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans hope to compel testimony by  
Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and other witnesses at President 
Clinton's Senate trial, congressional officials said Wednesday as 
the nation's impeachment drama dominated the opening day of the 
106th Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	With the trial due to start on Thursday, officials speaking on  
condition of anonymity also said presidential secretary Betty 
Currie was likely to be on any witness list the House impeachment 
team draws up. Linda Tripp, the woman who surreptitiously taped 
numerous conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, was not, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats oppose having any witnesses called to testify,  
and leaders of the two parties haggled throughout the day over the 
guidelines for the first presidential impeachment trial since 
Andrew Johnson sat in the White House in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have our responsibilities under the Constitution, and we  
will meet those responsibilities,'' said Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, who was involved in complicated negotiations involving 
rank-and-file GOP senators, Democrats and House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, officials said they were developing a  
strategy designed to force an early senate test vote to demonstrate 
there is not the two-thirds majority to force Clinton's removal 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we show the two-thirds is not there, the message is it's  
just a show trial with no chance of conviction. And every day we 
can remind the public of that,'' said one White House official, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in charge of the House team, met  
privately with Lott during the day, seeking permission to call 
witnesses -- despite the strong opposition of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans had earlier discussed a witness list as long  
as 15 names, several congressional sources said. It was not clear 
precisely how Hyde framed his request to Lott, or even whether the 
two men discussed prospective witnesses by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority leader spoke more in terms of five to seven  
witnesses, Republican sources added. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, one lawmaker said Lott, R-Miss., had indicated to  
Hyde that each side in the trial -- the House and the White House -- 
might be given three or four days to present evidence. At that 
point, the full Senate might decide whether to issue subpoenas for 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Hyde's request, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle  
said there was ``universal, unanimous opposition to witnesses'' 
among Democrats. And in polite but unmistakable terms, he urged 
members of the House to butt out of the Senate's business. ``We 
didn't involve ourselves in their proceedings and it is very 
disturbing that they now seem to be intent on involving themselves 
in ours,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations came as lawmakers took the constitutional oath  
of office, some laying claim to their hard-earned seats for the 
first time. Vice President Al Gore administered the oath in Senate, 
after which lawmakers, family and guests repaired to private 
receptions marking the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans and Democrats alike brought their  
young children into the chamber for the opening-day ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, conservative Republican Rep. J. Dennis Hastert of  
Illinois -- a genial, former wrestling coach from a congressional 
district in the nation's heartland -- was elected the new speaker in 
place of the harder-edged Newt Gingrich. Hastert's supporters were 
readily identifiable by the lapel pins they wore bearing the 
inscription, ``The coach is my speaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's impeachment trumped the other events of the day.  
And only the barest of details had been settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP sources said House Judiciary Committee Republicans  
had decided they wanted to have Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, a fact 
confirmed by Rep. George Gekas. ``There is no doubt that any 
witness list that we put together will include the name of Monica 
Lewinsky,'' he said in an interview on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. said Ms. Lewinsky should be  
questioned ``in limited fashion, but we don't have to go into all 
the (sexual) details.'' Much of the questioning could be on 
obstruction of justice issues, such as the attempt to find her a 
job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources said Vernon Jordan, a friend of the president who  
had contact with both him and Ms. Lewinsky, was also on the list. 
As for Mrs. Tripp, one Republican said her tapes would make her 
testimony unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women who filed affidavits in connection with the Paula  
Jones lawsuit might also be asked to testify, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., indicated that he might want to  
hear from onetime presidential adviser Dick Morris about Clinton's 
state of mind when he asked Morris for a poll on Americans' opinion 
of his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The House late last year approved two articles of impeachment on  
near party-line votes. They allege that Clinton committed perjury 
and obstruction of justice in his attempts to cover up a sexual 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was carried out in the vicinity 
of the Oval Office. In a postscript during the day, the House voted 
223-198, largely along party lines, to authorize Hyde to press the 
case against Clinton in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde is expected to formally present the articles of impeachment  
in the Senate on Thursday. A few hours later, Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist will enter the chamber and be sworn in to preside over 
the trial, his oath probably to be administered by Sen. Strom 
Thurmond, the Senate president pro tem. Rehnquist would then 
administer an oath to all 100 senators, who will sit as a jury to 
rule on Clinton's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol Rotunda -- clogged Wednesday with tourists  
eager to witness the opening day ceremonies -- the House Republican 
leaders pressed toward a vote to permit the presentation of 
evidence against the president when the trial opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats conceded privately the proposal would pass, but they  
sought to frame the issue as one final chance for majority 
Republicans to derail an impeachment that is unpopular with the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Daschle both referred to the momentous events in  
remarks on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said all sides must ``put aside our partisan instincts''  
for the duration of the impeachment proceedings. At the same time, 
he said, ``we must also set aside -- until this matter is resolved -- 
important legislative work on matters like education, health care, 
Medicare and Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott had a tart, one-word reply to the suggestion that all other  
work must halt: ``Wrong.'' Important work can go ahead, at least in 
committee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, little legislation is customarily brought to the floor  
in January or early February, so the lawmakers have a window to 
deal with impeachment.

<HEADLINE> 106th Congress Called to Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 106th Congress opened today with a new  
House speaker promising a more bipartisan spirit and a Senate 
impeachment trial sure to make that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	At the stroke of noon the House was called to order to start a  
session in which the Republican hold on power is one of the 
narrowest in history. The Senate session officially began minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, presiding over the opening of the  
Senate, swore in the 34 senators elected or re-elected in 1998. 
There are eight new senators, four from each party. 
</P>
<P>
	A different sort of swearing-in ceremony will take place  
Thursday in the Senate when Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
administers the oath to the 100 senators, who will serve as jurors 
in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	House Clerk Jeffrey Trandahl rapped the gavel twice to open the  
House proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of House business was to elect Rep. Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., a self-effacing former high school teacher, to 
succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker. Hastert would then deliver the 
oath of office to the other 221 Republicans, 211 Democrats and one 
Democratic-leaning independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who has emphasized the need to end the partisan rancor  
that has characterized Congress in recent years, carried that theme 
forward in his first remarks as speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks prepared for delivery, he said that ``solutions to  
problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the turbulent days behind us, debate on the merits often  
gave way to personal attacks,'' the 57-year-old lawmaker said. 
``Some here have felt slighted, insulted or ignored. That is wrong, 
and that will change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert outlined four areas that Republicans hope to promote in  
the coming session: Social Security and Medicare reform, more local 
control of education, lower taxes and stronger national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, on NBC's ``Today'' show,  
said that with Hastert in the leadership, ``We can work out a 
better relationship. I sure want to do that. I will work very hard 
to come more than halfway with him to develop a new respect, a new 
civility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As is customary on opening day, the House floor was filled with  
members children and scenes of lawmakers greeting old friends and 
welcoming new members. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore administered the oath of office in groups of four to the 34  
newly elected or re-elected senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, R-Ga., decided to resign after his party lost five  
House seats in the November election and his seat will be vacant 
until a special election is held next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, chosen unanimously by Republicans Tuesday evening to  
lead the party, says he'll work to end the partisan combat that 
held up key bills in the last session and hurt the Republicans at 
the polls. He added that he'll have to work with Democrats because 
``a smaller majority makes the dynamics change, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is already figuring out how to be speaker of the whole  
House rather than just the Republican speaker,'' said House 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a close ally. 
</P>
<P>
	At a reception Tuesday evening, Hastert told reporters he  
planned to meet today with Democratic leader Gephardt. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republicans led by Majority Leader Trent Lott of  
Mississippi, returned with the same 55-45 majority, still well 
short of the 60 votes needed to overcome minority filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is slated to make some changes in rules governing  
lawmakers, including easing a gift ban imposed in 1995 to concur 
with the less restrictive rules imposed in the Senate. The Senate 
allows its members to receive gifts, including meals, valued at up 
to $50 and accept up to $100 in gifts from one source in a year. 
House members have chafed under current rules which bans even such 
minor gifts as T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The House completed its part in President Clinton's impeachment  
matter when it approved two articles of impeachment last month. But 
it must reappoint the 13 GOP Judiciary Committee members who will 
act as prosecutors in the Senate trial on whether to remove the 
president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the impeachment proceedings will begin Thursday,  
although it's still unclear when the formal trial would start and 
how long it would last. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, as in most years, will go into recess after the  
opening session, waiting until after the president's State of the 
Union address, scheduled for Jan. 19, before getting down to real 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably the two most achievable goals of this session will be  
reforming Social Security to keep it solvent in the future and 
increasing consumer protections against health managed-care abuses. 
Democrats are leery of GOP efforts to allow the private investment 
of some retirement funds, and Republicans are against Democratic 
proposals to give consumers greater powers to sue HMOs. But both 
parties say they are committed to finding middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Republicans list as among their top priorities  
increased funding for national security and missile defense, 
substantial tax relief, more local control over schools and 
bankruptcy reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats will push for campaign finance reform, a national  
settlement with the tobacco industry, an increase in the minimum 
wage, and more money to hire elementary school teachers and build 
new schools.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Rejoices As Lockout Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Just hours after news broke of a  
compromise in the NBA's labor dispute, Delta Center workers began 
reassembling the hardwood floor where the Chicago Bulls won their 
sixth title in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The only game in town will soon be back at the site of the last  
NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Utah residents were elated by the sudden settlement of the  
six-month lockout. For everyone from businessmen feeling the 
financial crunch to fans with too much free time on their hands, 
the two-time Western Conference champion Jazz can't start playing 
soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a crazy winter and spring around here,'' said  
Craig Bunch. He and friend Brad Billyup, wearing matching Jazz 
parkas and hats, were in the arena's lobby Wednesday inquiring 
about tickets. Too soon, they were told. 
</P>
<P>
	``This state loves the Jazz probably more than any other city  
loves its basketball team, because they're the only thing we 
have,'' Billyup said. ``I bet every game is a sellout this 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy. I almost cried when I heard,'' said Janet Law, a  
secretary who walked past the Delta Center on her lunch hour. ``The 
Jazz are a big part of a lot of people's lives. It'll be so good to 
have them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz and Delta Center employees were still not allowed to speak  
about the lockout, but a female employee who asked not to be 
identified said: ``You can't believe how happy everybody is. People 
were bouncing off the walls around here wondering if they were 
going to lose their jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Timberwolves had been scheduled to play on the  
arena's floor Wednesday night. Instead, only the sideline paced by 
coached Phil Jackson and Jerry Sloan during last year's NBA Finals 
was assembled. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the court sat on wooden palettes, waiting to be  
pieced together for just the second time since the close of the 
WNBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, the Delta Center staged one college  
basketball game, several business seminars and an ice show. It even 
became a giant car lot for Jazz owner and automobile magnate Larry 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of NBA action drove fans to new pursuits. The  
International Hockey League's Utah Grizzlies saw an attendance 
increase, and Rick Majerus' Runnin' Utes drew larger crowds than 
normal to preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	A producer at a local radio station even began camping out on  
the roof of a downtown hotel on Oct. 28 to protest the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Rufus on the Roof, as he came to be known by a cult following in  
Salt Lake City, finally descended from his perch Wednesday after 10 
weeks in some of the coldest Utah weather in years. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing could replace John Stockton or Karl Malone. The  
Jazz's flagship TV station recently began replaying memorable games 
in franchise history, labeling them Jazz Classics. 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, which ended Wednesday with a labor agreement  
between the union and players, the area around the Delta Center was 
a ``ghost street,'' said Ali Raafati, director of the City Creek 
bar and grill, a haunt of visiting NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	His business fell 50 percent in the restaurant and 80 percent in  
the bar during the lockout. Before Wednesday's agreement, Raafati's 
waiters considered quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called my friends, I bought everybody a drink,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Karen Despain, the manager of Red Rock Brewing Co., a Delta  
Center-area restaurant, is not convinced fans will flock back. But 
Billyup expects all to be forgiven -- even Malone's offseason 
antics, which included a vow never to play in Utah again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl's going to want a championship, and he can do it here,''  
he said. ``And we're going to support them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, Bulls fan Barbara Scherer was not so forgiving. She  
swears she'll never watch another NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fed up,'' she said. ``I think they are all greedy. They  
throw a ball into a hoop. Big deal. This is not rocket science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Kleinman, a season-ticket holder in Vancouver, was becoming  
pessimistic about a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously someone figured it's better to have a season than to  
blow it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the settlement was welcome news at the NBA Store,  
across the street from league headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans will be back, but it will take some time,'' said  
Dimitrius Pinckney, a cousin of former NBA player Ed Pinckney. ``In 
a way, I'm glad they fought this long. But I didn't want the season 
to be canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Economou, a corporate driver, was checking out $225  
cashmere sweaters with the NBA logo when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is a fan and he kept asking me when we could go to a  
game,'' Economou said. ``Now we know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shortened schedule poses no problem for Dallas fan Bobby  
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why the NBA has to play 80 games,'' he said. ``We  
don't need all the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis, insurance salesman Dan Ohme was at the health  
club where Timberwolves Paul Grant and Chris Carr were playing 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means Kevin Garnett is not going to play on our city league  
team,'' Ohme said. ``I don't know where we're going to find another 
7-footer.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Scout Leader's Case Appealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- An ousted homosexual Boy Scouts leader  
asked the state's highest court to apply New Jersey's 
anti-discrimination law rather than the Scouts ``morally straight'' 
code to his appeal for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boy Scouts of America asked the court during two hours of  
oral arguments Tuesday to overturn a 1998 appeals court decision 
saying dismissal of Matawan assistant scoutmaster James Dale 
violated state anti-discrimination law. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale's attorneys told the court the Boy Scouts are not protected  
by First Amendment rights of expression because discriminating 
against gays is not the specific purpose for which the group was 
formed, citing such protected groups as the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides predicted the case could land in the  
U.S. Supreme Court, saying they would appeal if the state court 
rules against them. 
</P>
<P>
	George Davidson, an attorney for the Boy Scouts, said the group  
has a right to pick its own leaders without interference from ``an 
all powerful state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``An essential part of the Boy Scout message is to be morally  
straight,'' Davidson said. ``The view that homosexual conduct is an 
acceptable way of conducting oneself is not morally straight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Wolfson, representing Dale for the Lambda Legal Defense &AMP;  
Education Fund, said the state's laws against discrimination ``are 
simply too compelling'' to overturn the appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Boy Scouts' hierarchy has a policy of discrimination, but  
it is not a specific purpose of the organization, the reason that 
brought members together,'' said Wolfson. She said there is no 
mention of a policy excluding homosexuals in thousands of pages of 
Boy Scout literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale, 24, earned 30 merit badges, seven achievement honors and  
other awards, and was an Eagle Scout during his 12 years in the 
organization. He was expelled in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower court judge ruled in the Scouts' favor in 1995, calling  
homosexuality ``a serious moral wrong'' and agreeing with the Boy 
Scouts that the group is a private organization and has a 
constitutional right to decide who can belong. 
</P>
<P>
	In overturning that decision last March, an appeals court said  
Dale's ``exemplary journey through the Boy Scouts of America ranks 
as testament enough that these stereotypical notions about 
homosexuals must be rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale, who attended the hearing, said that to him, being morally  
straight ``is to be true to yourself, to be honest and open, and to 
be a member of your community.''

<HEADLINE> 'Ghost Galaxies' Theory Explored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Astronomers searching for mysterious  
missing matter in the universe are focusing on a new theory about 
``ghost galaxies'' that contain few stars but are surrounded by 
dense halos of invisible dark matter. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of 43 galaxies shows that small, ghostly galaxies  
that appear to be little more than ``fuzz balls'' in powerful 
telescope images actually contain high densities of dark matter, 
with only a scattering of visible stars, John Kormendy of the 
University of Hawaii said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the national meeting of the American Astronomical  
Society, Kormendy said there may be more of the small, dense 
galaxies than the bright, giant galaxies. They could, thus, contain 
``a significant portion'' of the universe's dark matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be a large population of dark galaxies that contain  
too few stars to be discovered,'' Kormendy said. ``They may 
outnumber all of the luminous galaxies combined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of invisible matter was determined years ago by  
astronomers who measured the motion of stars within galaxies. They 
determined that stars and clouds that shine and can be seen from 
Earth did not contain enough mass to hold the galaxies together. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, there had to be other matter to provide the gravitational  
force that keeps the galaxies from flying apart. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, some astronomers calculated that 90 percent of the  
matter in the universe cannot be seen and thus is ``missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since this matter is invisible, it must be dark and cold, the  
astronomers reasoned. Thus, it is called ``cold, dark matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, astronomers have been scrambling to try to find and  
identify this missing matter because it has profound implications 
about the motion and ultimate destiny of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still groping,'' said Vera Rubin, a Carnegie Institution  
of Washington astronomer and one of the original theorists about 
cold, dark matter. ``It is as if we are in a black room working on 
a black puzzle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kormendy said he and his colleagues do not claim that all of the  
missing matter is in ``ghostly galaxies,'' but because the fuzz 
balls are so numerous, ``they could add up to a significant portion 
of the dark matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another team of astronomers found support for the Kormendy  
theory in a Hubble Space Telescope study of a galaxy called NGC5907 
that is 40 million light years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubble focused on the galaxy for 10 hours to gather light  
from the very faintest of stars, said Michael Liu of the University 
of California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had expected to see hundreds of stars in the galaxy,'' said  
Liu, ``but in fact we saw very few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The galaxy did not have enough bright stars to provide the  
gravitational cohesion to hold it together, he said. Instead there 
appears to be ``a huge population of faint dwarf stars,'' he said. 
``This is the first evidence for a substantial population of dwarf 
stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwarf stars are too faint to be seen but are detected by their  
gravitational influence on nearby bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu said there is a halo around galaxy NGC5907 composed mostly  
of very dim dwarf stars. This dark matter halo is much denser than 
the bright halo surrounding many galaxies. Also, the high-density 
halo extends out much farther from the galactic center than do 
other galaxies' bright halos. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the studies by the Kormendy and Liu teams ``have  
provided a real service'' in the search for dark matter. But the 
puzzle is still far from solved. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we find a piece of the puzzle, we're not sure where it  
fits,'' she said. ``But these may be two pieces of the puzzle.''

<HEADLINE>  Grammy Nominations a Female Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Grammy voters saluted a spectrum of  
styles this year -- from country pop to introspective rock to 
empowering hip-hop -- as women dominated the major album, record and 
song categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauryn Hill, whose solo debut ``The Miseducation of Lauryn  
Hill'' was met with critical and popular acclaim, received the most 
nominations Tuesday with 10, including best new artist and producer 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill will compete against a nearly all-female field -- including  
Madonna, Sheryl Crow and Shania Twain -- for album of the year. 
Garbage, with lead singer Shirley Manson, also was nominated in the 
category. 
</P>
<P>
	Grammy voters also favored women for record of the year. Twain's  
``You're Still the One'' will compete against Celine Dion's ``My 
Heart Will Go On,'' the Brandy &AMP; Monica duet ``The Boy Is Mine,'' 
and Madonna's ``Ray of Light.'' The sole male entry, the Goo Goo 
Dolls, was nominated for ``Iris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, eight of the 10 Grammy nods for record and album of  
the year went to female artists, doubling last year's nomination 
totals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy women are getting a chance to break  
through,'' said Natalie Imbruglia, whose single ``Torn'' was 
nominated for best female pop vocal and her album ``Left of the 
Middle'' for pop album. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, women also broke new ground on Broadway, winning  
for the first time Tony Awards in direction -- Julie Taymor, for her 
work on the Disney musical ``The Lion King'' and Garry Hynes for 
the Irish drama ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are taking over,'' said Diane Warren, whose ``I Don't  
Want to Miss a Thing'' was nominated for song of the year. ``It 
does seem to be the day of the female artists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 41st annual Grammy Awards will be presented Feb. 24 at the  
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles during a three-hour ceremony on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 460 nominations in 95 categories were such eclectic  
choices as shock rocker Marilyn Manson, Andy Griffith, former 
President Jimmy Carter and pop stalwarts Boy George and Cyndi 
Lauper. 
</P>
<P>
	Diversity also marked the best new artist category. Australian  
pop sensation Imbruglia, teen idols the Backstreet Boys, opera 
singer Andrea Bocelli, the country trio Dixie Chicks and Hill will 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian chanteuse Dion may have sung on two of the top-selling  
albums of 1998 -- the ``Titanic'' soundtrack and her own ``Let's 
Talk About Love'' -- but she earned just four nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Twain kept her success in the family. Her husband, Robert John  
``Mutt'' Lange, who produced and co-wrote much of Twain's material, 
had five nominations, tying with recording engineer Jeff Balding 
for the most among men. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna received five nominations for the ``Ray of Light''  
album, which prompted the best reviews of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic! I'm thrilled! I'm incredibly blessed!'' Madonna  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations for song of the year, a writer's award, went to  
``Iris'' by John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls; ``Lean on Me'' by 
Kirk Franklin; ``My Heart Will Go On'' by James Horner and Will 
Jennings; ``You're Still the One'' by Twain and Lange; and Warren's 
``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill also received Grammy nods for best pop female vocal for  
``Can't Take My Eyes Off of You''; rap solo performance for ``Lost 
Ones''; R&AMP;B female vocal for ``Doo Wop (That Thing);'' R&AMP;B 
performance by a duo or group for ``Nothing Even Matters,'' with 
D'Angelo; and R&AMP;B album for ``Miseducation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was lauded twice in the R&AMP;B song category -- for writing ``A  
Rose is Still a Rose'' for soul queen Aretha Franklin, and for 
penning ``Doo Wop (That Thing).''

<HEADLINE> Denver Wideouts Seek Miami Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Shannon Sharpe isn't shy about flexing his  
considerably toned biceps, whether it's on the 50-yard line, in the 
end zone or in front of the water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Dec. 21, Sharpe -- a seven-time Pro Bowl tight end -- and  
the Denver Broncos wide receivers literally got outmuscled by the 
Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling to get separation against Miami's cornerbacks,  
Denver's frustrations peaked in the fourth quarter when Sharpe 
appeared to catch a third-down pass, only to have Jerry Wilson 
wrestle the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
	The interception led to a game-clinching field goal in a 31-21  
Miami victory that the Broncos vividly remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were embarrassed,'' Sharpe said this week as Denver  
prepared for Saturday's AFC divisional playoff game against the 
Dolphins. ``They handed it to us on Monday night on national 
television. There were probably 30 or 40 million people watching, 
and we didn't make a good showing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to do anything to diminish what they did. They  
stopped us. They won the ball game, and now we get an opportunity 
on Saturday to see if it was for real or if it was a hoax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anchored by cornerbacks Terrell Buckley and Sam Madison, Miami's  
pass defense is legit. Buckley and Madison had eight interceptions 
apiece this season, the most by any tandem in Dolphins history. As 
a team, Miami led the NFL with 29 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with the way our secondary has played, and when  
you say secondary, I think that encompasses everybody,'' Dolphins 
coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The secondary struggled against Buffalo last week as Eric Moulds  
caught nine passes for an NFL playoff-record 240 yards and a 
touchdown. That was 108 yards more than Sharpe and receivers Rod 
Smith and Ed McCaffrey had combined three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The standard is so high, and every time one little minute  
thing doesn't go our way, it's perceived as such a big 
disappointment,'' Smith said. ``It's our fault because we want our 
high standards. We live and die with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith (1,222 yards), McCaffrey (1,053) and Sharpe (768) put up  
gaudy numbers this season, but looked ordinary against Miami. While 
linebacker Zach Thomas blanketed Sharpe, Madison and Buckley took 
care of the corners, with support from safeties Brock Marion and 
Calvin Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The superb man-to-man coverage enabled the Dolphins to crowd the  
front line, and it paid off as they held Terrell Davis to a 
season-low 29 yards rushing. Davis finished the season with 2,008 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a doubt, that was the best defense that we faced all  
year in the running game and passing game,'' McCaffrey said. ``They 
shut us down. We are going to have to do a lot of things 
differently, or at least better, to win.'' was a step or two from 
making a big run. I need to make those plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe challenged himself, personally, as he prepares for a  
rematch with Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zach won that one, and I'll be ready this time,'' he said.  
``He played better than I did, and I tip my hat to him. I didn't 
think he was that good in the beginning, but I have a newfound 
respect for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that humble admission, Sharpe didn't back down from his  
postgame comment of three weeks ago, when he insisted Denver is 
still 10 to 14 points better than the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stopped us, and I gave them credit, the utmost credit,''  
Sharpe said. ``I am very (stingy) with my compliments, but I passed 
them out to them, so they should be gracious and accept them and be 
ready to play on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're looking for me, I ain't hard to find. If they're  
looking for something to say, I'm going to give them something to 
say.''

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner-Berra Feud Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Welcome back, Yogi.  
</P>
<P>
	With two simple words -- ``it's over'' -- and a handshake Tuesday,  
Yogi Berra ended his 14-year feud with Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Yogi says it's over, it's over.  
</P>
<P>
	The whole thing started when the Boss fired Berra as New York's  
manager only 16 games into the 1985 season. Ever since, the man who 
popularized the phrase ``it ain't over 'til it's over'' has stayed 
away from Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fourteen years, I'd say, is long enough,'' the 73-year-old  
Berra said. ``He apologized again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner flew in from Florida earlier in the day and  
apologized for the way in which he dismissed Berra -- sending a club 
executive to deliver the word rather than doing so in person. 
</P>
<P>
	The reconciliation, arranged by radio station WFAN, came at an  
appropriate setting -- the Yogi Berra Museum on the campus of the 
Hall of Famer catcher's adopted alma mater, Montclair (N.J.) State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize how much I'd screwed up. It was a major  
screw-up. It was a stupid thing on my part,'' Steinbrenner said. 
``It was a monumental mistake on my part. Sometimes, it takes a 
long time to get things right. Yogi is a highly principled man. I 
messed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy he feels it's time to put this behind us,'' he  
said, standing next to Berra during a WFAN interview. ``I'm glad 
he's said, `George, I forgive you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra has not been at Yankee Stadium for an official function  
since he was replaced by Billy Martin with a 6-10 record in 1985, 
though he has occasionally showed up to visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who managed the Yankees to the World Series in 1964, had  
returned for the 1984 season and went 87-75. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no word yet, but look for Berra to be back at the  
ballpark this year, throwing out a first ball and appearing at 
Old-Timers Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him how much I wanted him to come back to Yankee  
Stadium again, where he belongs,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I didn't 
feel right winning the World Series last year and not having Yogi 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have him sitting with me sometimes, just to talk  
about what's going on,'' he said. ``He is a treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Berra wanted to make this clear: He never stopped rooting  
for his old team, for which he won three AL MVP awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled for them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, before a Yankees-Mets interleague game at Shea  
Stadium, Berra seemed to indicate a possible thaw in his 
Steinbrenner freeze. The official end came Tuesday when 
Steinbrenner met for 15 minutes with Berra and his wife, Carmen, at 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Berra gave Steinbrenner a 45-minute tour of the  
building. The owner said he was impressed with the items on 
display, including uniforms, bats and the mitt he used to catch Don 
Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could spend a whole day here,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm  
going to start sending him some stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks At Record High; Dow Up 120 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks vaulted to record high territory this  
morning, as investors continued to pour cash into the market. The 
Dow industrials, Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's composite indexes 
were all at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 120.50 at 9,431.69, beating its previous closing record high of 
9,374.27 set on Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 15.78 at 1,260.56, on  
track to set its second consecutive record. The technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index was up 44.04 at 2,295.31, the fourth record 
in as many trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices moved higher as investors continued to shower the market  
with new cash from yearend bonuses and sales late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly unbelievable,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment  
officer at BankBoston. ``Technology stocks are clearly the dominant 
group in this flurry of activity. I think there's a level of 
comfort with these securities that doesn't come with a lot of other 
areas in the marketplace. But these front-line companies are really 
stretching the realm of reality here in terms of price-to-earnings 
ratios relative to growth prospects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were indeed leading the way, with IBM up 2  
3/16 at 191 13/16 on the Big Board and Intel up 2 1/4 at 125 1/2 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks were also higher. MBNA Corp., a consumer  
finance and credit card company, was up 3/4 at 24 5/8 in leading volume 
on the Big Board. It was followed by Citigroup, up 2 9/16 at 53 
13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at 300 million 
shares and up sharply from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrials rose 126.92 to 9,311.19,  
missing by record by 63 points. As in today's trading, broad 
indexes climbed on strength in technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, the Commerce Department said sales of new  
single-family homes soared 7.6 percent to a record in November, 
propelled by low interest rates, unseasonable warmth and a strong 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas stock markets made strong gains following Wall Street's  
showing Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.09 percent. In 
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 5.03 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.29 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
6.55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pen, Ink, Paper - and Patience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tucked inside an elfin workshop in Staten  
Island, miles from Manhattan's publishing elite, bookmaker Malachi 
McCormick quietly plies his trade. REAL quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no whir of presses at The Stone Street Press, no mad  
dash to set type, no repetitive hum of machines in motion. In fact, 
there is no press of any kind -- just McCormick, a stack of paper, a 
pen and a bottle of ink. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepping into McCormick's Stone Street shop is like going back  
in time. No radio. No television. Not even a clock in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have anything dividing your attention,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Books are made here.  
</P>
<P>
	Not cookie-cutter, run-of-the-mill books, but slim, richly  
textured tomes, written entirely in calligraphy, each hand-bound by 
McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful to watch people discover Malachi's works at  
book fairs. Listening to the oohs and exclamations of delight,'' 
said Karin Taylor, executive director of the Small Press Center, 
which represents small publishers. ``It's quite apparent all the 
love and devotion that goes into his books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 61 limited-edition titles range from the esoteric (``Herself  
Long Ago,'' a translation of poems by six Irish women between the 
eighth and 10th centuries) to the Epicurean (cookbooks on Irish 
soups, breads, holiday dinners). 
</P>
<P>
	Though most reach deep into his Irish roots, McCormick has also  
published books on English, Yiddish and African proverbs and 
collections of nursery rhymes and cat folk tales. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone Street is among the smallest of the estimated 50,000 small  
presses in the nation, Taylor says. A small press is defined as one 
that publishes fewer than 12 titles a year and has a print run of 
5,000 or under. McCormick usually publishes one title a year, but 
he works on several different books at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Though labor intensive, his books are surprisingly affordable.  
They range from $4 for the diminutive ``How to Make a Decent Cup of 
Tea'' to $35 for the miniature three-volume ``Love of Frog.'' His 
entire catalog can be purchased for $440. 
</P>
<P>
	``A book should be affordable to people,'' he says. ``I have  
friends who have their own small press and nothing sells for less 
than $100 or $150. There's something anti-democratic when you get 
to that level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Cobh in County Cork, McCormick founded The Stone  
Street Press -- named after the cobblestone street where he lives 
and works -- in 1980, when he was between jobs and at a crossroads 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
	He had already spent nearly 25 years working first as a chemist  
for an Irish steel company and then as a management consultant at a 
large firm in London. Although he says he could make 20 times his 
current income in either career, he found neither fulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no need to ask why he pours so much into a business that  
has, he admits, marginal financial return. 
</P>
<P>
	McCormick simply loves what he does. Visitors are enveloped in  
his stories about Irish poets, harps (his newest book is poems 
about harps), Irish saints. He's not only interested in his 
research, he's immersed in it. 
</P>
<P>
	McCormick moved to New York in 1973 with a community of writers  
and artists he helped found in London. He wrote and edited the 
group's magazine, but in 1980 he decided to leave the community and 
Manhattan to try something new. He had an idea for a book on Irish 
proverbs and, while exploring how to get it published, a friend 
suggested he do it himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really a rather astounding suggestion,'' said  
McCormick, who has bushy salt-and-pepper hair and a cultured Irish 
brogue. ``For all the books I'd read, I had never thought about how 
a book is made. It was an outrageous idea, and I really liked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He knew it would be done in calligraphy, the legacy of both his  
rigorous Irish schooling and his mother, who he says ``wrote in the 
clearest hand'' all of her 89 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best calligraphy is invisible,'' McCormick says, adding  
that it should never distract the reader from the text. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he judges his first work, ``A Collection of Irish  
Proverbs,'' as amateurish but not bad, he says his latest book, 
``Colum Cille,'' about the life of a sixth-century Irish saint, 
showed vast improvement. ``I like the idea that the better you get 
at it, the less noticeable it is,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The writing might blend in, but the books do not. These are  
books that beg to be held, touched, even caressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper can be thick and hearty or delicate and dimpled; each  
page is slightly different. Bindings are hand-stitched and made of 
string and ribbons. And Stone Street book jackets are the 
antithesis of glossy, machine-made book fronts. His covers are 
adorned in brilliant Chinese paste silks, colorful collages and 
luxurious textured paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sort of wholesomeness or healthiness in touching a  
book with texture,'' McCormick says. ``I can't really explain it. 
It's like trying to explain why something handmade is better. You 
can have a handmade hammer and a machine-made hammer. Both have the 
same function, yet there is this THING that makes the homemade 
hammer just feel better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of his titles -- the Irish cookbook, the tea book and a  
collection of Irish folk tales -- were republished via conventional 
printing press by Random House. It was a learning experience for 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me they wanted the book to look like mine, so they  
hired me as a consultant on the design,'' he says. ``Yet everything 
I recommended they found a reason why it wouldn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He picked out a parchment paper with unusual markings but was  
told it was too expensive and wouldn't go through the machine. 
``They ended up photographing the paper'' and running it through 
the press, he said with a deep, head-shaking sigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his books are not big in size (the smallest is 2 1/8 inches  
by 2 3/4 inches) or volume (they range from 12 to 80 pages), they take 
time to make. 
</P>
<P>
	McCormick works eight to 10 hours a day, usually in silence,  
perched on his footstool, parchment paper on the light box, 
carefully scripting each letter. An apprentice comes in once a 
week. McCormick says it takes about 2 1/2 months to complete the 
calligraphy for a book the size of ``Colum Cille.'' Copies are then 
printed from the original. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he doesn't feel isolated. ``It's really a more reflective  
kind of thing,'' he says, and there's also the added pleasure of 
seeing a book come out right. 
</P>
<P>
	His works are sold at independent bookstores across the country,  
including Gaelsong in Seattle, Printed Matter in New York City, 
Wordsworth in Boston, Earthsong in Del Mar, Calif., McIntyre's in 
Pittsboro, N.C., and Chapters in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demise of many independent booksellers -- a subject that  
stokes McCormick's Irish ire -- has forced him to become his own 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	He spends many weeks each year selling his works at book fairs,  
auctions and craft shows. And while he enjoys meeting readers, it 
cuts into his creative time. 
</P>
<P>
	His books are sold on the Internet through Amazon.com and  
barnesandnoble.com, but McCormick says he's had few sales from 
either. Perhaps, he says, book lovers who scour small shops for 
quirky, interesting works do not buy books via computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``A book,'' he says, ``is not just a vehicle for a story. It's  
sort of living as well.''

<HEADLINE> Ford To Install Crash Sensors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will begin equipping its cars and  
trucks with a new computer-driven system that adjusts how air bags 
expand to better protect the driver and front-seat passenger from 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The system involves sensors that instantly determine the  
severity of a frontal crash, consider the front occupants' seating 
position and weight, and determine if they are belted. It then 
adjusts the explosive power of the air bags and tightness of the 
seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced the system today at the North American  
International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Elements of the system will begin appearing on Ford cars and  
light trucks beginning with year 2000 models that will arrive in 
showrooms later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advanced Restraints System first will be the 2000 Taurus  
family sedan. Within three years, all elements of the system should 
be on all new Ford vehicles sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The move addresses concerns about the threat air bags pose to  
unbelted occupants and small children and adults in minor 
accidents. Though air bags have saved thousands of lives, they also 
have been blamed in the deaths of dozens of people, mostly children 
and small women. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving beyond mechanical devices for occupant safety  
and are now adding to the mix a fully integrated, computer-driven 
system that `thinks' about and responds to different conditions,'' 
said Neil Ressler, chief technical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will work with two-stage air bags that will expand at  
full force in higher speed crashes and more slowly in lower-speed 
wrecks. They are designed not to inflate in minor fender-benders. 
If the driver is closer to the air bag, as determined by seat 
position, the air bag will inflate more slowly. It also will adjust 
the front passenger's air bag depending on the passenger's weight -- 
more so for the heavy, less for small children. 
</P>
<P>
	The seat weight sensor will not initially be included in the  
2000 Taurus, however. 
</P>
<P>
	In severe crashes, the system will tighten the seat belts  
initially, but as the force on the occupant's chest increases a 
sensor will give the belt some slack to avoid crushing the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every accident is as unique as the individuals involved,''  
said Helen Petrauskas, vice president of environmental and safety 
engineering. ``Bearing that in mind, Ford has worked hard to 
develop a safety system that can provide people of different sizes, 
facing various types of frontal crash situations a restraints 
system that automatically tailors itself based on certain crash 
conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to offer the system at no extra cost.

<HEADLINE> Text of Articles of Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the articles of impeachment against President Clinton  
approved by the House and sent to the Senate for trial: 
</P>
<P>
	Resolution Impeaching William Jefferson Clinton, President of  
the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Resolved, That William Jefferson Clinton, President of the  
United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and 
that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the 
United States Senate: 
</P>
<P>
	Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of  
Representatives of the United States of America in the name of 
itself and of the people of the United States of America, against 
William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States of 
America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him 
for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	ARTICLE I   	
</P>
<P>
	In his conduct while President of the United States, William  
Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath 
faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States 
and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed, has willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial 
process of the United States for his personal gain and exoneration, 
impeding the administration of justice, in that: 
</P>
<P>
	On August 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the  
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth before a Federal 
grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William 
Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and 
misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of 
the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with 
a subordinate Government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and 
misleading testimony he gave in a Federal civil rights action 
brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he 
allowed his attorney to make to a Federal judge in that civil 
rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the 
testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in 
that civil rights action. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the  
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency, 
has betrayed his trust as President, and has acted in a manner 
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants  
impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	ARTICLE III   	
</P>
<P>
	In his conduct while President of the United States, William  
Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath 
faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States 
and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration 
of justice, and has to that end engaged personally, and through his 
subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed 
to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence 
and testimony related to a Federal civil rights action brought 
against him in a duly instituted judicial proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The means used to implement this course of conduct or scheme  
included one or more of the following acts: 
</P>
<P>
	(1) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil rights action 
brought against him to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding 
that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	(2) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil rights action 
brought against him to give perjurious, false and misleading 
testimony if and when called to testify personally in that 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	(3) On or about December 28, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal 
evidence that had been subpoenaed in a Federal civil rights action 
brought against him. 
</P>
<P>
	(4) Beginning on or about December 7, 1997, and continuing  
through and including January 14, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton 
intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance to 
a witness in a Federal civil rights action brought against him in 
order to corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness 
in that proceeding at a time when the truthful testimony of that 
witness would have been harmful to him. 
</P>
<P>
	(5) On January 17, 1998, at his deposition in a Federal civil  
rights action brought against him, William Jefferson Clinton 
corruptly allowed his attorney to make false and misleading 
statements to a Federal judge characterizing an affidavit, in order 
to prevent questioning deemed relevant by the judge. Such false and 
misleading statements were subsequently acknowledged by his 
attorney in a communication to that judge. 
</P>
<P>
	(6) On or about January 18 and January 20-21, 1998, William  
Jefferson Clinton related a false and misleading account of events 
relevant to a Federal civil rights action brought against him to a 
potential witness in that proceeding, in order to corruptly 
influence the testimony of that witness. 
</P>
<P>
	(7) On or about January 21, 23 and 26, 1998, William Jefferson  
Clinton made false and misleading statements to potential witnesses 
in a Federal grand jury proceeding in order to corruptly influence 
the testimony of those witnesses. The false and misleading 
statements made by William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the 
witnesses to the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive 
false and misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
	In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the  
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency, 
has betrayed his trust as President, and has acted in a manner 
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants  
impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> Iran Officials Arrested in Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- In a rare admission of official complicity,  
Iran has arrested several Intelligence Ministry officials in the 
slayings of five dissidents, the government acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement given to the official Islamic Republic News  
Agency, the Intelligence Ministry announced ``with regret'' on 
Tuesday that it had arrested a number of ministry officials. It did 
not say how many. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few of our colleagues -- irresponsible, devious and obstinate  
persons -- were among those arrested,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five writers and opposition figures killed late last year  
were all critical of the government's hard-line clergymen, who are 
trying to stymie the social and political reforms of moderate 
President Mohammad Khatami. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of students and intellectuals had demonstrated to  
protest the killings and called for the dismissal of Iranian 
intelligence officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry also accused foreign countries of being involved in  
the killings, but did not say which ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``With no doubt these criminals were acting for the interests of  
foreigners and the actions of these traitors are quite contrary to 
the holy mission of the Intelligence Ministry and we condemn it,'' 
the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the five victims, Dariush Foruhar and his wife  
Parvaneh, belonged to a minor opposition party. They were found 
stabbed to death in their Tehran home on Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In the following weeks, writers Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and  
Mohammad Mokhtari disappeared and their bodies were found dumped on 
the outskirts of Tehran. They appeared to have been strangled. Both 
men had tried to set up a writer's association. A third writer, 
Majid Sharif, was found dead after disappearing from his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami has ordered a top-level investigation into the killings.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, a senior hard-line judge was wounded in the leg,  
chest and abdomen after a man on a motorcycle fastened explosives 
to his car, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier reports said Hojatolislam Ali Razini was wounded only in  
the leg. He was in intensive care today after undergoing surgery, 
the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Interior Ministry official blamed the banned opposition group  
Mujahedeen Khalq Organization for the attack, which reportedly 
killed another judiciary official and wounded four other people.

<HEADLINE> SEC Backs Stricter Nasdaq Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have approved a sweeping  
proposal by the dealers' group that runs the Nasdaq Stock Market to 
remove thousands of small and speculative stocks from special 
over-the-counter listings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday approved the  
proposal made a year ago by the National Association of Securities 
Dealers to strip from the OTC Bulletin Board, an electronic market 
of about 6,800 securities, stocks of any companies that don't file 
financial disclosure statements with the SEC or banking or 
insurance regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the stocks listed on the Bulletin Board do not submit  
such reports, according to the NASD, which announced the SEC's 
approval on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Nasdaq's parent organization is aimed at distancing  
the nation's second-largest stock market from cheap, high-risk 
stocks, sometimes called ``penny stocks,'' that are thinly traded 
and loosely regulated and have had problems with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq runs the Bulletin Board, but its stocks are not actually  
listed on the Nasdaq market because they don't meet Nasdaq listing 
standards or don't file disclosure statements with the SEC. The 
Bulletin Board stocks often are linked with Nasdaq's name, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The new filing requirement for companies will protect investors  
in Bulletin Board stocks by giving them access to companies' 
financial information, the NASD said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thorough and accurate information is the foundation of sound  
investment decisions,'' Frank Zarb, NASD's chairman and chief 
executive officer, said in a statement. He called the move ``a 
major step toward improving the quality'' of the market for 
small-company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirement also means that the companies will be  
subject to closer oversight by the SEC and other watchdog agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing requirement will be phased in over a 12-month period  
beginning in July and continuing through June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman John Heine declined comment on the matter.  
</P>
<P>
	The stocks to be dropped under the proposal also include many  
special shares of foreign companies. As of April 1998, foreign 
securities had to be fully registered with the SEC to remain listed 
on the Bulletin Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts have said the stocks that are removed could  
still be listed on the so-called Pink Sheets, a less automated 
system not affiliated with Nasdaq -- but would be more difficult to 
trade.

<HEADLINE> 50 Trial Seats Reserved for Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If they are willing to line up at the Capitol  
a little early, 50 people a day can get a chance to witness the 
historic Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 seats reserved for the public in the 596-seat Senate  
chamber will be handed out one hour before each day's proceedings 
on a first-come, first-served basis through the regular Capitol 
tour entrances, the Senate decided in a resolution approved 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This system, said Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., will  
``make as many seats available in the gallery for the public and 
others as is possible for us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the choice seats will be divvied up among various  
government officials, with each of the 100 senators getting one 
permanent ticket -- good any day by anybody who holds it -- and three 
daily tickets apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate sergeant at arms gets 45 daily tickets, with smaller  
numbers allocated to the White House (30), House of Representatives 
(20), diplomatic corps (22) and Supreme Court (9). 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate part of the chamber, the press gets 120 seats and  
16 standing-room-only spots that don't count toward the 596-seat 
total. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate leadership will get most of the remaining 20 seats,  
but just how those will be distributed wasn't immediately 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules were based on the 1868 impeachment trial of President  
Andrew Johnson, which ignited the social scene in Washington, 
according to a Senate history by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opening day saw the Senate galleries jammed with a curious  
mob,'' Byrd wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate historian Don Ritchie said Johnson's trial marked the  
first time tickets were issued for the Senate galleries. That 
trial, in which Johnson escaped conviction by a single vote, lasted 
about six weeks and was held from noon to dinnertime daily except 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	``People flocked to it. We have some sketches of people rushing  
to the doors to get in. The women were in big hoop skirts. People 
were just desperate for seats in the trial,'' Ritchie said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reporters who were not credentialed to the press gallery were  
going crazy trying to get tickets to get into the gallery so they 
could hear what was going on. Once you got in the gallery, you 
pretty much stayed there.''

<HEADLINE> Mighty Mississippi, a River of Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When they set off down the great spine of the Midwest, John  
Junkerman and Elijah Wald worried that all they might be doing was 
recording the epitaph for something that was dying, Mississippi 
River music. 
</P>
<P>
	``We entered this thing with some trepidation, thinking all we  
would find in the Midwest was Wal-Marts and malls,'' says 
Junkerman, producer and director of an ambitious new PBS series, 
``The Mississippi: River of Song.'' It airs tonight and the three 
following Wednesday nights at 10 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some concern that we were just kidding ourselves  
that there was still music out there to be listened to,'' he said 
in a recent phone interview from the pair's home base, the Boston 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think one of the really surprising and exciting things  
for both of us was, that with only a couple of exceptions, what we 
were finding doesn't seem to be dying at all,'' Wald, the program's 
musical consultant and writer, said in a separate conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very exciting,'' he added with a laugh, ``to go in  
looking for the remains of a dying culture and to find out it 
wasn't dying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, if ``River of Song'' says anything about American  
culture, it is that while the great U.S. melting pot experiment may 
not have come to fruition yet, at least where racial tolerance or 
economic parity are concerned, it is humming right along when it 
comes to music. 
</P>
<P>
	Its development there is seen in the performances of Manny  
Lopez, a Mexican-American trumpeter from Davenport, Iowa, who grew 
up playing mariachi music, and whose name was the one Junkerman and 
Wald heard repeatedly when they asked around for a horn player who 
best represented the city's annual Bix Beiderbecke Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is seen again in the music of Louisiana's Christine  
Balfa. The daughter of the legendary Cajun accordion player Dewey 
Balfa does a song called ``Un Cadien de Grand Basile,'' whose 
lyrical refrain translates from Cajun French into, ``I'm content to 
be a Cajun from Grand Basile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After much listening, Junkerman and Wald discovered the melody  
to be a slightly altered, Cajun-inflected, but still 
very-much-recognizable variation of one performed by Merle Haggard 
when he sings, ``I'm proud to be an Okee from Muskogee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody, including Christine Balfa, knew that,'' Junkerman  
recalls excitedly. ``She said this is just considered to be a Cajun 
song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it turned out the connection clearly made sense.  
</P>
<P>
	For just up the river from Balfa's Louisiana bayou country,  
Junkerman and Wald had filmed Haggard singing at a 98th birthday 
party in Shreveport for former Gov. Jimmie Davis, the man who gave 
the world the song ``You Are My Sunshine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It just serves to illustrate the way music crosses barriers of  
language and culture and continues to be reinterpreted and 
revised,'' Junkerman said. ``And people take it for their own, and 
the origins of the music become lost in time. But then there they 
are. That's a wonderful organic process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's one that gets repeated up and down the Mississippi as  
``River of Song'' takes viewers on a journey through nearly a dozen 
states and into scores of cultures, where songs are sung in 
uncounted variations of Spanish, French and English. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip, narrated by folk-rock musician Ani DiFranco, unfolds  
over four hour-long segments that are scheduled to air on PBS 
stations across the country on successive Wednesday nights starting 
tonight. A companion CD, a seven-part radio series and a book on 
the project are also scheduled for release this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, Junkerman, a veteran documentary filmmaker, and  
Wald, a music writer for The Boston Globe, uncover seemingly every 
American musical form, from blues to bluegrass, gospel to jazz, 
Cajun to zydeco, rock to folk, Indian chants to inner-city 
handclaps. 
</P>
<P>
	DiFranco, meanwhile, makes mention of seemingly every prominent  
musician who ever trod the banks of the Mississippi, from Bob Dylan 
of Minnesota to Elvis Presley of Memphis to Chuck Berry and 
Josephine Baker of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	But save for a few exceptions, such as Haggard and alternative  
rockers Soul Asylum of Minnesota, the spotlight rarely falls on the 
famous. It is directed instead at the working-class musicians, the 
ones who sing and play in the clubs, the roadhouses, on the back 
porches, at work, even in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	They include the likes of Sonny Burgess, the greatest rockabilly  
musician to never leave Arkansas, and Irma Thomas, the great New 
Orleans soul singer whose ``Time is on My Side'' was an early hit 
for the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
	And they include groups like the Bottle Rockets, a blue-collar  
contingent from Festus, Mo., that got together to meld the musical 
styles of Hank Williams and Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Put it all together and it's a snapshot of real life. Real life  
from a place the Bottle Rockets' Brian Henneman calls, ``That 
mysterious land in the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> No Deaths on US Air Carriers in '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after the ValuJet and TWA 800  
crashes raised questions about safety, U.S. airlines closed out 
1998 with a little noticed milestone: None of their 615 million 
passengers died in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears to be the first year since the dawn of commercial  
aviation for such an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least two other years when no one died in the  
crash of a U.S. jetliner, most recently 1993. But since the 
National Transportation Safety Board began compiling statistics in 
1967, such zeros have always been offset by deaths in smaller, 
generally propeller-driven commuter airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, no passenger died in an accident involving a scheduled  
U.S. commercial airplane anywhere in the world. That silent 
achievement stands in contrast to the public outcry after the TWA 
and ValuJet crashes in 1996 killed a combined total of 340. The 
same year a United Express commuter accident in Quincy, Ill., 
killed all 12 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Government, aviation safety and airline officials were heartened  
by the latest news, but they were also quick to say that even in 
years when there are passenger deaths, the nation's aviation system 
remains the safest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there is an accident, it's just by the grace of God  
whether there are a lot of people killed or not,'' said Stuart 
Matthews, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an industry 
trade group. ``The truth is, these are very random things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Les Dorr said 1998's zero-fatality count ``was the  
result of the things that we and our industry partners have been 
doing every day to make sure that flying remains the safest form of 
transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the FAA, the airlines and the aerospace industry  
announced a goal to cut the aviation accident rate by 80 percent by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the things they are targeting are crashes in which pilots  
become disoriented and fly perfectly workable planes into terrain 
around an airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that safety commitment, experts say, a coming boom in  
worldwide aviation could result in an airplane crash each week. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety drive comes two years after ValuJet Flight 592  
plunged into the Florida Everglades, killing 110, and TWA Flight 
800 exploded off Long Island, killing 230. The crashes prompted 
criticism of the FAA and then-Transportation Secretary Federico 
Pena. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators later traced the ValuJet crash to a cargo fire,  
prompting the FAA to order airlines to install systems that detect 
and fight cargo fires. Investigators still do not know what caused 
the TWA explosion, but they suspect sparks from wiring around the 
plane's center fuel tank. That has prompted a series of new 
inspection orders for U.S. aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board deferred comment on the  
lack of fatalities, waiting for official confirmation from the FAA. 
The airlines were pleased by the news, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the final numbers are in, we expect we will have carried  
615 million passengers last year,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman 
for the Air Transport Association, which represents the major 
airlines. ``Without a fatality, that's a wonderful statistic. Zero 
fatalities have to be our goal every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 numbers do not include the Sept. 2 crash of Swissair  
Flight 111 off Nova Scotia, which killed all 229 aboard. While that 
flight departed from New York bound for Geneva, it did not involve 
a U.S. carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures also do not include a Nov. 4 incident in which a  
Northwest Airlines baggage handler was killed when she walked into 
the turning propeller blades of a commuter plane as it readied for 
takeoff in Memphis, Tenn. The plane was carrying eight passengers, 
none of whom was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB said the last time a passenger died in a U.S. airline  
accident was Dec. 28, 1997, when a woman suffered a fatal head 
injury after a United Airlines plane hit turbulence during a flight 
from Tokyo to Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The last fatal commuter crash in NTSB records occurred on Nov.  
8, 1997, when a Hageland Aviation Services Cessna 208B crashed in 
Barrow, Alaska, killing seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary figures show that 598 people were killed in general  
aviation accidents in 1998, including crashes of private and 
corporate planes. There also were 17 people killed -- 15 in Alaska 
alone -- in crashes of air taxis. They are not scheduled airlines, 
but for-hire commercial airplanes.

<HEADLINE> Lockout's Over, So What's Up, M.J.? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- So, what's it going to be, Michael?  
</P>
<P>
	The world's greatest basketball player had promised that once  
the lockout ended he'd announce whether he will retire or return to 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, it's over -- and now the real suspense begins.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan could keep everyone guessing for another couple  
of weeks while he enjoys more time on a sun-splashed golf course 
and considers his options. 
</P>
<P>
	He might, as his buddy Charles Barkley predicted last month,  
walk away from the game he has ruled. A second retirement, this one 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
	He could, as his brother suggested in November, be enticed by a  
short season and return for a chance to lead the Chicago Bulls to 
their seventh championship of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Even his agent isn't sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no gut feeling on it,'' David Falk said Wednesday from  
New York as players -- Jordan not among them -- gathered to approve 
the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision. I'm not certain what his 
time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two months shy of his 36th birthday, Jordan is a free  
agent who can sign with any team. But none could pay him as much as 
the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, a grandfather clause allows any player to  
re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous salary. That 
means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, could get about 
$34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials wouldn't comment Wednesday because the lockout  
doesn't officially end until the agreement is approved by the Board 
of Governors, which is to vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's return would figure to be a boost for a league that has  
now turned off many fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league could survive without him but it would really be a  
setback,'' said Bulls center Bill Wennington, also a free agent. 
``People love to watch him play. I love to watch him play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan owns 10 scoring titles, five MVP Awards, six NBA Finals  
MVPs and the highest playoff scoring average in history. Along with 
Muhammad Ali, he's the most recognizable athlete in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	After a golf outing last summer, he leaned toward retirement but  
said he would reveal his plans once the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Even earlier, he reflected on a life without the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't miss it at all, as much as you may think,'' Jordan  
said last June after leading the Bulls over Utah for their sixth 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I may have some (nostalgia) when it comes back to this  
time of the season, but I've got enough memories to suffice and 
overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have another life. And I know I have to get to it at some  
point in time. Hopefully the fans and the people understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some scenarios:  
</P>
<P>
	--HE STAYS: A shortened season of 50 games would be easier  
physically and mentally, creating a shorter path to another 
championship. The abbreviated season -- if the one played out in the 
NHL in 1995 following labor strife is an indication -- would be one 
of the most competitive ever because every game would mean so much. 
That type of basketball is what Jordan relishes most, where every 
game has playoff ramifications. And why leave when he's still the 
best player in the game, even as he approaches 36? 
</P>
<P>
	--HE GOES: He's fed up with the haggling after all he's done for  
the game, including an early role in the negotiations, and ready to 
move on. He said he wouldn't play for any coach but Phil Jackson 
but backed off and said he'd play for anyone he wanted. Tim Floyd 
might not be that coach. In a rushed three-week training camp with 
unsettled rosters, there would be little time for Jordan and Floyd 
to get used to each another. Scottie Pippen's future will also be a 
factor. And it would be difficult for Jordan to top his performance 
in the Game 6 last June against Utah: a driving basket to get the 
Bulls close, a steal from Karl Malone and then a game-winning shot, 
all in the final minutes. Vintage. A fitting way to leave. He's got 
golf and business to satisfy his competitive cravings. Money? Need 
you ask?

<HEADLINE> Feds Say Texaco Underpaid 186 Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal agency has found that Texaco  
Inc., which reached a landmark settlement with black employees in 
1997, underpaid some women at offices around the country between 
1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, without admitting any violations, has agreed to pay  
$3.1 million to the 186 women, who held managerial and support jobs 
at its White Plains headquarters and elsewhere, company spokeswoman 
Kelly McAndrew said today. The number is 2 percent of Texaco's 
female employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a cooperative agreement,'' Ms. McAndrew said. ``We're  
very pleased that the agency found no violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is the largest resulting from an audit by the  
Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, 
which monitors affirmative action at companies that do business 
with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is dwarfed by the $176 million settlement the company  
reached in the racial discrimination case. That case brought 
notoriety to Texaco because of tape recordings on which company 
executives belittled black employees and discussed destroying 
documents sought by the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreement provides back pay -- ranging from $1,500 to  
$51,000 -- and salary increases for the women involved. Texaco must 
expand opportunities for women and analyze its pay scales every 
year, paying particular attention to salaries in the midlevel pay 
grades covered by the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Jags' Brunell Says He's Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Last week, Mark Brunell shook the rust  
off. This week, he's feeling even better. 
</P>
<P>
	After going through his first full practice of the week  
Wednesday, Brunell said his sprained ankle has improved 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	He is no longer listed on the team's injury report and will  
start when Jacksonville plays the New York Jets on Sunday in a 
second-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going full out, and the reason I'm going full out is  
because it feels great,'' Brunell said. ``There's a lot of 
strength, there's no pain. And I need to practice, just like all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell took about half the snaps at practices last week and  
worked with a watered-down game plan against the New England 
Patriots, one that didn't include as many rollouts and bootlegs as 
the Jaguars normally put in. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tom Coughlin said he doesn't expect Brunell to return to  
full health before the end of the season, but he knows things will 
be better this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things linger, and I don't see him being by any means as  
he would appear next July,'' Coughlin said. ``We'll see. It's an 
ongoing thing in terms of experimenting with him to see what he can 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell said Coughlin's assessment is accurate.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not 100 percent,'' Brunell said. ``I don't think I have  
the speed I had before the injury. But I do feel more mobile. I 
feel if I get out of the pocket, I will be able to run with the 
ball a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Keenan McCardell suffered a small fracture in his hand  
and will wear a small splint for the Jets game. He was listed as 
probable on the team's injury report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will hamper him,'' Coughlin said. ``The  
swelling is gone, but he will have to play with some sort of 
device'' on his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars also listed center Quentin Neujahr as questionable  
with a neck injury. Neujahr missed last week's 25-10 victory over 
the New England Patriots, replaced by rookie John Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive lineman Tony Brackens was limited in practice with a  
hip injury, Coughlin said.

<HEADLINE> New-Home Sales Surge to Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home purchases surged to a record high in  
November and, even without December's figure, 1998 already is the 
best year for new home sales since the government began tracking 
them 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom -- and shopping for trimmings such as furniture and  
appliances -- is helping the U.S. economy weather spillover on 
American factories and farms from the global economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	According to economist Robert Barr of Fannie Mae, housing  
construction -- which represents only about 4 percent of the 
nation's economic output -- accounted for roughly a seventh of last 
year's growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you include home services and services linked to housing,  
there's an even larger impact,'' he said. ``It's been vital for the 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans bought new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate  
of 965,000 in November, up 7.6 percent from October and surpassing 
the previous record rate of 919,000, set in June, the Commerce 
Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure ``is the economic equivalent of Mark McGwire's 70  
home runs,'' said economist David Orr of First Union Mortgage Corp. 
in Charlotte, N.C. ``The continued surge in residential housing 
during 1998 is historic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	November's increase, the third in a row, was the largest in a  
year. And, the 823,000 homes sold during the first 11 months of the 
year have already established an annual record, beating the 819,000 
homes sold during 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	November marked the 15th consecutive month of sales rates above  
800,000, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe unusually warm weather in November gave sales  
an added boost for the month and predicted sales would slide a bit 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is stronger than anyone expected. We don't expect it to  
be sustained, but we do expect sales to remain very strong,'' said 
economist Michael Carliner of the National Association of Home 
Builders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for all of 1998 should total around 880,000 but fall to  
around 802,000 this year, compared with 804,000 in 1997, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A variety of factors have combined to make 1998 such a strong  
year for housing. First, jobs are plentiful, with the unemployment 
rate this year averaging around 4.5 percent, a 28-year low. Second, 
mortgage rates have remained below 7 percent since June, a stretch 
unseen in 30 years. Third, the stock market, though tumultuous, has 
helped many buyers with down-payments for vacation and trade-up 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, stocks shot to a new record, as investors poured in  
cash from year-end bonuses and sales late last year. The Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks gained 234 points to close at 9,545, 
easily beating the old record of 9,374, set Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally in November, new home sales jumped 9.9 percent in the  
South to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 432,000. They rose 
5.4 percent in the West to a rate of 292,000, the highest in 19 
years; 20.5 percent to 88,000 in the Northeast; and 0.6 percent to 
172,000 in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The median price of a new home -- meaning half sold for more and  
half for less -- was $148,700 in November, up 2.6 percent from a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of homes for sale at the end of November totaled  
292,000 -- a 3.7 months supply at the current sales rate. That's a 
record low inventory.

<HEADLINE> Villeneuve Again Says Cars Too Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRACKLEY, England (AP) -- Jacques Villeneuve has changed teams --  
jumping to the new British American Racing -- but his complaint with 
Formula One remains the same: the cars are too slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old French Canadian, the '97 series champion at  
Williams before leaving without a win in '98, hit out Wednesday at 
a tire groove added for the '99 season to slow the cars -- a change 
mandated by the world governing body the FIA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't understand why we have an extra groove, but we're  
going to compensate for it,'' said Villeneuve, who angered the FIA 
last season when he criticized the introduction of grooved tires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure we'll wind up going the same speeds as last year, but  
last year wasn't fast enough,'' he added as BAR unveiled it new 
cars Wednesday. ``We get used to these speeds and it doesn't feel 
special. You're part of Formula One, that's great, but it's just 
not fast enough to make you feel you're doing something very 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the 1995 IndyCar title and the Indianapolis 500  
the same year, Villeneuve talked up Formula One's return to the 
famed Brickyard -- and the United States -- for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he was disappointed the race, the first Formula One  
race in the United States since 1991, could not be run exclusively 
on Indy's famed oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indy was very important and winning the 500 was very important  
for my career, so I'm very happy to be going back there,'' he said. 
``It's just a sad thing they are not going to be able to run the 
oval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you have an oval and build a track on the inside --  
like they're going to do -- it never feels real. It just feels like 
an artificial track.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Figure Welcomes Launch of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Describing the first days of trading in the  
new unified European currency as ``strikingly smooth,'' Michel 
Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary fund, 
welcomed the successful launch of the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is testament, indeed, to the vision, professionalism and  
dedication of all those involved at both the European Union and 
national levels,'' Camdessus said in a statement Wednesday. ``It 
has also been a model of cooperation and partnership between public 
and private sectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in the euro began on Monday. On Wednesday, the euro was  
worth about $1.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said the launch of the euro -- which combines the  
currencies of 11 European nations -- is a ``historic event for 
Europe and for the international monetary system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said if European Monetary Union is to achieve its full  
promise, then the participating nations must meet difficult 
challenges such as balancing their budgets. The nations are France, 
Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Finland, Ireland, Belgium, 
Austria, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said the euro can play ``a key role'' in broadening  
and deepening Europe's capital markets by offering new 
opportunities to ``savers and borrowers the world over.''

<HEADLINE> Satellite TV Battling Cable Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jeffrey Washington got really mad at his cable company when a  
technical glitch turned his television dark just before a holiday 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm going into a three-day weekend and I've got children at  
home that are 8 and 4 and I can't get Nickelodeon, I've got a 
problem,'' Washington said. ``We would call to find out what was 
happening and just get a recording.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, when Bell Atlantic began packaging  
satellite-based DirecTV with his local telephone service in 
Mitchellville, Md., Washington signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	He pays about the same price -- around $60 a month for basic  
service with premium channels -- and said he is happier with the 
service and gets a sharper picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite companies have been hobbled by a federal law designed  
to protect broadcasters that bars them from offering local stations 
via satellite. That has convinced many potential customers to stick 
with cable. 
</P>
<P>
	But they have found a low-tech solution by joining forces with  
local phone companies, a move that the satellite companies hope 
will snare more customers like Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We provide a local signal solution,'' said Richard Beville,  
president of Bell Atlantic Video, the subsidiary that is executing 
Bell Atlantic's foray into television service. ``We're the home 
team in all these markets we serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies are responding to the new threat by upgrading  
their systems with technology that will allow sharper pictures, 
more channels and additional services like telephone and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the new strategies will give satellite companies such as  
DirecTV a bigger chunk of cable's customer base remains to be seen. 
What is clear is that the approach has infused the industry with 
new energy and optimism about the future of direct broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see it as a very big deal in terms of it driving  
subscribers, building the subscriber base and getting the 
word-of-mouth out there in terms of what satellite TV can do,'' 
said Jimmy Schaeffler, chairman of the Carmel Group, a market 
analysis company that monitors the direct broadcast industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable now has 67.4 percent of the nation's TV market, a share  
that's worth $33.8 billion, according to the National Cable 
Television Association. Direct broadcasters claim about 10 percent 
of the market share. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months Hughes Electronic Corp.'s DirecTV and U.S.  
Satellite Broadcasting each have entered into marketing agreements 
with big local telephone providers including Bell Atlantic, 
Southwestern Bell and GTE. The deals are expected to give the 
satellite companies a broader marketing reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone companies have been offering the service on a limited  
basis for several months and plan to expand this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Those subscribing to the new service get a pizza-size satellite  
dish on their roof, and they also get a small antenna that pulls in 
local channels. In some cases, depending on the location of the 
home, the antenna can be mounted in the attic, or integrated as 
part of the satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
	By picking the right antenna for local conditions, the phone  
companies say they can match or exceed the picture quality of cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent acquisitions might also make satellite companies more  
appealing to American viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, DirecTV announced it would buy U.S. Satellite for  
$1.3 billion in a deal that will allow DirecTV to offer subscribers 
more than 100 channels, far more than the number now available 
through cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitor EchoStar Communications, operator of the Dish  
Network, plans to buy the last U.S. satellite license from MCI 
Worldcom and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp in a $1.25 billion deal 
that also includes two satellites under construction. The sale 
gives Denver-based EchoStar the potential to offer up to 500 
channels and Internet access to its customers. EchoStar and the 
other big player in the industry, Primestar Inc., each have around 
2 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	To entice customers, companies also are offering sharp discounts  
on the cost of dish installation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies are countering with upgraded service and  
determination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will win,'' said Bill Rosendahl, senior vice president of  
operations at Century Communications of Southern California, a 
subsidiary of Connecticut-based Century Communications Inc., which 
provides cable to about 1.3 million households nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosendahl said upgrades that will provide high-definition TV and  
a greater number of channels, combined with solid customer service, 
can ensure cable's continued dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The uniqueness of cable is the pipe to the home,'' Rosendahl  
said. ``This broadband pipe will do more than a satellite option 
does. First of all, it will provide a cable modem. Second, it will 
give two-way capability and interactivity. This opens up a whole 
new world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will the upgrades be enough to overcome customer relations  
problems? 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of consumers really have an animosity toward cable, and  
a lot of it is an earned animosity,'' said Schaeffler, of the 
Carmel group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cable has been an entrenched, arrogant monopoly for 20 to 30  
years, and they have done what monopolies usually do, they have 
raised rates and provided poor service and just in general 
disregarded the leveling effect of competition, so now it's coming 
back to bite them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satisfaction with direct broadcast systems is high among users.  
In a survey of satellite subscribers conducted by the Boston-based 
Yankee Group, 90 percent rated features overall as excellent or 
good. Eighty-four percent said they would recommend it to a friend, 
said Bruce Leichtman, the Yankee Group's director of media and 
entertainment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Group's data suggests, however, that satellite companies  
have yet to make a compelling case to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second survey, consumers who don't get direct broadcast  
were asked why they hadn't signed up. Forty-one percent of the 
2,000 respondents said simply that they saw no need for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at satellite companies are hoping those attitudes  
will change as their new marketing plans swing into full gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an evolutionary type of process,'' said Larry  
Chapman, executive vice president of DirecTV. ``I think we are 
getting more and more successful in explaining to customers the 
options they have.''

<HEADLINE> Be-Bop Song Urges Humanities Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the National Endowment for the  
Humanities illustrated the scope of his federal agency Wednesday by 
belting out Gene Vincent's ``Be-Bop-A-Lula'' to his own guitar 
accompaniment in an appeal for private help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of requests about my singing today, but I'm  
going to sing anyway,'' quipped NEH Chairman William R. Ferris. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferris, a former anthropology professor at Yale and the  
University of Mississippi, got an ovation from the Washington 
Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like so much of American culture,'' he explained, ``we're a  
merging of different traditions in the South: rich music of Africa 
and Europe. The blues and country music came together in the '50s 
to shape a new and different sound called rock 'n' roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent, one of the pioneers of rock 'n' roll, died in 1971.  
</P>
<P>
	Ferris said time in Ireland sparked his interest in folklore and  
the untold stories of the American South. One story of his own 
involved Ray Lum, a Mississippi horse trader whom he brought to 
Yale and who auctioned off an old horse on the campus green. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me tell you, that raised a few Ivy League eyebrows,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferris called on the private clubs to help state councils for  
the humanities with media and technology projects, teacher-training 
workshops, newsletters and Web sites. In return, the agency could 
supply the club with interesting lunch speakers, he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Biographies Planned on First Lady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pulitzer Prize-winner Carl Bernstein and  
best-selling author Gail Sheehy -- two writers with a talent for 
digging deep -- are working on competing biographies of Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The books are expected to examine Mrs. Clinton's turbulent  
marriage before and during the White House years as well as her 
political partnership with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein, whose stories in The Washington Post with Bob  
Woodward helped bring down President Nixon, has signed a deal with 
Alfred A. Knopf. He would not reveal the terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sheehy, author of nine books, including the best seller  
``Passages,'' is expected to announce a deal by next week, said her 
agent, Lynn Nesbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect Mrs. Clinton to cooperate.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she will do any interviews. At some point there  
is speculation about whether she will write a book, and frankly, 
she would be the best source for her book,'' said Mrs. Clinton's 
spokeswoman, Marsha Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sheehy's book is due out in a year at most, Nesbit said.  
Bernstein said he has just started the research and told the Daily 
News he is waiting until two years after the president leave 
offices to finish it. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday,  
Bernstein would not speculate on a publication date or give hints 
of the book's contents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I would do is talk about what's going to be in  
a book that I haven't even written,'' he said. Earlier, in a 
statement, he said, ``Hers is a great story, both before and during 
the White House years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sheehy got a jump on Bernstein with her 15,000-word article  
exploring the Clintons' marriage in Vanity Fair's February issue, 
which hit newsstands Wednesday. Ms. Sheehy and Bernstein are 
contributing writers at Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The article gives a glimpse of the upcoming book, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Relying on interviews with family, friends, associates, aides  
and lawyers and previous interviews with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Sheehy 
characterized the first lady as a woman with two identities: a 
moral Methodist and a radical feminist. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of which, Sheehy writes in the article, have influenced  
Mrs. Clinton's marriage and public life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her life strategy, decided long ago, was to take the raw  
material of a brilliant, emotionally battered child with a good 
heart and a desperate ambition and shape him into a political 
star.... It took a Hillary to raise a president,'' Sheehy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Clintons moved to the White House, Sheehy wrote,  
``Hillary believed that, at last, Bill would be more or less 
exclusively hers. If not because of a change of heart, then because 
of diminished opportunity. She told friends they had grown closer 
than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When allegations of sexual improprieties arose, Mrs. Clinton  
presumably ``learned not only to rationalize, but even to 
capitalize on her husband's weaknesses,'' the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sheehy also speculated in her article that the president  
would fight hard to keep his marriage, quoting Betsy Wright, who 
was Clinton's chief of staff while he was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``That man would lie down and kill himself before he would let  
her leave,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that Mrs. Clinton might run for  
elective office -- perhaps the Senate -- in either New York or 
Illinois after her husband leaves the White House. But Ms. Sheehy 
said she doubts it. 
</P>
<P>
	``She doesn't want to be in Washington,'' Ms. Sheehy said.  
``It's been a horrible place for her, and she doesn't like to 
answer questions.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Leads Grains, Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices settled higher  
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose on news that the U.S. Agriculture Department  
is increasing wheat purchases for its donor program by one million 
metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	When the program was announced last year, the USDA committed to  
purchasing 2.5 million metric tons of wheat. In October, the 
government agency made a 1.5 million metric ton wheat donation to 
Russia. With Tuesday's announcement, the program's total now stands 
at five million metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical factors also helped push wheat futures higher, as buy  
orders were triggered when prices reached $2.83 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength of wheat gave a boost to corn futures prices. The  
corn rally also was technical in nature as funds that sold their 
positions as the market declined in recent trading sessions entered 
the market to cover their losses. Also giving corn futures a boost 
were beliefs the cold weather in the Midwest will prompt increased 
demand for feed grains from cattle ranchers and hog producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were higher because of continued dryness  
in South America. Rain has not fallen for days in the soybean crop 
areas of southern Brazil and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery was 7 1/4 cents higher at $2.87 1/2 a bushel;  
March corn was 6 1/2 cents higher at $2.23 3/4 a bushel; March oats were 
3 1/2 cents higher at $1.12 1/4 a bushel; January soybeans were 4 1/4 cents 
higher at $5.53 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and pork futures prices settled higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather continues to be a concern of the market, with the cold  
and snow in parts of the Plains states and the Midwest expected to 
adversely affect the growth of hogs and cattle. Higher cash prices 
also contributed to rise in pork belly and hog futures prices, both 
up the daily limit. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were 1.50 cents higher at 62.17 cents a  
pound; January feeder cattle were 1.50 cents higher at 71.67 cents 
a pound; February lean hogs were 2 cents higher at 34.72 cents a 
pound; February pork bellies were 3 cents higher at 47.05 cents a 
pound.

<HEADLINE> Kosir Wins Slalom in Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KRANJSKA GORA, Slovenia (AP) -- After fulfilling a dream by  
winning in front of his hometown crowd, Slovenian Jure Kosir is 
confident he can do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	He might get that chance today, when the men's World Cup circuit  
moves to Schladming, Austria, for a night slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to seize the moment because I think I am quite  
hot now,'' Kosir said Wednesday after prevailing in a slalom race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Slovenian easily won, finishing nearly a half-second ahead  
of Austrian Thomas Stangassinger in the first run, then maintaining 
his position in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosir, who has a history of fading after leading in the first  
run, said he knew he was strong mentally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had bad luck the other times,'' he explained.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory was a dream-come-true for Kosir, who lives just a  
few miles from Kranjska Gora and trained with the local club. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a kid I always imagined coming through the finish line and  
seeing big crowds, exactly like today,'' Kosir said. ``It is a 
dream come true. It is a beautiful feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosir completed the two-run slalom in 1 minute, 37.22 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Stangassinger, who leads the World Cup slalom standings, was  
second in 1:37.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Stangassinger, who at 33 is the oldest man on the circuit, also  
finished second in the latest slalom contested in Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 Olympic slalom champion, Stangassinger is a big  
favorite today. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian rookie Benjamin Raich, 20, was third Wednesday,  
finishing on the podium for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Austrian in his first year on the circuit, Rainer  
Schoenfelder, 21, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich, five-time winner of the World Junior Championships, said  
his ``secret dream'' was to qualify for the upcoming World 
Championship in Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no special secret behind the young Austrian's  
success,'' Stangassinger said. ``The young skiers train extra hard 
because they want to make the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norwegian veteran Finn Christian Jagge, the 1992 Olympic slalom  
champion, was fifth. The Norwegian, second in the slalom standings, 
is another favorite today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosir's only previous career victory came in December 1993, in a  
slalom at Madonna di Campiglio, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 26-year-old skier has been consistently among the top  
racers this season. He was third in the Sestriere slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Cries of joy went up from the approximately 10,000 spectators  
when Kosir crossed the finish line victorious. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Thomas Sykora, a comeback, re-injured his left knee and  
is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian powerhouse Hermann Maier, who does not race slalom,  
maintained a 59-point lead over Norwegian Lasse Kjus in the overall 
World Cup standings.

<HEADLINE> NBA To Reimburse NBC and Turner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC and Turner Sports invested millions of  
dollars in a new TV deal with the NBA after last season. Their 
payoff is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Both had to settle for substitute programming in place of NBA  
games. However, NBC will be fully compensated for its nine missed 
telecasts. The league will also pay back Turner for the 50 or so 
games it didn't carry due to the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC signed a four-year, $1.75 billion deal and is expected to  
receive its money back for the missed telecasts during the next 
three years. The network also canceled the Feb. 14 All-Star game 
and will almost certainly replace that slot with a regular-season 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner paid $178 million a year for four seasons. It will try to  
insert about 20 games into the remainder of this season's schedule 
and will work out a deal with the league to be compensated for the 
other 30 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net took the biggest hit during the lockout. With  
rights to 26 of the 29 NBA teams, it has replaced pro basketball 
games with regional classics and other low-rated programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We produce more NBA games than anyone else,'' said Arthur  
Smith, Fox Sports Net executive vice president for programming and 
production. ``Our substitute programming did well, but not as well 
as our NBA games. It's fair to say we lost the most until now, but 
nobody benefits more than us from here on in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the season expected to begin the first week of February,  
the first NBC telecast should be a triple-header on Feb. 7, and the 
Bulls at the Lakers could be one of those games. 
</P>
<P>
	An entirely new schedule will be put in place for the 50-game  
season that is expected to be played, so that matchup may not take 
place on that date. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox lost more than 500 games through the end of January,  
although the network would not estimate its financial loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fox regional lost a lot of games,'' said Neal Pilson, the  
former president of CBS who runs a consulting firm. ``NBC won't be 
damaged significantly because the bulk of their season is coming 
up. The postseason is always when they draw their best ratings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings, and advertising dollars, might also depend on the  
status of Michael Jordan. Network executives are hoping Jordan 
doesn't call it a career just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lockout probably won't have any effect on the ratings  
until the postseason,'' said Steve Grubbs of BBDO Worldwide 
Advertising. ``Michael Jordan's return may have a bigger impact 
than anything, but in terms of advertising, we've been walking away 
from the NBA because we feel they've lost touch with the 
consumers.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Lays Out Case Vs. Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Sen. Robert Torricelli told the National  
Gambling Impact Study Commission that Atlantic City is an 
``extraordinary success story,'' one panel member said he ``found 
it difficult not to gag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a status report to his supporters, James C. Dobson --  
president of Colorado-based Focus on the Family and the most 
outspoken gambling opponent on the federal commission -- said 
gambling actually ``ruins lives and wrecks families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobson's statement marks his most detailed comments on gambling  
since the study commission began work 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It also suggests the difficulty the commission may have in  
finding common ground for its final report, due in June. The 
nine-member commission spans viewpoints from those of Dobson to 
those of J. Terrence Lanni, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Las Vegas-based MGM Grand, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In the January edition of a monthly newsletter mailed to 2.4  
million people, Dobson said he has already ``seen more than I 
wanted to know about the seamier side of this industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, 'gambling fever' has engulfed the nation and has  
penetrated every age group from the very young to the very old,'' 
Dobson wrote. ``It now threatens the work ethic and the very 
foundation of the family. ... Most Americans now think of gambling 
not as a vice or unsavory habit, but as harmless entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobson visited Atlantic City last January along with the rest of  
the commission. He complained at the time that the witness list was 
skewed in favor of the gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the witnesses, Torricelli, D-N.J., told the commission  
that casino gambling has been ``an extraordinary success story'' in 
Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobson painted a more dismal picture of the city, saying parts  
of it resembles ``a bombed-out war zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli said Wednesday that he stands by his position that  
gambling saved Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming  
Association, said Dobson's letter to constituents ``makes it 
perfectly clear that he never had any intention of taking a fair 
and unbiased look at gaming.''

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist To Swear In Senate Jurors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist will wear  
his distinctive robe and use a Bible provided by the Senate when he 
swears in 100 senators as jurors Thursday at the start of President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist is the first modern-day Supreme Court member to depart  
from tradition and wear something other than a plain black robe. 
His features four gold stripes on each sleeve, a flourish inspired 
by a costume in a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Court sources said they assumed Rehnquist would administer the  
same oath used for several recent Senate impeachment trials of 
federal judges, one contained in a 1986 version of Senate rules for 
such proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, the oath would state: ``I solemnly swear (or affirm, as  
the case may be) that in all things pertaining to the trial of the 
impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, now pending, that I will 
do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So 
help me God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist will be accompanied to the Senate by James Duff, his  
administrative aide, and by one of the chief justice's three law 
clerks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate schedule for the trial beyond that is not yet known,  
but it is possible the proceeding could create a time conflict for 
Rehnquist. The Supreme Court will be in session next week to hear 
arguments in pending cases Monday through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If a conflict arises, Rehnquist is expected to miss the argument  
session and catch up later by reading a transcript or listening to 
an audio tape. 
</P>
<P>
	When he underwent back surgery during the court's 1995-96 term,  
Rehnquist missed sitting in on six arguments but participated in 
deciding all six. That has been a routine practice at the nation's 
highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rehnquist were to miss any court session, senior Justice John  
Paul Stevens would preside.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Cocaine Farming Down in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coca farming is down dramatically in the two  
South American countries that traditionally supply most of the drug 
crop, but that success is offset by increases in Colombia, U.S. 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca plants must be chemically processed to become the powdered  
or crystallized cocaine, typically sold in the United States. For 
years, Peru has been the leading supplier of coca plants, followed 
by Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	But both Peru and Bolivia have reduced the amount of farmland  
devoted to coca plants as farmers abandon Andean coca farms in 
favor of legal crops and U.S.-backed eradication efforts enjoy 
success, White House drug policy coordinator Barry McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely astonishing,'' McCaffrey said at a news  
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca grew on about half as much Peruvian land in 1998 as it did  
in 1996. And with fewer plants, the amount of cocaine Peruvian 
plants could produce fell by 48 percent to 240 metric tons between 
1995 and 1998, CIA analysts concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolivia eradicated a record 28,660 acres of coca fields last  
year, or almost a quarter of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighboring Colombia has traditionally been the seat of cocaine  
manufacturing, with less emphasis on farming the raw material coca. 
</P>
<P>
	As production declined in Peru and Bolivia and kept coca from  
Colombian processing outfits, Colombian coca farming increased 56 
percent in 1996 and 1997, CIA analysis of satellite photos and 
other data show. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA is still analyzing Colombian data for 1998, but  
officials said they expect to see further increases in coca farming 
there. So far, increases in Colombian production have not filled 
the gap created by decreased production in Peru and Bolivia, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey would not comment in detail about Colombia, pending  
final analysis of the data. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, coca production in Colombia is skyrocketing,''  
McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey credited enlightened self-interest in Peru and Bolivia  
for reducing the coca crop, much of which ends up in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers see the advantage of getting law enforcement off their  
backs, and they like financial incentives offered by U.S.-backed 
anti-drug programs, McCaffrey said. The governments of both 
countries have worked hard to reduce economic dependence on drugs 
because they, too, see the long-term benefits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe it serves their own national interests,''  
McCaffrey said. ``The U.S. has played a modest supporting role.''

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA lockout finally came to an end Wednesday  
on its 191st day, a nasty and divisive struggle that cost the 
owners and players hundreds of millions of dollars and scarred a 
league at the pinnacle of its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody lost. We lost three months of the season and we did  
a disservice to the game, so there are no winners and losers,'' 
Charles Barkley said. ``There's going to be a lot of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The season will begin the first week of February, with teams  
playing about 50 games each, some 30 fewer than a regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached just 29 hours before the NBA Board of  
Governors was to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. It 
came just before dawn, following an all-night bargaining session at 
NBA headquarters between commissioner David Stern and union 
director Billy Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side made significant compromises to close the deal, but  
the owners clearly walked away with a much better agreement than 
the old one. The players, for their part, came away with their 
dignity intact and with more money for the non-superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say that I am elated that we will be playing basketball  
this season,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, the deal was ratified by players in a 179-5 vote  
after being approved by both negotiating committees. It gives 
owners the unprecedented concession of a maximum limit on 
individual salaries and will be in place for six years, with owners 
having an option for a seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable,'' Milwaukee Bucks coach  
George Karl said. ``It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach. 
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I 
love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Governors will vote on the agreement Thursday, and  
the league said it would not comment until then. The lockout will 
not officially be lifted until terms of the agreement are formally 
drawn up -- a process that could take 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, however, spoke to the almost 200 players who had flown in  
to vote on the owners' latest proposal -- a vote that never came. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us Billy was a tough guy, but a good guy, and how glad  
he was to get it over with and to start playing again,'' Aaron 
Williams of the Seattle SuperSonics said. 
</P>
<P>
	And now Michael Jordan must decide whether he will retire or  
return to the Chicago Bulls for a shot at a seventh championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said. 
``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows  
any player to re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous 
salary. That means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, 
could get about $34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can offer him more than $14 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of about $2 billion in  
annual revenue in the fourth, fifth and sixth years of the 
agreement, according to several sources involved in the talks who 
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Players would get 57 percent if the league exercises its option  
for the seventh year. In the first three years, there is no limit 
on the percentage of revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the agreement includes a ban on marijuana, with all  
players undergoing drug testing once per season, and tougher player 
discipline penalties and conduct rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides also agreed to form a joint committee of three owners  
and three players to discuss the growth of the league and improving 
the relations between players and management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to five years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, but not quite as high as the union had been demanding. 
</P>
<P>
	No professional sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary  
before, but the NBA had been pushing for one throughout the 
lockout. The union initially refused, then suggested a luxury tax 
be charged to any owner who signed a player for more than $15 
million. The league kept holding out, and eventually the players 
relented. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys can still make $14 million, and that's a lot of money,''  
said Kevin Willis of the Toronto Raptors. ``If you can't live off 
that, something's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is finalized and the lockout is lifted, it will  
unleash a three-week frenzy of teams scrambling to fill rosters, 
make trades and sign some of the 200 free agents while running 
abbreviated training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have eight months of NBA basketball squeezed  
into four months, with trades and signings,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman,  
Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, Rod Strickland and Damon 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be very busy,'' agent Mark Bartelstein said. ``We've  
got a lot of free agents, so we've got to find them homes and 
teams. Get other guys into camps. I'm sure I'll probably talk to a 
lot of teams today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide  
the estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement was reached as players arrived in New York to vote on  
the owners' previous offer, and it took everyone by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a call at 6 a.m. in my hotel room this morning and I  
couldn't believe it,'' free agent center Joe Kleine said. ``We will 
finally play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout went into effect July 1, just 2 1/2 weeks after Jordan  
and the Bulls won their sixth championship in a riveting Game 6 
that put up the largest TV viewer numbers ever for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1980s and especially since Jordan arrived, the league  
has enjoyed unprecedented popularity here and abroad. On the labor 
front, Stern and the NBA lived a relatively charmed life while 
baseball struggled through a strike that caused thousands of fans 
to turn away from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But then came the lockout, that for the first time caused the  
NBA to miss games because of a labor dispute. The first three 
months of the season were scrapped and players lost about $500 
million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	An entirely new schedule will be put in place for the remainder  
of the 1998-99 season, although details were still unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Cal. Gov. Vows To Clean Up Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Newly elected Gov. Gray Davis has  
proposed a litany of get-tough initiatives that will demand more 
from students, teachers and parents in a drive to improve the 
state's 8,000 public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's first State of the State speech by a Democratic  
governor in 16 years, Davis announced Wednesday that he'll revamp 
or close chronically ailing schools, and called for a special 
session of the Legislature to tackle education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we do together in the coming months is more important  
to the people of California and to me,'' Davis told lawmakers in 
the nation's most populous state, which has approximately 5 million 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one gets a free ride,'' he said. ``Students will be tested.  
Teachers will be reviewed. Principals will be held to account. And 
parents will be urged to take greater responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he will urge school districts to require parents to  
sign a contract promising to read to their children and assist with 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 200 under-performing schools will be given extra  
state money each year. If they shape up within two years, they can 
get additional cash bonuses. Schools that don't improve could be 
closed, their principals dismissed and teachers reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``When an NFL coach has one losing season after another, he gets  
replaced. Period. End of the story. I say we should be just as 
decisive when our children's future is at stake,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``extraordinary session'' of the Legislature that Davis  
wants to begin on Jan. 19 is largely symbolic, but will focus 
attention on education reform and could accelerate any bills 
introduced there. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also promised to ease traffic, provide more money to  
cities to hire police officers, open a new home for older war 
veterans, control suburban sprawl, more vigorously regulate health 
maintenance organizations, restore coastal wetlands and clean up 
Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ideas were good. We like them. They're Republican ideas.  
We hope the Democratic Legislature will move forward,'' said 
Republican Rod Pacheco, Assembly minority leader.

<HEADLINE> Bjorkman Slams Korda, Tennis Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Swedish player Jonas Bjorkman called for  
Petr Korda to be banned and says the International Tennis 
Federation is scared of confronting the drug issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda had his ranking points and prize money stripped after  
testing positive for the banned steroid Nandrolone at Wimbledon 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF accepted Korda's argument that he took the drug  
inadvertently, but Bjorkman on Wednesday called the ITF decision 
``totally the worst that could happen for tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bjorkman said he believed the world's leading players should  
pressure the ITF and men's ATP tour to ban Korda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard so many things that guys are positive and they  
just cover it -- they are just so scared of putting it out,'' 
Bjorkman said. ``If you cheat, you should be suspended for two, 
three, four, five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is steroids and you take them or not. There is no one  
that is just going to put them into you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda beat Marcelo Rios to win last year's Australian Open, his  
first Grand Slam title, and reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon 
but was later stripped of 199 rankings points and $94,529 in prize 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is sick,'' Bjorkman said. ``It is a sick decision  
to just make him pay back the money and lose the points. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played his best tennis all the way up to Wimbledon and then  
he was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Swede became the second player this week to challenge the  
ITF's handling of the Korda case. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek also urged  
his fellow players to seek an explanation from the ITF about why 
Korda was not banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda has raised some doubts about whether he will play this  
year's Australian Open. Bjorkman called it a ploy to generate 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is trying to get people to feel bad for him. I think this  
is the worst he can do,'' Bjorkman said. ``It is better to be 
honest and say that, `Yes, I am sorry I did that' and then that is 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Kentucky's Couch Opts for Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The day dreaded by Kentucky football fans  
has arrived, with star quarterback Tim Couch ready to announce he 
will skip his senior year to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely coming out'' in the NFL draft, a source told  
The Associated Press on Wednesday, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who scheduled a news conference to announce his plans,  
set national high school passing records in his home town of Hyden 
and is revered in Kentucky for spurning scholarship offers from 
Florida, Tennessee and Penn State to attend his home state 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	He and coach Hal Mumme are given credit for the turnaround that  
took Kentucky from a Southeastern Conference doormat to a New 
Year's Day bowl team in just two years. Kentucky's appearance in 
last Friday's Outback Bowl was the school's first bowl in five 
years and its first Jan. 1 game in 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Kentucky rewarded Mumme for his work with a $4  
million, five-year contract. Now, Couch is poised to make millions 
of dollars as a potential No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Cleveland Browns hold the first pick, and team  
president Carmen Policy has said he would take a ``franchise 
quarterback'' with the pick if one is available. Many scouts 
believe Couch -- with his 6-foot-5, 225-pound size, accuracy, touch 
and experience in Kentucky's pro-style passing offense -- fits that 
description. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday is the deadline for underclassmen to declare for April's  
draft, and Couch was just one of several top players set to leave 
school early. Also declaring for the draft Wednesday were this 
season's Outland Trophy winner, UCLA tackle Kris Farris, West 
Virginia tailback Amos Zereoue and Ohio State wide receiver David 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Shaun Alexander, Alabama's leading rusher,  
announced that he would pass on the draft and remain in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch struggled as a freshman at Kentucky in then-coach Bill  
Curry's conservative offense, then blossomed under Mumme and his 
``Air Raid'' offense, throwing for 73 touchdowns and more than 
8,500 yards the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he threw for 4,275 yards and 36 touchdowns, leading the  
Wildcats (7-5) to their first seven-win season since 1984. He 
finished fourth in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch insisted during the season that he had not yet made up his  
mind whether to go to the NFL or return to Lexington for his senior 
year. In his most recent meeting with reporters, following 
Kentucky's 26-14 Outback Bowl loss, Couch said he was ``50-50'' on 
whether to turn pro or stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Farris, the UCLA standout honored as the nation's top interior  
lineman, said he took about six months to decide to leave early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident this is the best decision for me at this  
time,'' Farris, a 6-foot-9, 315-pound junior, said. ``The Outland 
Trophy really helped my decision, I'm not going to lie about it. 
Injury wasn't really a big concern. I just felt like this was the 
best time to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farris said a significant factor in his decision was the fact  
that since he sat out his freshman year, many players in his class, 
including quarterback Cade McNown, have completed their 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``These have been the best years of my life,'' Farris said. ``I  
don't feel like I belong here anymore. It's time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue said he decided to declare after consulting with his  
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given this decision a great deal of thought,'' he said in  
a statement released by the school. ``After a lot of research and 
consideration, I finalized my decision over the holidays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue is West Virginia's career rushing leader with 4,086  
yards and the Big East's top career rusher with 3,907 yards, not 
including bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be pulling for him on the next level,'' coach Don  
Nehlen said. ``Amos is a great back and he's done a great job for 
us over the past three years. We won't forget him. All we have to 
do is open our record book and Amos is everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue followed up a 1,505-yard season a year ago with 1,430  
yards and 13 touchdowns in his junior season, sixth best in 
Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, a second-team All-American who holds most Ohio State  
receiving records, will create an interesting problem in the pros. 
His father, Byron Boston, is a line judge in his fourth year in the 
league. It will be the first time that the NFL has had to 
reschedule games to prevent an official from working games 
involving his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just ready for a new challenge,'' Boston said. ``I've  
accomplished a lot here at Ohio State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through his three seasons, Boston set Ohio State records for  
receptions in a game (14), season (85) and career (191), receiving 
yards in a season (1,435) and career (2,855) and touchdown catches 
in a career (34). 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough decision,'' he said. ``I had to do a lot  
of thinking this past week. It was a rough week for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he was staying in school because he was enjoying  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I wanted to do is be happy wherever I am,'' he  
said. ``If I go to the NFL, I've got to be a grownup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he talked with both Cincinnati and Cleveland, and  
was told he would go ``very high'' in the draft if he came out 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, Alexander decided, ``I want to have fun.''

	Dow Soars 233.78 to Record Close  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher today, smashing major index  
records, as investors staged the third day of a huge New Years 
buying spree. The Dow Jones industrial average easily crossed the 
9,400 and 9,500 thresholds for the first time. The Dow Jones 
industrial average rose 233.78 to close at 9,544.97, shooting by 
the previous high of 9,374.27 set Nov. 23. NYSE advancers led 
decliners 2,014-1,091. The Nasdaq composite index was up 69.35 at 
2,320.62.

	NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just hours before the NBA was poised to scrap  
the season, the league and the players' union reached an agreement 
today to end the 6-month-old lockout. The players approved it 179-5 
in a ratification vote at the union's law office this afternoon, a 
union spokesman said. A season of about 50 games would begin the 
first week of February, with training camps not starting before 
Jan. 17.

	Congress Opens With New Speaker  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 106th Congress opened today with the House  
choosing Rep. Dennis Hastert as its new speaker. The Illinois 
Republican promised a more bipartisan spirit. ``Solutions to 
problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness,'' Hastert said in 
his first speech as speaker, which he delivered from the well of 
the chamber rather than the speaker's chair in a gesture toward 
breaking down barriers between the leadership and the rank-and-file 
membership.

	Lott Planning Clinton Trial Outline  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said today  
he hoped to announce a framework for President Clinton's 
impeachment trial within 24 hours. He cautioned the historic 
proceeding could stretch three weeks or more. Democrats vowed 
``universal, unanimous'' opposition to calling witnesses. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Projects $76B Surplus  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government will have a $76 billion  
surplus this year, its second straight year in the black, President 
Clinton said today. He asked Congress to consider devoting the 
money to Social Security and ``a lot of other challenges'' rather 
than a tax cut. But some lawmakers called for using the money to do 
both, saying it was Clinton, not Congress, who spent chunks of last 
year's $67 billion surplus without addressing Social Security.

	Ex-Khmer Rouge General Warns of War  
</P>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A Khmer Rouge general who made peace  
with the government last month warned today that Cambodia could 
return to civil war if senior leaders of the bloodstained 
revolutionary movement are arrested. Khem Ngun's warning was the 
strongest yet that the fragile peace Cambodia has achieved after 20 
years of war might evaporate with any attempt to prosecute Khmer 
Rouge leaders who seized power in 1975 and caused the deaths of as 
many as 2 million people.

	Pope Consecrates Nine Bishops  
</P>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II elevated nine men to  
bishop's rank today in an elaborate Epiphany service. The pontiff 
asked some of them to carry the church's mission to countries where 
it is met with mistrust or even violence. The consecration took 
place in St. Peter's Basilica, where the nine men prostrated 
themselves on a red carpet before the canopied altar. The new 
bishops include the Rev. Cesare Mazzolari, bound for Sudan.

	Prince Edward To Wed  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Five years after he began dating public relations  
executive Sophie Rhys-Jones, Prince Edward has proposed. Her reply 
-- ``Yes, yes please,'' -- delighted Queen Elizabeth II and launched 
another national bout of royal wedding fever. As messages of 
congratulations poured in today, Ms. Rhys-Jones, 33, posed for 
press photographs with her 34-year-old fiance, flashing an 
engagement ring featuring a 2-carat diamond flanked by two smaller, 
heart-shaped ones.

	Reggie White Gets AP Defensive Award  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reggie White today was selected The Associated  
Press NFL Defensive Player of the Year. White, who planned to 
retire a year ago, came back to the Green Bay Packers for one last 
season and led the NFC with 16 sacks. The 37-year-old defensive end 
is the career sacks leader with 192 1/2. White easily won the award in 
balloting by a nationwide panel of 47 sports writers and 
broadcasters. He received 20 votes, far ahead of Minnesota tackle 
John Randle's six.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Attack Sierra Leone Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rampaging rebel fighters shot  
their way into the heart of Sierra Leone's capital today, capturing 
a main government office building and burning down the city's 
police station while terrified residents huddled indoors, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who -- if anyone -- controlled Freetown, though  
rebels could be seen in the State House and the rubble of the 
police station and were moving through the empty streets, according 
to witnesses contacted by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Leonean soldiers and forces of the Nigerian-led  
intervention force that has been fighting the rebels were nowhere 
to be seen, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition their names 
not be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing control of Freetown's city center would be a major blow  
to the intervention force, which was hailed as liberators earlier 
last year when its forces moved into the city to depose the ruling 
junta and restore the elected government to power. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun battles and artillery volleys rang out through abandoned  
streets in the West African nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how many rebels had infiltrated the city, though  
they were believed to number at least a few hundred. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses said the rebels had captured the State House -- an  
important government office building and the symbolic seat of 
government -- and burned down the Nigerian embassy and the main 
police headquarters. The police special branch headquarters -- the 
state's secret service -- was also burned down. 
</P>
<P>
	One unconfirmed report said prisoners, including scores of  
rebels, had been freed from the city's main prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinforcements and additional supplies were being dispatched to  
Freetown from Nigeria, a Nigerian military official said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the government had claimed to remain in control of the  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is still in control,'' Information Minister  
Julius Spencer said on state radio. ``There is no cause for 
alarm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State radio, which hours earlier had been warning people off the  
streets, was broadcasting only music for much of the morning. 
However, it later aired Information Minister Julius Spencer's 
comments in a bid to calm city residents. He said that the 
intervention force, known as ECOMOG, would beat back the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	``ECOMOG will deal with the rebels decisively,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He explained that an unspecified number of rebels, hidden among  
crowds of refugees, had moved into Freetown from the southern 
outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer earlier warned people to stay indoors, indicating that a  
dusk-to-dawn curfew had been extended to stay in effect around 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody found in the street from now on will be considered to  
be a rebel and shot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, thousands of people fled to the center of  
Freetown after a two-hour barrage on the outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The civilians, fleeing on foot and in vehicles, retreated after  
the onset of firing from an industrial area about six miles from 
Freetown. 
</P>
<P>
	Government soldiers and ECOMOG troops are battling the rebel  
Revolutionary United Front, which has fought a long-running war in 
Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel force, which has been accused of widespread  
atrocities, including the murder and torture of countless 
villagers, launched a renewed offensive in December. It has swept 
through several towns in the east and north of the country since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nigerian-led ECOMOG task force has managed to thwart until  
now threatened attacks on Freetown. 
</P>
<P>
	The first attacks, which began just after 1:30 a.m. local time,  
lasted about two hours and then subsided, only to begin again 
inside the city center. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was deposed in a coup in May 1997  
by a military junta allied with the rebels. Soldiers from the 
intervention force restored him to power 10 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the insurgents have been rebuilding, strengthened by  
defections from Sierra Leone's military and mercenaries from 
Liberia.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA lockout finally came to an end Wednesday  
on its 191st day, a nasty and divisive struggle that cost the 
owners and players hundreds of millions of dollars and scarred a 
league at the pinnacle of its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody lost. We lost three months of the season and we did  
a disservice to the game, so there are no winners and losers,'' 
Charles Barkley said. ``There's going to be a lot of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The season will begin the first week of February, with teams  
playing about 50 games each, some 30 fewer than a regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached just 29 hours before the NBA Board of  
Governors was to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. It 
came just before dawn, following an all-night bargaining session at 
NBA headquarters between commissioner David Stern and union 
director Billy Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side made significant compromises to close the deal, but  
the owners clearly walked away with a much better agreement than 
the old one. The players, for their part, came away with their 
dignity intact and with more money for the non-superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say that I am elated that we will be playing basketball  
this season,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, the deal was ratified by players in a 179-5 vote  
after being approved by both negotiating committees. It gives 
owners the unprecedented concession of a maximum limit on 
individual salaries and will be in place for six years, with owners 
having an option for a seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable,'' Milwaukee Bucks coach  
George Karl said. ``It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach. 
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I 
love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Governors will vote on the agreement Thursday, and  
the league said it would not comment until then. The lockout will 
not officially be lifted until terms of the agreement are formally 
drawn up -- a process that could take 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, however, spoke to the almost 200 players who had flown in  
to vote on the owners' latest proposal -- a vote that never came. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us Billy was a tough guy, but a good guy, and how glad  
he was to get it over with and to start playing again,'' Aaron 
Williams of the Seattle SuperSonics said. 
</P>
<P>
	And now Michael Jordan must decide whether he will retire or  
return to the Chicago Bulls for a shot at a seventh championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said. 
``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows  
any player to re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous 
salary. That means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, 
could get about $34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can offer him more than $14 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of about $2 billion in  
annual revenue in the fourth, fifth and sixth years of the 
agreement, according to several sources involved in the talks who 
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Players would get 57 percent if the league exercises its option  
for the seventh year. In the first three years, there is no limit 
on the percentage of revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the agreement includes a ban on marijuana, with all  
players undergoing drug testing once per season, and tougher player 
discipline penalties and conduct rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides also agreed to form a joint committee of three owners  
and three players to discuss the growth of the league and improving 
the relations between players and management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to five years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, but not quite as high as the union had been demanding. 
</P>
<P>
	No professional sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary  
before, but the NBA had been pushing for one throughout the 
lockout. The union initially refused, then suggested a luxury tax 
be charged to any owner who signed a player for more than $15 
million. The league kept holding out, and eventually the players 
relented. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys can still make $14 million, and that's a lot of money,''  
said Kevin Willis of the Toronto Raptors. ``If you can't live off 
that, something's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is finalized and the lockout is lifted, it will  
unleash a three-week frenzy of teams scrambling to fill rosters, 
make trades and sign some of the 200 free agents while running 
abbreviated training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have eight months of NBA basketball squeezed  
into four months, with trades and signings,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman,  
Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, Rod Strickland and Damon 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be very busy,'' agent Mark Bartelstein said. ``We've  
got a lot of free agents, so we've got to find them homes and 
teams. Get other guys into camps. I'm sure I'll probably talk to a 
lot of teams today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide  
the estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement was reached as players arrived in New York to vote on  
the owners' previous offer, and it took everyone by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a call at 6 a.m. in my hotel room this morning and I  
couldn't believe it,'' free agent center Joe Kleine said. ``We will 
finally play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout went into effect July 1, just 2 1/2 weeks after Jordan  
and the Bulls won their sixth championship in a riveting Game 6 
that put up the largest TV viewer numbers ever for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1980s and especially since Jordan arrived, the league  
has enjoyed unprecedented popularity here and abroad. On the labor 
front, Stern and the NBA lived a relatively charmed life while 
baseball struggled through a strike that caused thousands of fans 
to turn away from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But then came the lockout, that for the first time caused the  
NBA to miss games because of a labor dispute. The first three 
months of the season were scrapped and players lost about $500 
million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	An entirely new schedule will be put in place for the remainder  
of the 1998-99 season, although details were still unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Rejoices As Lockout Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In a town where basketball is the only  
game, it was time to talk of tickets and toast the NBA season -- or 
what's left of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy. I almost cried when I heard,'' said Janet Law, a  
secretary who was among the handful of fans milling around the 
Delta Center during Wednesday's lunch hour. ``The Jazz are a big 
part of a lot of people's lives. It'll be so good to have them 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Billyup and Craig Bunch, wearing Jazz parkas and hats, were  
in the arena's lobby inquiring about tickets. Too soon, they were 
told. 
</P>
<P>
	``This state loves the Jazz probably more than any other city  
loves its basketball team because they're the only thing we have,'' 
Billyup said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 6-month lockout, which ended Wednesday with a labor  
agreement between the union and players, the area around the Delta 
Center was a ``ghost street,'' said Ali Raafati, director of the 
City Creek bar and grill, a haunt of visiting NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	His business fell 50 percent in the restaurant and 80 percent in  
the bar during the lockout. Before Wednesday's agreement, Raafati's 
waiters considered quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called my friends, I bought everybody a drink,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Salt Lake City Marriott hotel, which plays host to all  
but one of the visiting NBA teams, managers were lining up 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the lockout wiped out the entire season, the Marriott would  
have lost $250,000, said general manager Robert Gaymer-Jones, who 
learned of the agreement on the radio while driving to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great,'' he said. ``I almost had an accident.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jazz and Delta Center employees were still not allowed to speak  
about the lockout, but a woman who asked not to be identified said: 
``You can't believe how happy everybody is. People were bouncing 
off the walls around here wondering if they were going to lose 
their jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta Center floor, where Michael Jordan and the Chicago  
Bulls won their sixth NBA title last June, will soon be brought out 
of storage. 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, the Delta Center staged one college  
basketball game, several business seminars and an ice show. It even 
became a giant car lot for Jazz owner and automobile magnate Larry 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of NBA action drove desolate fans to new pursuits. The  
International Hockey League's Utah Grizzlies saw an attendance 
increase, and Rick Majerus' Runnin' Utes drew larger crowds than 
normal to preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing could replace John Stockton or Karl Malone. The  
Jazz's flagship television station recently began replaying 
memorable games in franchise history, labeling them Jazz Classics. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Despain, the manager of Red Rock Brewing Co., a Delta  
Center-area restaurant, is not convinced fans will flock to the 
Delta Center. But Billyup expects all to be forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely our year,'' he said. ``And we're going to  
support them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the settlement was welcome news at the NBA Store,  
across the street from league headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans will be back, but it will take some time,'' said  
Dimitrius Pinckney, a cousin of former NBA player Ed Pinckney. ``In 
a way, I'm glad they fought this long. But I didn't want the season 
to be canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Economou, a corporate driver, was checking out $225  
cashmere sweaters with the NBA logo when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is a fan and he kept asking me when we could go to a  
game,'' Economou said. ``Now we know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, Bulls fan Barbara Scherer swears she will never  
watch another NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fed up,'' she said. ``I think they are all greedy. They  
throw a ball into a hoop. Big deal. This is not rocket science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Kleinman, a season-ticket holder in Vancouver, was becoming  
pessimistic about a settlement.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator Rules for Ex-Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Don Nelson, the winner in a $1.56 million  
arbitration case with the Golden State Warriors, said the team 
unfairly made him take the blame for a breakdown of relations with 
forward Chris Webber that led to his trade and the coach's firing. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony during the arbitration hearing, Nelson said the  
real reason for Webber's departure and the Warriors' downfall was 
owner Chris Cohan's refusal to pay Webber an additional $3 million 
for seven years. Nelson also said he arranged a much better trade 
for Webber than the one Cohan eventually ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors had no comment on the arbitration or Nelson's  
testimony, spokesman Raymond Ridder said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, now coach and general manager of the Dallas Mavericks,  
was fired from the same jobs with the Warriors in February 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was paid $562,000 in salary and a $1 million lump sum,  
bringing his earnings to $3.6 million for two years. The Warriors 
contended the payments were part of an ongoing contract that had 
three more years to run and that the contract required Nelson to 
reimburse the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But arbitrator Lance Liebman, a Columbia law professor appointed  
by the NBA, ruled Tuesday that the $562,000 was for work Nelson had 
already done and the $1 million was a buyout of the contract, 
eliminating any requirement for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, fired by the New York Knicks in March 1996, was hired by  
the Mavericks as general manager in February 1997 and also became 
their coach last December. 
</P>
<P>
	His firing by the Warriors came during a season-long slump  
marked by the team's inability to sign Webber, a star rookie for 
Golden State the previous season. Before Nelson's firing, Webber 
was traded to Washington for forward Tom Gugliotta and three 
first-round draft choices, a deal that failed to revive the 
Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	During the arbitration hearing, Nelson testified that the team's  
official reasons for the trade -- animosity between him and Webber, 
and the new owner's decision to back the coach over the player -- 
was false. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, according to a transcript, Nelson said Webber would  
have signed for $53 million for seven years, but Cohan drew the 
line at $50 million and instead ordered a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson testified the trade he initially worked out with  
Washington would have brought the Warriors rookie forward Juwan 
Howard, in addition to Gugliotta and a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great deal because I considered both of those players  
better than Webber,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Webber, who had veto rights, objected to the trade  
because he wanted to play with Howard, his former college teammate 
at Michigan. Nelson said he advised Cohan to ``hold his feet to the 
fire'' and insist on Howard, but Cohan refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said the Warriors ordered him to take the blame for the  
Webber situation at a news conference announcing the trade. He 
argued that the order violated his contract and entitled him to 
keep the money he was paid at the time of his firing. 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitrator did not rule on the breach-of-contract claim and  
instead decided that the terms of the contract and the $1 million 
buyout did not require reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson's lawyer, John D. O'Connor, said regretted the public  
misperception of the causes of the Warriors' decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don continues to love the Bay area and its fans, and feels he  
could have brought them a championship if he had been permitted a 
reasonable degree of control over this situation,'' O'Connor said.

<HEADLINE> Lott Planning Clinton Trial Outline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said today  
he hoped to announce a framework for President Clinton's 
impeachment trial within 24 hours but cautioned the historic 
proceeding could stretch three weeks or more. Democrats vowed 
``universal, unanimous'' opposition to calling witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling for days to build a consensus, Lott told  
senators his emerging plan would be one ``that neither the House 
nor the White House will just necessarily think is wonderful but 
will give all parties a fair chance to make the case and get to a 
conclusion that's an equitable one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will get that done hopefully in a relatively short period  
of time without limiting it to a day or three days or three weeks, 
for that matter. It could very well take longer than that,'' Lott 
said shortly after the 106th Congress convened. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said his party opposes  
prolonging the case by calling witnesses as House prosecutors want. 
He urged the House members to stay out of the dispute over the 
first trial of a president in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't involve ourselves in their proceedings and it is  
very disturbing that they now seem to be intent on involving 
themselves in ours,'' said Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	As for calling witnesses like Judiciary Committee chairman Henry  
Hyde and other House prosecutors want, Daschle said: ``I think it's 
fair to say that there is universal, unanimous opposition to 
witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor dismissed the criticism. ``It is certainly  
appropriate for us to present our views on what it will take to 
present the case. ... It is a very strange thing to have a trial 
with no witnesses,'' Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde met Lott today to discuss the trial. Several senators  
familiar with the meeting said Hyde was seeking to allow House 
prosecutors and the White House to each call five to eight 
witnesses but that no decisions were made. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott laid the first groundwork for the trial minutes after  
senators were sworn in this afternoon. The Senate approved a plan 
to limit public access while the trial is going on and to create a 
ticketing system for access to the public gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	But he continued to struggle to develop a consensus among  
Republicans on how long the trial should last. ``I can't give you a 
magic date,'' the Mississippi Republican told reporters before 
ducking into a caucus of GOP senators. He promised senators would 
continue their legislative work even in the midst of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart voiced ``some  
obvious frustrations that we don't know what the procedures will 
be.'' The president, he said, ``is anxious to get this resolved 
quickly and fairly.'' Lockhart said presidential advisers ``share 
some of those concerns'' about calling witnesses but would leave 
the final decision to senators. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Democrat cautioned he could vote to remove Clinton from  
office. ``I could go either way based on the evidence as I've seen 
it or heard it. And I've followed it pretty closely,'' Sen. Robert 
Byrd, D-W. Va., said in an interview on the C-Span cable TV 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	More than six of 10 Americans in a CBS News poll say they think  
a full trial of President Clinton is not necessary and almost that 
many, 60 percent, think a full trial would have a serious negative 
impact on the country. Only a third think the president's actions 
are serious enough to warrant his being impeached and removed from 
office, according to the poll conducted Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond establishing a date to formally open the historic perjury  
and obstruction of justice trial, nearly everything else is 
unsettled -- from whether there will be witnesses to the length of 
the proceedings. Each party's members met in caucuses this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle pleaded for a quick resolution of the trial.  
``Regrettably, we must also set aside until this matter is resolved 
important legislative work on matters like education, health care, 
Medicare and Social Security. This, in and of itself, should serve 
to motivate us to proceed with deliberate dispatch,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the new Congress took their seats today some two  
weeks after a House vote made Clinton just the second impeached 
president in history. In the House, one of the first orders of 
business was to be reappointing the 13 House Republicans who will 
serve as prosecutors in the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh criticism surfaced among Republicans on Tuesday over the  
bipartisan plan for a proceeding as short as a week -- a proposal 
mostly favored by Democrats looking for a vote to censure the 
president rather than remove him from office. The likelihood of a 
longer trial, meanwhile, grew -- with some senators predicting it 
could last well into next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not at all worried about a two-to-three-week process that  
could take us into mid-February,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, 
a member of the GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Senate sources who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
Lott said in closed-door meetings during the day that after 
Thursday's largely ceremonial events, he wants opening arguments 
presented the following Monday by representatives of the House and 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 House Republicans who will act as prosecutors gave their  
take on the debate during a meeting Tuesday night. No consensus was 
reached on just whom to call as witnesses, said Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R-Fla. But he estimated that the House would need two or three 
weeks in the trial just to present its case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved articles of impeachment on Dec. 19, alleging  
that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice as part of a 
months-long campaign to cover up his sexual relationship with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Former-Boston Herald Editor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- George W. Bates, a newsman who started delivering  
papers as a boy and rose to the rank of managing editor at the 
International Herald Tribune in Paris, has died of cancer. He was 
69. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates, of Somerville, died Tuesday at Beth Israel Deaconess  
Medical Center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a real perfectionist and did a tremendous job to make  
sure everything was absolutely right and historically correct,'' 
said Norman Gray, news editor at the Boston Herald, where Bates 
last worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The longtime editor was born and educated in Nashville, Tenn.,  
and graduated in 1950 from Vanderbilt University. He served in the 
U.S. Navy in the Mediterranean during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he joined The Tennessean of Nashville as a sports  
reporter, and in 1959 went to The Miami Herald as a news editor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, Bates joined the now-defunct New York Herald Tribune. A  
year later he was named managing editor of the International Herald 
Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Boston Herald as news editor in 1978 and worked  
there until days before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his career, Bates was known for his strong grasp of  
international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a really good eye for stories. He understood the  
dynamic of the international stuff, which was unusual in those 
days,'' said Bob Sales, former executive editor of the Boston 
Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates is survived by his wife, Betsy, and several nieces and  
nephews.

<HEADLINE> Miami's Defensive Line Depth Helps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- No need for old-timers Bob Baumhower or Jeff  
Cross to wait by the phone. Despite losing two of their best 
defensive linemen, the Miami Dolphins aren't looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson has been hoarding nine defensive linemen on  
the roster since opening week. So even with end Jason Taylor and 
Pro Bowl tackle Tim Bowens suffering season-ending injuries in the 
past two weeks, the NFL's top defense still will have a full 
rotation for Saturday's AFC divisional playoff at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a smart move by us,'' said Shane Burton, who will  
start his second consecutive game at left end. ``Now it's paying 
off at the end when it's most crucial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowens, the team's only Pro Bowl selection, was placed on  
injured reserve this week after tearing a biceps muscle in Miami's 
24-17 wild-card victory over Buffalo. That came one week after 
Taylor broke his collarbone against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	For most teams, such losses would be crippling. Buffalo played  
just five defensive linemen last week, hampered even further when 
nose tackle Ted Washington wore down in the second half. He was on 
the sideline catching his breath when the Dolphins scored what 
turned out to be the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's desperation went so far as to bring Charles  
Haley out of retirement. Nearly three years after winning helping 
Dallas win the 1996 Super Bowl for his fifth championship ring, he 
played several downs in the 49ers' victory over Green Bay last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's situation means playing time for Daniel Stubbs, a  
10-year veteran who played with two Super Bowl winners with San 
Francisco and had nine sacks for Miami in 1996. He's been active 
for just five games this year, but has ample experience in the 
Dolphins' system. 
</P>
<P>
	``That helps,'' end Trace Armstrong, Miami's pass-rush  
specialist, said. ``That's the whole line of reasoning in keeping 
nine. Injuries happen. When they do, we have somebody in there that 
knows the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins still were forced to do some shuffling, with right  
tackle Daryl Gardener the only lineman to remain in the same spot. 
Rookie starter Kenny Mixon shifted to Taylor's right end position 
from the left. Burton moved in at left end, and second-year tackle 
Barron Tanner makes his first career start. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner's role is paramount. Bowens' strength has been his  
ability to tie up two blockers, freeing up middle linebacker Zach 
Thomas to make 160 tackles this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping B.T. does the same thing,'' Thomas said. ``I think  
we'll be all right. B.T. plays half the game anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said: ``Barron Tanner is a good football player. The key  
to our defense is our two guys inside. I think Barron will do a 
good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton can spell Gardener or Tanner inside on passing downs.  
Armstrong, Stubbs and rookie swingman Lorenzo Bromell fill out the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the revamped lineup can bottle up Denver's 2,000-yard  
rusher, Terrell Davis, the way Miami did last month remains to be 
seen. Davis was held to 29 yards in the Dolphins' 31-21 victory 
Dec. 21, and the Broncos are looking forward to reasserting 
superiority up front. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got players missing right now, and I'm sure they'll try  
to take advantage of that,'' Mixon said. ``We'll try to do it the 
same way we did the first time. We've already shown we can play 
with these guys.''

<HEADLINE> Plutonium Found in Nev. Groundwater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Traces of plutonium from a test blast in the Nevada desert  
migrated nearly a mile through groundwater, according to a study 
that prompted the government to recalculate slightly the risks that 
would be posed by an underground nuclear waste storage site. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists said the amount of radioactivity that can move in  
this fashion is too small to endanger the public, and the U.S. 
Energy Department, in reassessing the risks of the government's 
proposed waste site beneath Nevada's Yucca Mountain, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, it was commonly believed that significant  
amounts of plutonium would not move through groundwater because the 
element dissolves at a very low rate and attaches strongly to any 
rocks it touches. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature,  
researchers confirmed suspicions that plutonium can hitch a ride on 
colloids, or particles of debris suspended in water. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in  
California and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico looked 
at a 30-year-old nuclear blast that reached below the water table 
on the Nevada Test Site, where the United States has conducted 828 
underground nuclear tests between 1956 and 1992. The site is 70 
miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists found minute amounts of plutonium -- measurable  
only by the most sensitive equipment -- in test wells nearly a mile 
away from the blast, and concluded that the plutonium had flowed 
downstream on colloids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shown there is a new potential pathway that has been  
suggested before, but never definitely shown. The question is what 
the maximum amount is that you could move. We don't know that,'' 
said Annie Kersting, a Lawrence Livermore scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department wants to build a nuclear waste repository  
at Yucca Mountain, about 90 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The 
government has already spent $2.2 billion in 15 years of research 
in hopes of entombing 80,000 tons of used reactor fuel that will 
remain deadly 300,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The department took the latest findings into account and  
concluded that the seepage wouldn't happen for 10,000 to 100,000 
years, and even then, the escaped radiation would be less than the 
background amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not rates that would bust any kind of standards. We  
see no impact,'' said Abe Van Luik, senior technical advisor for 
performance assessment for the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Honeyman, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines,  
said the very nature of colloids -- their extremely small size and 
low concentrations -- assure that they would never move large 
amounts of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The radioactivity is so low that it probably is not of  
significance for adverse human health effects,'' he said. 
``Conceptually, you can think of colloids being like a conveyor 
belt. The belt is really not turning very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department's conclusions did not satisfy Bob Loux,  
executive director of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects in the 
Nevada governor's office. He said he believes containers holding 
the waste will fail much more quickly than the government estimates 
and allow unknown quantities of contaminants to escape within 500 
years.

<HEADLINE> Reducing C-Sections May Be Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Aggressive efforts to lower the number of Caesarean sections in  
the United States could lead to more injuries and deaths among 
mothers and babies, some obstetricians are warning. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion piece in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, four doctors at Harvard teaching hospitals in Boston said 
that pressure from HMOs and policymakers is leading some doctors to 
encourage women to try vaginal delivery even when the risks are 
higher than those of a C-section. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstetricians said they are concerned about an increase in  
uterine ruptures, as well as injuries to babies caused by vacuum 
devices and forceps used during difficult labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration recently reported a tiny but  
growing number of head injuries and deaths of babies caused by 
vacuum devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Uterine ruptures also are increasing, according to data from  
four states. Serious uterine rupture during labor, which usually 
occurs in women with previous C-sections, can lead to brain damage 
or death for the baby and loss of the uterus or death for the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some parts of the country, some people have tried to  
mandate a trial of labor and not given women the option of a repeat 
Caesarean delivery,'' said Dr. Benjamin Sachs, chairman of 
obstetrics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ``There is 
enormous apprehension in the medical community about these mandates 
and approaches, for safety reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors especially criticized a campaign coordinated by the  
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to bring the nation's 
C-section rate down to 15 percent by 2000, from a high of 25 
percent in 1988. In 1995, five years after the goal was announced, 
the rate was 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting a 15 percent target is an ``authoritarian approach to  
health care delivery,'' the obstetricians wrote. ``It implies that 
women should have no say in their own care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Thompson, a spokesman for the Department of Health and  
Human Services, said the 15 percent goal was based on consultation 
with hundreds of groups, and is only a target, not a quota. He said 
studies have shown that hospitals can lower the C-section rate 
without compromising safety. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that studies show vaginal deliveries are  
safer than C-sections for most women, though vaginal deliveries are 
slightly riskier in women with a previous Caesarean. Also, women 
who deliver vaginally spend much less time in the hospital and 
generally recover more quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 15 percent goal has led health maintenance  
organizations to put a lot of pressure on hospitals to keep the 
number of Caesareans down, said Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, chief of 
obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, another one of the 
doctors who wrote the opinion piece. He said a low C-section rate 
is considered the ``gold standard'' of a maternity ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Many HMOs discourage C-sections by paying doctors the same  
amount for vaginal and Caesarean deliveries. Others pay a flat fee 
per mother, regardless of how complicated the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some HMOs consider a hospital's C-section rate when deciding  
whether to include it in their networks, and doctors consider it 
when deciding where to refer patients, the obstetricians said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists did not  
sign on to the 15 percent goal ``because there is no adequate 
science upon which to recommend an ideal national Caesarean rate,'' 
according to the organization's director of practice activities, 
Dr. Stanley Zinberg.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Police Seek Shooting Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The police chief in the nation's capital asked  
the Justice Department Wednesday to investigate his own officers' 
use of deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan Police Department Chief Charles Ramsey called for a  
Civil Rights Division probe of every shooting involving district 
police over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am reacting to the environment I find myself in now,''  
Ramsey told reporters, saying he wants a probe by the Justice 
Department's Civil Rights Division of every shooting involving 
District of Columbia police over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The written request to Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Holder also  
calls for a review of the department's policies on the use of 
force, and how such cases are investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department is reviewing the request, said spokesman  
Myron Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey said the probe is needed to restore public confidence in  
the department because of questions surrounding a series of police 
shootings and statistics indicating that district police have shot 
and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than has any other 
large police force in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Through last November, district police officers had been  
involved in 640 shootings in the 1990s -- 40 more than in Los 
Angeles, a city with six times the population, according to a 
compilation by The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to once and for all address this issue,'' said Ramsey,  
a former deputy superintendent of police in Chicago who took 
control of Washington's police department last April. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's new mayor, Tony Williams, said he is confident the  
Justice Department will agree to Ramsey's request, which be 
supported with his own letter to Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this action will ultimately identify systemic  
weaknesses that put all of our officers at risk,'' Williams said in 
his letter to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	The request came the day after three district officers were put  
on administrative leave pending further investigation of their 
involvement in a fatal shooting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary police investigation determined that the three  
officers used appropriate force in the fatal shooting of Joseph 
Robert Durant, 40. The officers said Durant lunged at them with 
knives after they were called to his father's home. They say they 
were forced to shoot. Family members dispute police claims that the 
son lunged at officers. Durant was hit with several shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have an occupation where unfortunately we have to take a  
life in order to save a life,'' Ramsey said.

<HEADLINE> False Teeth Monopoly Is Alleged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's dominant manufacturer of false  
teeth has clamped down too hard on its market, the Justice 
Department is alleging in a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Delaware, the  
department's antitrust division argues that Dentsply International 
Inc. unlawfully maintained its near monopoly by restricting most of 
the nation's artificial tooth distributors from selling products 
made by its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentsply, headquartered in York, Pa., sells some 70 percent of  
the artificial teeth used in this country and has maintained about 
that market share for at least a decade, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the department advised Dentsply it would challenge  
the company's restrictive dealing arrangements that the government 
said are affecting more than 80 percent of the nation's tooth 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response from the company. But after last  
month's notice from the government, Dentsply asked a court to rule 
that its actions were legal. In addition to its lawsuit, the 
government filed a motion to dismiss that action by Dentsply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dentsply tried to limit competition by depriving its rivals of  
effective distribution networks,'' said Assistant Attorney General 
Joel I. Klein. ``In the process, its actions reduced competition 
and raised the prices of artificial teeth in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all artificial teeth sold in this country are used by  
dental laboratories to make dentures. Laboratories sell more than 
$500 million in dentures annually to dentists for use by about 10 
million customers. Artificial teeth are the costliest part of a 
denture. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent dealers are the primary distributors of artificial  
teeth to dental laboratories in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleged that in 1987, after foreign competitors  
tried to build distribution networks here, Dentsply entered into 
agreements and other arrangements with independent dealers which 
provided that the dealers in most cases could not add the new 
competing brands of false teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Dentsply has refused to sell its teeth, or other  
products, to dealers who add any competitor's tooth line, the 
government alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentsply's actions have effectively deprived its domestic and  
foreign competitors of adequate distribution and have deterred 
other firms from entering its market, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's suit seeks to restore competition in the artificial  
teeth market so that consumers will receive lower-priced, higher 
quality dentures,'' Klein said.

<HEADLINE>  Palestinian Killed in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- A Palestinian carrying what turned out  
to be a toy pistol near a Jewish enclave in Hebron was shot today 
by Israel soldiers and died several hours later, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron, home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers, is  
one of the tensest spots in the West Bank. Assailants believed to 
be Palestinian militants opened fire Monday on a van carrying 
settler women and two of the passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Israeli army imposed a curfew on the downtown  
area of the city it controls and also barred Palestinians from 
leaving and entering Hebron. Settlers can move around freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The army said soldiers were guarding the Jewish settler enclave  
of Beit Romano this morning when the Palestinian approached. 
Soldiers asked the man to stop for a security check, the army 
statement said. The man took out a handgun and fled, with soldiers 
in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the man suddenly turned and ran toward the soldiers, the  
army said, but offered no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers opened fire, critically wounding him, the army said.  
The army said the gun in the man's possession was a toy. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was treated by army paramedics and taken to a hospital  
by military ambulance. He died several hours later at Hadassah 
Hospital in Jerusalem, said Hadassah spokeswoman Yael Bosem-Levy. 
</P>
<P>
	She said his identity was not known because he carried no  
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting occurred shortly before 9 a.m. in the central  
square of Hebron, near the outdoor vegetable market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new violence in Hebron comes at a time when the  
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused the  
Palestinians of violating the Wye River peace agreement and has 
said he would not hand over more West Bank land, as required by the 
accord, until the Palestinians meet their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a charismatic former army chief, announced  
his candidacy for prime minister today by saying he hoped to heal 
the deep divisions in Israel over peace with the Arabs and the role 
of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The silver-haired ex-general said Netanyahu had exploited those  
rifts for political gains. ``Netanyahu is dangerous for Israel. 
Netanyahu must go,'' Lipkin-Shahak told a news conference broadcast 
live on Israeli TV and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu responded sharply. ``The prime minister heard with  
pain and disappointment that Amnon Lipkin-Shahak opened his 
election campaign with a blatant personal attack, instead of 
presenting his political positions, if he has any,'' said a 
statement by Netanyahu's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's parliament gave final approval Monday for elections to  
be held more than a year early -- May 17 -- in a country divided over 
how to negotiate peace with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu has frozen the accords brokered by President Clinton  
in October, accusing the Palestinians of violating the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-liners in his coalition back early elections because they  
are angry with Netanyahu for having agreed to further territorial 
concessions in the accord. Doves in the opposition say Netanyahu's 
freeze shows he is not serious about pursuing peace.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dumps Tapes in Anwar Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The judge in the sex and  
corruption trial of Malaysia's ousted deputy premier threw out 
tapes today that defense attorneys believed would prove a political 
conspiracy against their client. 
</P>
<P>
	With prosecutors having rested their case, the defense had hoped  
today to begin by playing tapes of secretly recorded conversations 
between star prosecution witness Ummi Hafilda Ali and a Malaysian 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense attorneys believed the tapes would prove that Ummi  
was being used by political operatives to destroy the former deputy 
premier, Anwar Ibrahim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ummi has testified that Anwar had sex with the wife of her  
brother, Anwar's former personal secretary. She also encouraged a 
former driver for Anwar's family to come forward with charges that 
Anwar repeatedly sodomized him. 
</P>
<P>
	High Court Judge Augustine Paul refused to listen to the tapes  
after prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed their transcripts of 
the tapes did not match. 
</P>
<P>
	``This confirms that the authenticity of the tapes ... is in  
serious doubt,'' Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the tapes were first admitted to court, Paul barred the  
media from reporting the conversation. He did not mention the gag 
order in today's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar faces 10 counts of illegal sex and corruption. The trial  
is for four of the corruption charges that relate to allegations of 
misuse of office to cover up sexual trysts. He will be tried later 
on the other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and he  
was arrested soon after for organizing huge protests that demanded 
an end to Mahathir's 17-year-rule. Anwar has denied the allegations 
against him, saying they are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar showed up in court for his arraignment with a black eye  
and bruises. Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah finally conceded 
Tuesday that police caused some of Anwar's injuries. But the 
investigation has yet to identify the officers responsible, Mohtar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar told reporters today that he was ``shocked'' that after  
nearly four months of inquiry, Malaysia's top police chief had yet 
to be interviewed about the beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense mistrust of the police overshadowed the trial earlier  
today, after prosecutors asked that an officer be present during an 
interview with a potential defense witness. 
</P>
<P>
	But the defense refused. ``We don't trust police officers,''  
said attorney Gurbachan Singh. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul demanded Singh withdraw the statement. When he refused,  
Paul said angrily that ``proper action will be taken about this at 
a later stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge may have been referring to contempt charges. He has  
already held one of Anwar's lawyers in contempt for accusing the 
prosecution of trying to coerce a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides beating Anwar, the Malaysian police are accused of  
mentally and physically abusing several of his relatives and 
allies. They have admitted on the stand to brutal tactics to coerce 
witnesses and the chief intelligence officer said he would lie 
under oath to protect his bosses.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Back Drops NCAA Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Madre Hill, who set an Arkansas  
rushing record as a sophomore in 1995, said Wednesday he will not 
petition the NCAA for an additional year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill's decision will make him available for the NFL draft in  
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said he was told by NCAA officials that if he applied for  
another year of eligibility, it would be 4-5 weeks before there 
would be an answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That puts us (Arkansas football) in the middle of spring, and  
then I would have missed the NFL draft,'' Hill said. ``So if I 
didn't get that year, I wouldn't have college or the NFL. We 
thought it was best that I'm healthy and full speed to pursue a 
dream that I have been trying to achieve since the sixth grade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill is finishing his fifth year with the Razorbacks, but missed  
two years with knee injuries. NCAA rules give an athlete five years 
to complete four seasons of eligibility. A sixth year, called a 
medical hardship, may be granted if the player misses all or most 
of a season because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said NFL scouts had told him he would be drafted in the  
third round or later, but he is prepared to go the free-agent route 
if he is not selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 205-pound Hill set Arkansas records in 1995 when  
he carried 307 times for 1,387 yards and 15 touchdowns. His 
production was instrumental in the Razorbacks' 8-3 record and 
championship of the Western Division of the Southeastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was injured during the SEC championship game against  
Florida and redshirted in 1996. Another knee injury in spring 
practice knocked him out of the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	After major surgery on both knees, he shared time at tailback,  
carrying 160 times for 669 yards and seven touchdowns. He had 35 
yards in 13 carries in the Citrus Bowl loss to Michigan.

<HEADLINE> World Cup, Olympics Won't Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- International soccer's governing body  
assured the IOC today that it would not stage the World Cup in the 
same year as the Summer Olympics if soccer's showcase tournament 
becomes a biennial event. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made by FIFA president Sepp Blatter after a  
meeting with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, FIFA maintained its opposition to the IOC's  
policy on punishment for drug use, but agreed to reconsider easing 
the eligibility limit for soccer players in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter announced last weekend that he wanted to hold the World  
Cup every two years instead of four, a move which would put the 
tournament in direct competition with the Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we go to a (cycle) of two years we will not play the same  
years as the summer Olympic Games,'' Blatter told a news 
conference. ``First and foremost it is a matter of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said there would be ``two losers'' if the World Cup  
and Olympics were held in the same years. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter did not say exactly how the World Cups would be  
scheduled. He would not specify whether the tournament would be 
held in odd years rather than even years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Summer Olympics are held every four years. The next games  
are in Sydney in 2000, followed by Athens in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The next World Cup is scheduled for 2002 in Japan and South  
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Defense: Juror Didn't Take Bribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A jury foreman accused of accepting a $500,000  
bribe in a 1996 cocaine smuggling trial got money to fund his 
lavish lifestyle from a relative convicted of drug trafficking, his 
attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Miguel Moya was able to buy a home in the  
Florida Keys, a Hawaiian vacation, a sports car and a boat after 
being paid to acquit two men who were charged with making $2 
billion off of Colombian cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Curt Obront said in his opening statement that  
Moya really was bankrolled by Ramon ``Ray'' Perez, a former Miami 
police officer who asked Moya's father to hide proceeds from a drug 
operation in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Moya family has a past that they are not proud of,''  
Obront said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Nucci said as a prospective  
juror, Moya lied about whether he or anyone close to him had ever 
been arrested or accused. 
</P>
<P>
	Nucci also said that Moya ignored a judge's order not to have  
any contact with defendants Augusto ``Willie'' Falcon and Salvador 
``Sal'' Magluta -- alleged to be the nation's top cocaine smugglers 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend an associate of Falcon and Magluta contacted  
Moya after he was named foreman of the jury and gave him about 
$500,000 for his vote and his influence on other jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a traitor in that jury who was bought and paid  
for,'' Nucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors in Falcon and Magluta's cocaine smuggling trial  
deliberated for three days before telling the judge they could not 
reach a verdict. Hours later, they announced they had acquitted the 
men, who had been accused of smuggling 75 tons of cocaine into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquittal humiliated prosecutors, including U.S. Attorney  
Kendall Coffey, who resigned after a newspaper reported he was 
under investigation by the Justice Department for allegedly biting 
a topless dancer on the arm the night after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya, an aircraft hydraulic engineer, is charged with bribery,  
obstruction of justice, witness tampering, money laundering and 
filing a false tax return. If convicted, he could get up to 130 
years in prison 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, Jose and Rafaela Moya, were indicted in November on  
charges of money laundering, witness tampering and accessory. They 
also are on trial, and face up to 62 1/2 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Their attorney said the couple retired because of medical  
problems and also started spending Perez's money shortly after 
Falcon and Magluta were acquitted.

<HEADLINE> Alternative Dr. Weil To Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Massachusetts College of Pharmacy is  
challenging the views of much of the medical establishment by 
awarding an honorary doctorate to Dr. Andrew Weil, the guru who has 
successfully promoted alternative remedies such as acupuncture and 
chamomile tea. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerome Kassirer, editor in chief of the New England Journal  
of Medicine, said the college's decision to honor Weil 
inappropriately legitimizes Weil's points of view. 
</P>
<P>
	The journal's editor in chief emeritus, Dr. Arnold S. Relman,  
wrote a blistering critique of the Harvard-trained Weil in a Dec. 
14 New Republic cover story. 
</P>
<P>
	Relman objected to Weil's increasingly popular notion that  
traditional and alternative treatments can be used in conjunction 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not two kinds of medicine,'' Relman wrote. ``Nor, as  
Andrew Weil and his friends also would have us believe, are there 
two kinds of thinking, or two ways to find out which treatments 
work and which do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That followed criticism in September in the journal, which  
criticized New Age medicine advocates for their heavy reliance on 
anecdote and lack of clinical research into the effectiveness of 
various remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	But those doctors may be on the losing end of a debate over the  
possibility that traditional, or allopathic, and alternative 
medicines can coexist peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts College of Pharmacy, for one, is embracing  
Weil's philosophy that both kinds of medicines work, and can work 
together, by honoring him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the college will announce plans to open The  
Center for Integrative Therapies in Pharmaceutical Care, becoming 
the first of the nation's 80 or so pharmacy colleges to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The center will evaluate alternative therapies and test herbal  
remedies such as magnolia tree bark for irritable bowel syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Montagne, co-director of the center, concedes there is a  
lack of scientific basis for alternative medicines. But he said the 
same is true for some traditional drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 150 years, we've had anesthetics,'' he said. ``We still  
don't know how they work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey published in the Journal of the American Medical

<HEADLINE> McDougal Trial Delayed Three Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal on Wednesday received a  
three-week delay in her trial on charges stemming from her refusal 
to testify about President Clinton before a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. granted the delay, pushing  
Ms. McDougal's trial from Feb. 16 to March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard cited Ms. McDougal's recent, lengthy trial in California  
on an unrelated matter. He also said that Ms. McDougal's attorney, 
Mark Garagos, had several felony trials scheduled in California 
starting in January through the middle of February. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitewater prosecutors did not oppose the delay.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McDougal was indicted May 4 for obstruction of justice and  
two counts of criminal contempt for refusing to testify before the 
grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Her trial in Little Rock was to occur last year but was delayed  
to accommodate the California trial, which concluded shortly before 
Thanksgiving with her acquittal on embezzlement charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McDougal was convicted in May 1996 in a Whitewater loan  
fraud cause along with her ex-husband, James McDougal, who has 
since died, and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	She served 18 months in prison on a previous contempt citation  
for refusing to testify about Clinton before the Whitewater grand 
jury.

<HEADLINE> Bengals To Protect QBs From Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- General manager Mike Brown doesn't want to get  
the new Cleveland Browns started, so he plans to protect all four 
quarterbacks on the Cincinnati Bengals' roster when the Browns 
draft players from established teams next month. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL teams must submit their list of five unprotected roster  
players next week for the Browns' Feb. 9 expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to help Cleveland. If they get a quarterback, we  
would prefer it isn't one of ours,'' Brown said. ``The thing we've 
found in this league is quarterbacks are hard to find. You're 
awfully reluctant to surrender them unless you have somebody else 
who can do better. Until we do, I think we'll have to hold onto 
those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neil O'Donnell, Jeff Blake and Paul Justin all were given  
chances as the starter last season, but the Bengals wound up 
somewhat dissatisfied with all of them. The fourth quarterback on 
the roster is little-used backup Eric Kresser. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season began, Blake lost the starting job to  
O'Donnell. But after O'Donnell went down late in the season with a 
broken hand, Blake started and made a good impression in 
Cincinnati's 25-24 win at Pittsburgh before Blake, too, injured his 
throwing hand and missed the season's final game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals players who could be left unprotected include wide  
receivers James Hundon and Damon Gibson, defensive lineman Mike 
Thompson, long snapper Greg Truitt and linebackers James Francis 
and Tom Tumulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Tumulty is recovering from a knee injury that cut short his  
season. The Bengals have questioned whether Francis is motivated 
enough to be worth keeping. The team is well stocked at wide 
receiver, which could make Hundon or Gibson expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals may not see the return of cornerback Ashley Ambrose,  
now a free agent. The team tried to re-sign him to a contract 
extension in 1998, but no agreement was reached. His agent, Kennard 
McGuire, said Ambrose's price of $4.5 million per year has gone up 
now that the season is finished. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire hinted Ambrose might seek as much as $6 million per  
year, the price McGuire thinks Kansas City might pay to retain 
cornerback Dale Carter. The Bengals think Ambrose had an off year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told in so many words that they don't think he's a  
good enough player to command that money and they'll just take a 
corner in the draft,'' McGuire said. ``I'm not saying this to be 
hostile, but that can have an adverse effect on the player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown still has the option of declaring Ambrose a franchise  
player in order to retain the rights to him. Brown thinks that free 
agents are overestimating the market because the salary cap rises 
only by $5 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five to $6 million is going to be too much for us,'' Brown  
said. ``If he can get it, God bless him. Our hope is he'll come 
back if it's not out there.''

<HEADLINE> 106th Congress Called to Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 106th Congress opened today with a new  
House speaker promising a more bipartisan spirit and a Senate 
impeachment trial sure to make that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	At the stroke of noon the House was called to order to start a  
session in which the Republican hold on power is one of the 
narrowest in history. The Senate session officially began minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, presiding over the opening of the  
Senate, swore in the 34 senators elected or re-elected in 1998. 
There are eight new senators, four from each party. 
</P>
<P>
	A different sort of swearing-in ceremony will take place  
Thursday in the Senate when Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
administers the oath to the 100 senators, who will serve as jurors 
in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	House Clerk Jeffrey Trandahl rapped the gavel twice to open the  
House proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of House business was to elect Rep. Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., a self-effacing former high school teacher, to 
succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker. Hastert would then deliver the 
oath of office to the other 221 Republicans, 211 Democrats and one 
Democratic-leaning independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who has emphasized the need to end the partisan rancor  
that has characterized Congress in recent years, carried that theme 
forward in his first remarks as speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks prepared for delivery, he said that ``solutions to  
problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the turbulent days behind us, debate on the merits often  
gave way to personal attacks,'' the 57-year-old lawmaker said. 
``Some here have felt slighted, insulted or ignored. That is wrong, 
and that will change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert outlined four areas that Republicans hope to promote in  
the coming session: Social Security and Medicare reform, more local 
control of education, lower taxes and stronger national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, on NBC's ``Today'' show,  
said that with Hastert in the leadership, ``We can work out a 
better relationship. I sure want to do that. I will work very hard 
to come more than halfway with him to develop a new respect, a new 
civility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As is customary on opening day, the House floor was filled with  
members children and scenes of lawmakers greeting old friends and 
welcoming new members. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore administered the oath of office in groups of four to the 34  
newly elected or re-elected senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, R-Ga., decided to resign after his party lost five  
House seats in the November election and his seat will be vacant 
until a special election is held next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, chosen unanimously by Republicans Tuesday evening to  
lead the party, says he'll work to end the partisan combat that 
held up key bills in the last session and hurt the Republicans at 
the polls. He added that he'll have to work with Democrats because 
``a smaller majority makes the dynamics change, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is already figuring out how to be speaker of the whole  
House rather than just the Republican speaker,'' said House 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a close ally. 
</P>
<P>
	At a reception Tuesday evening, Hastert told reporters he  
planned to meet today with Democratic leader Gephardt. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republicans led by Majority Leader Trent Lott of  
Mississippi, returned with the same 55-45 majority, still well 
short of the 60 votes needed to overcome minority filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is slated to make some changes in rules governing  
lawmakers, including easing a gift ban imposed in 1995 to concur 
with the less restrictive rules imposed in the Senate. The Senate 
allows its members to receive gifts, including meals, valued at up 
to $50 and accept up to $100 in gifts from one source in a year. 
House members have chafed under current rules which bans even such 
minor gifts as T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The House completed its part in President Clinton's impeachment  
matter when it approved two articles of impeachment last month. But 
it must reappoint the 13 GOP Judiciary Committee members who will 
act as prosecutors in the Senate trial on whether to remove the 
president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the impeachment proceedings will begin Thursday,  
although it's still unclear when the formal trial would start and 
how long it would last. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, as in most years, will go into recess after the  
opening session, waiting until after the president's State of the 
Union address, scheduled for Jan. 19, before getting down to real 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably the two most achievable goals of this session will be  
reforming Social Security to keep it solvent in the future and 
increasing consumer protections against health managed-care abuses. 
Democrats are leery of GOP efforts to allow the private investment 
of some retirement funds, and Republicans are against Democratic 
proposals to give consumers greater powers to sue HMOs. But both 
parties say they are committed to finding middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Republicans list as among their top priorities  
increased funding for national security and missile defense, 
substantial tax relief, more local control over schools and 
bankruptcy reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats will push for campaign finance reform, a national  
settlement with the tobacco industry, an increase in the minimum 
wage, and more money to hire elementary school teachers and build 
new schools.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Receivers Now a ? Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- For the better part of 1998, Ed McCaffrey, Rod  
Smith and Shannon Sharpe gave opposing secondaries fits as they 
outjumped cornerbacks, outran free safeties and outmuscled 
linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
	But on a forgettable Monday night in December -- on national  
television, no less -- the Miami Dolphins stifled the Denver 
Broncos' potent receiving trio, begging the question: Can they do 
it again? 
</P>
<P>
	``The receivers -- myself, Rod, Ed -- we didn't make the plays,''  
Sharpe said this week as Denver prepared for Saturday's AFC 
divisional playoff game against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to do anything to diminish what they did. They  
stopped us. They won the ball game, and now we get an opportunity 
on Saturday to see if it was for real or if it was a hoax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anchored by cornerbacks Terrell Buckley and Sam Madison, Miami's  
pass defense is legitimate. Buckley and Madison had eight 
interceptions apiece this season, the most by any tandem in 
Dolphins history. As a team, Miami led the NFL with 29 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with the way our secondary has played, and when  
you say secondary, I think that encompasses everybody,'' said 
Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The secondary struggled against Buffalo last Saturday, and Eric  
Moulds caught nine passes for an NFL playoff-record 240 yards and a 
touchdown. That was 108 yards more than Smith, Sharpe and McCaffrey 
had combined three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The standard is so high, and every time one little minute  
thing doesn't go our way, it's perceived as such a big 
disappointment,'' Smith said. ``It's our fault because we want our 
high standards. We live and die with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith (1,222 yards), McCaffrey (1,053) and Sharpe (768) put up  
gaudy numbers this season, but looked ordinary against Miami. While 
linebacker Zach Thomas blanketed Sharpe, Madison and Buckley took 
care of the corners, with support from safeties Brock Marion and 
Calvin Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The superb man-to-man coverage enabled the Dolphins to crowd the  
front line, and it paid off. They held Terrell Davis to a 
season-low 29 yards rushing. He finished the regular season with 
2,008 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``That can't happen again,'' Davis said. ``Just looking at the  
film, I was a step or two from making a big run. I need to make 
those plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe also challenged himself as he prepares for a rematch with  
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zach won that one, and I'll be ready this time,'' he said.  
``He played better than I did, and I tip my hat to him. I didn't 
think he was that good in the beginning, but I have a newfound 
respect for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that humble admission, Sharpe didn't back down from his  
postgame comment of three weeks ago, when he insisted Denver is 
still 10 to 14 points better than the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stopped us, and I gave them credit, the utmost credit,''  
he said. ``I am very (stingy) with my compliments, but I passed 
them out to them, so they should be gracious and accept them and be 
ready to play on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're looking for me, I ain't hard to find. If they're  
looking for something to say, I'm going to give them something to 
say.''

<HEADLINE> China Task Force To Fight Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China has stepped up its crackdown on rampant  
smuggling by forming a 10,000-member police force with special 
powers of arrest and interrogation, state media said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	China launched the crackdown in July to stop a  
multibillion-dollar flood of cheap, illegal imports ranging from 
cars to sugar that are undercutting Chinese producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smuggling Investigation Bureau was set up Tuesday with 6,000  
police officers in 19 offices nationwide, the China Daily newspaper 
said. An additional 4,000 officers and 23 offices are to be added 
by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smuggling can wreck the economy, destroy the party, the  
military and maybe even the country,'' Cabinet minister Luo Gan was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the crackdown, few leading smugglers have been caught  
and ``huge stocks of goods are being piled up along our border,'' 
said Wu Yi, another Cabinet member. 
</P>
<P>
	Smuggling increased dramatically after the collapse of Asian  
currencies made goods much cheaper, while China maintained the 
value of its currency, the yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	Smuggling is believed to account for as much as 15 percent of  
Chinese imports, or some $30 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new force will have more sweeping powers than Customs  
agents, with authority to investigate and arrest suspects and 
conduct hearings, state media said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, lack of investigative powers meant only 20 percent  
of smuggling cases went to court, said Mu Xinsheng, political 
commissar of the new force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hands were tied,'' said Mu, a former deputy minister of  
public security. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a ceremony Tuesday to launch the force, Luo appealed  
to its members to resist bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you yourself cannot hold your heads high, how can you deter  
smugglers and convince the public?'' Luo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new force -- recruited from the army, police, courts and  
Customs service -- will cover tariff-related smuggling cases, while 
police will continue to combat smuggling of drugs, guns and other 
contraband, the China Daily said.

<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	

</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Rob Zombie, groovy ghoul  

</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* With his matted dreadlocks that cascade below his  
shoulders, custom-made contact lenses that turn his pupils into 
black pinholes and Z.Z. Top beard, Rob Zombie is the perfect person 
to turn heavy metal into something macabre. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Born Robert Cummings on Jan. 12, 1966, Zombie  
spent his formative years in Haverhill, Mass., a depressed 
industrial outpost the singer describes as ``a place where nothing 
ever happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up with really normal, straight parents, but they let  
me and my brother do anything we wanted to do,'' says Zombie. 
``They took us to see 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Texas Chain Saw 
Massacre.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zombie was an art student in New York. He wanted to be a film  
director. He was a production assistant for several years on the 
offbeat TV show, ``Pee-wee's Playhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was totally obsessed with TV, to the point where it was  
unhealthy,'' he says. ``It didn't matter what was on, I would watch 
it. If there was a storm and the power went out, I would sit there 
in a state of shock, just freaking out!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He formed White Zombie in 1985. The name was taken from the  
title of a 1932 horror movie. Zombie created the band's unique 
visual style, designing everything Zombie: album art, T-shirts, 
stage shows and music videos. ``I never saw it as work; I love 
doing everything,'' Zombie says. ``How else can you realize a 
complete vision?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band's darkly themed major label debut on Geffen Records,  
``La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Vol. 1,'' spawned a hit single, 
``Thunder Kiss '65.'' The album went double platinum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Astro Creep: 2,000 Songs of Love, Destruction and Other  
Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head'' included the single, 
``More Human Than Human.'' The album also went double platinum, and 
White Zombie collected the Best Hard Rock Video trophy for ``More 
Human Than Human'' at the MTV Awards in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Solo debut:* Zombie made his solo debut in 1998 with  
``Hellbilly Deluxe.'' Shortly after the album's release, White 
Zombie disbanded. A statement released by the band said that 
``after 13 years, White Zombie has accomplished everything we set 
out to do, and we all felt it was time to move on.''

<HEADLINE>  Vols' Town Giddy Over Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee fans welcomed home coach  
Phillip Fulmer, snapped up souvenirs and embraced the Vols' 
national football championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting time for all of Tennessee football,''  
Fulmer told a crowd greeting him and his wife Vicky with applause 
as they moved through McGhee Tyson Airport on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids have had a phenomenal season. We're really proud to  
be a part of history by being the first unified champion, and we 
are very appreciative of the unbelievable support all season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers won the national championship and completed a  
13-0 season Monday night with a 23-16 victory over Florida State in 
the Fiesta Bowl. It was the Vols' first national football title 
since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer stopped in Knoxville only long enough to hop another  
plane for a recruiting trip. His players went their separate ways 
with their families from Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	An official celebration and parade are planned for Jan. 16 after  
students return from winter break. But the date could be changed 
because it's the same day as Gov. Don Sundquist's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all these conflicts,'' Deputy Mayor Gene Patterson  
said, noting it also is falls on the weekend before the Martin 
Luther King Jr. holiday. ``But this only happens about once every 
half-century, so we can't wait until the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mayor Victor Ashe is proposing to rename Stadium  
Drive in front of Neyland Stadium to Phillip Fulmer Way. 
</P>
<P>
	A small electronic sign behind the counter of the downtown post  
office flashed the message in orange pulses: ``A Perfect Season ... 
How 'Bout Them ... Vols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this was the year of destiny, fate, call it whatever  
you want to,'' Will Kirkpatrick said. ``I think UT was destined to 
make it where they did this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoxville sports bars were packed with boisterous,  
cigar-smoking, high-fiving fans Monday night. The city's embrace 
was more low-key Tuesday morning as commemorative caps appeared on 
the heads of downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tostitos, sponsor of the Fiesta Bowl, flooded grocery stores  
with commemorative bags of chips. The Make-A-Wish Foundation hoped 
to raise $25,000 through sales of 5,000 commemorative Tennessee 
footballs. 
</P>
<P>
	And retailers with UT goods expected to sell millions of dollars  
in merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Souvenir makers Bacon &AMP; Co. of Knoxville and New Hampshire-based  
Pro Player cranked up their printing operations as soon as the game 
was in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in at about midnight, and I would say we will be here  
until midnight tonight,'' Bacon &AMP; Co. spokesman Jed Dance said. 
``Or maybe around the clock again, if we can stand up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Tennessee Fever, another Vols souvenir store, spokesman John  
Weaver said fans were waiting when he opened at 7:30 a.m. Half of 
the 600 championship items he stocked were sold by midday. 
</P>
<P>
	What's selling? ``Hats, shirts, anything that says `Tennessee  
national champions,''' he said. And more is on the way. ``License 
plates, trash cans, flags, ties, anything you can put an orange `T' 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knoxville News-Sentinel was expecting strong demand for its  
Tuesday edition, so it printed 215,000 copies instead of the normal 
125,000. The front page featured the headline ``CHAMPIONS!'' 
printed in orange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are selling them as fast as we can print them,'' publisher  
Bruce Hartmann said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Iraqi Planes in Dogfight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and British warplanes patrolling the  
``no-fly'' zones over Iraq may well be facing ``a period of 
challenge'' from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the Clinton 
administration says. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Saddam Hussein, defiance is his only strategy,'' Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters at the Pentagon, discussing 
the third clash with Iraqi forces within the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, four U.S. Air Force and Navy jets fired on -- and  
missed -- four Iraqi MiGs testing the no-fly zone over southern 
Iraq. It was the first such air confrontation in more than six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqis ``beat a hasty retreat'' following the early morning  
clashes, which occurred in two separate incidents just 15 minutes 
and 62 miles apart, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, between 13 to 15 Iraqi aircraft attempted to violate the  
no-fly zone in a rash of eight incursions that Bacon termed 
``suspicious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was the third military confrontation with Iraq  
within the past two weeks over enforcing the no-fly zones in 
northern and southern Iraq. Iraq considers the restrictions illegal 
and has vowed to defy them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going through a period of challenge,'' Bacon said when  
asked about the rash of incidents. Twice last week, U.S. warplanes 
fired on Iraqi surface-to-air missile batteries in separate 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	While dismissing any ability to ``psychoanalyze'' Saddam, Bacon  
said the moves could have been aimed at luring U.S. and British 
aircraft within shooting range of surface-to-air missile batteries, 
or may be marks of his ``frustration'' in the wake of the surprise 
December air attacks by U.S. and British forces. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, said he believed the current provocations by Iraqi 
aircraft reflected the fact that ``they lost the initiative which 
we feel they are trying to regain now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the U.S.  
missiles were fired ``at a distance,'' and were near the limit at 
which they are effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., whether the United States  
shouldn't try to destroy the airfields used by Iraqi aircraft, 
Shelton said: ``We have those kinds of plans on the shelf'' should 
President Clinton decide to take such action. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shelton sidestepped a direct question on whether the United  
States should try to target Saddam directly. 
</P>
<P>
	As to casualties, he said that civilian casualties were slight.  
He said that as many as 800 of Saddam's Republican Guard members 
were killed in the attacks, giving the first such estimate of Iraqi 
military casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, Bacon said the first incident occurred at 2:15  
a.m. EST southwest of Baghdad and involved two U.S. Air Force F-15s 
that fired off one Sparrow and three AIM-120 missiles at two Iraqi 
MiG-25s. The Iraqis had turned their radar on the American 
aircraft, prompting the missile firings, Bacon said. Such a use of 
radar can indicate intent to attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second event, two U.S. Navy F-14s fired on two other  
MiG-25s, using two AIM-54 Phoenix missiles. That incident took 
place southeast of Baghdad after the Iraqi planes ``dipped'' into 
the no-fly zone, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the Iraqi planes turned quickly after being fired upon,  
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi planes ``confronted  
and clashed with the aggressive British and American aircraft'' 
before ``the aggressive aircraft withdrew. All of our air force 
planes returned to base safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said U.S. and British forces will continue banning  
Iraqi flights in the restricted zones, arguing that Saddam 
Hussein's military still represents a threat to minority Kurds in 
the north and Shiite Muslims in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Pentagon official said the air-to-air altercation was  
the first in Iraq since Dec. 27, 1992, when a U.S. F-16 shot down 
an Iraqi MiG-25. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said one Iraqi MiG-23 apparently crashed in attempting to  
return to its base, but it wasn't immediately clear whether that 
aircraft had been one of those that had flown southward. It is 
possible the MiG crashed because it ran out of gas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash evoked harsh words from the State Department spokesman  
James P. Rubin, who said Saddam was ``lashing out as a result of 
his isolated condition,'' because he has ``no support in the Arab 
world. He has no support around the world.''

<HEADLINE>  Congress Opens With New Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 106th Congress opened today with the House  
choosing Rep. Dennis Hastert as its new speaker. The Illinois 
Republican promised a more bipartisan spirit, but a Senate 
impeachment trial was sure to make that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of  
bitterness,'' Hastert said in his first speech as speaker, which he 
delivered from the well of the chamber rather than the speaker's 
chair in a gesture toward breaking down barriers between the 
leadership and the rank-and-file membership. 
</P>
<P>
	In another symbolic act, he asked Democratic leader Dick  
Gephardt of Missouri to hold the gavel while he gave his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt responded by saying Democrats will do their part to end  
the partisan conflicts of recent years. ``Let's bury the hatchet,'' 
he said as he introduced Hastert, and ``put to rest finally the 
poisonous politics that has infected this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the stroke of noon the House was called to order to start a  
session in which the Republican hold on power is one of the 
narrowest in history. The Senate session officially began minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, presiding over the opening of the  
Senate, swore in the 34 senators elected or re-elected in 1998. 
There are eight new senators, four from each party. 
</P>
<P>
	A different sort of swearing-in ceremony will take place  
Thursday in the Senate when Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
administers the oath to the 100 senators, who will serve as jurors 
in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of House business was to elect Hastert, a  
self-effacing former high school teacher, to succeed Newt Gingrich 
as speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote, taken in the old-fashioned manner of calling out each  
member's name, was 220-205, with Democrats voting for Gephardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who has emphasized the need to end the partisan rancor  
that has characterized Congress in recent years, carried that theme 
forward in his first remarks as speaker. ``In the turbulent days 
behind us, debate on the merits often gave way to personal 
attacks,'' the 57-year-old lawmaker said. ``Some here have felt 
slighted, insulted or ignored. That is wrong, and that will 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert was sworn in by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the senior  
member of the House, and then administered the oath to the other 
221 Republicans, 211 Democrats and one Democratic-leaning 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert outlined four areas that Republicans hope to promote in  
the coming session: Social Security and Medicare reform, more local 
control of education, lower taxes and stronger national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	As is customary on opening day, the House floor was filled with  
members children and scenes of lawmakers greeting old friends and 
welcoming new members. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, R-Ga., decided to resign after his party lost five  
House seats in the November election and his seat will be vacant 
until a special election is held next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, chosen unanimously by Republicans Tuesday evening to  
lead the party, says he'll work to end the partisan combat that 
held up key bills in the last session and hurt the Republicans at 
the polls. He added that he'll have to work with Democrats because 
``a smaller majority makes the dynamics change, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is already figuring out how to be speaker of the whole  
House rather than just the Republican speaker,'' said House 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a close ally. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republicans, led by Majority Leader Trent Lott of  
Mississippi, returned with the same 55-45 majority, still well 
short of the 60 votes needed to overcome minority filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is slated to make some changes in rules governing  
lawmakers, including easing a gift ban imposed in 1995 to concur 
with the less restrictive rules imposed in the Senate. The Senate 
allows its members to receive gifts, including meals, valued at up 
to $50 and accept up to $100 in gifts from one source in a year. 
House members have chafed under current rules which bans even such 
minor gifts as T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The House completed its part in President Clinton's impeachment  
matter when it approved two articles of impeachment last month. But 
it must reappoint the 13 GOP Judiciary Committee members who will 
act as prosecutors in the Senate trial on whether to remove the 
president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the impeachment proceedings will begin Thursday,  
although it's still unclear when the formal trial would start and 
how long it would last. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, as in most years, will go into recess after the  
opening session, waiting until after the president's State of the 
Union address, scheduled for Jan. 19, before getting down to real 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably the two most achievable goals of this session will be  
reforming Social Security to keep it solvent in the future and 
increasing consumer protections against health managed-care abuses. 
Democrats are leery of GOP efforts to allow the private investment 
of some retirement funds, and Republicans are against Democratic 
proposals to give consumers greater powers to sue HMOs. But both 
parties say they are committed to finding middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Republicans list as among their top priorities  
increased funding for national security and missile defense, 
substantial tax relief, more local control over schools and 
bankruptcy reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats will push for campaign finance reform, a national  
settlement with the tobacco industry, an increase in the minimum 
wage, and more money to hire elementary school teachers and build 
new schools.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Pianist Petrucciani Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michel Petrucciani, an acclaimed jazz pianist  
who waged a lifelong battle against a crippling disease that 
stunted his growth and made his bones dangerously brittle, died 
Wednesday at 36. 
</P>
<P>
	The French-born musician was being treated at Beth Israel  
Medical Center for a lung infection when he died, said his Paris 
agent, Bernard Ivain. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrucciani won a wide following with his technical mastery,  
skillful improvisation and sense of harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder known  
as ``glass bone disease,'' he lived a fragile existence. Because he 
was only 3 feet tall, his pianos had to be fitted with pedal 
extensions. Often he had to be carried to and from the piano bench 
because his bones were so brittle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a warrior,'' said jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter. ``He  
dared to go places that others never even think to go -- and not 
just musically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A child prodigy schooled in classical music as well as jazz,  
Petrucciani made his professional debut at 13 at an outdoor jazz 
festival in France, and put out his first album, ``Flash,'' when he 
was 16. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inspired by greats like Duke Ellington and jazz pianist  
Bill Evans, and by his father, jazz guitarist Antoine Petrucciani. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he recorded more than a dozen albums, including  
``Promenade With Duke,'' an homage to Ellington; ``Pianism'' 
(1986); ``Michel Plays Petrucciani'' (1988); and ``The Best of 
Michel Petrucciani -- The Blue Note Years'' (1994), a compilation of 
his seven years with the Blue Note jazz label. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrucciani moved to the United States in 1981. He lived in Big  
Sur, Calif., before moving to New York to form his own trio. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a totally natural musician,'' guitarist John Abercrombie  
once said. ``I just think he's one of the greatest piano players to 
hit the jazz scene in a long time. He's quite a figure, in spite of 
his size. He's much bigger than he appears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petrucciani admitted being sensitive about his condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``People don't understand that being a human being is not being  
7 feet tall. It's what you have in your head and not your body,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he credited his disease with giving him plenty of time to  
practice as a child, since he couldn't go outside and play sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could stay in front of the piano for five or six hours a day  
and it all adds up over the years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Genius? ``I don't believe in genius,'' he said. ``I believe in  
hard work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by three sons.

<HEADLINE> NBA Lockout Hurt Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some NBA cheerleaders had to flash their moves at a bar mitzvah  
instead of a basketball game. Around dormant arenas, empty sports 
bars closed early and parking attendants sat around in vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
	These hardships, felt in small doses around the country, are the  
most significant economic effects of the 6-month NBA lockout that 
will end with an agreement reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that while the lockout may have caused steep  
losses for individuals and small businesses, the overall economic 
impact wasn't significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lockout might determine where people in Chicago drink  
beer. But it clearly doesn't affect how much beer they drink,'' 
said Allen Sanderson, a sports economist at the University of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cities, economists said, the NBA lockout was the  
equivalent of a big department store closing temporarily -- 
employees and nearby businesses would be affected, but consumers 
could certainly find somewhere else to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson is part of a group that shares Chicago Bulls season  
tickets and would have attended two or three games by now. ``But 
we've just gone to more movies, we went to concerts more often, 
probably spent more on Christmas gifts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	True enough, but some who depend on basketball directly for  
their livelihood were still left scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Laker Girls, who would normally be working on their halftime  
routines, were instead banking on various public appearances -- 
including one fan's bar mitzvah several weeks ago. Each Laker Girl 
has lost thousands of dollars, despite the $75 per hour they get 
for these special events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not like the players,'' said the squad's director, Lisa  
Estrada. ``This has always been part-time work, and most of the 
girls either go to school or have other jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, Mayor Edward Rendell is trying to lure people  
to city hotels for Valentine's weekend to make up for the loss of 
the NBA's All-Star Game next month. This week, the city launched a 
promotion called ``Love Is More Than a Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the league has salvaged its season, the All-Star  
Game remains canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street from Milwaukee's Bradley Center, home of the  
Bucks, the Legends sports bar had cut most of its full-time staff 
down to 20 hours a week during the lockout, manager Kathie Taglieri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't keep them here just to help them out, because we're  
also hurting,'' Taglieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday when the Bucks should have been playing the Golden  
State Warriors, the bar closed two hours early because there was 
only one customer. Usually, 300 to 900 people come before and after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake City, the Diamond Parking lot across from the Delta  
Center has been empty instead of pulling in the usual $10 to $12 
per car for its 100-space lot on game nights. ``The only existence 
for that location is for the Jazz,'' manager Damon Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the damage has been mostly local, the lockout has had  
some broader impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters have been forced to fill air time with movies and  
other sporting events such as golf and skiing, which are much less 
attractive to most advertisers. NBC replaced the Knicks-Bulls game 
on Christmas Day with another showing of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' 
the Jimmy Stewart classic. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports, which have national rights to broadcast  
NBA games, and Fox Sports Net, which has local cable rights to 26 
teams, have yet to disclose how much the lockout will cost them. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball shoe sales were already off before the lockout but  
the slump deepened as NBA games were canceled. Nike Inc. chairman 
Phil Knight compared the lockout to a fashion designer losing one 
of its major runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike will now resume its payments to NBA stars that endorse its  
shoes, which had been suspended last month because of the lockout, 
said spokeswoman Vizhier Mooney.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minutes after his election as the new speaker  
of the House, Republican Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois cast 
tradition aside. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned the gavel over to a Democrat, Minority Leader Dick  
Gephardt of Missouri, and stepped down from the speaker's chair to 
deliver his first speech as leader of the 435-member House from the 
well of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who began his seventh two-year term Wednesday, has  
promised to return bipartisanship and civility to the chamber and 
his move was seen as a gesture toward improving relations among 
House leaders and rank-and-file members. 
</P>
<P>
	``My legislative home is here on the floor with you and so is my  
heart,'' he said, acknowledging that the speaker's job was one he 
did not seek. 
</P>
<P>
	After the speech, Hastert returned to the speaker's chair,  
banged the gavel twice and declared, ``Now, let us bring an end to 
talk and get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At least one ``opening-day of Congress'' custom continued in the  
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The floor was filled with the children of members, some of whom  
roamed the chamber's blue-carpeted aisles, with or without their 
parents, or remained seated in its big, brown leather chairs. Many 
others were seen sleeping in their seats or playing hand games with 
other children -- all apparently bored by the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	But 2 1/2-month-old Will, who was cradled by his father-to-be, Rep.  
Kevin Brady, R-Texas, was too young to know, or care, what was 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, who, with his wife, Cathy, is adopting the baby, proudly  
showed off Will to colleagues, some of whom took turns cuddling or 
stroking the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mark Sanford Jr., R-S.C., also was on baby patrol.  
</P>
<P>
	A burp cloth spread across his left shoulder and armed with a  
bottle of formula, Sanford walked up and down the aisles feeding 
his fourth son, 3-month-old Blake. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Traditions continued, too, across the Capitol in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	As is customary, Vice President Al Gore administered the oath of  
office to the 34 senators elected to six-year terms, including 
eight freshmen, four from each party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, Chuck, congratulations,'' Gore called to Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y. Gore represented Tennessee in the both the Senate 
and the House. Schumer graduated from the House by defeating 
Republican Alfonse D'Amato in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore swore in the senators in groups of four and greeted each  
one by name, regardless of political affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, Fritz, God bless,'' he said to Sen. Ernest Hollings,  
D-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who also is president of the Senate, left after fulfilling  
his duty. On Thursday, the Senate opens an impeachment trial that 
could lead to President Clinton's removal from office and Gore's 
elevation to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the real swearing-in, the Congressional Black  
Caucus attended a ceremonial oath-taking in the Jefferson Building 
of the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing, right hands raised, 36 members of the 39-person group  
swore to uphold the Constitution and defend the country as U.S. 
District Judge Margaret Beane Seymour of South Carolina 
administered the oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Author, poet and playwright Maya Angelou was the emcee.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who attended, said the Congressional Black Caucus, is  
needed to ``keep our country focused, to keep our Congress 
focused.'' The group was founded in January 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., began a two-year term Wednesday as  
chairman of the group, succeeding the outspoken Rep. Maxine Waters, 
D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under her leadership, not only did the CBC have a strong  
voice, it had strong elbows when they were needed too,'' the vice 
president joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyburn declared himself ready for the ``awesome challenge''  
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One political dynasty continued when Rep. Charlie Gonzalez,  
D-Texas, assumed the congressional seat that was held by his 
father, Henry, for the past 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
	And the elder Gonzalez was on hand, on the floor for the first  
time as a non-voting member, to witness his son's swearing-in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a happy feeling that I was there at this point,''  
Gonzalez said, ``but it is a new era and a new Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Gonzalez was philosophical about inheriting his  
father's seat on the House Banking Committee, despite his interest 
in other subject matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're in a committee room that has a giant portrait of  
your dad hanging on the wall, it's just a little different than for 
other members,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Camry, Ford Pickups Still Sell Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Toyota Camry family sedan and Ford's F-series  
pickup again took top honors as the best-selling car and truck in 
the United States in 1998, according to final year-end sales 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camry outsold the runner-up Honda Accord by 28,504 units to  
keep the sales crown for the second consecutive year. A total of 
429,575 Camrys were sold, compared with 401,071 Accords. Ford's 
Taurus placed third with 371,074 sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camry was redesigned in 1997, and last year's title was the  
first for Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Toyota added a coupe version called the Camry Solara,  
which boosted sales by about 15,000 units. More than two-thirds of 
the Camrys sold here last year were made in Georgetown, Ky.; the 
rest were imported from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had the best seller of all vehicles for the 17th straight  
year with its F-series truck. F-series sales totaled 836,629, the 
most for any one vehicle in the United States in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	F-series sales were boosted by February's introduction of the  
Super Duty version, which is sold mostly as the F-250 and F-350. 
Pipas said the Super Duty represented 40 percent of F-series sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In a distant second place was the Chevrolet pickup, which was  
sold last year as the C/K series and the '99 Silverado. General 
Motors Corp. sold 538,254 of the pickups, which was up slightly 
from 1998, even though two strikes against GM and the changeover to 
the new model slowed production significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also sells a Silverado twin as the GMC Sierra, which  
accounted for another 160,555 units last year. Combined 
Silverado-Sierra sales still lagged the F-series by 137,820 trucks.

<HEADLINE> Jury To Mull Anti-Abortion Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Amid the photos of mangled fetuses and the  
drawings of dripping blood blares a headline that reads like a 
wanted poster -- ``ABORTIONISTS: the baby butchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What follows on the controversial Internet site are the names of  
hundreds of doctors who perform abortions, their addresses, license 
plate numbers -- even the names of their children. Those killed, 
including four doctors and two clinic workers since 1993, are 
crossed off like items on a grocery list. The wounded are shaded in 
a misty gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tactics in the fight against abortion are on trial in  
federal court, where jurors will be asked to decide whether the Web 
site titled The Nuremberg Files is legally protected free speech or 
a thinly veiled hit list. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection was to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
	The site drew attention in October, when the name of Dr. Barnett  
Slepian was crossed off the list shortly after he was killed at his 
suburban Buffalo, N.Y., home by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sites like Nuremberg are a threat to doctors because the  
anti-abortion movement in the United States follows up on threats 
like that with violence,'' said Bonnie Jones, a lawyer at New 
York's Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. ``These are not 
words in isolation. They are typically followed up with murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood, a women's health center and five doctors  
filed the multimillion-dollar lawsuit in 1995, claiming the site 
violates a federal law that bars activists from inciting violence 
against abortion doctors and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	That law -- the 1994 Clinic Entrances Act -- has often been used  
against people who have firebombed clinics or attacked doctors, but 
has never been used to challenge a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include the American Coalition of Life Advocates, an  
umbrella group for several anti-abortion groups nationwide, and 
Advocates for Life Ministries, a radical Portland-based group. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendant Michael Bray called the Web site a form of political  
protest and said the lawsuit is simply an attempt to stifle debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a horrendous interference with freedom of speech,'' said  
Bray, a Reformed Lutheran pastor from Bowie, Md., who spent nearly 
four years in prison for setting fires to clinics in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that a victory for Planned Parenthood could backfire.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you are blocked of public protests, then people are left  
saying, `What are we going to do?''' Bray said. ``It leaves only 
one option: the covert use of force -- vandalism, blowing up places 
and terminating doctors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Henderson, a lawyer who has represented Bray but will not  
this time, said Planned Parenthood has no case unless they can 
prove anti-abortion forces intended to cause harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to see the constitution perverted by the claim that  
posting names and addresses alone on the Internet is cause for 
incitement,'' he said. ``You've got to have a whole lot more than, 
`You put my name up there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The site goes further than that. In some cases, it chronicles a  
doctor's personal history, property, physical appearance and 
wedding anniversary dates. It invites readers to send in photos, 
videotapes and background data on doctors, their cars, their house, 
their friends and their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Site creator Neal Horsley, a 54-year-old computer programmer  
from Carrollton, Ga., has said the purpose of The Nuremberg Files 
is to build a dossier on ``every abortionist presently plying their 
bloody trade in the USA'' so they can be tried for ``crimes against 
humanity.'' Horsley is not named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ray Guggenheim, a retired Portland obstetrician whose name  
appears on the site, said the list has had a clear effect on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see the doctors they've crossed off. You tell me, is  
that free speech or intimidation?'' he said. ``It tends to make you 
think twice about what you believe in.''

<HEADLINE> 50 Trial Seats Reserved for Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone hoping to catch a bit of history as the  
Senate begins President Clinton's impeachment trial had best get up 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty seats in the 596-seat Senate chamber have been reserved  
for the public. They will be handed out one hour before each day's 
proceedings on a first-come, first-served basis through the regular 
Capitol tour entrances, according to a resolution approved 
Wednesday by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	This system, said Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., will  
``make as many seats available in the gallery for the public and 
others as is possible for us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the choice seats will be divvied up among various  
government officials, with each of the 100 senators getting one 
permanent ticket -- good any day by anybody who holds it -- and three 
daily tickets apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate sergeant at arms gets 45 daily tickets, with smaller  
numbers allocated to the White House (30), House of Representatives 
(20), diplomatic corps (22) and Supreme Court (9). 
</P>
<P>
	The press gets 120 seats and 16 standing-room-only spots; those  
are in a separate part of the chamber and don't count toward the 
596-seat total. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate leadership will get most of the remaining 20 seats.  
</P>
<P>
	The rules were based on the 1868 impeachment trial of President  
Andrew Johnson, which ignited the social scene in Washington, 
according to a Senate history by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opening day saw the Senate galleries jammed with a curious  
mob,'' Byrd wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate historian Don Ritchie said Johnson's trial marked the  
first time tickets were issued for the Senate galleries. That 
trial, in which Johnson escaped conviction by a single vote, lasted 
about six weeks and was held from noon to dinnertime daily except 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	``People flocked to it. We have some sketches of people rushing  
to the doors to get in. The women were in big hoop skirts. People 
were just desperate for seats in the trial,'' Ritchie said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reporters who were not credentialed to the press gallery were  
going crazy trying to get tickets to get into the gallery so they 
could hear what was going on. Once you got in the gallery, you 
pretty much stayed there.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Farm Losses Are Over $1 Bil. / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- From El Nino's cotton-soaking spring  
deluges to a fruit-killing Christmas freeze, with all sorts of crop 
damage in between, 1998 was a year of monumental havoc for 
California agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers, who like fishermen are at the mercy of the weather but  
also are heavily insured, have estimated losses at more than $1 
billion and counting. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary tally, which is sure to climb once industry  
officials and insurers close the books on all the damage, already 
rivals some of the worst years in recent memory for the state's 
agricultural industry. A common measuring stick is 1990, when $800 
million in losses were attributed to a severe freeze and a drought 
cost millions more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly was a very, very challenging year, and farmers  
are glad to see 1998 end,'' said Bob Krauter, spokesman for the 
California Farm Bureau Federation. ``Obviously, we face all kinds 
of weather-challenging events: droughts, freezes, floods. But it 
just seemed there was a more significant number of challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the year, El Nino's unceasing, unpredictable wrath led  
to flooding and excessive wetness that doused crops, threw harvest 
and planting schedules out of whack and created environments in 
which pests and disease flourished. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, in late December, a four-day stretch of snow and  
freezing temperatures wiped out the lemon crop and delivered a 
crippling blow to the rest of the citrus industry. Citrus losses 
were most recently estimated at $540 million but are expected to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Those losses translate into higher prices for customers at  
grocery stores and produce markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``For consumers, that does mean that you will see a shortage of  
eating oranges. When it comes to pricing, everything in agriculture 
is related to supply and demand,'' said Heather Flower, spokeswoman 
for the Western Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Wholesale prices for navel oranges have gone from $10 or $12 a  
box to more than $20, said Krauter. In a few instances, boxes of 
the largest oranges have gone for $30, he said. Prices at the 
retail level also were on their way up, rising nearly 30 percent at 
some stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Department of Food and Agriculture has compiled  
losses of $532 million blamed on El Nino from January through June 
only, with cotton taking the biggest hit, at $110 million. Next 
were almonds, $77 million; cherries, $75 million; alfalfa, $26 
million; and strawberries, $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The full toll for the state's 250 crops is far from complete.  
The department has not computed losses for the fall and winter 
harvest, insurance claims are still being processed, and the 
prospect of federal disaster relief is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Rural Community Insurance Services, which is one of California's  
six biggest providers of farm insurance, said about 4,200 claims 
were filed for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact on farm receipts is hard to gauge, because there are  
so many variables. Market forces could help recovery, with prices 
going up as volume goes down. And California is normally insulated 
from big downturns by its diversity and volume of crops. 
</P>
<P>
	But some farmers are not sure the banks will be as optimistic  
once the final damage is calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financing is difficult ... and nothing is set for '99,'' said  
Mark Borba, whose family grows 11,000 acres of cotton and has been 
in the business since the early 1900s. ``Once the extent of the 
losses are known, financiers are going to become nervous and 
disenchanted.''

<HEADLINE> Foreman Would Like Tyson at 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It doesn't appear likely George Foreman will celebrate his 50th  
birthday with a fight -- at least not a scheduled one in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Birthday Bash between Foreman, who turns 50 Sunday, and  
49-year-old Larry Holmes on Jan. 23 in the Houston Astrodome 
appears to be dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman is unhappy that promoter Roger Levitt missed two  
deadlines for payment of the remaining $9 million of his $10 
million purse and was not satisfied when Levitt on Monday posted a 
guaranteed insurance bond instead of a letter of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	So if big George celebrates his 50th birthday with a fight,  
somebody might have to call the cops. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion still might fight at 50,  
something he has often talked about doing. 
</P>
<P>
	So, if not Holmes, how about 32-year-old Mike Tyson, who is  
scheduled to launch his latest comeback against Francois Botha, a 
native of South Africa, Jan. 16 in the MGM Grand Garden at Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to George, and George said he would be interested  
in fighting Tyson,'' promoter Bob Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said he has not talked to Shelly Finkel, Tyson's boxing  
advisor, about Iron Mike fighting Foreman, but that he planned to 
do so next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the potential of being the biggest (financial) fight  
ever,'' Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the vast difference between the two fighters'  
personalities and images, Arum added, ``People would have to be 
intrigued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Foreman has not been promoted by Arum for some time, Arum  
said that ``when I let George, go I retained the right to promote 
him if he fought Tyson, but I never thought it would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Foreman-Tyson fight, of course, would draw criticism from  
various areas. Boxing purists would see it as a sideshow. Some 
people would argue that a 50-year-old man doesn't belong in the 
ring with even a faded Tyson, that it's much too risky. Others 
would say Foreman should not risk tarnishing his image by fighting 
a man whose image will be forever tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Foreman-Tyson match is intriguing.  
</P>
<P>
	Foreman cannot match Tyson in speed. On the other hand, age and  
inactivity have robbed Tyson of the speed that made him unbeatable 
in the late 1980s. Also, Tyson's size -- he is a small heavyweight -- 
dictates he must attack. That's what Joe Frazier did when he was 
stopped in the second round by Foreman in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman, of course, doesn't put punches together like he did  
back then. He's depends mostly on a stiff left jab and occasional 
rights. But he still hits hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman also would have the benefit of knowing he would have  
nothing to lose. Tyson would have to fight with the knowledge that 
his considerable achievements in boxing would be trampled on by a 
loss to a 50-year-old opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	So why would Tyson want to take the risk?  
</P>
<P>
	Why not, wondered Arum.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tyson may very well be at the stage of his career where  
anybody who can fight a little bit could be dangerous,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reducing C-Sections May Be Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Aggressive efforts to lower the number of Caesarean sections in  
the United States could lead to more injuries and deaths among 
mothers and babies, some obstetricians are warning. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion piece in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, four doctors at Harvard teaching hospitals in Boston said 
that pressure from HMOs and policymakers is leading some doctors to 
encourage women to try vaginal delivery even when the risks are 
higher than those of a C-section. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstetricians said they are concerned about an increase in  
uterine ruptures, as well as injuries to babies caused by vacuum 
devices and forceps used during difficult labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration recently reported a tiny but  
growing number of head injuries and deaths of babies caused by 
vacuum devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Uterine ruptures also are increasing, according to data from  
four states. Serious uterine rupture during labor, which usually 
occurs in women with previous C-sections, can lead to brain damage 
or death for the baby and loss of the uterus or death for the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some parts of the country, some people have tried to  
mandate a trial of labor and not given women the option of a repeat 
Caesarean delivery,'' said Dr. Benjamin Sachs, chairman of 
obstetrics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ``There is 
enormous apprehension in the medical community about these mandates 
and approaches, for safety reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors especially criticized a campaign coordinated by the  
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to bring the nation's 
C-section rate down to 15 percent by 2000, from a high of 25 
percent in 1988. In 1995, five years after the goal was announced, 
the rate was 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting a 15 percent target is an ``authoritarian approach to  
health care delivery,'' the obstetricians wrote. ``It implies that 
women should have no say in their own care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Thompson, a spokesman for the Department of Health and  
Human Services, said the 15 percent goal was based on consultation 
with hundreds of groups, and is only a target, not a quota. He said 
studies have shown that hospitals can lower the C-section rate 
without compromising safety. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that studies show vaginal deliveries are  
safer than C-sections for most women, though vaginal deliveries are 
slightly riskier in women with a previous Caesarean. Also, women 
who deliver vaginally spend much less time in the hospital and 
generally recover more quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 15 percent goal has led health maintenance  
organizations to put a lot of pressure on hospitals to keep the 
number of Caesareans down, said Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, chief of 
obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, another one of the 
doctors who wrote the opinion piece. He said a low C-section rate 
is considered the ``gold standard'' of a maternity ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Many HMOs discourage C-sections by paying doctors the same  
amount for vaginal and Caesarean deliveries. Others pay a flat fee 
per mother, regardless of how complicated the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some HMOs consider a hospital's C-section rate when deciding  
whether to include it in their networks, and doctors consider it 
when deciding where to refer patients, the obstetricians said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists did not  
sign on to the 15 percent goal ``because there is no adequate 
science upon which to recommend an ideal national Caesarean rate,'' 
according to the organization's director of practice activities, 
Dr. Stanley Zinberg.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 233.78 for Record Close / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher on Wednesday, powering the  
Dow Jones industrial average to a record, as investors who are 
flush with new cash staged the third day of a huge New Year's 
buying spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow easily crossed the 9,400 and 9,500 thresholds for the  
first time. It ended 233.78 higher to close at 9,544.97, handily 
beating its previous closing record high of 9,374.27 set on Nov. 
23. 
</P>
<P>
	In a trend so consistent over the years that analysts have  
dubbed it ``the January effect,'' the stock market is awash in 
cash. Many investors cleaned out their portfolios of money-losing 
stocks late last year and now have the sales proceeds to invest. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies and individuals are making cash infusions into  
retirement plans, either to get a break on 1998 taxes or to get a 
jump on 1999 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors who had funded retirement plans early in 1998 have  
been well rewarded,'' said Charles G. Crane, chief market 
strategist at Key Asset Management in New York. ``They are eager to 
have as much money in the market as early as possible this year, so 
they're accelerating those contributions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, investment professionals, who manage portfolios of  
wealthy clients and institutions, are buying furiously because they 
don't want to be caught without the best stock performers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend is your friend, and you want to own them, period,''  
said Al Goldman, vice president at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally marks a continued turnaround from last fall. The Dow,  
which slid below 7,500 in early October, has now rallied more than 
2000 points, or about 27.8 percent, in less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which has benefited  
from the rush into Internet stocks, set its ninth record since Dec. 
18, rising 69.59 to close at 2,320.86. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
composite set its second consecutive record, rising 27.56 to close 
at 1,272.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which have been leading the market higher for  
some time, performed well again Wednesday. On the New York Stock 
Exchange, America Online rose 1 1/16 to 149, and Micron Technology 
rose 5 5/8 to 59 5/8. In Nasdaq trading, Intel rose 6 1/4 to 129 1/2 in leading 
volume. It was followed by Applied Materials, which rose 3 13/16 to 
53 9/16 after BT Alex. Brown upgraded the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also expanded their shopping lists to include a wide  
selection of names across numerous business sectors. The shares of 
big, well-known companies did the best, as investors bought the 
tried and true stalwarts that produced strong earnings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hard to find a sector that didn't do well. Transportation  
stocks were higher, pushing the Dow Jones Transportation average up 
125 points, nearly 4 percent, to 3,317.46. Financial stocks rose. 
The 30 Dow industrial components were led higher by American 
Express, up 4 5/16 to 103 5/8, and Citigroup, up 3 1/8 to 54 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors rose 3 7/16 to 78 1/16, amid a report Wednesday  
of strong December auto sales numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Dow components, only Disney lagged throughout the  
session, and even that sprinted into positive territory at the end 
of the day, closing at 30 15/16, up 3/8. Chairman Michael Eisner said 
in a letter to shareholders that new initiatives had dragged down 
the entertainment company's profits in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume was very heavy at 
1.21 billion shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Other market indexes rose. The NYSE composite index added 11.10  
to 611.01, breaking its closing record of 600.75 set last July 17. 
The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 9.26 to 701.47. 
The Russell 2000 Index added 5.70 to 427.79. Wall Street's rally 
was part of a global surge in stock prices. London's FTSE-100 index 
rose 3.20, the DAX in Frankfurt rose 3.61 percent, the Paris CAC 
index rose 2.24, and Tokyo's Nikkei 125 rose 1.78 percent.

<HEADLINE> Two Jaguars Fined for Lateness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin fined two  
rookies $500 each for being late to a team meeting even though 
their tardiness was caused by a car accident that sent both to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Tavian Banks and Cordell Taylor were on their way to a team  
meeting Saturday night when Taylor's car was involved in a one-car 
accident, flipping four times before hitting a guard rail on a 
downtown bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were 30 minutes late to the team meeting at a  
downtown hotel. After the meeting, they were taken to a nearby 
hospital for observation. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither suffered major injuries and nobody else was involved.  
Both players were on the inactive list for last Sunday's wild-card 
playoff game against the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Always a stickler for rules, Coughlin said Wednesday that he did  
not think twice about levying the fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's more thankful for the fact that those two young men  
were not injured than I am,'' he said. ``However, facts are facts 
and they don't cease to exist because we want to ignore them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player would comment Wednesday, leaving the coach as the  
only one who would go on record about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accident took place at a time that was very, very close to  
the meeting time,'' Coughlin said. ``They were running late. They 
were going to be late from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lesson to be learned here for young players. It's  
harsh in the short term, but it's consistent and it's the way I've 
always dealt with fines in the long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Times-Union reported that some teammates have called  
the NFL Players Association to lodge a formal complaint over the 
fines, although union representative Keenan McCardell said he had 
not made any calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union has been notified and we will review the  
situation,'' Carl Francis, director of communications for the NFLPA 
told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks had been held out since Oct. 18 with a foot injury and was  
expected to return for the playoff game. Taylor was used on special 
teams only. Neither was listed on this week's injury report.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA and the players' union reached an  
agreement today to end the 6-month-old lockout and save what's left 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	After a secret all-night bargaining session between commissioner  
David Stern and union head Billy Hunter, the deal was struck 
sometime around 6 a.m. -- just 29 hours before the league's Board of 
Governors was set to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners' and players' negotiating committees recommended  
approving the deal, sources told The Associated Press. About 200 
players were set to conduct a ratification vote this afternoon at 
the union's law office. 
</P>
<P>
	A season of about 50 games will begin the first week of  
February. The six-year deal, with an NBA option for a seventh year, 
still must be put on paper and ratified before the lockout will 
officially be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors will meet Thursday to vote on  
it, and the NBA will have no comment until then. 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of revenues in the fourth,  
fifth and sixth years of the agreement, sources told the AP. The 
NBA has an option for a seventh year, and the players would get 57 
percent if it is exercised. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three years, there is no limit on the percentage of  
revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to six years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The annual allowable salary increases will be 12 percent for  
players with so-called Larry Bird rights -- those free agents 
re-signed by a team without regard to the salary cap -- and 10 
percent for others. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Changes to free agency timing rules will be phased in, with  
free agents counting 200, 250 or 300 percent against their old 
team's salary cap until that team re-signs them or renounces their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, although the exact amounts weren't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is finalized and the lockout is lifted, it will  
unleash a three- to four-week frenzy of activity with teams 
scrambling to fill rosters, make trades and sign some of the 200 
free agents on the market while also holding abbreviated training 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Michael Jordan, who may retire,  
Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, 
Rod Strickland and Damon Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it will be very busy,'' said agent Mark  
Bartelstein. ``We've got a lot of free agents, so we've got to find 
them homes and teams. Get other guys into camps. Get up and 
rolling. I'm sure I'll probably talk to a lot of teams today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide an  
estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone won. Both sides lost on it,'' Indiana  
Pacers guard Fred Hoiberg said. ``I think it will take some time to 
get the game back to where it was. Hopefully, we can get back to 
work soon and put a good product on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors had scheduled a meeting for 11  
a.m. Thursday, and Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik had 
said they would recommend canceling the rest of the season if an 
agreement wasn't reached. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players began arriving in New York on Tuesday for a  
scheduled vote on whether to support the position of their 
negotiating committee, which had recommended that players reject 
the owners' final offer. At least 200 players had been expected to 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The league already had an offer on the table allowing the union  
to reopen the agreement if any other sport's average salary 
surpasses that of NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, in effect since July 1, caused the NBA to miss  
games because of a labor dispute for the first time in its history. 
The first three months of the season had been scrapped and players 
had lost about $500 million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said  
Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz. ``Neither side is coming out of 
this thing looking good.''

<HEADLINE> Lott Tries To Negotiate Trial Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders haggled over ground rules on  
the eve of President Clinton's trial as impeachment proceedings 
dominated the opening day of the 106th Congress. House Republicans 
sought the right to call several witnesses to testify in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have our responsibilities under the Constitution, and we  
will meet those responsibilities,'' said Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott,. He was involved in complicated negotiations Wednesday 
involving rank-and-file GOP senators, Democrats and House 
Republicans over the shape of the first presidential impeachment 
trial in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in charge of the House's impeachment  
team, met privately with Lott seeking permission to call witnesses, 
although congressional sources offered differing accounts as to 
whether Hyde's list was as long as 15 names or as short as five to 
eight. Lott spoke more in terms of five to seven, these sources 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, one lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Lott, R-Miss., had indicated to Hyde that each side in the 
trial -- the House and the White House -- might be given three or 
four days to present evidence. At that point, the full Senate might 
decide whether to issue subpoenas for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Hyde's request, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle  
said there was ``universal, unanimous opposition to witnesses'' 
among Democrats. And in polite but unmistakable terms, he urged 
members of the House to butt out of the Senate's business. ``We 
didn't involve ourselves in their proceedings and it is very 
disturbing that they now seem to be intent on involving themselves 
in ours,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came as lawmakers took the constitutional oath  
of office, some laying claim to their hard-earned seats for the 
first time. Vice President Al Gore administered the oath in Senate, 
after which lawmakers, family and guests repaired to private 
receptions marking the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans and Democrats alike brought their  
young children into the chamber for the opening-day ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, conservative Republican Rep. J. Dennis Hastert of  
Illinois -- a genial, former wrestling coach from a congressional 
district in the nation's heartland -- was elected the new speaker in 
place of the harder-edged Newt Gingrich. Hastert's supporters were 
readily identifiable by the lapel pins they wore bearing the 
inscription, ``The coach is my speaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's impeachment, the first of a president since Andrew  
Johnson's in 1868, trumped the other events of the day. And only 
the barest of details had been settled. 
</P>
<P>
	The House late last year approved two articles of impeachment on  
near party-line votes. They allege that Clinton committed perjury 
and obstruction of justice in his attempts to cover up a sexual 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky that was carried out in the 
vicinity of the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde is expected to formally present the articles of impeachment  
in the Senate on Thursday. A few hours later, Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist will enter the chamber and be sworn in to preside over 
the trial, his oath probably to be administered by Sen. Strom 
Thurmond, the Senate president pro tem. Rehnquist would then 
administer an oath to all 100 senators, who will sit as a jury to 
rule on Clinton's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol Rotunda -- clogged Wednesday with tourists  
eager to witness the opening day ceremonies -- the House Republican 
leaders pressed toward a vote to permit the presentation of 
evidence against the president when the trial opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats conceded privately the proposal would pass, but they  
sought to frame the issue as one final chance for majority 
Republicans to derail an impeachment that is unpopular with the 
public. ``This is a new Congress, this is an opportunity for 
members who are returning as well as new members ... to cast a vote 
to really in my view to end this nightmare and bring us to some 
sense of what the American people want,'' said Rep. Robert 
Menendez, D-N.J., a member of the Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans and Democrats met separately in private  
before the noontime opening of the session, discussing how 
Clinton's trial should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	And Lott and Daschle both referred to the momentous events in  
remarks on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said all sides must ``put aside our partisan instincts''  
for the duration of the impeachment proceedings. At the same time, 
he said, ``we must also set aside -- until this matter is resolved -- 
important legislative work on matters like education, health care, 
Medicare and Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott had a tart, one-word reply to the suggestion that all other  
work must halt: ``Wrong.'' Important work can go ahead, at least in 
committee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, little legislation is customarily brought to the floor  
in January or early February, so the lawmakers have a window to 
deal with impeachment.

<HEADLINE> 106th Congress Convenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 106th Congress opens with a new House  
speaker promising a more bipartisan spirit and a Senate impeachment 
trial sure to make that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first order of business today, the House will elect Rep.  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., a self-effacing former high school teacher, 
to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker. Hastert will then deliver the 
oath of office to the other 221 Republicans, 211 Democrats and one 
Democratic-leaning independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, R-Ga., decided to resign after his party lost five  
House seats in the November election and his seat will be vacant 
until a special election is held next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, chosen unanimously by Republicans Tuesday evening to  
lead the party, says he'll work to end the partisan combat that 
held up key bills in the last session and hurt the Republicans at 
the polls. He added that he'll have to work with Democrats because 
``a smaller majority makes the dynamics change, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is already figuring out how to be speaker of the whole  
House rather than just the Republican speaker,'' said House 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a close ally. 
</P>
<P>
	At a reception Tuesday evening, Hastert told reporters he  
planned to meet today with House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, on NBC's ``Today'' show, said that with Hastert in the  
leadership ``we can work out a better relationship. I sure want to 
do that. I will work very hard to come more than halfway with him 
to develop a new respect, a new civility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republicans led by Majority Leader Trent Lott of  
Mississippi, return with the same 55-45 majority, still well short 
of the 60 votes needed in the Senate to overcome minority 
filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is slated to make some changes in rules governing  
lawmakers, including easing a gift ban imposed in 1995 to concur 
with the less restrictive rules imposed in the Senate. The Senate 
allows its members to receive gifts, including meals, valued at up 
to $50 and accept up to $100 in gifts from one source in a year. 
House members have chafed under current rules which bans even such 
minor gifts as T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The House completed its part in President Clinton's impeachment  
matter when it approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton 
last month. But it must reappoint the 13 GOP Judiciary Committee 
members who will act as prosecutors in the Senate trial on whether 
to remove the president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the impeachment proceedings will begin Thursday,  
although it's still unclear when the formal trial would start and 
how long it would last. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, as in most years, will go into recess after the  
opening session, waiting until after the president's State of the 
Union address, scheduled for Jan. 19, before getting down to real 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably the two most achievable goals of this session will be  
reforming Social Security to keep it solvent in the future and 
increasing consumer protections against health managed-care abuses. 
Democrats are leery of GOP efforts to allow the private investment 
of some retirement funds, and Republicans are against Democratic 
proposals to give consumers greater powers to sue HMOs. But both 
parties say they are committed to finding middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Republicans list as among their top priorities  
increased funding for national security and missile defense, 
substantial tax relief, more local control over schools and 
bankruptcy reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats will push for campaign finance reform, a national  
settlement with the tobacco industry, an increase in the minimum 
wage, and more money to hire elementary school teachers and build 
new schools.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Close Sharply Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian markets ended sharply higher Wednesday,  
buoyed by Wall Street's overnight gains and various local 
market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, blue chips rose 1.78 percent as investors scooped up  
selected issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 235.72  
points to close at 13,468.46, after shedding more than 600 points 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian markets got a lift from the Dow Jones industrial average's  
gain of 1.4 percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Much attention in Tokyo focused on the U.S. dollar's movement  
against the yen. The dollar bought 112.52 yen in late trading, up 
1.00 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late 
New York level of 111.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressures remained on the dollar, however, including a narrowing  
gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates, President Bill 
Clinton's scheduled impeachment trial in the Senate on Thursday and 
financial troubles in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive  
overseas, and that had investors worried about shares in companies 
that depend heavily on foreign earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shares in exporters aren't that strong despite the rise on  
Wall Street because the dollar remains weak,'' said Masatoshi Sato 
of Kankaku Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, blue chips soared 3.5 percent on hopes of a  
possible cut in local interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index rose 342.80 points to close at 10,233.80.  
</P>
<P>
	A gap between U.S. and Hong Kong interest rates has triggered  
expectations of a possible slash in deposit rates by a 
quarter-point or a half-point as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If deposit rates fall, banks usually match the move by lowering  
prime lending rates. Hong Kong rates have been kept high in recent 
months to protect the Hong Kong dollar from speculative selling.

<HEADLINE> Carotid Artery May Show Health Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Thickening of the carotid artery walls in the neck is a more  
powerful predictor of a heart attack or stroke in elderly people 
than even high cholesterol or high blood pressure, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine used  
ultrasound measurements of the two carotid arteries in people over 
65 with no history of heart disease or stroke-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultrasound can detect cumulative damage to the blood vessels  
before the patient experiences any symptoms, said the study's lead 
author, Dr. Daniel O'Leary, chairman of radiology at Tufts-New 
England Medical Center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've clearly shown in the older age group that this is the  
single most powerful predictor of future heart attack or stroke,'' 
O'Leary said. ``It's clearly a screening test that ought to be done 
once'' at 65, or possibly earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the United States, claiming  
about 500,000 lives each year. Stroke kills an additional 160,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and  
Blood Institute, which financed the study, said ultrasound has 
great potential to prevent heart attacks and strokes in seemingly 
healthy people. 
</P>
<P>
	``By identifying high-risk patients, ultrasound would allow  
doctors to provide aggressive treatment early,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a Yale University cardiologist, said  
ultrasounds probably should not be given to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholesterol tests and blood pressure readings are cheaper and  
also tell doctors what they should treat, Krumholz said. Obesity, 
lack of exercise and smoking are other major risk factors for which 
treatment is straightforward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not clear to me in most cases (ultrasound) would change  
the way patients are treated,'' he said. ``The tests are probably 
most useful in patients who might have one risk factor, such as 
moderately high cholesterol, when doctors are trying to decide how 
aggressively to treat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two carotid arteries carry blood from the heart to the  
brain. An ultrasound to measure them in the neck costs about $250, 
O'Leary said. The tests are not done routinely now. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 4,476 Medicare recipients with an average  
age of 72. 
</P>
<P>
	None had a history of heart attacks, angina, bypass surgery,  
angioplasty, stroke, or surgery to widen a carotid artery. 
</P>
<P>
	An average of six years later, the 20 percent with the thickest  
artery walls had more than three times the risk of suffering a 
heart attack or stroke as the 20 percent with the thinnest artery 
walls, even after other risk factors such as high cholesterol, 
diabetes and smoking were taken into account.

<HEADLINE> Travolta Film Looks at Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- John Travolta takes heart in knowing that his new  
movie, ``A Civil Action,'' is shining a national spotlight on 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people leave the theater more enlightened about the  
situation in our environment we're in good shape,'' Travolta said 
Wednesday. ``They came out maybe wanting to check their own water 
out, maybe their neighbors, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of fans braved the cold Wednesday to catch a glimpse of  
Travolta and co-star Robert Duvall, who attended a $250-a-ticket 
screening to benefit Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the nonfiction best-selling book by Jonathan Harr, the  
film chronicles the saga of Woburn families who blamed polluted 
drinking water for the leukemia that killed their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta stars as Jan Schlichtmann, the underdog lawyer who goes  
up against a team of corporate attorneys to fight for the families. 
</P>
<P>
	In the real-life legal fight against the accused companies,  
Beatrice Foods was absolved of responsibility. The multinational 
chemical corporation W.R. Grace paid the families $8 million, but 
did not admit to any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Reggie White Gets AP Defensive Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Reggie White's final season of an illustrious career was a  
brilliant one, and on Wednesday he was selected The Associated 
Press NFL Defensive Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who planned to retire a year ago, came back to the Green  
Bay Packers for one last season and led the NFC with 16 sacks. He 
also served as an off-field teacher for young defensive linemen 
Vonnie Holliday and Keith McKenzie, who finished with eight sacks 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	No player has retired after winning the defensive or offensive  
player of the year award, but two MVPs did -- Norm Van Brocklin, 
co-winner in 1960, and Jim Brown in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	White also won the award in 1987 with Philadelphia, and recently  
was voted to the All-Pro team for the seventh time. The 37-year-old 
defensive end is the career sacks leader with 192 1/2 and is generally 
recognized as the first significant free-agent signing of the 
1990s, when he left the Eagles for Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers general manager Ron Wolf has said White's signing  
convinced other players to come to Green Bay, which won the Super 
Bowl after the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go out on top like this is an honor and a privilege that  
God would allow me to come through and play the way I did,'' said 
White, an ordained minister who around football is known as the 
``Minister of Defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play for the people who doubted me. When the Lord  
spoke to me about coming back, that was the only reason I came 
back. No. 2, all of us have team goals and individual goals; my 
prayer was that God would make me defensive player of the year and 
to get 16 sacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White easily won the award in balloting by a nationwide panel of  
47 sports writers and broadcasters. He received 20 votes, far ahead 
of Minnesota tackle John Randle's six. 
</P>
<P>
	Next in the voting were Miami linebacker Zach Thomas and New  
England cornerback Ty Law with four, and Dallas cornerback Deion 
Sander, who received three votes despite missing the final month of 
the season with a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiving one vote each were end Jason Taylor and cornerback Sam  
Madison of Miami; Minnesota linebacker Dwayne Rudd; Pittsburgh 
linebacker Levon Kirkland; Tampa Bay linebacker Derrick Brooks; 
Seattle end Michael Sinclair; Green Bay safety LeRoy Butler; New 
York Giants end Michael Strahan; San Diego linebacker Junior Seau; 
and Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	White began playing pro football in the USFL and spent 14  
seasons in the NFL. He says he has no fear of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people who don't have a purpose, they end up  
dying twice,'' White said. ``They don't know what they're going to 
do. I think that's why among ex-athletes, the divorce rate is so 
high because they left the game with no purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a purpose, No. 1 my family. My wife and my kids. I want  
to spend more time with my kids. I want to go to their basketball 
games more. Go to their band concerts more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in five years, he can head for Canton and the Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
	White is the first Packer to win the honor since the defensive  
player award began in 1973. Last year's winner was San Francisco 
tackle Dana Stubblefield, who signed with Washington as a free 
agent and had a mediocre, injury-riddled season.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Ready To Woo Holmgren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The immediate future of the Baltimore Ravens  
could be determined Saturday, when owner Art Modell gets his one 
solid chance to convince Green Bay Packers coach Mike Holmgren to 
join the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of Nov. 6, 1995, when Modell announced his  
intention to bring the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore, it, just 
might turn out to be the most important day in the history of the 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens hope Holmgren will replace Ted Marchibroda, fired  
last week after compiling a 16-31-1 record in three seasons as 
Baltimore's first and only head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing Holmgren, who has led Green Bay to two Super Bowls and  
six straight trips to the postseason, would be a major coup for 
Modell, who also expects to meet with Pittsburgh Steelers defensive 
coordinator Jim Haslett in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gearing up for what we hope is a productive weekend,''  
Modell said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren clearly is the man the Ravens covet most, far more than  
the other finalists: Haslett, Minnesota Vikings offensive 
coordinator Brian Billick and Jacksonville offensive coordinator 
Chris Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody would like to have Mike Holmgren on their side,''  
Modell said. ``I'm anxious to see him; I hope he likes us and we 
like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren probably would assume the duties of coach and general  
manager, which would infringe upon the responsibility of director 
of player personnel Ozzie Newsome. But Newsome knows the addition 
of Holmgren, 84-42 in seven seasons in Green Bay, would be a 
substantial addition to the entire organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he would be great to have here,'' Newsome said.  
``Are we impressed with what he's done? Absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore will be the second stop in a rapid three-city tour for  
Holmgren, who is in the midst of a 21-day stretch in which he must 
decide whether to keep his current job or sign with Seattle, 
Baltimore or Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's current contract with Green Bay contains an escape  
clause that gives him until Jan. 25 to take a job as a coach and 
general manager somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't make a decision until he's visited all three cities.  
That's good news for the Ravens -- former San Francisco 49ers coach 
George Seifert signed with the Carolina Panthers before Newsome and 
Modell got a chance to make their pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have liked the opportunity to have George Seifert sit  
down and talk with us, but we realize other teams are in the same 
situation as we are,'' Newsome said. ``George liked what he heard 
in Carolina and took the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Holmgren is thought to be leaning toward staying in  
Green Bay or taking the title of coach and general manager of the 
Seahawks, Modell hopes to sway the 50-year-old coach in another 
direction -- east. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell said last week that money will not be an object in his  
search for a new coach. He will have to pay big bucks to get 
Holmgren, who has been offered an extension from the Packers at 
nearly $4 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me to leave, it has to be something very special, it has  
to be exactly right,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks are loaded with young talent, have a new stadium  
planned for 2002 and are willing to draw talent from the free-agent 
market. But the Ravens plan to convince Holmgren that Baltimore is 
the right place for him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Mike Holmgren sits down with Art and his family and sees  
the passion and commitment he has for the franchise,'' Newsome 
said, ``I think that will make it a level playing field.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Soars 200 To Pass 9,500 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were barrelling higher in mid-afternoon  
trading, pushing major indexes into record high territory, as 
investors continued to pour cash into the market. The Dow 
industrials, Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's composite indexes were 
all at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 200.31 at 9,511.50, crossing the 9,500 threshold for the first 
time and handily beating its previous closing record high of 
9,374.27 set on Nov. 23. Half an hour later, it had fallen back 
just a bit, and was up 185.12 at 9,496.31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 24.50 at 1,269.24 this  
afternoon, on track to set its second consecutive record. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 62.06 at 2,313.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were pushed higher partly by investors who cleaned out  
their portfolios of money-losing stocks late last year and now have 
cash to invest. Other investors are beginning to get 1998 bonuses 
that they are now pumping into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that heartened traders and analysts, they were  
expanding Tuesday's shopping spree in computer-related stocks to 
nearly all big companies with well-known names. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Dow industrial components were led higher by American  
Express, up 4 1/16 at 103 3/8. That was followed by General Motors, up 
3 7/8 at 78 1/2, amid strong December auto sales numbers. Dow component 
Citigroup was up 3 1/16 at 54 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Dow components, only Disney was down, off 3/8 at 30  
3/16, after chairman Michael Eisner said in a letter to 
shareholders that new initiatives had dragged down the 
entertainment company's earnings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2 to 1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at 654.6 million 
shares and up sharply from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The breadth of the rally caught traders' attention and fueled  
optimism that it could continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are starting to say, `well,' this is much more  
significant here, there's a lot better participation,'' said 
William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald in 
Stamford, Conn. ``I see no end, in the nearterm, in sight and it's 
going to be very difficult to determine where the bubble gets 
pricked, or how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, the Commerce Department said sales of new  
single-family homes soared 7.6 percent to a record in November, 
propelled by low interest rates, unseasonable warmth and a strong 
economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Iraqi Planes in Dogfight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and British warplanes patrolling the  
``no-fly'' zones over Iraq may well be facing ``a period of 
challenge'' from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the Clinton 
administration says. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Saddam Hussein, defiance is his only strategy,'' Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters at the Pentagon, discussing 
the third clash with Iraqi forces within the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, four U.S. Air Force and Navy jets fired on -- and  
missed -- four Iraqi MiGs testing the no-fly zone over southern 
Iraq. It was the first such air confrontation in more than six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqis ``beat a hasty retreat'' following the early morning  
clashes, which occurred in two separate incidents just 15 minutes 
and 62 miles apart, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, between 13 to 15 Iraqi aircraft attempted to violate the  
no-fly zone in a rash of eight incursions that Bacon termed 
``suspicious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was the third military confrontation with Iraq  
within the past two weeks over enforcing the no-fly zones in 
northern and southern Iraq. Iraq considers the restrictions illegal 
and has vowed to defy them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going through a period of challenge,'' Bacon said when  
asked about the rash of incidents. Twice last week, U.S. warplanes 
fired on Iraqi surface-to-air missile batteries in separate 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	While dismissing any ability to ``psychoanalyze'' Saddam, Bacon  
said the moves could have been aimed at luring U.S. and British 
aircraft within shooting range of surface-to-air missile batteries, 
or may be marks of his ``frustration'' in the wake of the surprise 
December air attacks by U.S. and British forces. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, said he believed the current provocations by Iraqi 
aircraft reflected the fact that ``they lost the initiative which 
we feel they are trying to regain now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the U.S.  
missiles were fired ``at a distance,'' and were near the limit at 
which they are effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., whether the United States  
shouldn't try to destroy the airfields used by Iraqi aircraft, 
Shelton said: ``We have those kinds of plans on the shelf'' should 
President Clinton decide to take such action. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shelton sidestepped a direct question on whether the United  
States should try to target Saddam directly. 
</P>
<P>
	As to casualties, he said that civilian casualties were slight.  
He said that as many as 800 of Saddam's Republican Guard members 
were killed in the attacks, giving the first such estimate of Iraqi 
military casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, Bacon said the first incident occurred at 2:15  
a.m. EST southwest of Baghdad and involved two U.S. Air Force F-15s 
that fired off one Sparrow and three AIM-120 missiles at two Iraqi 
MiG-25s. The Iraqis had turned their radar on the American 
aircraft, prompting the missile firings, Bacon said. Such a use of 
radar can indicate intent to attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second event, two U.S. Navy F-14s fired on two other  
MiG-25s, using two AIM-54 Phoenix missiles. That incident took 
place southeast of Baghdad after the Iraqi planes ``dipped'' into 
the no-fly zone, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the Iraqi planes turned quickly after being fired upon,  
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi planes ``confronted  
and clashed with the aggressive British and American aircraft'' 
before ``the aggressive aircraft withdrew. All of our air force 
planes returned to base safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said U.S. and British forces will continue banning  
Iraqi flights in the restricted zones, arguing that Saddam 
Hussein's military still represents a threat to minority Kurds in 
the north and Shiite Muslims in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Pentagon official said the air-to-air altercation was  
the first in Iraq since Dec. 27, 1992, when a U.S. F-16 shot down 
an Iraqi MiG-25. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said one Iraqi MiG-23 apparently crashed in attempting to  
return to its base, but it wasn't immediately clear whether that 
aircraft had been one of those that had flown southward. It is 
possible the MiG crashed because it ran out of gas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash evoked harsh words from the State Department spokesman  
James P. Rubin, who said Saddam was ``lashing out as a result of 
his isolated condition,'' because he has ``no support in the Arab 
world. He has no support around the world.''

<HEADLINE> Teens Charged With Molesting Sister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two teen-age brothers were charged with sexually  
molesting their 8-year-old half sister after claiming they got the 
idea from watching an episode on incest on ``The Jerry Springer 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, ages 13 and 15, were arrested Dec. 11 by police in  
nearby Hollywood and charged with sexual battery and lewd and 
lascivious acts. Police said the older boy confessed to having 
intercourse with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This 15-year-old showed no emotion, he showed no concern, he  
showed no remorse,'' Detective Curt Navarro said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarro said he asked the older boy, ``How did you learn this?''  
The teen responded that he saw a Springer show on incest, the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was crying when she recently told a teacher about the  
alleged abuse, and the school notified police. The victim said the 
abuse had been going on for a while and would occur after her 
mother left for work, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was assaulted on at least 10 separate occasions,  
according to a police report. She is back home with her mother and 
receiving counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Shafran, a publicist for the Springer show, said she could  
not recall any show on the topic of incest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never had a show that is even remotely close to this  
situation, and unfortunately there are situations in the world for 
which we are blamed,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed last year in Connecticut, a 16-year-old boy  
claimed the show inspired a fight that left him with a broken jaw 
and other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, four girls in New York City were suspended after  
beating their sixth-grade teacher for refusing to turn on the show 
on a classroom television. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will decide whether the 15-year-old boy will be  
charged as an adult. His younger brother is charged as a juvenile.

<HEADLINE> Shaun Alexander To Skip NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Running back Shaun Alexander, Alabama's  
leading rusher, is passing up a chance at the NFL draft and will 
stay at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I wanted to do is be happy wherever I am,''  
said Alexander, who was accompanied by his mother and brother at a 
news conference today. ``If I go to the NFL, I've got to be a 
grownup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he talked with both the Cincinnati Bengals and  
Cleveland Browns organizations and was told he would go ``very 
high'' in the draft if he came out early. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, Alexander decided: ``I want to have fun.''  
</P>
<P>
	Had he decided to enter the draft, Alexander would have been in  
a group of running backs that includes Heisman Trophy winner Ricky 
Williams of Texas and the Southeastern Conference's top two rushers 
from last season, James Johnson of Mississippi State and LSU's 
Kevin Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike DuBose has said Alexander has what it takes to win  
the Heisman, and the 6-foot-1, 205-pound back will continue to be 
featured in a ground game he led with 1,178 yards and 13 touchdowns 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he wasn't staying in school for personal awards.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to worry about the Heisman. I'm just going to go  
out there and play the best I can,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA and the players' union reached an  
agreement today to end the 6-month-old lockout and save what's left 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	After a secret all-night bargaining session between commissioner  
David Stern and union head Billy Hunter, the deal was struck 
sometime around 6 a.m. -- just 29 hours before the league's Board of 
Governors was set to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	A season of about 50 games will begin the first week of  
February, according to a source close to the talks. The six-year 
deal, with an NBA option for a seventh year, still must be put on 
paper and ratified before the lockout will officially be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval is still needed from the owners and the players, and  
the process of selling the deal to those constituencies began 
almost immediately as the agreement was presented to the 
negotiating committees for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	If the union' committee approves it, it will be presented to the  
full union membership this afternoon, an NBA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors will meet Thursday to vote on  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of revenues in the fourth,  
fifth and sixth years of the agreement, a source close to the talks 
told The Associated Press. The NBA has an option for a seventh 
year, and the players would get 57 percent if it is exercised. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three years, there is no limit on the percentage of  
revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to six years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The annual allowable salary increases will be 12 percent for  
players with so-called Larry Bird rights -- those free agents 
re-signed by a team without regard to the salary cap -- and 10 
percent for others. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Changes to free agency timing rules will be phased in, with  
free agents counting 200, 250 or 300 percent against their old 
team's salary cap until that team re-signs them or renounces their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, although the exact amounts weren't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is finalized and the lockout is lifted, it will  
unleash a three- to four-week frenzy of activity with teams 
scrambling to fill rosters, make trades and sign some of the 200 
free agents on the market while also holding abbreviated training 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Michael Jordan, who may retire,  
Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, 
Rod Strickland and Damon Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it will be very busy,'' said agent Mark  
Bartelstein. ``We've got a lot of free agents, so we've got to find 
them homes and teams. Get other guys into camps. Get up and 
rolling. I'm sure I'll probably talk to a lot of teams today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide an  
estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone won. Both sides lost on it,'' Indiana  
Pacers guard Fred Hoiberg said. ``I think it will take some time to 
get the game back to where it was. Hopefully, we can get back to 
work soon and put a good product on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors had scheduled a meeting for 11  
a.m. Thursday, and Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik had 
said they would recommend canceling the rest of the season if an 
agreement wasn't reached. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players began arriving in New York on Tuesday for a  
scheduled vote on whether to support the position of their 
negotiating committee, which had recommended that players reject 
the owners' final offer. At least 200 players had been expected to 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The league already had an offer on the table allowing the union  
to reopen the agreement if any other sport's average salary 
surpasses that of NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, in effect since July 1, caused the NBA to miss  
games because of a labor dispute for the first time in its history. 
The first three months of the season had been scrapped and players 
had lost about $500 million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said  
Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz. ``Neither side is coming out of 
this thing looking good.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton To Seek More Base Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After failing two years in a row, President  
Clinton will try again to persuade Congress to let the Pentagon 
close more domestic military bases. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins  
in October, Clinton will ask Congress next month to grant authority 
to begin two new rounds of base closings starting in 2001, National 
Security Council official Robert Bell said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell would not say which -- or how many -- bases the  
administration wants to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved several rounds of base closings earlier this  
decade but since the last round in 1995 has rejected two attempts 
by the Clinton administration to further shrink the far-flung 
network of bases developed during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said it would take about a 10 percent cut in the overall  
U.S. military base structure to make it fit today's smaller 
military, which has shrunk steadily since the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	The key point, Bell said, is that the Pentagon needs to be able  
to cut its costs in order to pay for the kinds of force 
improvements that Congress says are urgently needed. ``It's going 
to be incumbent on Congress to cooperate and give us that 
authority,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hopes it can win congressional approval by  
arguing an urgent need to achieve more defense savings and by 
pointing to examples in which communities have turned the setback 
of a base closing into long-term economic gain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, the nation's top military officers pressed the  
case for more base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting rid of the excesses that we have now ... would be very  
beneficial,'' Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said 
the savings could amount to up to $15 billion over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said the administration is counting on savings from new  
base closures of $2 billion to $3 billion through 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has come under attack from many congressional  
Republicans for allowing the state of readiness of U.S.-based 
troops to deteriorate in recent years. Bell, in remarks to 
reporters at the White House, said one reason for this erosion of 
military readiness is Congress's repeated refusal to allow savings 
from new base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy for them to, just out of spite, or whatever is  
motivating this, decide not to take an obvious source of $2 billion 
or $3 billion in savings,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Defense Secretary William Cohen asked for  
congressional authority for base closings in 2001 and 2005, and in 
1997 he proposed closings in 1999 and 2001. In both cases Congress 
said no. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Congress favor more closures, but many fear a political  
backlash from the economic pain that can be experienced in 
communities dependent on the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been accused by some in Congress of having  
manipulated the 1995 base-closing process for his political 
advantage, particularly with bases in vote-rich California and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on  
Tuesday, the top military brass welcomed Clinton's announcement 
Saturday that he would seek military spending increases of more 
than $100 billion over the next six years in his new budget, 
beginning with a $12 billion boost next year, although they said 
more was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still another $30 billion to $40 billion in  
requirements that are not met,'' said Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he testified, ``it will meet our most critical needs.''  
</P>
<P>
	In his Saturday announcement on his defense budget, Clinton did  
not mention seeking more base closings.

said they would recommend canceling the rest of the season if an 
agreement wasn't reached. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players began arriving in New York on Tuesday for a  
scheduled vote on whether to support the position of their 
negotiating committee, which had recommended that players reject 
the owners' final offer. At least 200 players had been expected to 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The league already had an offer on the table allowing the union  
to reopen the agreement if any other sport's average salary 
surpasses that of NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, in effect since July 1, caused the NBA to miss  
games because of a labor dispute for the first time in its history. 
The first three months of the season had been scrapped and players 
had lost about $500 million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said  
Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz. ``Neither side is coming out of 
this thing looking good.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Misses Steel Plan Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has missed a  
congressional deadline for coming up with a plan to combat a rising 
flood of imported steel into the United States in the wake of the 
Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials insisted that the report could still  
come out this week. ``Maybe today, maybe tomorrow,'' White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart said today. Officials attributed the 
delay to President Clinton's desire to consult more fully with 
members of Congress. Clinton said he had a two-hour meeting on the 
issue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry officials and members of Congress said the delay  
reflected divisions within the administration over two camps -- one 
arguing for tough protectionist measures sought by the industry and 
its union and an opposing camp that is arguing that such measures 
would run counter to the administration's efforts to help countries 
hurt by the global financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., inserted language in the budget bill  
last fall ordering the administration to tell Congress by Tuesday 
what its plans were to cope with the sharp rise in steel imports 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	One administration official, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said the report in its present form is about 20 pages 
long and essentially is a status report showing what actions have 
been taken so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., has been urging the  
administration to initiate its own steel protection cases against a 
larger number of countries than the three cases filed by the 
industry against Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers expressed unhappiness Tuesday about the missed  
deadline and the indications the administration will shy away from 
more dramatic steps to curb imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not interested in a status report because I already know  
where we have been and where we are. I want this report to show 
where we are going,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said unless the administration takes  
more aggressive action, ``it sends a signal to the rest of the 
world to let dumping continue, which would be very damaging to the 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been split between a desire to help a key  
domestic industry and union workers whose jobs are endangered and 
concerns that raising protectionist barriers would represent a 
setback for hard-hit Asian nations and Russia. These nations are 
hoping to boost sales in the huge U.S. market to cope with severe 
recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade deficit is expected to set records this year and  
next because the Asian economic crisis has cut into American 
exports of manufactured goods and farm products while boosting 
imports, in part because the currency devaluations in many 
countries have made foreign products cheaper for U.S. consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for action out of the administration, not  
reports,'' said William Klinefelter, Washington representative of 
the United Steelworkers of America union. He said 5,000 
steelworkers have already gotten layoff notices and another 20,000 
are working reduced hours because of increased imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has until Feb. 12 to issue a preliminary  
ruling in the original dumping cases. Many expect the industry will 
file its own cases against more countries if, as expected, Commerce 
issues a favorable ruling next month.

<HEADLINE> NYC Ballet Marks 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One night in 1948, dancing bodies filled a  
Manhattan stage and leaped into the avant-garde. It was the birth 
of the New York City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning-fast feet. Arms cutting clean through the air, like  
propelled feathers. A woman, suspended high above a man, seemingly 
weightless. 
</P>
<P>
	These heart-stopping illusions were George Balanchine's  
choreography for his company's opening triple bill: ``Concerto 
Barocco,'' ``Orpheus'' and ``Symphony in C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American dance would never be the same again.  
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-born genius who was the century's most influential  
choreographer had pushed the 300-year-old classical idiom to the 
edge of symmetry -- and slightly over. The company he created in New 
York City that night has gloried in that precarious balance for 
five decades since. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, to mark its golden anniversary, the New York City  
Ballet opened its season Nov. 24 by repeating the three pieces from 
Oct. 11, 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance at Lincoln Center ended with a mass bow by 250  
men and women who had danced with the prestigious troupe. Showered 
with gold confetti were veterans like Russian-born Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, American Indian dancer Maria Tallchief, matinee idol 
Jacques d'Amboise, the sparkling Suzanne Farrell, and Arthur 
Mitchell, founder of the Dance Theater of Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City Ballet is now under the artistic direction of  
a onetime star dancer, Peter Martins. This winter and spring, it is 
offering 100 works that still push the artistic envelope, and 
clearly follow in Balanchine's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York State Theater at Lincoln Center ``is still the most  
creative place in the world of ballet,'' said Martins, who is 
choreographing a ballet to music by jazz composer Wynton Marsalis 
to premiere in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Martins, an elegant, 52-year-old Dane, danced as many as 14  
ballets a week under Balanchine, including a memorable lead in 
``Apollo.'' To be the world's best, Martins said, Balanchine sought 
performers who could go in any stylistic direction. 
</P>
<P>
	He steeped them in the classic traditions of his youth in  
imperial St. Petersburg, Russia, where he absorbed such works as 
Tchaikovsky's ``Swan Lake'' and the choreography of Marius Petipa. 
``Classicism is enduring because it is impersonal,'' Balanchine 
once told a British critic. 
</P>
<P>
	His ``Concerto Barocco,'' danced to music by Bach, and the  
dazzling ``Symphony in C,'' set to Bizet, have endured with a 
neoclassicism that relies on music, rather than story lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Balanchine also used the music of an innovative fellow Russian,  
Igor Stravinsky. Both men reveled in classical discipline -- and 
loved to break it. 
</P>
<P>
	Balanchine entertained audiences with ``classic steps turned  
inside out and upside down, retimed, reproportioned, rerouted, 
girls dancing hard and boys soft,'' dance critic Edwin Denby said 
in describing the master's joyous fancy. In ``Concerto Barocco,'' a 
dancer lowers his suspended partner to the ground on her pointed 
toe, like ``a deliberate and powerful plunge into a wound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This classicism, with a knife in it, was Balanchine's legacy to  
ever-changing American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	When he founded the company with the wealthy Lincoln Kirstein,  
Balanchine also embraced an American choreographic voice, Jerome 
Robbins, of Broadway fame. For City Ballet, Robbins created 
modernistic works like ``Afternoon of a Faun'' and ``The Cage.'' 
Over the decades, Kirstein added an array of other great 
choreographers, including Frederick Ashton, Martha Graham, John 
Cranko and Antony Tudor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company's roots remained Russian-American, and the  
product was ``an American art form based on the classical ballet, 
and on a technical skill unmatched, with great speed and 
modernism,'' said Christopher Ramsey, who edited the book 
``Tributes,'' a history of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. B'' -- as disciples affectionately call Balanchine -- became  
America's ballet teacher par excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans who wanted to know how to dance knew that the way to  
express themselves was his way. Before him, Americans did old-hat 
things with ballet,'' said Francis Mason, author of the book ``I 
Remember Balanchine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, he said, Balanchine ``used the American dancers'  
special quality of energy to make a new modernism for the art. It 
was like joining the best football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On opening night this year, each member of the audience was  
handed a shot glass and a miniature bottle of vodka so Martins 
could propose a bottoms-up toast to ``Mr. B and Lincoln.'' The 
artistic triumvirate of Balanchine, Kirstein and Robbins ruled the 
company in the 1980s. Balanchine died in 1983, Kirstein in 1996 and 
Robbins last July. They were a hard act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``People said the company wouldn't last two years after  
Balanchine,'' said Martins, who became artistic co-director in 1983 
with Robbins and assumed sole directorship in 1990; he has just 
signed another five-year contract as ballet master in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an affair, or a one-night stand,'' he said with a  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	That was clear from the five decades of memories that filled a  
reunion of 1,100 former and current company members two days before 
opening night. Cries of recognition filled the atrium of the New 
York State Theater as dancers fell into each other's arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was Balanchine's fifth and last wife, dancer Tanaquil  
LeClerq, a muse for both Robbins and Balanchine until she was 
felled by polio in 1956. She had graced their ballets with wit and 
a virtuosic technique, as the figure of Sacred Love in Ashton's 
``Illuminations'' and in ``Symphony in C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To create ballets for the new millennium, Martins has invited  
latter-day dance gurus such as Mark Morris and Twyla Tharp. But 
he's also keeping alive the Russian legacy by staging a ``Swan 
Lake'' in April that combines the choreography of Balanchine, 
Petipa and another Russian master, Lev Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading a ballet company today brings in concerns beyond art.  
Martins has to address the danger of anorexia, for example, as 
dancers try to stay competitively slim. The company ``doesn't 
require a specific body type, and offers whatever guidance might be 
necessary through doctors, counselors and nutritionists,'' he said 
after a dancer at another company, the Boston Ballet, succumbed to 
an eating disorder last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the reunion banquet, the artists had cake and champagne after  
a snazzy dance medley summing up a half century of productions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were flops.  
</P>
<P>
	``You taught me that jazzy part with the plastic pieces on our  
heads and hot pants!'' retired dancer Wilhelmina Frankfurt yelled 
across the crowd at the company's current ballet mistress, Rosemary 
Dunleavy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This company is flavored with humor,'' said Ms. Frankfurt, 42,  
who now markets her own exercise method. ``The feeling is, `We've 
all been through the same war!'''

<HEADLINE> Medicare's Eligibility Age Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans would have to work two years longer  
or risk retiring without health insurance under a revived proposal 
to raise the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a controversial proposal, obviously,'' said Sen. John  
Breaux, D-La., chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission on 
the Future of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, an hour-long discussion at a meeting Tuesday revealed  
that many of the commission's members believe the fact that 
Americans are living longer means a higher eligibility age could 
save Medicare money with minimal disruption to people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the downsides on it,'' Breaux said. ``I think there's  
been some good discussions on how to alleviate some of the obvious 
problems that are created by increasing eligibility age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the commission, which must make recommendations for  
Medicare's future to Congress and President Clinton by March 1, has 
made no final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Without changes, Medicare is expected to face cash shortages  
starting in 2008 -- just as the nation's huge baby boom generation 
is nearing retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and Clinton would have to enact any changes to the  
program, which now provides health insurance to more than 38 
million elderly and disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux helped achieve Senate passage in 1997 of a proposal to  
raise Medicare's eligibility age, only to see it rejected as too 
controversial in later negotiations with the House and Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tuesday's meeting, only two of the 17 commission members  
expressed strong reservations about the basic idea of raising 
Medicare's eligibility age. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would slowly raise the Medicare eligibility age to  
67, increasing it by about a month each year. People now age 62 and 
older would not be affected. People 38 and younger would feel the 
full brunt of the change, not getting Medicare benefits until age 
67. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would be the same as the eligibility-age hike  
Congress approved more than a decade ago for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., and Samuel H. Howard, chairman of a  
Nashville, Tenn., company that operates health plans, said they 
feared such a change would hurt people who work at jobs requiring 
physical labor and minorities with lower life expectancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Others suggested those problems could be avoided by letting at  
least some people younger than age 67 pay an extra fee to enroll in 
Medicare early. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to raise the age, I think there's general  
agreement to have a way to allow those who would have had it 
earlier to get it,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the 
commission's co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders have promised only to hold hearings on the  
commission's recommendations. Clinton administration officials also 
have also declined to comment on specific proposals until after the 
recommendations are formally submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, however, has proposed opening Medicare to people as  
young as 55 who are willing to pay $300 to $400 a month to buy into 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Some commission members said that would go too far. ``We don't  
want to create ... incentives to retire early that don't exist 
now,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls have shown that the idea of gradually  
raising the Medicare eligibility age is widely unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee that every member of Congress is going to think  
about a 30-second ad of this,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. But he 
added: ``Of all the choices we've got to try to save money, this 
one may be the easiest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although raising the retirement age would save Medicare an  
estimated $620 billion over the next 30 years, that still would not 
be enough to keep the program afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members are also talking about additional changes to  
control costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Today they were scheduled to discuss how Medicare might be  
converted to a system in which private health insurance companies 
compete for government contracts to provide a basic package of 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the government pays most Medicare beneficiaries'  
medical bills directly, a system that critics say allows providers 
to inflate costs.

<HEADLINE> House Picks Hastert As Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid pomp and extraordinary gestures of  
partisan amity, the 106th Congress convened Wednesday with a new 
House speaker urging an end to the ``pool of bitterness'' that has 
engulfed lawmakers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the turbulent days behind us, debate on the merits often  
gave way to personal attacks,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
told his colleagues in a 17-minute acceptance speech. ``Some here 
have felt slighted, insulted or ignored. That is wrong, and that 
will change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even as the burly former high school teacher and wrestling  
coach exchanged a warm handshake and conciliatory words with House 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., there were foreshadowings of 
problems ahead. These include the looming Senate impeachment trial 
of President Clinton, the Republicans' razor-thin House margin, 
incredibly complex issues such as revamping Social Security and the 
2000 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the obstacles, the Senate did little public business  
other than swearing in its members Wednesday, as its real work 
proceeded behind the scenes. There, in closed meetings, the two 
parties argued bitterly over procedures to be used in the 
impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Hastert, elevated from obscurity during a tumultuous  
period for GOP leaders, would countenance no talk of stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after his election as speaker by a 220-205 party-line  
vote, he insisted the GOP would advance an agenda that also 
includes tax cuts, spending restraint and bolstering schools and 
defense. He promised to do it while working to improve 
congressional relationships frayed by the impeachment fight and 
other battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of  
bitterness,'' he said. ``They can be found in an environment in 
which we trust one another's words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a gesture of good will, Hastert delivered his remarks after  
handing Gephardt the House's gavel. And Gephardt, who had an icy 
relationship with Hastert's predecessor, the retired Newt Gingrich 
of Georgia, suggested that the two leaders and their wives visit 
each other's congressional districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's bury the hatchet,'' the Democrat said, and added:  
``Let's put to rest the poisonous politics which have infected this 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Constitution prescribes, the new Congress swung to life  
at noon, each chamber in its own, idiosyncratic way. 
</P>
<P>
	With Vice President Al Gore in his role as Senate president  
administering the oaths, the staid Senate solemnly swore in the 34 
newly elected and re-elected senators. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the Capitol, the boisterous House was awash  
with members greeting each other and the squeals of children as the 
chamber elected its speaker and swore in its members. 
</P>
<P>
	The conciliatory words by Hastert and Gephardt came as public  
opinion polls show many voters hold Congress in low regard. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a CBS News poll released Wednesday, 42 percent of  
Americans expect this Congress to accomplish less than usual, while 
only 38 percent think it will achieve more. And 51 percent of the 
public disapprove of the way Congress is doing its job, while just 
41 percent approve. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides that, Hastert must run a House the GOP dominates by just  
222-211, plus a Democrat-leaning independent. That is the slimmest 
House margin since the 1952 elections, when Republicans held a 
221-213 edge, plus an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to get anything done, it really has to be  
bipartisan,'' said moderate Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denny Hastert has to not be held hostage by the right wing of  
the Republican Party,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass. ``I 
applaud his words, but obviously it has to be met with 
skepticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for the two parties to find common ground.  
By voice vote and with scant debate, the House eased a 4-year-old 
ban on gifts to lawmakers so it will agree with more generous 
Senate rules. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and aides had been barred from receiving even  
minor gifts from lobbyists. Lawmakers in both chambers may now 
receive gifts, including meals, worth up to $50, and accept up to 
$100 in gifts from one source per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us ... have a whole lot more important things to do  
than sit around trying to decide whether a gift of a pie or a can 
of popcorn is acceptable,'' said Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, 
chairman of the House ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the words of reconciliation, it didn't take long for  
some partisan sniping to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., took to the floor to accuse  
Republicans of ``disenfranchisement'' for continuing the historic 
bans against floor votes by delegates from U.S. territories and the 
District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., said the GOP wanted to make  
``a few powerful people very happy'' with new House rules letting 
the GOP put some limits on spending if Congress fails to approve a 
federal budget, as it did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 435-member House's only vacancy was the Georgia seat held by  
Gingrich, who resigned last November after Republicans lost five 
seats on Election Day. Gingrich spent the day on the West Coast, 
said his former spokeswoman Christina Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	All but invisible was Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., whom  
Republicans picked to replace Gingrich but who stepped down after 
admitting to marital infidelity. Livingston, who plans to leave 
Congress this year, spent much of the day in a rear corner of the 
House chamber.

<HEADLINE> Inflation-Index Notes' Yield Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yields on 10-year, inflation-indexed notes  
rose in Wednesday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield was 3.898 percent, up from 3.650 percent at the last  
auction on Oct. 7 and the highest since the government began 
selling 10-year, inflation-indexed notes in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the government's ninth auction of inflation-indexed  
securities and the fifth at the 10-year maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the yield, owners of inflation-indexed notes  
receive an adjustment to principal twice a year. For instance, if 
inflation were 2 percent in a year, the principal of a $1,000 note 
would increase to $1,020. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of $8 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling  
$25 billion.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Jump at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices jumped Thursday morning on  
optimism triggered by a rally earlier on Wall Street. The dollar 
edged higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average climbed 319.44 points, or 2.37 percent,  
to finish the morning session at 13,787.90. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 235.72 points, or 1.78 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.88 yen in late morning, up 0.36 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its level of 112.66 yen in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices advanced after the Dow  
Jones industrial average surged 2.5 percent to close at a record 
high of 9,544.97 points on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip exporters such as Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp.  
were among early gainers amid expectations the rally on Wall Street 
indicates continued strong sales in the crucial American market, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section picked up 23.49 points, or 2.22 percent, to 1,082.25. 
The TOPIX closed up 10.43 points, or 0.99 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices rose in early trading  
Thursday on optimism triggered by an overnight surge in stocks 
traded in the United States. The dollar gained ground against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 249.90  
points, or 1.86 percent, to 13,718.22 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Wednesday, the average had closed up 235.72 points, or 
1.78 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.94 yen in early trading, up 0.42 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
112.66 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices advanced after the Dow  
Jones industrial average rallied 2.5 percent to close at a record 
high of 9,544.97 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Share prices are higher across the board,'' said Sachio  
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities 
Co., noting some issues were untraded as buy orders overwhelmed 
sell offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip exporters such as Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp.  
were among the biggest winners amid expectations the rally on Wall 
Street indicates continued strong sales in the crucial American 
market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of computer chip makers such as Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba  
Corp. also soared after the Nihon Keizai business daily reported 
Thursday that prices for semiconductors have begun bottoming out, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section picked up 20.65 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,079.41. 
The TOPIX closed up 10.43 points, or 0.99 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar gained ground against  
the yen after the strong performance of shares traded in New York 
overnight, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some cautioned that the rise in Japanese stocks could blunt  
the U.S. currency's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was lower against the dollar in thin  
trading, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at dlrs 1.1631 in early trading, down from  
dlrs 1.1740 in Tokyo late Wednesday, but above its level of dlrs 
1.1592 overnight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.815 percent from Wednesday's finish of 
1.820 percent, pushing its price up to 99.87 yen from 99.83 yen.

<HEADLINE> Gun Industry Accused of Negligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing handgun manufacturers of  
letting guns fall into criminals' hands went to trial Wednesday 
with relatives of seven shooting victims using a legal strategy 
that proved so effective against Big Tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is being closely watched by several cities that are  
trying to recover the costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a simple case about accepting responsibility,''  
victims' attorney Elisa Barnes said in opening statements in 
federal court. The gun industry ``has effectively taken a 
head-in-the-sand approach to the problem of gun violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry lawyer Anne Kimball countered by saying the lawsuit is  
an attempt to ``just blame someone else for pulling the trigger, to 
shift the blame away from the cold-blooded killers in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action lawsuit was brought in 1995 by Freddie  
Hamilton, a Brooklyn woman whose son was gunned down in 1993, and 
other relatives of shooting victims. It seeks unspecified damages 
from an industry that generates sales of $2 billion to $3 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Like some of the lawsuits brought against Big Tobacco, this one  
accuses an industry of negligently marketing a legal product. The 
lawsuit charges that about 30 gun manufacturers and 15 gun 
distributors oversupply certain markets where gun laws are lax, 
knowing the excess weapons end up in the hands of criminals in 
states with strict controls like New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has the means to reduce the threat of its product --  
but not the will, Ms. Barnes said. ``This is not a gun control 
case,'' she said. ``But it is about self-control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those expected to testify is Stephen Fox, the sole  
survivor among the seven victims. Fox, who still has a bullet 
lodged in his head, was shot by a neighbor who had bought the 
handgun off the black market, Ms. Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to ask you why was that gun so easily available, out  
of a trunk, on a street in Queens,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said manufacturers should not be held accountable  
for the criminal sale and use of an already heavily regulated item. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns used in crimes are bad -- we're all in agreement on  
that,'' Kimball said. ``Nonetheless, guns are a legal, legitimate 
product in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Beretta USA Corp., Ruger &AMP;  
Co., Accu-Tek and the other defendants also complained that the 
families have never conclusively linked the weapons used to shoot 
their relatives to specific manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein is allowing the families  
to argue that the industry as a whole creates a widespread risk 
with indiscriminate marketing -- a concept know as collective 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley used similar logic in filing a  
$433 million lawsuit against the firearms industry in November. The 
suit accuses gun makers of saturating his city with more guns than 
could ever be sold to law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans is pursuing a similar lawsuit. Other cities,  
including Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, are considering 
taking gun makers to court.

<HEADLINE> Strom Thurmond Relinquishes Gavel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., relinquished the  
gavel of the Senate Armed Services Committee chairmanship on 
Tuesday to Sen. John Warner, R-Va., and cautioned: ``Unlike old 
generals, I do not intend to fade away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, who turned 96 last month, said he plans to remain  
active on the committee. With that, he stood and changed seats with 
Warner, 71, who had been next-in-line while Thurmond was chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond announced last year that he was stepping aside as  
committee chairman. He has served on the panel for 40 years, the 
last four of them as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner immediately began his tenure by convening a hearing on  
the state of the nation's military readiness. His witnesses were 
the nation's top military service chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War and Navy  
secretary in the Nixon administration, had warm words for Thurmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've been a big brother to me...And you will serve as an  
inspiration to me and the other members of this committee for many 
years to come,'' said Warner, a Navy secretary in the Nixon 
administration. Thurmond fought in World War II and retired from 
the Army Reserve as a major general. 
</P>
<P>
	``This committee has a long tradition of a bipartisan approach  
to national security. I know you will carry on that tradition and 
make great contributions to the committee and the nation,'' said 
Thurmond. He and Warner were given a standing ovation by the rest 
of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, who has never been reluctant to express his views on  
the attractiveness of women, regardless of the setting, also 
welcomed new members to the panel in characteristic fashion. Noting 
that Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., was among four new arrivals, 
Thurmond observed: ``We've got some pretty women on here this time.

<HEADLINE> Three Old Pals Head for Cooperstown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball's Hall of Fame Class of 1999 -- Nolan  
Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount -- spent a lifetime competing 
against each other, one firing fastballs, the other two trying to 
time them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday as the three posed in Hall of Fame shirts and hats,  
they recalled the duels, the good moments and the bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I faced Nolan, he was with California,'' Brett  
said. ``I was batting seventh, behind Jim Wohlford. He hit Jim in 
the ribs and the ball seemed to stick there for a minute before it 
fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim was trying to breathe and he couldn't. Then I came up and  
took three pitches, three strikes. That was good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pitches were all fastballs because that was what Ryan threw,  
the pitch he rode to 324 victories and a record seven no-hitters 
and 5,714 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, who had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 20-year career  
with the Kansas City Royals, went 29-for-101 lifetime against Ryan. 
That was better than Yount, who had 3,142 career hits but only 16 
in 69 swings against Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I faced both of them when they were rookies,'' Ryan said. ``I  
remember Robin was only 18 but he choked up and stood up on the 
plate. You couldn't intimidate him. He'd hang in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount frowned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't intimidated?'' he said. ``I must have hid it well. It  
took three or four years for me to catch up with that fastball. If 
you didn't turn it up a notch, you were in big trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan and Brett, who won three batting championships, were each  
named on more than 98 percent of the 497 ballots cast by 10-year 
members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's 98.79 percent was the second-highest in history, trailing  
only Tom Seaver's 98.84 in 1992. Brett received 98.19 percent, 
trailing only Seaver, Ryan and Ty Cobb's 98.23 in 1936's first 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryan-Brett-Yount rookie sweep marked the first time three  
first-year candidates had been elected since Cobb, Babe Ruth, 
Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson comprised the 
first class at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, in Kansas City, and Yount, in Milwaukee, spent their  
entire careers in small markets -- something that may not be 
possible in the current baseball economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the end of his career, Yount said he thought about leaving  
the Brewers. He had been to just one World Series, batting .414 in 
the seven-game loss to St. Louis in 1982. He wanted a chance at 
another postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came close to leaving Milwaukee after 1989,'' he said. ``I  
was a free agent, not sure how much longer I would play. I was 
close to signing with California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount was inundated by mail pleading with him to stay. It  
affected his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pressure to stay,'' he said. ``The more I  
looked at it, the more I thought it was the right thing to do. How 
much the people of Wisconsin wanted me to stay was the deciding 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan never got a chance to stay with his first team, the New  
York Mets. After four spotty seasons, he was traded to California 
and launched one of the greatest power-pitching careers in baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 324 wins and 5,714 strikeouts hadn't gotten him into the  
Hall of Fame, the seven no-hitters certainly would have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably pitched better games when things didn't go as  
well,'' he said of the no-hitters. ``I wasn't a no-hit pitcher 
coming up. I pitched one in Little League and one in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I pitched the first one against Kansas City, no one was  
more surprised than me. The second and third time through the 
batting order, the advantage is with the hitters because they've 
seen you pitch and they have a better feel for what you're throwing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one in 1973 against Detroit, warming up everything was  
going right. I could put the ball right where I wanted it. I said 
to Tom Morgan, the pitching coach, `If I ever pitch another one, 
this could be the day.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And it was.

<HEADLINE> False Teeth Maker Cited in Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department on Tuesday accused the  
nation's leading manufacturer of false teeth of illegally 
maintaining a monopoly by coercing distributors to not sell the 
products of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware, the  
government alleges that Dentsply International Inc. entered into 
agreements with dealers that prevented them from adding competing 
lines of false teeth. Dentsply refused to sell its teeth as well as 
other dental laboratory products to dealers who also used 
competitors' artificial tooth lines, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Justice Department, the arrangements affected  
more than 80 percent of the nation's tooth distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentsply, headquartered in York, Pa., sells about 70 percent of  
the artificial teeth used in the United States, a market share it 
has kept for more than a decade, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Artificial teeth comprise the single most expensive components  
of a denture. Dental laboratories use the teeth to make the more 
than $500 million in dentures they sell annually to dentists. These 
reach about 10 million consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Klein, assistant attorney general for the Justice  
Department's antitrust division, said the restrictive arrangements 
enforced by Dentsply reduced competition and raised the price of 
artificial teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Dentsply's anticompetitive acts, there would have been  
more competition in the artificial teeth markets,'' Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Dentsply could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The complaint alleges that in 1987, after foreign competitors  
tried to build networks to distribute their goods, Dentsply begin 
setting up the restrictive agreements with the independent dealers 
who supply teeth to dental laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangements have deterred domestic and foreign firms from  
entering the market and have prevented them from competing 
effectively, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department indicated last month that it would  
challenge the restrictive agreements. Dentsply asked a court to 
rule that its practices were legal. In Tuesday's suit, the 
department filed a motion seeking to dismiss Dentsply's December 
action.

<HEADLINE> Metallica, Orchestra To Collaborate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The heavy metal band Metallica has a new  
gig with an unlikely collaborator: the San Francisco Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 symphony members will back the band and composer  
Michael Kamen for two performances of all-Metallica songs at the 
Berkeley Community Theater April 21-22. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamen, who has provided orchestration for artists such as David  
Bowie, Eric Clapton and Pink Floyd, says the Metallica project is 
no joke and has been in the works for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to be the easy-listening version of  
Metallica,'' Kamen said Wednesday. ``The idea is to have Metallica 
be Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony be the San Francisco 
Symphony. I think there's more in common than there are 
differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What to wear when the metal crowd meets the black-tie bunch?  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe Metallica will be in black tie and the orchestra will be  
in ...,'' began drummer Lars Ulrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black leather!'' chimed in lead guitarist Kirk Hammett.

<HEADLINE> Report: Volvo Mulling Car Spin-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Volvo, the Swedish automotive company, has hired a  
U.S. investment bank to explore a possible spin-off of its car 
division, the London-based Financial Times reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-based Ford Motor Co., Italy's Fiat and Germany's  
Volkswagen have all been named as possible bidders for the business 
-- valued at 3 billion to 3.4 billion pounds ($4.8 billion to $5.4 
billion), the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional cash reserves would allow Volvo to expand in  
other areas. Chief executive Leif Johansson has said he would like 
to grow the company's truck, bus and construction equipment 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo, which sold slightly fewer than 400,000 cars in 1998, is  
one of the world's smallest independent car makers and has 
acknowledged that it has become increasingly difficult to finance 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo, which declined to comment to the newspaper, has been at  
the center of much merger speculation recently. Most of the rumors 
have centered on a merger involving the whole group, leading to a 
25 percent rise in Volvo's shares over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the company told the Financial Times there were  
no assurances a deal would be announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street investment bank, which was not identified, has  
proposed a number of options including outright sale of the 
division, a partial sale or a joint venture, the paper reported.

<P>
	SIMPSONVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- A Hillcrest High School basketball  
player collapsed on the court and died, the second time that 
happened at the school in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Devin Antonio Pyles, a 15-year-old sophomore, was running laps  
Monday night during junior varsity practice at a nearby middle 
school when he got short of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greenville County coroner's office said Pyles collapsed  
shortly after 6 p.m. and died about 1 1/2 hours later at Hillcrest 
Hospital of cardiac arrhythmia, a congenital heart defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene Pyles Wilson said her son collapsed twice while playing  
ball last year, but he was cleared in a required physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know what to tell other parents. Because you  
can tell them ... take your child and have them seen, checked out, 
and I did that, and my son is not here,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1996, Hillcrest junior Brandon Warren collapsed and  
died during a game. He also had cardiac arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greenville County School District requires athletes to  
complete a health assessment questionnaire and pass a physical 
before they can practice or play in games, spokesman Oby Lyles 
said.

<HEADLINE> Matenopoulos Leaving 'The View' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Debbie Matenopoulos, the frequently lampooned  
bubbly blonde on ``The View,'' is out as the show's youngest 
co-host. 
</P>
<P>
	She won't be returning as one of the ABC program's full-time  
hosts, co-executive producer Barbara Walters told viewers 
Wednesday. Matenopoulos, 24, ``is looking into doing a situation 
comedy and is working on a book about young people,'' said Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	``My co-hosts and I want to say how important Debbie has been to  
the success of `The View,''' Walters said in a separate statement. 
``She is an adorable girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matenopoulos said in a statement: ``I owe everything to Barbara  
Walters for being like a mother to me and for giving me the 
opportunity of a lifetime that I'll never forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sketches on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' have portrayed  
Matenopoulos as an airhead. A 1996 college graduate, she was a 
$500-a-week MTV production assistant when Walters hired her. 
</P>
<P>
	A new group of twentysomethings will get on-air tryouts for the  
job beginning next week. In addition to Walters, who appears on the 
show several times weekly, the show's hosts are Meredith Vieira, 
Star Jones and Joy Behar.

<HEADLINE> Panel Prepares Medicare Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of a Medicare reform commission said  
Wednesday they're preparing broad proposals -- including raising the 
eligibility age and improving prescription drug coverage -- that 
they believe the panel might agree on before a March 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will present a structured proposal ... that we think the  
majority of the commission could support,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas, 
R-Calif., who heads the National Bipartisan Commission on the 
Future of Medicare along with Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members, however, are far from reaching any final  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some even asked Thomas and Breaux to consider pushing back the  
panel's deadline for making recommendations to Congress and 
President Clinton -- in part because of Clinton's Senate impeachment 
trial, scheduled to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For anybody to think that senators are going to be able to  
spend much time thinking about this issue ... I think is overly 
optimistic to say the least,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Five senators are among the Medicare commission's 17 members.  
The rest are House lawmakers or private health care experts. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 11 members must approve the advisory panel's final  
report suggesting changes to prevent the cash shortage expected to 
hit the nation's health care program for the elderly and disabled 
by 2008. That's just before the huge baby boom generation begins to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and Clinton would decide whether to enact any changes  
the commission recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, the panel has no analysis showing that any  
proposal it is considering -- or even all the proposals together -- 
can completely avert Medicare's looming financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Medicare administrator Bruce Vladeck, who was appointed  
to the commission by Clinton, said this week that he believes it 
will be impossible to solve Medicare's problems without a tax 
increase or some other injection of money, such as from the 
government budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a possibility the group has not yet seriously considered,  
partly because House Republican leaders required the commission 
members they appointed to swear off higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux, however, said he believes the panel is making progress  
and for now declined to delay its deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we get closer to that date and find out we need another few  
days or a couple of weeks ... we can make that decision at the 
time,'' Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and Thomas said they want to focus future discussion on  
proposals they believe have the best chance of getting 
commissioners' approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Those include raising the Medicare eligibility age slowly -- by  
about a month a year -- to 67 from 65. That would bring Medicare in 
line with a change already under way for the Social Security 
eligibility age. 
</P>
<P>
	People already age 62 or older would not be affected, and the  
full brunt of the change would be felt only by people now 38 or 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission leaders said they probably will propose that  
people who still need to -- or want to -- retire at 65 be allowed to 
buy Medicare insurance from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	They also will include proposals to improve prescription drug  
coverage for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare currently does not cover most prescriptions. Private  
supplemental insurance, known as Medigap, that many senior citizens 
buy offers only limited drug coverage and is increasingly 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Options include adding some drug coverage to Medicare, or  
requiring Medigap insurers to expand what they offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal will be to let private health insurance  
companies compete for government contracts to provide at least a 
basic package of Medicare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That would limit the governments' costs. Senior citizens could  
choose to contribute more money of their own -- or health care 
vouchers that employers could offer as a retirement benefit -- if 
they wanted additional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The current Medicare program, in which the government pays most  
people's bills directly, would remain an option. But it would 
probably have to change to compete with the private plans.

<HEADLINE> Disney's Eisner Reassures Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Eisner, his annual bonus nearly  
halved after a year of weak earnings, urged Walt Disney Co. 
shareholders on Wednesday to look beyond the company's sluggish 
growth in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner, whose performance-based bonus was slashed from $9.9  
million a year ago to $5 million, said in a letter to investors 
that costly ventures such as the new $800 million Animal Kingdom 
theme park in Florida were partly responsible for holding earnings 
growth to 4 percent in 1998. Earnings grew 48 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, like all investments that create theoretical  
opportunities in the future, they cost real money right now,'' the 
Disney chairman and chief executive officer wrote. ``In the long 
run (which is all that really matters,) we believe they will enrich 
our company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, part of the company's annual report, did not address  
the bonus cut. Other top Disney executives also got smaller awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Disney, the company's vice chairman, received $410,000, down  
from $700,000. Chief financial officer Thomas Skaggs' bonus was cut 
from $900,000 to $650,000 and chief of corporate operations Sanford 
Litvack's dropped from $1.47 million to $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner's compensation package, negotiated in 1997, includes an  
annual bonus linked to the company's stock performance. His base 
pay for 1998 was $764,423. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner's bonuses and stock options have made him one of the  
nation's most richly compensated executives. In 1997, Eisner sold 
5.4 million shares which, at the time, had a market value of $514 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonus formula will be renegotiated during 1999. The company  
requested the renegotiation under a clause that permits the bonus 
deal to be changed if Disney makes significant transactions, such 
as last November's acquisition of Infoseek Corp., according to 
documents filed Wednesday with the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to shareholders, Eisner noted that Disney launched  
an array of expensive new ventures last year. They included the 
Animal Kingdom attraction near Walt Disney World; Disney Cruise 
Line; DisneyQuest, a chain of interactive game attractions in major 
cities; the renovation of Anaheim Stadium, home of the Disney-owned 
Anaheim Angels baseball team; and the purchase of Infoseek and the 
Internet technology company Starwave. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the damage to earnings came from investments, said Linda  
Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was not one thing you could point to as the reason for  
the flat earnings. They were making a lot of investments, films 
were not doing as well as they had hoped. There was the Asia 
crisis,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of those things were short term in nature or things that  
can be changed. Asia will turn around. The film business is 
notoriously cyclical. These investments that they are making will 
eventually pay off,'' Ms. Bannister said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's going to take nine to 12 months for things to  
start to look up, but for those who are willing to be a little bit 
patient, we think now's a good opportunity to move in,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, Eisner held open the possibility of a theme park  
in China. In a visit last fall, Eisner said he was impressed by the 
large number of McDonald's restaurants in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am completely sure that the Chinese people love Mickey no  
less than Big Mac,'' he wrote. ``As evidenced by the popularity of 
McDonald's, we could be getting close to the time for a major 
Disney attraction in the world's most populous nation.''

<HEADLINE> Kris Farris Leaving UCLA for NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kris Farris, who won the Outland Trophy as  
college football's outstanding interior lineman, is passing up his 
final year of eligibility at UCLA for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Outland Trophy really helped my decision, I'm not going to  
lie about it,'' Farris said Wednesday during a news conference. 
``Injury wasn't really a big concern. I just felt like this was the 
best time to leave. I am confident this is the best decision for me 
at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farris, a 6-foot-9, 315-pound junior, said he has no idea where  
he'll be selected in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of talk, I could go anywhere from the first  
round to the seventh round,'' he said. ``That's not what's 
important to me. What's important is the opportunity to play in the 
NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farris said a significant factor in his decision to leave school  
was the fact that since he redshirted as a freshman, many players 
on his incoming freshman class, including quarterback Cade McNown, 
have completed their eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``These have been the best years of my life,'' Farris said. ``I  
don't feel like I belong here anymore. It's time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farris, who started all 35 games of his college career, said it  
took him about six months to make the decision to leave school. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old lineman said he accomplished his three goals of  
being named all0-conference, All-America and winning the Outland 
Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took him a while to come to this decision,'' coach Bob  
Toledo said. ``He took his time and made a good decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo said he made several phone calls to NFL general managers  
and player personnel people on Farris' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to give direction and guidance, I'm not here to hold  
anybody back,'' Toledo said.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA and the players' union reached an  
agreement today to end the 6-month-old lockout and save what's left 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	After a secret all-night bargaining session between commissioner  
David Stern and union head Billy Hunter, the deal was struck 
sometime around 6 a.m. -- just 29 hours before the league's Board of 
Governors was set to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners' and players' negotiating committees recommended  
approving the six-year deal, which gives the NBA an option for a 
seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	The players approved it 179-5 in a ratification vote at the  
union's law office this afternoon, a union spokesman said. The 
league's Board of Governors will vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A season of about 50 games would begin the first week of  
February, with training camps not starting before Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable,'' Milwaukee Bucks coach  
George Karl said. ``It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach. 
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I 
love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of revenues in the fourth,  
fifth and sixth years of the agreement, sources told the AP. 
Players would get 57 percent if the league exercises its option for 
the seventh year. In the first three years, there is no limit on 
the percentage of revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also means Michael Jordan must now decide whether  
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said. 
``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows  
any player to sign for 105 percent of his previous salary. That 
means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, could get about 
$34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can offer him anything close to that amount.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to five years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The annual allowable salary increases will be 12 percent for  
players with so-called Larry Bird rights -- those free agents 
re-signed by a team without regard to the salary cap -- and 10 
percent for others. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Changes to free agency timing rules will be phased in, with  
free agents counting 200, 250 or 300 percent against their old 
team's salary cap until that team re-signs them or renounces their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, although the exact amounts weren't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	No professional sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary  
before, but the NBA had been pushing for one throughout the 
lockout. The union initially refused, then suggested a luxury tax 
be charged to any owner who signed a player for more than $15 
million. The league kept holding out, and eventually the players 
relented. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is finalized and the lockout is lifted, it will  
unleash a three- to four-week frenzy of activity with teams 
scrambling to fill rosters, make trades and sign some of the 200 
free agents on the market while also holding abbreviated training 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have eight months of NBA basketball squeezed  
into four months, with trades and signings,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman,  
Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, Rod Strickland and Damon 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it will be very busy,'' said agent Mark  
Bartelstein. ``We've got a lot of free agents, so we've got to find 
them homes and teams. Get other guys into camps. Get up and 
rolling. I'm sure I'll probably talk to a lot of teams today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide an  
estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone won. Both sides lost on it,'' Indiana  
Pacers guard Fred Hoiberg said. ``I think it will take some time to 
get the game back to where it was. Hopefully, we can get back to 
work soon and put a good product on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Board of Governors had scheduled a meeting for 11  
a.m. Thursday, and Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik had 
said they would recommend canceling the rest of the season if an 
agreement wasn't reached. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players began arriving in New York on Tuesday for a  
scheduled vote on whether to support the position of their 
negotiating committee, which had recommended that players reject 
the owners' final offer. At least 200 players had been expected to 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The league already had an offer on the table allowing the union  
to reopen the agreement if any other sport's average salary 
surpasses that of NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, in effect since July 1, caused the NBA to miss  
games because of a labor dispute for the first time in its history. 
The first three months of the season had been scrapped and players 
had lost about $500 million in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said  
Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz. ``Neither side is coming out of 
this thing looking good.''

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Safety Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scott Baker was doing the kind of routine but  
risky job a lot of helicopter pilots do when he died two days 
before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was airborne in his UH-1, carrying a sling filled with  
construction materials for a soil stabilization project at a remote 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. facility in Quincy, Calif. It's the 
kind of work that is impossible for an airplane and impractical for 
land equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Without warning, the 55-year-old pilot was hit with engine  
problems. Baker steered away from a crew on the ground but crashed 
into the 34-degree water of a nearby reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
	His was among 182 helicopter crashes in the United States in  
1998, an average of one every other day. In many ways it 
highlighted the dangers and benefits of that kind of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Federal Aviation Administration, rotorcraft as  
a group have far more crashes than commercial airliners or commuter 
planes, the type of flying most people experience. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, for example, there were 176 rotorcraft accidents, or  
9.29 per 100,000 flight hours. That same year, there were 48 
commercial airliner accidents, or 0.35 per 100,000 hours, and 17 
commuter crashes, or 0.94 per 100,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The year before, in 1996, crashes of a ValuJet crash airliner in  
the Everglades, which killed 110 people, and TWA flight 800 off 
Long Island, in which 230 people died, caused widespread unease 
over FAA safety rules. Last year, for the first time, no passenger 
or crew member was killed aboard a scheduled commercial or commuter 
U.S. airliner. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Les Dorr said 1998's zero-fatality count ``was the  
result of the things that we and our industry partners have been 
doing every day to make sure that flying remains the safest form of 
transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent meeting of the National Transportation Safety  
Board, called to discuss the April 1997 crash of a corporate 
helicopter into New York's East River, the board's senior 
metallurgist described choppers thusly: ``Flying fatigue-test 
machines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spectacular accidents like the Dec. 3 crash of a TV news  
helicopter in Newark, N.J., a sight captured on tape by other news 
choppers, only reinforce the image. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the FAA says the industry can fall victim to  
misperceptions and faulty analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The category ``rotorcraft,'' for instance, includes all types of  
helicopters. They range from aircraft piloted by students to sleek 
corporate choppers and helicopters used for such challenging jobs 
as logging. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics for airplanes are more finely parsed, including  
categories for commercial planes, commuter aircraft and general 
aviation planes including training aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Baker crash showed, helicopters also are often asked to  
do the kind of tasks that can't be performed by other kinds of 
aircraft. They are jobs low to the ground, near hazards like power 
lines. Often pilots don't have the benefit of an air traffic 
controller watching them on radar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is if you are a pilot, because of the way  
helicopters are flown, there is more of a chance of having an 
accident,'' said FAA spokesman Les Dorr. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading industry group, the Helicopter Association  
International, said when it compares the accident rates for 
airliners to helicopters that ferry thousands of workers out to oil 
platforms in the Gulf of Mexico each day, the numbers are about the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	The same is true when it compares the accident rates of  
corporate airplanes and corporate helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference, the group believes, is that the public doesn't  
know a lot about helicopters, and what it does see is usually 
sensationalized, especially in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all chases and explosions,'' said Roy Resavage, the  
association's president. ``I think there is a natural curiosity and 
misunderstanding because other aircraft are more ingrained in our 
everyday lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Wright, a 25-year veteran helicopter pilot and the  
association's director of flight operations, said design 
improvements dramatically reduced the helicopter accident rate 
between the mid-1970s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, for example, helicopter users flew 1.5 million hours  
and had an accident rate of 20.6 per 100,000 hours. By 1997, the 
flight time had risen to over 2 million hours, but the rate was 
below 10 per 100,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said new advances in fuel-tank design, navigation  
equipment and passenger crash protection should further improve 
helicopter safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of aviation is really on a threshold over the next  
year of seeing some pretty dramatic (accident) reductions,'' he 
said. ``Unfortunately, when an accident occurs on your backyard, it 
gets a lot of attention. But it has to be put into perspective.''

<HEADLINE> Disney's Eisner Reassures Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Eisner's 1998 bonus was cut by nearly  
half after Walt Disney Co. registered weak earnings growth amid the 
Asian financial crisis, poor box office performance and costly new 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonus was $5 million, down from $9.9 million in 1997,  
according to Disney documents filed Wednesday with the federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney earnings grew just 4 percent in 1998, compared with 48  
percent in 1997. Eisner blamed the company's sluggish growth on big 
investments in projects such as Animal Kingdom near Walt Disney 
World in Florida and the new Disney Cruise Line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, like all investments that create theoretical  
opportunities in the future, they cost real money right now,'' the 
chairman and chief executive officer wrote in a letter published in 
the company's annual report Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consequently, during the fiscal season that was 1998, they  
helped drag down our net income. But that's the short-run story. In 
the long run (which is all that really matters,) we believe they 
will enrich our company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter did not address the bonus cut. Other top Disney  
executives also got smaller bonuses.

<HEADLINE> US To Allow More Contact With Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- In baseball-mad Cuba, one of the biggest bonuses  
of an eased U.S. embargo could be a visit by a major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a tremendous attraction,'' said Armando  
Armendares, a 31-year-old hotel worker taking part in a daily 
baseball argument in Havana's Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration announced Tuesday that it would ease  
the movement of money, athletes and scholars to Cuba. As part of 
that, the Baltimore Orioles may travel to play teams in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it would approve a proposed meeting between  
the Orioles and Cuban teams, which U.S. officials have blocked in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the proposal were sketchy for most Cubans. Officials  
said they would not comment until they had studied Clinton's 
proposal. State television mentioned the news only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	But those gathered in Central Park were thrilled by the idea of  
seeing major league baseball in Cuba after a half-century absence -- 
since the 1947 visit of the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could I not go? I'll be one of the first ones in the  
park,'' said Roman Garcia, wearing a New York Yankees cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said the games will be allowed only  
if profits go to nongovernment humanitarian aid for Cubans, not to 
Fidel Castro's government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles are expected to send representatives to Cuba as  
early as this week to negotiate arrangements for a game in Cuba and 
one in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is a wonderful medium in bringing people together.  
... In that spirit, the Orioles welcome the opportunity to play a 
part in the efforts to improve relations between the two peoples,'' 
Orioles owner Peter Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have tried to play exhibition games in Cuba since at  
least 1996, but the U.S. government has rejected the requests. 
Also, unlike some major league teams, the Orioles have no Cuban 
defectors on their roster, which might make them more acceptable to 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	A few defectors -- most recently Orlando Hernandez of the New  
York Yankees -- have made their way to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuba is a country that has ballplayers growing like grass,''  
said Garcia, 47, an unemployed driver and former amateur player. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that Cuban players will have an advantage for the  
proposed March or April meeting: They will be in end-of-season 
form, while U.S. players will be starting spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	While baseball may capture the imagination, the biggest impact  
of Tuesday's measures may be a plan to let organizations, with 
Treasury Department approval, send money to Cuban churches and 
other non-government groups. Until now, only donations of goods 
have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Roman Catholic Church had no immediate reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed rules, any American could send money to Cuba,  
not just relatives of Cubans. The $500 million to $800 million sent 
by Cubans in the United States are already Cuba's largest net 
source of foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Another measure would allow charter flights to cities other than  
Havana and from cities other than Miami. Food and farm equipment 
could be sold to nongovernment groups -- though it was unclear who, 
other than church aid groups, might be able to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirements for scholars and athletes to visit Cuba would  
be streamlined. There also would be direct mail service, if Cuba 
agrees. That would dramatically cut the month or so needed to send 
a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things that cause Cuban families to be separated a  
lot,'' Margarita Sanchez, 35, said at a Havana post office, 
clutching a postcard for a distant relative in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Judge Asks About AOL Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust case interrupted the trial Wednesday to ask a witness 
about comments by America Online's chairman that its planned deal 
with Netscape won't change Microsoft's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual exchange was a clear illustration of the judge's  
deep unease about how the pending $4.2 billion AOL-Netscape deal 
might affect the competitiveness of the nation's computer industry, 
the main issue in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that the deal, announced in November weeks into  
the Microsoft trial, illustrates that the computer industry remains 
viable and thus suggests that government intervention isn't needed 
to ensure competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interview published Wednesday in The Washington Post,  
AOL Chairman Steve Case said: ``AOL's merger with Netscape has no 
bearing on the Microsoft case. ... I have a lot of respect for 
Microsoft. I continue to live in fear of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the judge's questions, a Microsoft lawyer was  
questioning the government's final witness about AOL's purchase of 
Netscape, which sells browser software that competes directly with 
Microsoft's Windows to let people view information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that, starting in mid-1995, Microsoft  
sought to crush Netscape by using illegal business tactics, in part 
because it feared the popular browser software might one day 
displace the importance of its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Justice Department lawyer David Boies called the  
potential deal's impact on the antitrust case a ``red herring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is the world's largest Internet provider with more than 15  
million subscribers. So, a decision by AOL to distribute Netscape's 
browser software could dramatically boost Netscape's now-flagging 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have some relevance,'' said economist Franklin Fisher  
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the witness, who 
called the deal a ``hopeful sign'' of renewed competition. But he 
said: ``It won't have changed the fact that Microsoft took actions 
to reduce the threat from Netscape's browser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted the  
questioning, saying he read Case's comments, and briefly recessed 
the trial to find a copy of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Case told the newspaper: ``We have no flight of fancy that we  
can dent in any way, shape or form what is a monopoly in the 
operating system business. ... It's hard to imagine that PCs won't 
be the dominant way people connect with the Internet for many years 
to come, and Microsoft has a pretty amazing lock on that 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson read aloud several paragraphs, then turned to the  
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I have of you is ... is this consistent with your  
understanding of what the impact of the consortium will be, insofar 
as developing viable competition?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher replied: ``It certainly is.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is clearly preoccupied with Netscape's purchase. Last  
month, in remarkably candid comments, he said the deal ``might be a 
very significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's purchase must be approved by the Justice Department, and  
the judge agreed last month that Microsoft should be allowed to 
review the merger request. In a letter to the government made 
public Wednesday, a Microsoft lawyer wrote: ``I have not heard from 
you on the subject for more than two weeks and am anxious to move 
this matter along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL currently distributes Microsoft's browser software to its  
subscribers in exchange for Microsoft prominently including AOL's 
software within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Case has indicated he will continue to distribute Microsoft's  
browser to AOL subscribers, but Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
recently said he expects AOL to distribute Netscape ``sooner or 
later to all its online service customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyer questioned Fisher in detail later Wednesday  
about how browser software is distributed. Fisher frequently paused 
to search through four enormous binders of paperwork before 
answering. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial's slow pace clearly irked the judge. ``It's no test of  
his credibility to put him through a memory test,'' he complained 
to the Microsoft attorney.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Post Strong 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Declining prices and a robust economy led  
Americans to buy 15.6 million cars and light trucks last year, the 
most in 12 years and the third highest total ever, based on 
automakers' final results released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers ended the year with a bang, with December sales up 7  
percent compared to the year-ago period. No. 1 General Motors 
Corp., which is still dealing with the effect of last summer's 
strikes on its inventory, managed a 3 percent improvement last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, foreign automakers made the biggest gains: Asian  
companies were up 4 percent while the Europeans, which have the 
smallest share of the U.S. market, improved 29 percent thanks to a 
wide array of new models. GM, Ford Motor Co. and the American 
products of DaimlerChrysler AG combined for just a 1 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But the totals were better than anyone anticipated a year ago.  
The 15.6 million vehicles sold were third to the 16.3 million in 
1986 and 15.7 million in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous year,'' said Mike DiGiovanni, head of  
market research at GM. ``No one I know forecast that level of 
sales. There's not much to complain about in terms of how the 
industry's performing right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there was cause for concern behind the numbers. Much of the  
increased demand was due to rebates, cut-rate financing and other 
incentives that reduced transaction prices. GM began the rise in 
incentives in April with its ``loyalty coupon'' program for 
previous customers after dismal first-quarter sales results. 
</P>
<P>
	The ploy worked, but incentives remained high the rest of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales in 1998 were more dependent on incentives than sales of  
any of the past three or four years,'' said analyst Susan Jacobs of 
Jacobs &AMP; Associates in Rutherford, N.J. ``The need for incentives 
is flagging some emerging softness in the market, even though the 
economy's strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs noted that the industry placed discounts even on some of  
the vehicles it redesigned for '99 shortly after they were 
introduced in the fall, something that's rarely been done in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reached a point where the ink wasn't even dry on the '99  
price increases before we had incentives,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most automakers are optimistic about 1999. They expect  
sales to be down slightly, but still near the 15 million level 
where they have been for an unprecedented five consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for light trucks, the classification that includes sport  
utility vehicles, pickups and minivans, continued to surge at the 
expense of cars. For the year, truck sales were up 8 percent while 
car sales fell 2 percent. Trucks represented a record 48 percent of 
the market; buyers chose more trucks than cars in November -- the 
first month that has happened. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's truck sales set a company record and surpassed the 2  
million mark for the third consecutive year, despite the 
strikes-related slowdown in production and the fall plant 
changeover for GM's redesigned full-size pickup, its biggest 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes also were blamed for causing GM's market share to  
fall to 29.2 percent from 31.1 percent in 1997. DiGiovanni 
estimated that the strikes cost GM about 1.3 share points last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is producing its new pickups at full speed, but demand has  
been so strong that inventories remain half of what they were a 
year ago, DiGiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker wants to get its market share up to 30 percent in  
the first quarter and has set what it calls a ``stretch goal'' of 
32 percent for the year. ``It will be difficult to attain 32, but 
it gives us a target to shoot for,'' DiGiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. posted strong gains last  
month and for the year. Toyota's sales increased 19 percent for the 
month and 11 percent for the year. Honda was up 6 percent in 
December and 7 percent for the year. Both automakers posted strong 
gains in sales of their SUVs and minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there are indications of a gradual slowdown in '99,  
the sales surge in December fueled one of the industry's best-ever 
yearend closeouts,'' said Yale Gieszl, a Toyota vice president.

<HEADLINE> Starr Says Some Leaks Not Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr told a judge  
that some news leaks about his investigation of President Clinton 
and Monica Lewinsky attributed to his office didn't violate grand 
jury secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In court records unsealed Wednesday, Starr did not acknowledge  
that his office was the sources of any leaks. But even if it was, 
he contended, the status of Lewinsky's immunity deal, her dress 
stained with DNA evidence and other evidence were not grand jury 
matters that are barred by secrecy rules from being disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports that attribute information about those topics to  
Starr or sources in his office are at the center of an 
investigation into whether prosecutors violated grand jury secrecy 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has denied that his office disclosed any information  
covered by federal law requiring that grand jury matters be kept 
secret. He asked a federal judge to reconsider her decision to 
investigate certain articles. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson denied Starr's  
appeal, ordered a hearing into the matter and appointed a ``special 
master'' to investigate allegations of leaks, which were first made 
by President Clinton's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has said in a published report that he and his top deputy  
briefed reporters but did not disclose secret information about his 
investigation of an affair between Clinton and Lewinsky and effort 
to keep it private. Documents unsealed Wednesday by Judge Johnson 
provide new details about his contention that the court defined 
secrecy rules too broadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said 24 news articles -- some attributed information to  
Starr's office and some attributed information to ``federal law 
enforcement sources'' and ``prosecutors'' -- provided enough 
evidence to justify an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said several articles that attributed information about  
Lewinsky's immunity deal to his office do not violate rules because 
they don't disclose grand jury matters ``or even matters likely to 
occur there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Disclosures of the status of such negotiations cannot  
constitute a basis for the violation,'' Starr said in a motion 
asking Johnson to reconsider. Rule 6e of the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure prohibits leaks of grand jury matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson denied the request. Charles Bakaly, Starr's spokesman,  
could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Information about the dress is not covered by secrecy rules  
either because it's evidence that was collected outside the grand 
jury process, Starr said in the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said disclosure of the so-called ``talking points''  
Lewinsky gave to her former colleague, Linda Tripp, which were 
eventually presented to a grand jury do not touch on a ``protected 
aspect'' of the grand jury's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said articles that don't expressly attribute information  
to his office shouldn't be part of the investigation and suggested 
hostile witnesses or their lawyers could have been the sources of 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``A witness hostile to the OIC could disclose grand jury  
testimony with the hope that the target of the investigation will 
use that as a basis for a complaint,'' Starr's motion said.

<HEADLINE> Class of 1999 Heads for Cooperstown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When he started his pitching career, Nolan Ryan  
seemed like the last guy in the world likely to wind up in the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike George Brett and Robin Yount, who are accompanying him to  
Cooperstown, Ryan was erratic and inconsistent, a kid who could 
throw hard but with very little idea where those pitches would wind 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like a young Sandy Koufax, except Koufax had only four  
no-hitters. Ryan wound up with seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was the odd man out on a Mets staff headed by Tom Seaver,  
Jerry Koosman and Gary Gentry, the nucleus of the team's 1969 world 
championship. The hard-throwing pitcher was in a high-priority 
military reserve unit, required to report to meetings every other 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pitching maybe every 10th day,'' he said. ``I was  
erratic and wild. I wasn't happy my four years with the Mets. I was 
frustrated with the lack of success and no consistency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were frustrated, too, and shipped Ryan and three other  
players to California in 1971 for Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``That trade kicked off my career,'' Ryan said. ``I had no more  
military obligation. I went into a four-man rotation. Tom Morgan 
was the pitching coach. Jeff Torborg was my catcher. I was able to 
pitch over 300 innings the first year. That was what I needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the real beginning of one of the most dominating power  
pitching careers in baseball history. Ryan won 324 games and struck 
out a record 5,714 batters to go with those seven no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers earned him 98.79 percent of the 497 ballots cast  
by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Ryan's total was the second-highest in history, trailing only 
Seaver's 98.84 in 1992. Brett received 98.19 percent, trailing only 
Seaver, Ryan and Ty Cobb's 98.23 in 1936's first election. Yount 
received 77.46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of them had great games and great seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	Yount remembered hitting two home runs against Jim Palmer in the  
last game of the 1982 season to push Milwaukee past Baltimore into 
the American League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett remembered celebrating the 1985 World Series championship  
in Kansas City after the Royals recovered from a 3-1 deficit in the 
playoffs and another 3-1 deficit in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ryan remembered pitching on that 1969 Mets staff.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you look back, some of the most memorable moments were  
things that occurred as a team,'' he said. ``The '69 Mets, nobody 
expected us to win. You develop a cohesiveness and there are 
memories and a special feeling. It was a unique group that came 
together at a very early age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Ryan thought about pitching on a staff with Seaver,  
Koosman, Gentry, Jon Matlack and Tug McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been fun to stay together for 10 or 15 years and  
see what we could accomplish,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Off on his own, he accomplished plenty. Brett, who won three  
batting titles, recalled hitting against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I faced Nolan, he was with California,'' Brett  
said. ``I was batting seventh, behind Jim Wohlford. He hit Jim in 
the ribs and the ball seemed to stick there for a minute before it 
fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim was trying to breathe and he couldn't. Then I came up and  
took three pitches, three strikes. That was good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan recalled pitching to Yount and how impressed he was with  
the rookie's courage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember Robin was only 18, but he choked up and stood up on  
the plate,'' Ryan said. ``You couldn't intimidate him. He'd hang in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount frowned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't intimidated?'' he asked. ``I must have hid it well.  
It took three or four years for me to catch up with that fastball. 
If you didn't turn it up a notch, you were in big trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, who had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 20-year career  
with the Kansas City Royals, went 29-for-101 lifetime against Ryan. 
That was better than Yount, who had 3,142 career hits but only 16 
in 69 swings against Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryan-Brett-Yount rookie sweep marked the first time three  
first-year candidates were elected to the Hall of Fame since Cobb, 
Babe Ruth, Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson 
comprised the first class at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	The three will be inducted Sunday, July 25.

<HEADLINE> Congress Changes Without Gingrich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Tyrannosaurus rex skull is gone from the  
corner office with the majestic view, and new plants adorn the 
hallway of the House speaker's suite. As an obscure congressman 
from Illinois was sworn into that office Wednesday, Newt Gingrich 
was 3,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich's spokesman couldn't say whether the self-described  
visionary who toppled Democrats from the helm of the House four 
years ago watched from California as he was replaced by Rep. Dennis 
Hastert of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denny, I never dreamed that it would be my privilege to walk  
you down the aisle,'' Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said with 
a hearty slap to Hastert's back moments before House leaders and 
the Illinois delegation escorted the new speaker into the chamber 
for his debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Gingrich been in the Capitol, he would have noticed a  
distinctly different atmosphere from the reception he received in 
1995 from Democrats as he became the first Republican to take the 
speaker's chair in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone were the forced smiles from Democrats that greeted Gingrich  
when he walked to the House rostrum. For Hastert, the Democrats had 
affectionate handshakes and words of welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who frostily handed  
Gingrich the gavel ``with resignation but with resolve'' four years 
ago and was barely on speaking terms with him for the next four 
years, had nice things to say about the new GOP speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's bury the hatchet,'' Gephardt declared. Republicans,  
Democrats and those who packed the public galleries responded with 
a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich was gone, and with him the ferocious partisan  
bitterness that marked his tenure, several members said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest sign of his absence is that the Democrats don't  
have a ready target,'' said Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no tension in the chamber,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, the  
Illinois Republican who presided over the House impeachment debate 
last month, on the remarkable day when Gingrich's original 
successor, Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston, 
shocked the nation by resigning amid a sex controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Gingrich himself endorsed Hastert, his  
temperamental opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich gained national attention as the rank-and-file agitator  
whose ethics crusade brought down House Speaker Jim Wright. 
``Hastert's not exactly a household name,'' the new speaker 
acknowledged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As speaker, Gingrich saw himself as the party's titular head,  
moving from domestic issues to international diplomacy and back, 
burning up the speaking circuit and dismissing Democratic criticism 
as the stuff of a party out of power and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 43-minute speech, his first from the speaker's chair,  
former history professor Gingrich called his ascendance ``the end 
of an imperial era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pledged to work with Democrats, but within hours belittled  
their early legislative plans as ``foolish'' and ``stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus began a stormy, four-year tenure that saw Gingrich become a  
superstar who often hobbled himself with his own words. He survived 
a coup attempt from within his own party and an ethics 
investigation that resulted in a $300,000 fine. He wrote a book 
about the lessons he learned, but resigned three days after the 
Republicans suffered losses in the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich still is considering running for president, his  
associates say. As his staff this week prepared to vacate their 
suite for Hastert's to move in on Monday, Gingrich hiked in Arizona 
and appeared on the Jay Leno show. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, in contrast, descended from the podium to deliver his  
17-minute speech from the well below the chair, making the symbolic 
statement that running the House, and not solving civilization's 
problems, would be his first priority. 
</P>
<P>
	With his white coif and his entourage, Gingrich was always easy  
to spot on the House floor. Hastert stood behind the last row of 
seats, looking much the same as any other gray-haired, 
bespectacled, blue-suited congressman as the clerk called the vote 
for speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hastert,'' Republicans called out, one by one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gephardt,'' each Democrat responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the list of 435 lawmakers, Hastert's turn came.  
</P>
<P>
	``Present,'' he said in a clear, quiet voice. Then he slipped  
out of the chamber, alone.

<HEADLINE> Holmgren at Top of Ravens List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Green Bay Packers coach Mike Holmgren is the man Art Modell  
wants as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Ravens owner hopes Holmgren likes what he sees when he  
visits Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gearing up for what we hope is a productive weekend,''  
Modell said Wednesday. ``Anybody would like to have Mike Holmgren 
on their side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who can leave the Packers if he takes a general  
manager-coach position, is the most sought-after football mind 
available, with six NFL teams still looking to fill coaching 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other hot prospects are Pittsburgh defensive  
coordinator Jim Haslett, Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian 
Billick, Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer and Denver 
offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens also plan to meet with Haslett as they seek a  
replacement for the fired Ted Marchibroda. But Holmgren appears to 
be the man they're after. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Ozzie Newsome, whose responsibility of director of player  
personnel would be infringed upon should Holmgren join the Ravens, 
is excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he would be great to have here,'' Newsome said of  
Holmgren, 84-42 with two Super Bowl appearances and one victory in 
the big game to show for seven seasons in Green Bay. ``Are we 
impressed with what he's done? Absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore will be the second stop in a three-city tour for  
Holmgren, who is in the midst of a 21-day stretch in which he must 
decide whether to keep his current job or sign with Seattle, 
Baltimore or Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Los Angeles Raiders coach Art Shell, now offensive line  
coach for the Atlanta Falcons, will interview Sunday with the 
Cleveland Browns, team president Carmen Policy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, the first black NFL head coach in the modern era, will be  
the third coaching candidate interviewed by the expansion Browns, 
who will return to the NFL next season team after a three-year 
hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a head coach in the NFL. He's a Hall of Fame player  
and he's done an excellent job with the offensive line in Atlanta 
this year,'' Policy said. ``He's a special person and he's somebody 
we've been interested in talking to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Browns have talked only with Billick and Kubiak.  
</P>
<P>
	Policy said the Browns also would interview Palmer ``when  
there's a break in their schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars will visit the New York Jets on Sunday in an AFC  
divisional playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State coach Mike Riley can have the job in San Diego if  
he feels comfortable retaining several assistants. General manager 
Bobby Beathard wants to retain defensive coordinator Joe Pascale 
and his staff, as well as offensive line coach Joe Bugel and 
running backs coach Ollie Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's defense was one of the few bright spots in an  
otherwise dismal 5-11 season. The defense ranked first in fewest 
yards allowed overall and against the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, it isn't that simple because this is a little  
different situation, just because of coming in and not bringing all 
your own guys,'' Beathard said Wednesday. ``He wants to make sure 
it's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley hadn't met with all of the assistants as of Wednesday  
afternoon, Beathard said, and wouldn't be able to meet with some of 
them until today. Beathard left the impression that Riley might 
want to bring some of his own staff with him, although he said 
Riley felt comfortable with Pascale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers say a deal could be made as early as today.

<HEADLINE> Royal Opera House Hits Hard Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- As Britain's Royal Opera House remains shrouded in  
scaffolding for an extensive and long-overdue renovation, its 
renowned ballet and opera companies can't help but wonder if the 
sound they're hearing is the fat lady singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Crippled by a nagging financial crisis, the opera house -- made  
up of the Royal Ballet and Royal Opera -- has been sapped by mass 
resignations and blasted by Parliament as arrogant and elitist. 
</P>
<P>
	It has grappled with unions over working conditions, and just  
replaced its chief executive for the third time in less than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, its board must ponder the most recent wave of red ink  
resulting from trying to stage ballet and opera performances on the 
road while the theater is closed for remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
	To put it succinctly, the Royal Opera House is in a royal mess.  
And things are not going to get better any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opera house is on the front page these days, and for all  
the wrong reasons,'' observed Richard Morrison of The Times, who 
has been writing about the institution for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Theaters on the Covent Garden site have been home to opera since  
1732, with some of the most important productions in opera history 
getting their English debuts there. In the 18th century, Handel 
wrote several operas and oratorios especially for the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the marriage of the opera and ballet companies under the  
umbrella of the Royal Opera House in 1946, the list of performers 
having graced the Covent Garden stage reads like a who's-who of 
20th-century arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballet legends Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn danced together  
there for the first time in the 1960s, and the theater's walls have 
reverberated with the exalted voices of opera superstars Maria 
Callas, Joan Sutherland, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have triumphantly toured the world time and time  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	These are dark days, though, and the crisis at hand has led to  
drastic measures to keep the artistic companies afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Board chairman Colin Southgate, appointed in February after the  
previous board resigned en masse, was the person who dropped the 
big bomb: He canceled most opera and ballet productions next year 
and cut the performance schedule for up to five years after the 
theater reopens in December 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket prices and salaries will be slashed, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``The days for fudging are long passed,'' Southgate said in  
announcing the radical plan in September. ``The board is sad at the 
pain this will cause to our work force, but only a total 
restructuring will achieve real results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gloom deepened the next month when 11-year musical director  
Bernard Haitink resigned in protest over the cutbacks, along with 
the Royal Ballet's premier attraction, dancer Tetsuya ``Teddy'' 
Kumakawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballet company now has threatened to defect and form an  
independent troupe. 
</P>
<P>
	So how did all this happen?  
</P>
<P>
	That's what Prime Minister Tony Blair's government wanted to  
know, since the Royal Opera House had received more than $170 
million in Arts Council subsidies since 1992 but continued to 
report steep deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigative report by a Parliament committee concluded the  
problems were mismanagement, irresponsibility, incompetence and 
snobbery. It accused opera house leaders of wildly optimistic 
planning and allowing directors of productions to spend without 
restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Royal Opera House is now at the lowest point in its long  
and distinguished history,'' the report proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	On their way out, board members blamed previous management for  
the problems. They also criticized the government for underfunding 
the opera house and arts in general for years, pointing to the 
richer subsidies enjoyed by arts organizations in other European 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers didn't want to hear it. They called for lower ticket  
prices, operas and ballets with wider public appeal and, 
especially, a new director with good business sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would prefer to see the house run by a philistine with the  
requisite financial acumen than by the succession of opera and 
ballet lovers who have brought a great and valuable institution to 
its knees,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Running the house actually will be a job for two directors now.  
</P>
<P>
	An artistic director still is being sought, but the house's new  
executive chief is Michael Kaiser, a former management consultant 
who gave up a successful business career to run a small ballet 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to become executive director of American Ballet  
Theater in New York, leading a remarkable financial turnaround 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a group of people that has gone through a war, and I  
want to give them hope,'' said Kaiser, the first American to run a 
major British arts organization. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Opera House struggles to regain its footing, the $362  
million renovation project continues at its 140-year-old Covent 
Garden home base, the first major renovation in a century, partly 
funded by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt the Victorian-era landmark will be even more impressive  
when it opens next year, with its additional seats, backstage 
reconstruction and air-conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The good health of its companies, however, remains far less  
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it has to survive now,'' said The Times' Morrison.  
``The country has invested so much money in it. Plus, there's the 
legacy of the 50 years of the Royal Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it has to survive. It's just a question of in what  
form.''

</P>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Phil Berle, the brother of famed comedian  
Milton Berle who carved his own niche in vaudeville and television, 
died Saturday. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Berle, born Phil Berlinger, helped film a television pilot for  
The Three Stooges. As a TV producer/director and movie extra, he

<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Henry Guernsey Gay, former publisher of the  
Shelton-Mason County Journal who won national awards for his 
irreverent weekly newspaper columns, died Sunday of cancer. He was 
72.

	In 1952, Gay and his son Charles moved to Washington to take  
over the Buckley News Banner. Fourteen years later, Gay purchased 
the Journal, where his column was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay received the American Civil Liberties Union William O.  
Douglas Award for editorial excellence, the Master Editor/Publisher 
Award from the Washington Newspaper Publishers Association and the 
top award in the Golden Dozen category for editorial writing from 
the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>

<P>
	MARSHFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- R. Brendan Hanlon, an actor and  
accountant who appeared in several films and wrote a tax guide for 
those in show business, died Saturday of cardiac arrest. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanlon had small roles in the films ``Dirty Laundry,'' ``Good  
Will Hunting,'' ``A Civil Action,'' ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``The 
Spanish Prisoner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanlon had appeared in stage plays at the Nora Theater Company  
in Boston and the New Repertory Theater in Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a private practice as a tax preparer, specializing  
in the performing arts. He wrote ``The New Tax Guide for 
Performers, Writers, Directors, Designers and Other Show Biz 
Folk.''

</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jim Kropfeld, a three-time national champion  
driver in unlimited hydroplane racing, died Sunday of cancer. He 
was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Kropfeld won national championships in 1984, 1986 and 1987 as  
pilot of the hydroplane Miss Budweiser. His 22 career victories 
rank fourth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a broken neck in 1988 when the hydroplane crashed  
during a race in Miami. He resumed racing with the craft in 1989, 
winning two events. He retired in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Kropfeld was inducted into the Unlimited Hydroplane Racing  
Association Hall of Fame in Seattle last year.

</P>
<P>

with establishing professional ties with the Omaha and Nebraska 
business communities that helped move the college from the planning 
stage to its expected opening this year.

<P>
                          *Duke of Rutland    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The 10th Duke of Rutland, owner of vast estates in  
northern England and two of the country's finest houses, died of 
cancer Saturday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke, born Charles John Robert Manners, battled with the  
government Coal Board in the 1970s when it tried to develop mines 
in the Vale of Belvoir, which had some of the best farming land in 
Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. 
</P>
<P>
	He served in the army's Grenadier Guards in France and Germany  
during World War II. He was 20 when he inherited the dukedom on his 
father's death in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke was active for much of his life in county and local  
government and in the Conservative Party, and was a successful 
businessman as head of Rutland Hotels Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Belvoir Castle has been remodeled and rebuilt several times --  
most recently after a fire in 1816 that destroyed many famous 
paintings. A vast residence in the Regency style, it has more than 
150 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manners family's second great house is Haddon Hall in  
Derbyshire, northern England. Much of the building dates from about 
1370, and with its famous rose gardens has been described as the 
most romantic house in England. 

</P>

                         *Jose Vela Zanetti    	
</P>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Jose Vela Zanetti, a Spanish painter best  
known for his mural depicting human rights at the U.N. headquarters 
in New York, died Monday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Vela Zanetti went into exile in 1939 during the Spanish Civil  
War. His father had been killed by fascist supporters of late 
dictator Gen. Francisco Franco at the war's outset in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	On leaving Spain, Vela Zanetti first moved to the Dominican  
Republic. He later spent time and produced hundreds of murals in 
the United States, Mexico, Colombia and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Best known for paintings of peasant farm workers and rural  
scenes, his most famous work is the giant mural `La Lucha del 
Hombre por La Paz'' (Man's Struggle For Peace) in the U.N. building 
in New York.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The great falls on Tibet's Tsangpo River,  
subject of myth and folklore since Victorian times, have finally 
been reached by Western explorers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an enchanting moment ... we were all stunned and  
excited,'' Ken Storm Jr. said of the moment on Nov. 8 when the team 
of explorers sponsored by the National Geographic Society sighted 
the giant falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked tightly between the rising cliffs of the Tsangpo gorge,  
the falls are in shadow most of the time and hidden from view in a 
hairpin turn. The explorers named the cataract, 100 to 115 feet 
high, Hidden Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a great wonder,'' Storm said. ``The fact that we're  
here, in the late 20th century, and a large waterfall on a major 
river of the world has yet to be recorded, is a wonder in itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stories of the giant falls told by Tibetan hunters and Buddhist  
monks were a popular topic in Victorian drawing rooms. Those 
romantic tales sparked several unsuccessful expeditions, Storm said 
in a telephone interview from his Minneapolis office. 
</P>
<P>
	The last effort, in 1924, came within a quarter-mile of the  
falls before the explorers gave up and concluded they didn't exist. 
That ended western exploration for nearly three-quarters of a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tsangpo gorge in southeastern Tibet is a rugged wilderness  
unlike the high desert of the rest of the region. It is called 
Pemako, one of the hidden lands held sacred in Tibetan Buddhism, 
known only to local hunters and to religious pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a gap in the mountains flows weather from the south,  
pouring rain for a jungle at lower levels, fir forests as the land 
rises and snowcapped peaks above, explained Storm. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Chinese began allowing western visitors to Tibet in  
1993, Storm said, explorations were begun by members of the group 
that finally located the falls, including Storm; Ian Baker, who 
lives in New York and Nepal; and Hamid Sarder, of Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidden Falls is ``in a dramatic spot, deep in this gorge, beyond  
the point where earlier explorers were able to reach,'' Storm said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1924 expedition, a gap of about five miles was left  
unexplored because the men couldn't work their way into the area 
through steep cliffs where the river disappears into a knot of 
mountains. The river reappears, 100 miles farther on and 8,000 feet 
lower, as the Brahmaputra. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruggedness of the gorge prevented explorers from determining  
what became of the Tsangpo. An expedition in 1911 reduced the 
unexplored section to between 30 and 40 miles, and in 1924 that was 
cut to the five miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1924 explorers found a falls they estimated at 40 feet and  
called Rainbow Falls. But they couldn't work their way past that 
point because of the steep walls on each side of the river, Storm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believed their accounts that there probably wasn't a great  
waterfall in there,'' Storm said. ``Only in the last year were we 
able to realize from monks and hunters,'' that the falls were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker and Sarder are fluent in Tibetan, Storm noted, and are  
Buddhist scholars who could develop an understanding with local 
people, who had always known about the falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we came down into the gorge we could look upstream and see  
Rainbow Falls,'' Storm said. They were able to determine it was 
almost 70 feet high, almost twice what had been previously 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also realized as we were going down the gorge that in a  
narrow, tight hairpin turn, hidden ... was another waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thrill was amazing,'' he said. ``The river of 100 yards  
narrowed to 60 to 70 feet and the water poured over this, 
thundering, the full volume of the Tsangpo, which collects water 
from the whole Himalayan region.''

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Harassment of Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In dealing with the homeless, ``meanness'' is  
driving out compassion as cities across the country call in the 
police, an advocacy group's report contends. 
</P>
<P>
	From San Francisco to New York City, local police forces are  
tightening restrictions on sleeping and begging in public places, 
according to Tuesday's report by the National Law Center on 
Homelessness and Poverty. And police sweeps are driving some 
homeless people from their haunts altogether, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said many cities are bent on ``criminalizing  
homelessness'' and are failing to take advantage of existing 
constructive methods to treat homeless people for physical and 
mental problems and get them into housing and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	And cities haven't done enough to create shelters and transition  
housing for the homeless, according to the report. It is the fifth 
such report issued since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``While cities continue to crack down on homeless people,  
resources to shelter homeless people or to help them to become 
self-sufficient are sorely lacking,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of sending in the police to move and arrest these  
people, you can provide resources,'' said Maria Foscarinis, the 
center's executive director. ``Criminalizing is a quick fix, but 
it's not a solution. People have to go somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited five cities -- Atlanta, Chicago, New York, San  
Francisco and Tucson, Ariz. -- as being especially tough on the 
homeless and ``promoting the `meanest' streets.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The report makes these assertions:  
</P>
<P>
	--Atlanta: ``Sweeps and crackdowns continue to occur with  
homeless people being removed from under bridges and moved along in 
the downtown area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Chicago: The city ``has made a concerted effort to arrest and  
prosecute homeless people for panhandling'' and is trying to remove 
them altogether from certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--New York City: ``There continues to be a crackdown on homeless  
people as the mayor focuses on `quality of life' violations; sweeps 
continue on an almost nightly basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--San Francisco: ``From January to November 1998 the police  
issued over 16,000 `quality of life' violation tickets, the 
majority of which were issued to homeless people. Police are taking 
pictures of people they claim are `habitual drinkers' ... and 
distributing them to liquor stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Tucson: ``City officials fully accept the criminalization  
policy; council members proposed looking into a plan to privatize 
the sidewalks which would allow business owners to keep homeless 
people off the sidewalks. Some homeless people were released from 
jail with travel restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some concerns about public space are legitimate,'' the report  
says. ``Ultimately, no city resident -- homeless or housed -- wants 
people living and begging in the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it contends that rather than turning to the police, ``cities  
must concentrate on efforts to alleviate the problem of 
homelessness rather than concentrating on the symptoms of the 
problem.''

<HEADLINE>  Sports Car Market Getting Crowded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Aging, affluent baby boomers are driving the  
rising demand in the U.S. sports car market, so much that a trio of 
foreign automakers is about to enter the increasingly crowded 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the North American International Auto Show, Nissan Motor  
Corp. unveiled the prototype Tuesday for a new Z-car that the 
struggling Japanese automaker hopes will capture Americans' hearts 
the way the original 240-Z sports car did 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Audi AG, meanwhile, introduced its techno-cool TT  
Coupe with an aluminum and stainless steel body; it goes on sale 
next spring. They follow last week's unveiling of the sleek Honda 
S2000 roadster in Los Angeles, slated to arrive on U.S. shores next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	As production costs come down, more automakers are finding it  
profitable to develop high-performance ``road toys'' for a niche 
market that just a few years ago had relatively few entrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Len Hunt, vice president of Audi of America Inc., said the large  
number of prosperous, aging baby boomers is the main reason more 
automakers are attacking the sports car market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's people saying, 'Listen, I've given a lot to the kids,  
I've had a station wagon, an SUV. I want something that's for me,' 
'' Hunt said. ``They are expressions of individual choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Brown, an analyst with Nextrend consultants in Thousand  
Oaks, Calif., says this decade's sports car revival also is part of 
the larger boomer-driven retro trend in the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may not always be from a styling standpoint, but in terms  
of what those cars are, that concept is a trend from the past,'' 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The past certainly is evident in Nissan's Z concept, which  
borrows the long hood, ``sugar scoop'' headlight wells and sweeping 
front fenders of the original 240Z that debuted in 1969 in the 
United States and was an instant hit. The concept car is a far more 
aerodynamic interpretation of the original's fastback shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, which has become known more for bland, safe designs this  
decade, has high hopes for the Z to restore its image as a 
manufacturer of innovative, stylish yet affordable cars -- and to 
help get it back into the black financially. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Seergy, vice president of Nissan North America Inc.,  
said a final decision on putting the car into production will be 
announced by April. While executives said they were not worried 
that the sports car segment was too crowded, they acknowledged that 
Nissan can't afford anything less than a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, it's a risk,'' said Jerry Hirshberg, president of  
Nissan's California design studio where the Z concept was penned. 
``Nissan can't afford to make a misstep right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seergy said he wants the Z to be a high-volume car, with sales  
as high as 100,000 a year. The car ``has a soul and character unto 
itself that we think will make it special. We're going to build and 
price it so most people can afford a Z.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's goal is to price the car below $25,000, which would put  
it at the lower end of the sports car market with the popular Mazda 
Miata. The rear-drive car likely will be powered by a four-cylinder 
engine, but a six-cylinder engine may also be offered. Hirshberg 
said Nissan also is looking at a convertible version. 
</P>
<P>
	Audi's Hungarian-built TT is almost identical to the 1995 show  
car of the same name. It's unusual among sports cars in that the 
engine drives the front wheels. An all-wheel-drive option will be 
offered by next fall, and a roadster is planned by early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The car has a 1.8-liter, turbocharged, four-cylinder engine that  
produces 180 horsepower. Audi says safety also is a selling point: 
it had two side-impact airbags in addition to front airbags. 
</P>
<P>
	The car is classified as a 2-plus-2, which means it has the kind  
of back seat useful mostly for holding shopping bags or punishing 
your passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said Audi hopes to sell 10,000 TTs in its first full year,  
but for this year only 4,000 will be available in the United 
States. The car will be priced from $30,000 to $35,000, putting it 
in competition with the new Honda and BMW's Z3 roadsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all automakers care to test the sports car market. Dodge,  
for example, sells the expensive Viper -- a low-volume image car -- 
but has ignored the lower end of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gale, who heads design for the Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth and  
Jeep brands of DaimlerChrysler AG, said new sports cars tend to 
have short cycles of popularity that make it difficult for a 
high-volume automaker to justify the investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've studied it,'' Gale said. ``I think there are plenty of  
areas for us to go that maybe aren't quite so crowded.''

<HEADLINE> Why Bother With NBA Season? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The correct way to answer the question of whether there will be  
an NBA season is no longer yes or no, but why have one at all? 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations have become THE game, no longer just the means,  
but the end as well. A league and a commissioner that a few short 
years ago were blazing trails for the rest of sports to follow are 
lost. The union and its leaders have so little confidence in their 
bargaining position that they're prepared to rig the vote rather 
than find out if they were right. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after this lockout began, six months and a half-billion in  
lost wages ago, fans overwhelmingly told pollsters they didn't care 
whether there was pro basketball or not. It was easy to be cavalier 
early on. Nobody really believed either side would walk away from 
what was roughly a half-share of a $2 billion pie. That was then. 
Now everybody knows better. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA boss David Stern has dared the union leadership to step over  
a line, and the second they put their toes up against it, like 
``Bugs Bunny'' in one of those cartoons he made before ``Space 
Jam'' cartoons, the commissioner laughs and simply draws another 
one. On Monday, after union chief Billy Hunter spent the better 
part of the last few weeks creeping closer to Stern's shifting 
marks on both the revenue split and high- and low-end caps on 
salaries, the commissioner drew one more line. This time, it was at 
the edge of a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden show of contempt for any further negotiations fueled  
rumors that Stern has had a doomsday scenario ready almost from the 
start; that the longer this process drags on, the more ambitious he 
is likely to become. On the short list of things the commissioner 
would no doubt like to take care of is the power wielded by agent 
David Falk and his troublesome allies, as well as the behavioral 
problems being posed by Latrell Sprewell, Allen Iverson and the 
posse of wannabes they inspire. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether there is any substance to those rumors, the way the  
union's leaders have behaved hasn't turned them into loveable 
underdogs. Even before Hunter and his crew gave in to Stern's 
demands to put the owners' last proposal to the players for a vote, 
they started stuffing the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the final procedures were still being hammered out,  
today's vote in New York is practically guaranteed to be a sham. 
Players had to vote in person and were given notice of only about 
than 36 hours to make it across a transportation system moving like 
a player hampered by a torn ACL. A few of the first- and 
second-year players complained they could barely afford the 
last-minute fares. Even those who make it to New York likely won't 
get to cast their ballots without considerable interference. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the vote is not about whether to accept the  
owners' proposal, but whether to endorse their own negotiating 
committee's recommendation to reject it. Sound confusing? That's 
how Keith Askins felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a vote,'' he said. ``This is out of control. A vote  
is when you go to the federal building and cast your ballot. This 
is wrong. I feel ashamed to be part of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't the only one. A handful of players, most of them  
veterans, have already indicated a willingness to take Stern's 
sternest deal rather than leave it. That's why there is little 
chance of a secret ballot being offered. A voice vote held in open 
session after a drawn-out pep rally featuring Falk loyalists 
Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning could prove at least as 
intimidating as driving the lane against those same guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to us more like a bargaining tactic than an example  
of union democracy,'' NBA chief legal counsel Jeffrey Mishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the NBA has precious little room to talk about  
intimidation. Stern threatened to shut the league down for a season 
and start it back up next year with replacement players if need be. 
</P>
<P>
	What he forgets -- what the power brokers on both sides have  
forgotten -- is that the rest of us don't care that much now and 
will certainly care less a few months further down the road. The 
most important question about the NBA all along was whether Michael 
Jordan would come back if the season did. 
</P>
<P>
	And the answer to that question, more and more, sadly, seems to  
be why?

<HEADLINE> Plushenko Wins Russian Skating Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Sixteen-year-old Yevgeny Plushchenko landed seven  
triple loops Wednesday to win the Russian Figure Skating 
Championships over several rivals who failed to complete quadruple 
loops. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushchenko opened his program with a quadruple loop and failed  
to land it properly, but was then perfect on a succession of triple 
loops. 
</P>
<P>
	He completed his routine with a triple Salchov loop and got  
mostly 5.8s from the judges for both technical merits and artistic 
presentation, allowing him to move up from third place after the 
short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushchenko already has qualified for the Grand Prix finals that  
will be held in his hometown of St. Petersburg in March. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Alexei Yagudin finished second, landing seven  
triples loops, but he also failed in attempting a quad. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Urmanov, first after the short program, started his  
program with a a quadruple loop, but missed the landing and never 
fully recovered. He finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion, missed all of last season --  
including a chance to repeat as Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made his return this season a rewarding one with several  
strong performances.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Shell To Meet With Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Art Shell, offensive line coach for the Atlanta  
Falcons, will interview for the Browns head coaching job Sunday, 
team president Carmen Policy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, the first black NFL head coach in the modern era, will be  
the third coaching candidate interviewed by the Browns, who will 
return to the NFL next season as an expansion team after a 
three-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a head coach in the NFL. He's a Hall of Fame player  
and he's done an excellent job with the offensive line in Atlanta 
this year,'' Policy said. ``He's a special person and he's somebody 
we've been interested in talking to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Browns have talked only with Minnesota offensive  
coordinator Brian Billick and Denver offensive coordinator Gary 
Kubiak about their head- coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, Policy said the Browns also would interview Jacksonville  
offensive coordinator Chris Palmer ``when there's a break in their 
schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars will visit the New York Jets Sunday in an AFC  
divisional playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, 52, spent nearly six seasons as coach of the Los Angeles  
Raiders, the team he played for as a Hall of Fame offensive tackle. 
He guided the Raiders to a 12-4 record in 1990 and a trip to the 
AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired after the 1994 season, finishing with a 56-41  
overall record. After two years as an assistant with the Kansas 
City Chiefs, Shell joined coach Dan Reeves' staff in Atlanta this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	One of only four black coaches in modern NFL history, Shell's  
Cleveland candidacy was considered a surprise by some because his 
name had rarely been mentioned, and that unlike many of the other 
coaches being considered by the Browns, Shell had no ties to the 
San Francisco 49ers, Policy's former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always on our private list as one of the people we  
planned to interview,'' Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said the Browns probably will not be allowed to interview  
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren, who for a long time seemed destined 
to rejoin his former boss in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, it seems as though we don't have the right to  
interview Mike,'' Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's current contract with Green Bay contains an escape  
clause that gives him until Jan. 25 to take a job as a coach and 
general manager elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Holmgren, who is visiting Seattle, Baltimore and  
Philadelphia this week, decides to leave the Packers, Green Bay 
will receive a second-round draft choice as compensation. The NFL 
will not allow the Browns to trade a draft pick for a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought they (the league) might revisit that like they  
revisited some of the other things connected to the draft,'' Policy 
said. ``But it appears the commissioner is not going to revisit 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another coach linked to the new Browns -- current San Francisco  
coach Steve Mariucci -- also remains a longshot to come to 
Cleveland. Mariucci said earlier this week he was committed to the 
49ers, and Policy thinks that's where he'll stay.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Plans Trip to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will  
hold talks next week with the head of China's central bank during a 
trip to Asia that will also include a meeting with Hong Kong's 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan will be in Hong Kong for a meeting of the Bank for  
International Settlements on Monday and while there will meet with 
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, the Fed said in a brief statement 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank for International Settlements is often referred to as  
the central banker for central banks, helping to coordinate 
international monetary matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Its regular meetings are normally held at BIS headquarters in  
Basle, Switzerland. The Hong Kong discussions will be held at the 
BIS' new office in that city. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan will then travel to Beijing for a meeting Tuesday with  
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China. Greenspan 
last visited China for talks with central bank officials in May 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed spokesman Bob Moore said that Greenspan's trip results from  
an invitation from the Chinese and that the discussions would 
involve an ``exchange of views on economic and financial issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong and China have both resisted strong pressures to  
devalue their currencies in the wake of the financial crisis that 
has leveled a number of other economies of Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Chinese government reported that China's economy  
did slow in 1998 but still achieved a 7.8 percent growth rate, 
boosted in part by massive government spending on public works.

<HEADLINE>  Prince Edward To Get Married </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Prince Edward, youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II,  
will marry his longtime girlfriend, public relations executive 
Sophie Rhys-Jones, later this year, Buckingham Palace announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, said they were  
delighted at the match. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who have dated for five years, ``sought the  
permission of their respective parents between Christmas and the 
New Year,'' a statement from the palace said. ``Both families are 
thrilled at the news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckingham Palace said the date and venue have yet to be  
decided, but the couple hope to use St. George's Chapel at Windsor 
Castle, the queen's weekend home west of London, for a ceremony in 
late spring or summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rhys-Jones' parents, Christopher and Mary, said they were  
``extremely pleased and very happy for Sophie and Prince Edward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always enjoyed Prince Edward's company and feel that  
they make a wonderful couple,'' they said from their home in the 
village of Brenchley, south of London, where Ms. Rhys-Jones was 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the newly betrothed couple held hands and joked as they  
posed at St. James' Palace for photographers and showed off the 
engagement ring, three large diamonds in a setting from jewelers 
Asprey Garrard. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it (the ring) catches the sun, you'll all be blinded,'' the  
34-year-old prince teased. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked to kiss his fiancee on the palace lawn, Edward  
appeared diffident, saying, ``I don't know about that.'' 
Photographers later persuaded him to give Ms. Rhys-Jones, 33, a 
brief peck on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why they make a good couple, the prince replied, ``We are  
the best of friends and we happen to love each other very much.'' 
His fiancee added, ``We share a lot of interests, we laugh a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prince said he had not proposed until now because ``I don't  
think it would have been right before.'' He denied he had been put 
off by the trauma of his three siblings' divorces. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if anybody is going to get married I hope they think  
they will get it right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the couple's relationship, there have been numerous  
false reports of an imminent marriage, including a prediction that 
the pair would become engaged on Edward's 30th birthday in March 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Edward took out a 50-year lease on a former royal  
residence southwest of London, igniting new rumors that a marriage 
proposal was planned. But at the time, Edward told the Daily 
Telegraph newspaper, ``not to read too much into this in terms of 
any changes in my private life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After resigning his commission with the Royal Marines in 1987,  
the prince chose a career in the theater, starting with a job at 
Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company. 
</P>
<P>
	He is now an established documentary producer and is  
joint-managing director of his own company, Ardent Productions, 
which was set up in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rhys-Jones, whom friends describe as gregarious, vivacious  
and down-to-earth, runs a magazine for the Duke of Edinburgh's 
Award Scheme, a charity set up by her future father-in-law and 
handles public relations for several upmarket companies. 
</P>
<P>
	She plans to continue working after her marriage.

<HEADLINE> New-Home Sales Surge To Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new single-family homes soared 7.6  
percent to a record in November, propelled by low interest rates, 
unseasonable warmth and a strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans purchased new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual  
rate of 965,000 in November, surpassing the previous record rate of 
919,000, set in July, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure ``is the economic equivalent of Mark McGwire's 70  
home runs,'' said economist David Orr of First Union Mortgage Corp. 
in Charlotte, N.C. ``The continued surge in residential housing 
during 1998 is historic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	November's increase, the third in a row, was the largest in a  
year. And, even without December's number, the 823,000 homes sold 
during the first 11 months of the year have already established an 
annual record, surpassing the 819,000 homes sold during 1977. The 
department began tracking sales in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	November marked the 15th consecutive month of sales rates above  
800,000, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
	According to economists, a variety of factors have come together  
to make 1998 such a strong year for housing. First, jobs are 
plentiful, with the unemployment rate this year averaging around 
4.5 percent, a 28-year low. Second, mortgage rates have remained 
below 7 percent since June, a stretch unseen in 30 years. Third, 
the stock market, though tumultuous, has increased many Americans' 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, stocks advanced into record territory, as investors  
poured in cash from year-end bonuses and sales late last year. By 
late morning, the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks was up 122 
points to 9,433. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe unusually warm weather in November gave sales  
an added boost for the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally in November, sales jumped 9.9 percent in the South to  
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 432,000. They rose 5.4 percent 
in the West to a rate of 292,000, the highest in 19 years; 20.5 
percent to 88,000 in the Northeast and 0.6 percent to 172,000 in 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The median price of a new home -- meaning half sold for more and  
half for less -- was $148,700 in November, up 2.6 percent from a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of homes for sale at the end of November totaled  
292,000 -- 3.7 months supply at the current sales rate. That's a 
record low inventory.

<HEADLINE> Antibiotics-Coated Catheters Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coating catheters with antibiotics can greatly reduce a major  
source of infection among hospital patients, researchers reported 
today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Catheters are extremely thin, flexible tubes used to introduce  
drugs, anesthesia or food into a patient via a blood vessel. They 
may be used for a few hours or remain in place for weeks during 
treatment for heart disease, cancer and other major diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	From 150,000 to 200,000 Americans are infected each year when  
germs are accidentally introduced into the bloodstream by a 
catheter. An estimated 25 percent die. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers are experimenting with bonding antibacterial  
agents to catheters to try to cut the rate of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The study compared catheters saturated inside and out with the  
antibiotics minocycline and rifampin to catheters coated on the 
outside only with two antibacterial agents -- chlorhexidine and 
silver sulfadiazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one catheter-related infection occurred among the 350  
patients who got catheters impregnated with minocycline and 
rifampin, compared with 13 among the 370 patients who got catheters 
coated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Both types of catheters led to lower infection rates than other  
studies have found in catheters without antibacterial agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Dr. Rabih Darouiche of Baylor College of  
Medicine in Houston and Dr. Issam Raad of the University of Texas 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The two men invented the technology 
for impregnating catheters with minocycline and rifampin and earn 
royalties as a result.

<HEADLINE> M&AMP;M Boys Are Big Catch for Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- First, there's Minnesota's Randy Moss and  
Cris Carter. Now, name the NFL's second-most productive pair of 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	No, it's not Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens. Or Keyshawn Johnson  
and Wayne Chrebet. 
</P>
<P>
	Try Tony Martin and Terance Mathis, who somehow have managed to  
thrive in the Atlanta Falcons' run-oriented offense, even though 
few people seem to notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody gives us any credit,'' Mathis said. ``I think it's  
because of our running game. Everyone knows we have a smash-mouth, 
running type of offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an All-Pro year for Jamal Anderson, who set a team rushing  
record with 1,846 yards and an NFL mark for most carries in a 
season, Mathis and Martin have quietly put together 1,000-yard 
seasons of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss and Carter are the league's most productive duo, combining  
for 2,324 yards receiving, but Martin and Mathis accounted for only 
seven fewer yards between them. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin led the Falcons with 66 receptions for 1,181 yards, while  
Mathis had 64 receptions for 1,136 yards. Mathis had 11 touchdowns 
-- four of them covering at least 55 yards -- while Martin scored six 
times. Martin averaged 17.9 yards per catch to rank seventh in the 
league; Mathis was next with a 17.8-yard average. The 5-foot-10, 
185-pound Mathis also is a key blocker in the running game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just go out there and get the job done,'' Martin said.  
``Are we one of the top duos in the league? Yeah, without a 
doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, their accomplishments were hardly noted in the flurry of  
awards and all-star teams. Mathis, 31, was a second alternate for 
the NFC's Pro Bowl team, while the 33-year-old Martin wasn't even 
mentioned. Neither received a vote for All-Pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's because they both entered the league as obscure  
players who needed a few years to make their mark. They've been 
playing a futile game of catch-up ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had to work for everything we've gotten,'' Mathis said.  
``We still have to prove ourselves. People have started talking 
about our ages now. It seems like a constant thing to prove 
yourself year after year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was cut by the New York Jets after being drafted in the  
fifth round in 1989, then waited another year to play in his first 
NFL game with Miami. He didn't become a full-time starter until age 
30 with the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis was a sixth-round pick by the Jets in '90 but started  
only one game during four years in New York. He had a breakthrough 
season in 1994 after being traded to the Falcons, catching a 
team-record 111 passes for 1,342 yards and 11 touchdowns to earn 
his only trip to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta dumped the run-and-shoot offense after Dan Reeves was  
hired as coach in 1997, but Mathis remained a productive player. He 
had 62 receptions for 802 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny,'' Mathis said. ``When I played in the  
run-and-shoot, I did pick up some big numbers. Well, as you can 
see, we're out of the run-and-shoot now, and basically I'm doing 
the same thing. I don't know what it is. I guess sooner or later 
I'll get my respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his lone Pro Bowl appearance to conclude the '96 season,  
Martin slumped to 63 receptions a year ago with the Chargers. The 
Falcons, needing a receiver when Bert Emanuel signed with Tampa 
Bay, acquired Martin basically out of desperation for a mere 
second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	It was turned out to be yet another steal for Atlanta (14-2),  
which built the NFC West champions with castoffs from other teams 
and low-round draft picks. The Falcons meet San Francisco in a 
divisional playoff Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ended up with about the same amount of catches and the same  
amount of yards,'' Mathis said. ``Our average per catch was 
basically the same. You can't ask for anything better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin managed to stay focused even when he became embroiled in  
a money laundering investigation. It was revealed in October that 
federal authorities were investigating the player's financial 
dealings with a convicted drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges were filed, and Martin insisted Wednesday he's no  
longer a target of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just speculation. It wasn't even true. Really, it was  
just garbage,'' he said. ``I knew in my mind that I didn't have 
anything to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves doesn't, either. He knows the passing game is in good  
hands with Chris Chandler throwing to the M&AMP;M boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just shows you what tremendous confidence Chris has in both  
of them,'' the coach said. ``He'll go to them in tough situations 
and he knows he can count on them. They're just two great 
receivers.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Gifts to Samaranch Exceed $2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The retail value of the arsenal given by  
Salt Lake Olympics boosters to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
exceeds $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said today he didn't want to insult the city by  
refusing the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, Utah is a state where guns are very popular,'' he  
said at a news conference in Zurich, Switzerland. ``I have visited 
Salt Lake City twice and I got a gun both times. I took it to 
Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, two rifles and a shotgun, all made by Browning Arms of  
Mountain Green, Utah, have been identified as going to Samaranch 
and there also may have been a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials say such gift-giving to the leader of the IOC is  
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchange of gifts on the occasion of visits by the IOC  
president is customary and it has almost become a matter of 
protocol to do so,'' said Francois Carrard, the IOC's director 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he sees no problem in accepting the gifts,  
despite IOC rules that impose a $150 limit on gifts to committee 
members. He said the limit doesn't apply to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The limit is for the members who participate in the  
elections,'' he said. ``Now, I do not take part in the voting and 
the elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune de Geneve today quoted Samaranch as saying, ``I went  
to the American city twice before it was granted the 2002 Winter 
Games. On these occasions I did indeed receive a .22 Long Rifle and 
a Browning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do remember very clearly the inscription on the case: `To  
President Juan Antonio Samaranch on behalf of the population of 
Salt Lake City.' These gifts were put down in a register, as is 
required by our internal rules. They are in my office in Lausanne 
and I am in a position to show them to any of my visitors,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Samaranch said the two guns were in the  
Olympic Museum at IOC headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard's comment was in response to a report Tuesday in The  
Salt Lake Tribune that Samaranch received two guns worth $1,000 
from the Salt Lake bid committee a month before Salt Lake won the 
right to host the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said in another copyright story today that another  
Browning rifle also went to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said Samaranch was given a rifle in a case with an  
engraved plaque that read: ``Presented to President Juan Antonio 
Samaranch from the Browning Arms Co. on behalf of the people of 
Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That rifle apparently was sent to the Salt Lake City bid  
committee in Lillehammer, Norway, during the 1994 Winter Olympics 
and was delivered by Browning's distributor in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning billed the bid committee $1,250.75 for the rifle.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Browning disclosed the bid committee bought nearly  
$10,000 worth of rifles, firearms and cases at wholesale prices 
from July 1993 to May 1995, one month before Salt Lake City was 
selected as host to the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning has been searching its records since receiving  
inquiries about firearms sold to the bid committee. So far, its 
search has come upon four shotguns and five rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Other guns that went to Samaranch were a Browning ``Gold''  
semiautomatic shotgun with an estimated retail value of $475 and a 
``Euro Bolt'' bolt-action rifle with an estimated retail value of 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard also said a Browning pistol had been sent to Samaranch,  
but Browning spokesman Travis Hall said late Tuesday that the 
company was still searching for an invoice on a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also reportedly received a Ute Indian headdress and a  
quilt from Salt Lake bid officials worth thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's confirmation of the delivery of the Browning guns to  
Samaranch's office came amid investigations into claims that local 
Olympic officials bribed IOC members for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has acknowledged funding  
scholarships for at least six relatives of IOC members, providing 
free medical care, including cosmetic surgery, to visiting IOC 
members, and handing out lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the bribery scandal broke, Samaranch announced  
that the IOC would investigate and expel members found extorting 
favors from bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said today that the guns from Utah will be part of that IOC  
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said he isn't concerned about his future or that  
of the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will stay to the very last day of my mandate. We will do  
whatever is necessary to clean up whatever must be cleaned up,'' he 
said. ``Nevertheless, life goes on, and the Olympic movement has 
been very important over a century and it will stay on the same 
level.''

<HEADLINE> Defense Spending Boost Inevitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the surest bets is that the Congress  
that convenes this week will vote later this year for a sizable 
increase in defense spending, reversing a 15-year slide. Not only 
is the Republican-led Congress demanding it, but President Clinton 
is now on board as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the latest confrontations with Iraq all but  
guarantee Congress will open its checkbook for the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect base closings to necessarily be part of the  
mix. Lawmakers can be outspoken when calling for more money for 
defense readiness and then turn a deaf ear to suggestions that some 
of that money come in savings from closing bases in their states 
and districts. 
</P>
<P>
	In a political about face, Clinton announced over the weekend he  
will ask for Pentagon spending increases totaling $112 billion over 
the next six years, beginning with a $12 billion installment and a 
4 percent military pay increase for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton earlier balked at the size of increases that  
congressional Republicans and Pentagon chiefs wanted as he 
struggled to balance higher military spending with his pledge to 
prop up the Social Security system and satisfy other nonmilitary 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the impeachment-weakened president, fighting trial in the  
Senate, would have little to gain politically in resisting rising 
demands for higher defense spending coming from lawmakers in both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has always had a difficult relationship with the  
military. And many Republicans blame his policies for what they see 
as the current Pentagon morale and recruiting problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a coequal responsibility with the president of the  
United States to address (national security) threats and to take 
care of the men and women in uniform and to equip them today and 
tomorrow and into the future to meet those uncertainties,'' said 
Sen. John Warner, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee -- he took over the gavel Tuesday from Sen. Strom 
Thurmond, R-S.C. -- moved quickly to underscore GOP support for a 
boost in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the nation's military chiefs on Tuesday -- a day before  
the rest of the Senate convened -- before his panel to testify on 
their needs for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	And, while they dutifully voiced support for the president's  
request, under questioning they conceded -- readily -- that they 
could do with a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
	The military chiefs testified last September that roughly $150  
billion in additional spending was needed. ``Nothing has changed 
since we last met,'' said Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said Clinton's more modest request ``will 
meet our most critical needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Michael E. Ryan, Air Force chief of staff said, ``It will  
fix immediate readiness problems. It will not fix tomorrow's 
readiness problems at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican members complained that some of Clinton's  
proposed increases reflect accounting tricks more than real new 
money, such as calculating savings from lower fuel costs. Still, 
they welcomed the president's overture. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about base closings? The subject barely came up during  
four hours of questioning, although the White House announced the 
same day that Clinton would ask Congress for authority to close 
more military bases starting in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the last round in 1995, Congress has rejected several  
attempts by the Clinton administration to further close bases it 
considers unnecessary and wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting rid of the excesses that we have now ... would be very  
beneficial,'' Shelton told the Senate panel, suggesting the savings 
could total $15 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican pollster Frank Luntz said the impetus for increased  
defense spending has also been fueled by the recent military 
conflicts with Iraq. ``Americans may not know anything about 
millions and billions in defense budgets and missiles. But they do 
expect us to have a defense second to none. They do support 
spending whatever it takes to keep us No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leadership changes also figure. Warner, a former Navy secretary,  
calls a defense spending boost a top priority of his chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate  
Appropriations Committee, also has been a hawk on pumping up 
defense accounts. And the new chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee, Rep. C.W. ``Bill'' Young, R-Fla., comes there after 
serving as chairman of the panel's military spending subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> New Postal Rates Take Effect Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Send your cards and letters now, before the  
price goes up. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal rates increase Sunday for the first time in four years,  
raising the cost of the basic first-class letter to 33 cents, up a 
penny. 
</P>
<P>
	``After four years, we needed a small increase that was just  
enough to continue our investments to maintain quality customer and 
delivery service,'' said Frank P. Brennan, postal vice president 
for corporate relations. ``We have plenty of stamps and are ready 
to serve our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase takes effect despite four straight, highly  
profitable years for the post office, which says it needs added 
cash to buy equipment, cover rising costs and reduce outstanding 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Robinson of the National Minority Business Council,  
denounced the increase, charging that ``there is not one good 
reason'' advanced by the Postal Service to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the rate increase had been expected to take effect  
last summer, but it was postponed at the urging of the Postal Rate 
Commission and Congress, which noted the continuing strong profits 
being rung up by the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office made a profit of $550 million for the fiscal  
year that ended in September, following three years of profits of 
more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the post office says rising costs are eating into  
income and it still faces some $4 billion in losses accumulated 
since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 33-cent stamps went on sale Tuesday, with first-day  
ceremonies in Los Angeles. It's the Chinese New Year stamp 
commemorating the year of the hare. In addition, there are millions 
of undenominated ``H'' rate stamps available at post offices to 
cover the 33-cent rate, as well as 1-cent stamps that can be added 
to leftover 32-centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail without enough postage will be delivered postage due. If  
the recipient declines to pay the extra postage the item will be 
returned to the sender. Most businesses refuse postage-due items. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal officials like to point out that their domestic price is  
a bargain compared to some other countries. For example, Germany 
charges 66 cents for first-class postage, Switzerland 65 cents, 
France, 53 cents, Italy, 48 cents and Britain 44 cents. On the 
other hand, the rate is 30 cents in Canada and 23 cents in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. stamp price goes up for the basic one-ounce  
letter, for heavier letters there is a one-cent reduction -- to 22 
cents -- in the charge for each additional ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	That means someone sending a two-ounce letter would pay 55  
cents, the same as at present. And a three ounce missive, say a 
long letter with some photos, would cost 77 cents, a penny less 
than current rates. The current rates took effect Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rates cover most types of mail. In other typical price  
changes a priority mail package will rise from $3 to $3.20; sending 
a local newspaper will cost 15.7 cents, up from 14.5 cents; the 
price to mail a national magazine will rise from 27.1 cents to 29.1 
cents and a basic parcel post package that cost $2.42 to send will 
rise to $2.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase does have a somewhat complicated impact on the  
special stamp issued last year to raise money for research on 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamp costs 40 cents and is valid for 32-cents postage, with  
up to 8 cents going to research. 
</P>
<P>
	That stamp will remain on sale for 40 cents, and starting Sunday  
will be valid for 33 cents postage, meaning that up to 7 cents will 
go to research for each stamp sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, breast cancer stamps sold before Sunday remain  
valid for just 32-cents postage and people using them after Sunday 
should add a 1-cent stamp to cover the new rate. But, practically 
speaking, the post office has no way of knowing then the stamp was 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's rate increase does not affect international mail.  
</P>
<P>
	An increase is expected in July for some mail going overseas,  
though for half-ounce letters to most countries the price is 
expected to remain at the current 60 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The only expected increase for a foreign letter will be for mail  
to Canada, which now costs 46 cents for the first half-ounce. That 
new rate has not been announced.

<HEADLINE> Drayton Doubtful To Face Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The sprained right ankle of Miami tight end  
Troy Drayton still was severely swollen Wednesday, leaving the 
Dolphins to list him as doubtful for Saturday's AFC divisional 
playoff at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troy had more swelling than we anticipated,'' Dolphins coach  
Jimmy Johnson said. ``We took the cast off, and there still was 
significant swelling. He limped to the whirlpool pretty badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drayton was one of five Dolphins to miss practice Wednesday,  
including wide receiver O.J. McDuffie, still suffering from a 
sprained right foot suffered in Miami's 24-17 wild-card win over 
Buffalo. He hasn't missed a game since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	McDuffie, the NFL receiving leader with 90 catches during the  
regular season, was listed as questionable. Long snapper Frank 
Wainright, a backup tight end, was doubtful with a separated right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing practice were linebacker Larry Izzo, out while  
recovering from knee surgery, and tackle Richmond Webb, listed as 
probable with the aftereffects from surgery on his left triceps. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you take three or four starters out of the lineup, it's  
hard to have continuity,'' said Johnson, who hoped to have Webb and 
McDuffie back in workouts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury situation could mean a busy day for backup tight end  
Ed Perry, who takes over Wainright's long-snapping duties. Perry 
performed some long snapping last season, including the Dolphins' 
playoff loss to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing everything this week,'' Perry joked. ``It all  
depends on who's in the game, what formations we have. It's an 
opportunity to show what I can do -- play tight end, H-back, long 
snapper.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Wants Out of Dragging Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- The attorney for one of three men accused  
of dragging a black man to his death has asked to be taken off the 
case because his client has ignored advice and been uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Haden Cribbs filed a motion seeking to withdraw from the case  
after his client, William J. King, refused to attend a pretrial 
hearing Wednesday. The judge could have forced King to attend but 
declined to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputy Curtis Frame testified that King, in a diatribe  
filled with curses and insults against Cribbs, said he had no 
intention of going to the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is one of three ex-convicts facing capital murder  
charges in the June dragging death of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd was beaten, chained to a pickup and dragged to his death  
along a rural road near Jasper. The three defendants are accused of 
killing the 49-year-old man because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Pat Hardy said prosecutors will  
fight Cribbs' motion because there are fewer than 10 certified 
lawyers in southeast Texas qualified to defend death penalty cases 
and Cribbs is one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
	King's trial is scheduled for Jan. 25. It was unclear whether  
the trial would be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial dates have not yet been set for the other two defendants,  
Shawn Berry, 23, and Russell Brewer, 31.

<HEADLINE> United Increasing Dulles Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- United Airlines will increase service  
from the Washington D.C. area more than 60 percent by May, the 
Chicago-based carrier announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest airline plans to add 44 flights a day from  
Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia, bringing the 
total to 117. 
</P>
<P>
	United and United Express, an affiliated short-haul carrier run  
by Atlantic Coast Airlines Inc., already represent the largest 
operation at Dulles, according to Tara Hamilton, a spokeswoman for 
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	United reduced flights at Dulles in 1993, but has reversed  
course amid rapid business and residential growth in northern 
Virginia. Thanks to the tremendous success of America Online, which 
is based in Dulles, Va., the area has become a major center of 
Internet-oriented business. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the past decade the region has developed into one of  
the country's most dynamic business and residential centers, and 
customer and economic studies tell us the time is now right to 
move,'' said Gerald Greenwald, United's chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, United's move comes a month after US Airways, based in  
Arlington, Va., brought its low-fare MetroJet to Dulles to compete 
with Delta Express and AirTran and announced plans to expand in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to expand service at Dulles, United's only hub east  
of Chicago, had lagged recently while the airline focused on 
expansion in Los Angeles, said Rono Dutta, United's senior vice 
president for planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion will raise the average number of daily flights to  
Boston from four to 14.5 in April. The number of flights to Atlanta 
will grow from two to seven in May. Flights to New York's La 
Guardia will grow from 2.5 to eight in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few months, United will likely start shuttle service out of  
Dulles to such high-traffic points as New York, Boston and Atlanta, 
Dutta said.

<HEADLINE> White Names AP Defensive Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Reggie White played like he was a young  
man in 1998, capping his illustrious career as The Associated Press 
NFL Defensive Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won the award in 1987 while with the Philadelphia  
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	So, which does he consider the greater accomplishment,  
collecting 21 sacks in 12 games in '87 at age 25 or 16 sacks at age 
36 in his farewell season? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the highlight,'' White said without  
hesitation. ``Back then I was young. This is probably a bigger 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, who planned to retire a year ago, came back to the Green  
Bay Packers for one last season and led the NFC with 16 sacks. He 
also served as an off-field teacher for young defensive linemen 
Vonnie Holliday and Keith McKenzie, who finished with eight sacks 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie this year was phenomenal,'' Packers quarterback Brett  
Favre said. ``No one expected him, first of all, to play in the 
offseason, then he comes back and everyone's like, `Well, he'll 
give us his five, six sacks and his leadership in the locker room.' 
But he just blew everybody away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No player has retired after winning the defensive or offensive  
player of the year award, but two MVPs did -- Norm Van Brocklin, 
co-winner in 1960, and Jim Brown in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	White, the most honored defensive end in NFL history, insisted  
once again Wednesday that this was it, even though he said he 
thought he could play until he was 40. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some people who don't understand how I could walk away  
from the game having as good a year as I did, and No. 2 how I could 
walk away from so much money,'' said White, who could have made 
another $5 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
	White recently was voted to the All-Pro team for the seventh  
time. The 37-year-old defensive end is the career sacks leader with 
192 1/2 and is generally recognized as the first significant 
free-agent signing of the 1990s, when he left the Eagles for Green 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers general manager Ron Wolf has said White's signing  
convinced other players to come to Green Bay, which won the Super 
Bowl after the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go out on top like this is an honor and a privilege that  
God would allow me to come through and play the way I did,'' said 
White, an ordained minister who around football is known as the 
``Minister of Defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play for the people who doubted me. When the Lord  
spoke to me about coming back, that was the only reason I came 
back. No. 2, all of us have team goals and individual goals; my 
prayer was that God would make me defensive player of the year and 
to get 16 sacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press during training camp  
when the pain from his bad back began to diminish, White predicted 
exactly that: ``I'm not coming back to be a part-time player or 
have a mediocre season. I told God, `If You're telling me to come 
back, let me have a great season.' My goals are 16 sacks and to be 
Defensive Player of the Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hadn't had that many sacks in a decade.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's come to pass and I praise the Lord for it,'' White said.  
``It's an honor not only to go out my last year being Defensive 
Player of the Year and of course ... being the only Packer to ever 
be Defensive Player of the Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White easily won the award in balloting by a nationwide panel of  
47 sports writers and broadcasters. He received 20 votes, far ahead 
of Minnesota tackle John Randle's six. 
</P>
<P>
	Next in the voting were Miami linebacker Zach Thomas and New  
England cornerback Ty Law with four, and Dallas cornerback Deion 
Sanders, who received three votes despite missing the final month 
of the season with a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
	White began playing pro football in the USFL and spent 14  
seasons in the NFL. He says he has no fear of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people who don't have a purpose, they end up  
dying twice,'' White said. ``They don't know what they're going to 
do. I think that's why among ex-athletes, the divorce rate is so 
high because they left the game with no purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a purpose, No. 1 my family, my wife and my kids. I want  
to spend more time with my kids. I want to go to their basketball 
games more, go to their band concerts more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in five years, he can head for Canton and the Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, White will focus on sacking sin and not quarterbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably more excited about doing the things that He's  
called me to do than I have been about playing football,'' White 
said. ``Because I know and I believe it's going to help a lot of 
people, and that's all I really ever wanted to do.''

<HEADLINE> Ozolinsh Returns to Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A 30-minute skate-around left Sandis Ozolinsh  
winded and dripping with sweat. It did nothing to subdue his smile 
as he returned to the ice following a contentious four-month 
contract dispute with the Colorado Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be back,'' Ozolinsh said Wednesday, less than 24  
hours after agreeing to a two-year contract with Colorado. ``I was 
so excited, I couldn't sleep a minute last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh's return concluded a 3 1/2-month dispute that included  
trade demands, countless accusations and unwavering stubbornness on 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh, a three-time all-star defenseman, sought a contract in  
the neighborhood of $4 million per season, while the Avalanche 
countered with a three-year, $10 million offer they eventually 
lowered as Ozolinsh missed more games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix and Ozolinsh  
reached a compromise late Tuesday, striking a deal that will pay 
Ozolinsh $6.75 million through the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't count how much money I lost,'' said Ozolinsh, who was  
a restricted free agent. ``I didn't really care about it. Basically 
it's a principle and being treated as I thought was fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Avalanche saved more than $3 million because of  
Ozolinsh's initial rejection of a $10 million contract, neither 
side could claim much of a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, which played Florida on Wednesday night, was 17-18-3  
without Ozolinsh and has been inconsistent on the power play, 
suffering from a recent 0-for-27 slump before scoring with a man 
advantage in six straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Avalanche have the NHL's 12th-ranked power play at  
16.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``During a situation like this, there is no winner,'' Lacroix  
said. ``During the negotiation there was never an intention to beat 
the other party. We didn't have that in mind and I am sure they 
didn't have that in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Ozolinsh as their point man last season, the Avs converted  
17.4 percent of their power-play chances, and Ozolinsh's 35 points 
on the power play ranked third in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to bring a lot of offensive scoring chances to  
us,'' coach Bob Hartley said. ``We're going to exploit his style to 
the maximum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado had scored a power-play goal in six straight games  
entering Wednesday and will have to manage a few more days without 
Ozolinsh as he gets back into shape following several months of 
playing golf and working out with his junior team in Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to practice 5-on-5 and get more contact where I have to  
make quick decisions, then we'll see,'' Ozolinsh said. ``I'm in 
pretty good shape. I actually played golf a bit. Hey, that's a 
sport. They show it on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh's holdout was the second of his career. After failing  
to reach an agreement with San Jose before the 1995-96 season, the 
Sharks traded him to Colorado for right wing Owen Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh spent much of the latest dispute at his home in Riga,  
Latvia, where temperatures dropped to minus-14 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he is under contract, Ozolinsh insists that the chill  
also is gone from his icy dispute with Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never personal,'' Ozolinsh said. ``It was business.  
We're not calling anybody names.''

<HEADLINE> Modem Maker Hayes Shuts Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- On its World Wide Web site, Hayes Corp. has been  
offering limited edition, high-speed modems signed by the company's 
founder to mark its 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	There won't be a 21st anniversary.  
</P>
<P>
	The company that pioneered personal-computer modems is shutting  
down, after time ran out on efforts to find a buyer to pull it out 
of federal bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 250 employees were laid off Monday, leaving only a skeleton  
team at a company that once employed 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there hasn't been a formal bankruptcy liquidation, Ron  
Howard, Hayes' chief executive officer, told The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution the company is closing down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is being liquidated,'' Howard said in a story  
published Tuesday. ``The company is no longer being operated as a 
going concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company sought protection from creditors in October, in its  
second trip to Bankruptcy Court in the 1990s, and attempted a 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as it 
talked to potential buyers. But its primary lender notified the 
company it wouldn't continue funding efforts to keep Hayes alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes Corp. owes some $42 million to creditors that include  
NationsCredit, Lucent Technologies and Rockwell Semiconductor 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach the company for comment were unsuccessful.  
</P>
<P>
	Hayes had been heading toward demise for months. There had  
already been hundreds of layoffs since the Oct. 9 Chapter 11 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which had emerged from an earlier Chapter 11  
reorganization in 1996, had reported a net loss of $17.6 million 
for the first half of 1998 before its second filing in federal 
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes merged in 1997 with Access Beyond, a Gaithersburg,  
Md.-based company headed by Howard. Howard took over leadership of 
Hayes, focusing on digital and other new technologies. But the 
company's slow response to faster modems and the Asian economic 
crisis undercut turnaround efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, from pioneering industry standards, they had  
opportunities that, with hindsight now, they did not follow up 
on,'' said Benn Konsynski, a professor at Emory University's 
Goizueta School of Business. ``There are a lot of 
`could-have-beens' with that story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes hit a peak of $250 million in annual revenue, but was  
overtaken in the field by U.S. Robotics, and entered Chapter 11 in 
1994. Co-founder Dennis Hayes, who underwent a costly and bitter 
divorce in 1988, argued successfully against takeover bids as his 
company emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes stock had gone over $13 a share a year ago, but nose-dived  
to trade at only pennies per share in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes was a 29-year-old engineer when he and a partner worked on  
his dining room table to create home-use modems. His company began 
in 1978, and soon, Hayes modems and ``Hayes-compatible'' became 
part of the industry language.

<HEADLINE> Deal Sought on 'Full' Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans hope to compel testimony by  
Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and other witnesses at President 
Clinton's trial, lawmakers said Wednesday. White House officials 
made an unexpected night visit to the Capitol to discuss ground 
rules for the first presidential impeachment proceedings in 130 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the opening day of the 106th Congress, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., expressed optimism that agreement was near on 
a procedure for a ``full trial ... and votes on articles of 
impeachment at the end of the process.'' One GOP source, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said it would probably be February at 
the earliest before votes are taken on the president's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats vowed opposition to any plan to call witnesses, and  
insisted they had not been presented with a written proposal for 
conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	By a vote of the GOP-controlled House last year, the nation's  
42nd president stands accused of two articles of impeachment 
alleging perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with 
attempts to conceal his sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> No Time for O'Meara to Enjoy Wins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Mark O'Meara could use a break more than  
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Not because he traveled more than 60,000 miles during a  
five-week stretch after the Tour Championship. Not because the 
oldest man to win two majors in one year will turn 42 next week and 
his bones are starting to creak. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara is coming off the kind of season he never dreamed  
possible, especially this late in his career. All he'd like now is 
some time to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he and 29 other PGA Tour champions from last year are  
getting the new season started today in the Mercedes Championships 
on the Plantation Course at the Kapalua Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, having the shortest offseason in the history of  
professional sports -- the Presidents Cup ended only 24 days ago -- 
has an upside for O'Meara in that it feels like his dream season is 
still going. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot of fun,'' O'Meara said Wednesday. ``I know that  
'99 has come around, and there wasn't a whole lot of time off. I 
don't feel very tired. Even at the end of the year, when I traveled 
around the world, I was still mentally fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll keep playing well. We'll see what '99 holds.''  
</P>
<P>
	Can it possibly get better than '98?  
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara didn't just win the Masters, ending an 0-for-56 in the  
majors, he won the British Open and then almost matched Ben Hogan 
with three majors in one year until he came up short in the final 
round of the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't just win two majors, he walked away with the World  
Match Play Championship in England by rallying on the back nine to 
beat Tiger Woods. And not long after winning the PGA Tour player of 
year, he hauled in a record $430,000 in winning the Skins Game. 
</P>
<P>
	What will 1999 hold for O'Meara?  
</P>
<P>
	``My whole game plan is to set my sights on the U.S. Open and  
PGA,'' he said with a sneaky grin. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara refused to label himself as a great golfer, even after  
winning the British Open. But to be able to join Gene Sarazen, 
Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player as the only players to win all 
four majors would be different. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be pretty cool,'' O'Meara said. ``If I did that,  
I'll put myself in that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, O'Meara clearly feels less pressure now than if he had  
won two majors in a season at age 28. Last year was a bonus for 18 
years of grinding, and while O'Meara will not be satisfied without 
winning, he won't let a dry spell spoil everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I'm not a young stud,'' He said. ``I'm kind of winding  
down my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't a good time for anyone to wind down a career, not  
with a $134 million in purses -- up 40 percent from last year -- that 
includes the three new World Golf Championship events, each worth 
$5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``With new purses and new tournaments, those make it more  
exciting,'' U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen said. ``If you work hard 
this year and go out with a good attitude, you can do something for 
yourself. This has the potential to be an incredible year for 
somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts today in an idyllic setting in Maui, where Phil  
Mickelson will try to defend his title and increase his streak to 
seven straight years with at least one victory, the longest streak 
on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, golf is going prime time. Because of the five-hour  
difference between Hawaii and Eastern Standard Time, all four 
rounds of the Mercedes Championships will be televised by ESPN in 
the evening for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that will be good,'' Fred Couples said. ``Get home  
from work, turn on the tube and we're on -- especially since a lot 
of those states just got a foot or two of snow, and they'll see us 
playing in 80 degrees. I'd watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe those who tune in will see a 41-year-old man, slightly  
balding and gray around the edges, playing the game like he hasn't 
woke up from a dream.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Relieved Lockout Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The players wore white furs, leather jackets and  
diamond stud earrings along with the big blue buttons urging unity 
between the NBA and the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans squealed at the sight of Shaquille O'Neal and Charles  
Barkley. And commissioner David Stern came to try to heal the 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone in the NBA began to make up Wednesday. The league and  
its players had finally reached an agreement to end the nasty 
6-month-old lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all family again,'' New Jersey's Jayson Williams said.  
``Guys are wearing buttons with 'Solid' written on them, showing 
both sides are together again. This game won't have to go through 
something like this again for seven more years. And hopefully, I'll 
be retired then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the way the day was supposed to go.  
</P>
<P>
	Players who had flown in from all over the country late Tuesday  
and early Wednesday woke up at their hotels expecting to go their 
union's law office to vote on whether they supported the 
negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But as they shuttled over to the Manhattan offices next to the  
famous FAO Schwarz toy store, they began to hear news of a deal 
from fans and taxi radios. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxious to learn details, more than 200 players waded through a  
sea of cameras, tourists and workers on lunch break to get into the 
General Motors Building lobby, which looks less like a union hall 
and more like Kenny Anderson's garage before the lockout forced him 
to reduce his fleet of luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, these millionaires are far from typical union  
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	From the scores of fans desperately seeking autographs from any  
player -- from Kobe Bryant to Austin Croshere -- it appears as if the 
hard feelings over the lockout will end someday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the players know that it will take more than  
rim-rocking dunks and ankle-breaking crossover dribbles to win back 
NBA fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I don't care,'' said one fan while checking out  
his loot of autographs. ``I'll watch because I'm a basketball fan, 
but I'd rather watch college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players don't blame fans who may be bitter about a dispute  
over how to divide $2 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably will be lukewarm at first and some may be  
hostile,'' Chicago's Steve Kerr said. ``I can't blame them one bit. 
They are the ones who suffered the most during this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mood among the players in the 25th-floor conference room was  
calm as they gathered for their ratification vote -- in sharp 
contrast to the divisions that had been building among factions of 
players over the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a contentious vote over whether players supported  
their union, they voted on whether to approve the new deal. It 
passed, 179-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Williams, one of the union's biggest critics, talked  
peacefully with union president Patrick Ewing and negotiating 
committee member Alonzo Mourning -- whom he had criticized for the 
union's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the players ratified the proposal, Stern and deputy  
commissioner Russ Granik arrived to begin the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that both sides had to make concessions if we  
wanted to play again,'' said Vancouver's Shareef Abdur-Rahim, a 
second-year player who stands to lose millions of dollars under the 
deal. ``Regardless of how much I make, I'm making more money than I 
could ever without playing. It's good to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the only outward sign of a labor dispute was when  
locked-out ABC technicians tried to disrupt interviews by 
replacement crews by holding flyers in front of cameras and yelling 
``Don't talk to ABC scabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the details of their dispute, because I have my  
own situation to worry about,'' said Phil Barreca, a locked-out ABC 
electrician. ``The levels of money are obviously different, but it 
is still a classic labor dispute.''

<HEADLINE> Phillips Petro To Cut 1,400 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) -- In the latest sign of trouble in the  
oil industry, Phillips Petroleum Co. is cutting 1,400 jobs 
worldwide to save money in the face of slumped oil and chemical 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the eliminated jobs will be in exploration and  
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, which employs 17,200 workers worldwide, plans to  
eliminate 550 jobs from its foreign operations and 850 positions in 
the United States. About 400 jobs are expected to be cut at its 
Bartlesville headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp drop in crude oil prices to 12-year lows has been  
wreaking havoc on the oil industry, resulting in widespread layoffs 
and mergers as companies attempt to keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Allen, chairman and chief executive officer, said  
Wednesday that the plans are expected to produce annual cost 
savings of about $230 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes in the face of historically low margins  
in oil and some chemical sectors, and Allen said the company 
anticipates no improvement in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot visualize year after year after year of these  
unhealthy type margins,'' Allen said. ``I can't tell you absolutely 
that this is the bottom, but we haven't seen anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said more cost reductions will be realized once a joint  
venture between Phillips and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies have announced plans to create a new company,  
Diamond 66, with more than 12,000 gas stations and convenience 
stores in 36 states and Canada. The deal is expected to close in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips previously announced 500 job cuts in Bartlesville as a  
result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Phillips rose $1.18 3/4 to $43.81 1/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Small-Businesses Shun Y2K Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While major corporations and government agencies  
race to prepare their computer systems for the year 2000, one-third 
of small business owners plan to do nothing, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the holdouts say the expense and the time required to  
upgrade systems and software is too heavy a burden for a small 
business to bear. The solution for many is simply to throw their 
computer out and buy a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1.5 million owners of small businesses, from accounting  
firms to restaurants to jewelry makers, said they haven't taken any 
action to prevent the dreaded millennium bug, according to the 
study by the National Federation of Independent Business, a 
small-business trade group 
</P>
<P>
	The year 2000 problem stems from the fact that many computer  
calendars are programmed to recognize just the last two digits of a 
year. Machines that haven't been upgraded are likely to interpret 
Jan. 1, 2000, as Jan. 1, 1900. That could cause massive computer 
failures, lost data, or broken connections with clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Nagle, owner of Eli's Bar and Grill in Minneapolis, isn't  
worried, although he uses computers to track his inventory and 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not flying airplanes or building pacemakers,'' Nagle  
said. ``It's not a major concern.'' Nagle expects to buy a new 
computer some time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagle sounds just like many small-business owners, said William  
Dennis, a senior research fellow at the NFIB. While some feel the 
problem is not serious enough to devote time or money to fixing, 
others aren't sure where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Price, owner of a pipe- and sewer-cleaning business in  
Binghamton, N.Y., said preparing for Y2K is more challenging for a 
small business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a big company, someone on staff is bound to be very  
computer-literate,'' he said. ``I don't have time to be a hacker 
and learn all the intricacies of my computer. If it does what I 
need it to do, I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Price has purchased a new computer with updated  
software, and he plans to buy another new one before Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-nine percent of businesses surveyed said their most  
important software was less than two years old, and another 8 
percent said their software was two to five years old. Most of this 
newer software is Y2K-compatible, or is easy to upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFIB study, conducted in late October, was an update of a  
survey done in April 1998. The study found marked improvement since 
April, with 900,000 respondents saying they had addressed the 
problem between April and October. Another 925,000 business owners 
said they have made plans to upgrade their systems. In all, 
one-third of small businesses have completed their preparations for 
Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFIB estimates one in five small businesses doesn't use a  
computer. But virtually all of them have suppliers or clients who 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smaller businesses do need to watch for the ripple effect from  
other companies they deal with,'' said Shawn Bohner, a vice 
president with Meta Group, a Stamford, Conn., consulting company 
which helps companies deal with Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Vikki Nelson, owner of Jarnel Iron &AMP; Forge in Hagerstown, Md.,  
doesn't require much technology for the wrought-iron and bronze 
fixtures she crafts. She uses her year-old computer for 
recordkeeping and for receiving architectural drawings from 
clients, and she believes she and her clients are ready for Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she worries whether her bank is prepared and whether her  
local utility will be able to supply power when the calendar 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis said the small-business owners who have yet to deal with  
the problem should start scheduling help now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something does go wrong, you will find no one to help you  
on Jan. 2, 2000,'' he said. ``The large firms are lining up the 
talent.''

<HEADLINE> Riley, Chargers Still Talking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mike Riley's interview for the San Diego  
Chargers' coaching job dragged on into a second day, although it 
remained clear that the position is his if he feels comfortable 
inheriting several assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said late Wednesday afternoon that he had no reservations  
about the makeup of his staff. A deal making him the fourth 
Chargers' coach in as many seasons didn't seem far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's some, I suppose, t's to cross and i's to  
dot,'' Riley said. ``I'm hopeful, I'll say that. ... Within 24 
hours, I think we'll be able to say that one way or another,'' 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Beathard is insisting that Riley, the  
coach at Oregon State, retain defensive coordinator Joe Pascale and 
his staff, as well as offensive line coach Joe Bugel and running 
backs coach Ollie Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's defense was one of the few bright spots in an  
otherwise dismal 5-11 season, ranking first in fewest yards allowed 
overall and against the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, it isn't that simple because this is a little  
different situation, just because of coming in and not bringing all 
your own guys,'' Beathard said Wednesday. ``He wants to make sure 
it's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley hadn't met with all of the assistants as of Wednesday  
afternoon, Beathard said, and wouldn't be able to meet with some of 
them until Thursday. Also, Riley's lawyer was tied up with 
something else, stalling contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard left the impression that Riley might want to bring some  
of his own guys with him, although he said Riley felt comfortable 
with Pascale. 
</P>
<P>
	But Riley said there are no hangups there, and that he told his  
Oregon State staff that, obviously, not all of them could come to 
San Diego if he got the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the thing that's been good in this day today is that  
we've got a lot of cards on the table and all those things have 
been settled and there are no hangups in that regard in my mind,'' 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was just as optimistic as he was when he arrived in town on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great about it. There's no negatives in this deal. It's  
great to be able to talk to all these folks,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get to the point where you think it's the right guy,  
you just get nervous about everything and you just want it to get 
done,'' Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was 8-14 in two seasons at Oregon State, including 5-6  
this year, the Beavers' best record since 1971. Oregon State, which 
hasn't had a winning season since 1970, lost by one point to 
Washington and California, played even with UCLA until the final 
minute and beat Oregon in double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	If he takes the job, Riley would inherit a team that's had three  
straight non-winning seasons and doesn't have a first-round draft 
pick until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers like Riley's offensive background -- he was coach of  
the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the pass-happy CFL from 1987-90, and 
offensive coordinator at Southern Cal from 1993 until taking the 
Oregon State job in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, they think he can develop quarterback Ryan Leaf, who was a  
bust on the field and a problem off it. 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard fired Kevin Gilbride on Oct. 13 after a 2-4 start, and  
interim coach June Jones took the coaching job at Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi To Supply Engine Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top space industry company will supply  
engine parts for Boeing's next-generation rocket development 
project, a company official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. will supply an engine valve and  
a fuel tank for use in Boeing's two-stage Delta 4 series of launch 
rockets, said Mitsubishi spokesman Yukiharu Terakawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Co., based in Seattle, Washington, is the world's No. 1  
aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
	Terakawa said Mitsubishi and Boeing reached a basic agreement on  
the supply of engine parts recently. But he said he could not 
comment ``at this stage'' on whether his company will fully 
participate in Boeing's rocket engine development project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai business daily reported Thursday that  
Mitsubishi has agreed with Boeing to jointly develop an engine for 
use in the Delta 4 rockets. Mitsubishi will be the first Japanese 
company to fully participate in a U.S. aerospace development 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the  
U.S. Department of Defense have been assisting in the development 
of the Delta 4, which will be used to launch military and 
commercial satellites starting in the early 21st century, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Heavy, Japan's largest comprehensive heavy machinery  
maker, will use the technological expertise it gained developing 
and assembling Japan's H-2 rockets for the Delta project. 
</P>
<P>
	With the joint development, the two companies plan to have an  
engine for the second-stage in the Delta 4 rocket available for 
commercial use in around 2005, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta 4 is expected to be priced at nearly $90 million per  
rocket, with demand at more than 100 rockets, the Nihon Keizai 
quoted industry sources as estimating. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Japan successfully launched a telecommunications  
satellite using its H-2 rocket, the first designed and produced by 
Japan. Previous Japanese rockets were based entirely on U.S. 
designs.

<HEADLINE> Full Courts Lead to Dropped Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Courts here are so clogged that murder charges  
were dismissed against four defendants because their trial in a 
1995 gangland slaying kept getting postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cases could be in trouble, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``This case would affect cases not just in Baltimore City, if  
that interpretation is to go forth, but cases through the state of 
Maryland,'' State's Attorney Patricia C. Jessamy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, which handles half of Maryland's crime, it is  
becoming increasingly difficult to assemble judges, prosecutors, 
defense attorneys and witnesses for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dealing with a criminal justice system currently that  
is totally overwhelmed,'' Jessamy said. ``The system will continue 
to be strained unless we get additional resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Roger W. Brown dismissed the charges Tuesday  
against the four accused in the October 1995 murder of Shawn L. 
Suggs, 21, saying the long wait for trial ``boggles the 
imagination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On six occasions, defense attorneys or witnesses were  
unavailable. On six other occasions, the court was unavailable. One 
postponement came after one of the state's main witnesses was slain 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Attorney General's office is appealing the ruling  
</P>
<P>
	Brown's ruling was based on a Dec. 7 decision by an appellate  
court, which threw out the conviction of a Baltimore man charged 
with sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl. The case was postponed 
nine times over 19 months, including seven occasions when a judge 
was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are unaware of any case that even approaches this level of  
delay,'' the Court of Special Appeals wrote. ``Serial postponements 
of trial due to the unavailability of the court is the equivalent 
of the failure to assign any trial date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, prosecutors must bring a defendant to trial  
within six months unless a judge postpones the case for ``good 
cause.'' But the appellate court's ruling has altered what may 
constitute good cause in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Homicide detectives were extremely frustrated to see their work  
go down the drain, said police spokesman Robert Weinhold. A 
spokesman for Mayor Kurt Schmoke said the mayor hoped there would 
be no more cases so severe that they have to be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's not known how many cases could be affected by the  
ruling, there are several cases for which the trial date has been 
repeatedly postponed. According to The (Baltimore) Sun, William 
Flowers, scheduled for a first-degree murder trial this Friday, has 
had his court date postponed 15 times over three years. Ridgely 
Bond, also charged with first-degree murder, racked up 13 delays in 
more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges, prosecutors and other court officials say they've been  
working to try to streamline the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone agrees that drugs are behind the clogged courts and  
jails. Drugs also are blamed for Baltimore's murder rate -- one of 
the highest in the nation -- which has topped 300 for the past nine 
years.

<HEADLINE> Courtrooms Full, Charges Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Murder charges were dismissed against four  
defendants because their trial was postponed repeatedly, often 
because no courtroom space was available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vengeance is not mine,'' said retired schoolteacher Mamie  
Suggs, whose only child, 21-year-old Shawn L. Suggs, was killed in 
October 1995. ``I can't do one thing to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Roger W. Brown ordered the cases dismissed on  
Tuesday because the trial of the four had been delayed for three 
years, so long it ``boggles the imagination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they are considering appealing Tuesday's  
ruling, which dropped charges against Donte Spivey, 22; William 
Harrison, 21; Stacey Wilson, 29; and Jay Anderson, 30. They were 
accused of ambushing Suggs and shooting him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The trials of the four were postponed 12 times after their  
speedy trial deadline had passed. Trials are supposed to be held 
within six months of a defendant's first court appearance. Six 
times, a court was unavailable, and in the other six instances, 
defense attorneys, prosecutors or witnesses were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's ruling was based on a recent decision by the state Court  
of Special Appeals, which threw out the sex crime conviction of a 
man because his case had been postponed nine times for lack of a 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The circuit courts may not avoid (speedy trial) requirements  
by assigning trial dates that have no practical meaning,'' said the 
ruling by the court, the state's second highest. ``The serial 
postponements of trial due to the unavailability of the court is 
the equivalent of the failure to assign any trial date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How many other cases could be affected by the ruling was not  
immediately clear, said Circuit Judge David B. Mitchell, the 
administrative judge for the criminal docket. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the  
possibilities are,'' Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court system currently has a backlog of more than 5,500  
criminal cases, and 43 percent of cases heard in the first 10 
months of 1998 in Baltimore were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy State's Attorney Haven Kodeck said the dismissal  
highlights the need for additional funds for the court system, but 
his office will also do what it can to tighten procedures and speed 
up the handling of cases.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Install Crash Sensors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has found a way to make air bags  
deploy more safely by using a computer that senses the car's speed, 
the weight and positions of the people inside and the severity of 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, introduced Wednesday at the North American  
International Auto Show, addresses the threat air bags may pose to 
small children and adults in minor accidents and people who aren't 
wearing their seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although air bags have saved thousands of lives, their explosive  
inflation also has been blamed in dozens of deaths, mostly of 
children and small women. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving beyond mechanical devices for occupant safety  
and are now adding to the mix a fully integrated, computer-driven 
system that `thinks' about and responds to different conditions,'' 
said Neil Ressler, chief technical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elements of the Advanced Restraints System will begin appearing  
on cars and light trucks at no extra cost beginning with year 2000 
models that will arrive in showrooms later this year, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within three years, all elements of the system should be on all  
new Fords sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will use two-stage air bags that will expand at full  
force in higher speed crashes, or more slowly in lower-speed 
wrecks. If the driver is closer to the air bag, as determined by 
seat position, the air bag will inflate more slowly. It also will 
adjust the front passenger's air bag depending on the passenger's 
weight -- more so for the heavy, less for small children. 
</P>
<P>
	In severe crashes, the system will initially tighten the seat  
belts, while measuring the pressure on the occupant to avoid 
crushing the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every accident is as unique as the individuals involved,''  
said Helen Petrauskas, vice president of environmental and safety 
engineering. ``Bearing that in mind, Ford has worked hard to 
develop a safety system that can provide people of different sizes, 
facing various types of frontal crash situations a restraints 
system that automatically tailors itself based on certain crash 
conditions.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Charlie Trotter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charlie Trotter may be providing guidance to  
thousands of home chefs through his half-dozen cookbooks and new 
television show, but the truth is, he cooks only with himself in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Trotter goes out and finds ingredients that he wants to eat,  
prepares them they way he likes them, and hopes that others will 
like them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	He calls himself a ``food minimalist'' -- though he can't resist  
all that is indulgent. He has a weakness for ice cream, chocolate, 
olive oil and anchovies. Such foods, he says, enhance the pleasure 
of a meal without overshadowing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Trotter, 39, was never formally trained as a chef. He began  
cooking for his roommates at the University of Wisconsin, where he 
studied political philosophy. His only formal training came during 
a brief stay at a culinary institute in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he opened Charlie Trotter's in Chicago 11 years ago,  
Trotter has become a national food star. The restaurant's printed 
menu is short on choices, but there's a heavy emphasis on tasting 
menus developed daily by Trotter and his team. The meal follows a 
plan that flows from course to course with complementary flavors, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of a dinner averages $90, and there's a four-month  
wait for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kitchen Sessions With Charlie Trotter'' is his latest  
project, a 13-part cooking series on public television stations 
that began airing on Jan. 2 (check local listings). There is a 
companion cookbook published by Ten Speed Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten Speed Press also recently published ``Charlie Trotter's  
Desserts,'' and Trotter has launched a line of specialty sauces. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent visit to Manhattan for Celebrity Chef Week on ``Live  
With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee,'' Trotter took a break to answer some 
questions about his restaurant and food trends for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Are you still cooking on the line at the restaurant every  
night? 
</P>
<P>
	Trotter: I'm in the kitchen 240 nights a year, and I'll jump  
into the line if they need me, but I also know that I can affect 
the greater good of the restaurant by devising the menus and 
pairing the foods with wines. I don't really like to work the 
dining room, but I'll go out and talk to people if they ask for me. 
My mother works in the restaurant on Friday and Saturday nights and 
she is like the grande dame of the restaurant. Customers love her. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Did your taste for cooking come from your mother?  
</P>
<P>
	Trotter: We weren't really a food-oriented family, although my  
mother was ahead of her time because we ate fish two or three times 
a week. We were also allowed very little junk food and dessert was 
on Sunday only. We didn't go to restaurants often -- usually only 
for Mother's Day and birthdays. I used to think the restaurants 
were fancy, but they probably weren't. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Do customers ever resist some of the more unusual and  
sophisticated items on your menu? 
</P>
<P>
	Trotter: One table might be loving something and another might  
not fathom eating something like sweetbreads or lamb's tongue or 
even fois gras. We're not going to force things on people. If 
someone doesn't like something I'm happy to work around it. But I 
also issue a guarantee: If this is not the finest dining experience 
of your life, there's no check. So if we meet resistance, there is 
always that guarantee. And I've never had to buy dinner for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	4. What will be the food trends in 1999?  
</P>
<P>
	Trotter: More and more people are going to want to eat  
healthfully, but also flavorfully. People also want sensual and 
satisfying food. When you read the newspaper, two or three times a 
week there is a doctor telling you to eat less of this and more of 
that. I don't think there are too many people who make wholesale 
lifestyle changes based on that, but little by little, it starts to 
sink in. You'll also see a greater proliferation of ethnic 
influences to the Western European cuisine we're accustomed to. 
We're going to see a lot more Asian, Indian and Middle Eastern 
influences. They're more accessible now and people like variety. 
</P>
<P>
	5. How can people change their diets to be more healthful?  
</P>
<P>
	Trotter: Eliminate snacking in between meals and eliminate  
processed foods. I think they're part of our obesity problem. The 
body has a hard time digesting processed, synthesized foods. The 
body can much better digest skin on duck that's real fat than 
so-called low-fat items. Also, don't eat as much cream or butter. 
I'm also not from the school of 'don't use butter or cream' at all. 
But part of the reason we don't use much cream -- except for ice 
cream -- or butter is because they mute the flavors. You'll end up 
with a much more explosive cuisine without them.

<HEADLINE> New Postal Rates Take Effect Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cost of sending most letters will rise by  
a penny to 33 cents on Sunday despite a four-year run of strong 
profits by the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal officials said the increase is needed because rising  
costs are eating into income. 
</P>
<P>
	``After four years, we needed a small increase that was just  
enough to continue our investments to maintain quality customer and 
delivery service,'' said Frank P. Brennan, postal vice president 
for corporate relations. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also cost more to mail newspapers, magazines and most  
packages, although the price of mailing heavier letters will fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's increase had been expected to take effect last summer.  
It was postponed at the urging of the Postal Rate Commission and 
Congress, which noted the continuing strong profits being rung up 
by the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the post office made a profit of $550 million for the  
fiscal year that ended in September, following three years of 
profits of more than $1 billion. The Postal Service still faces 
about $4 billion in losses accumulated since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Robinson of the National Minority Business Council  
denounced the increase, saying the Postal Service did not offer 
``one good reason'' to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 33-cent stamp went on sale Tuesday, with first-day  
ceremonies in Los Angeles. The Chinese New Year stamp commemorates 
the year of the hare. In addition, there are millions of 
undenominated ``H'' rate stamps available at post offices to cover 
the 33-cent rate, as well as 1-cent stamps that can be added to 
leftover 32-centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail without enough postage will be delivered with postage due.  
If the recipient declines to pay the extra postage, the item will 
be returned to the sender. Most businesses refuse postage-due 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal officials said the domestic rate is a bargain compared  
with many other countries. Germany charges the equivalent of 66 
cents for first-class postage; Switzerland, 65 cents; France, 53 
cents; Italy, 48 cents; and Britain, 44 cents. On the other hand, 
the rate is 30 cents in Canada and 23 cents in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. stamp price goes up for the basic one-ounce  
letter, there is a 1-cent reduction -- to 22 cents -- for each 
additional ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	That means sending a 2-ounce letter would cost 55 cents, the  
same as now. A 3-ounce missive would cost 77 cents, a penny less 
than the rates that have been in effect since Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rates cover most types of mail. In other typical price  
changes, a priority mail package will rise from $3 to $3.20; 
sending a local newspaper will cost 15.7 cents, up from 14.5 cents; 
the cost of mailing a national magazine will rise from 27.1 cents 
to 29.1 cents; and a basic parcel post package that cost $2.42 to 
send will rise to $2.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase will not change the price of a special stamp issued  
last year to raise money for research on breast cancer, but it will 
affect the amount of money earmarked for that research. The stamp 
will still cost 40 cents, but up to 7 cents, a penny less, will go 
to research. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, breast cancer stamps sold before Sunday remain  
valid for just 32-cent postage and people using them after Sunday 
should add a 1-cent stamp to cover the new rate. But practically 
speaking, the post office has no way of knowing then the stamp was 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's rate increase does not affect international mail.  
</P>
<P>
	An increase is expected in July for some mail going overseas,  
though for half-ounce letters to most countries, the price is 
expected to remain at the current 60 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The only expected increase for a foreign letter will be for mail  
to Canada, which now costs 46 cents for the first half-ounce. That 
new rate has not been announced.

	NBA Owners, Players Reach a Deal  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA and the players' union reached an  
agreement today to end the 6-month-old lockout and save what's left 
of the season. A season of about 50 games will begin the first week 
of February, according to a source close to the talks. The union 
agreed to accept 55 percent of revenues in the fourth, fifth and 
sixth years of the agreement, a source close to the talks told The 
Associated Press. The NBA has an option for a seventh year, and the 
players would get 57 percent if it is exercised.

	Congress Opens With New Speaker  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 106th Congress opened today with the House  
choosing Rep. Dennis Hastert as its new speaker. The Illinois 
Republican promised a more bipartisan spirit. ``Solutions to 
problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness,'' Hastert said in 
his first speech as speaker, which he delivered from the well of 
the chamber rather than the speaker's chair in a gesture toward 
breaking down barriers between the leadership and the rank-and-file 
membership.

	Lott Planning Clinton Trial Outline  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said today  
he hoped to announce a framework for President Clinton's 
impeachment trial within 24 hours. But he cautioned the historic 
proceeding could stretch three weeks or more. Democrats vowed 
``universal, unanimous'' opposition to calling witnesses. 

</P>

	Butler Denies Monitors Spied for US  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. weapons inspectors may have helped  
Washington collect sensitive Iraqi communications to undermine 
Saddam Hussein's regime, newspapers reported. But the top inspector 
denied the allegations today. ``It's simply not true,'' Richard 
Butler said as he entered U.N. headquarters when asked about 
reports in The Washington Post and The Boston Globe that detailed 
such an operation but differed on certain elements of it. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Projects $76B Surplus  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration today projected a budget  
surplus of more than $76 billion for this year. ``We can say the 
era of big deficits is over,'' President Clinton said. The 
president, convening a White House ceremony to tout the figure, 
immediately squelched any speculation that the extra revenue would 
be used to cut taxes. 

</P>

	Pope Consecrates Nine Bishops  
</P>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II elevated nine men to  
bishop's rank today in an elaborate Epiphany service. The pontiff 
asked some of them to carry the church's mission to countries where 
it is met with mistrust or even violence. The consecration took 
place in St. Peter's Basilica, where the nine men prostrated 
themselves on a red carpet before the canopied altar. The new 
bishops include the Rev. Cesare Mazzolari, bound for Sudan.

	New Postal Rates Take Effect Sunday  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cost of sending most letters will rise by  
a penny to 33 cents on Sunday despite a four-year run of strong 
profits by the U.S. Postal Service. Postal officials said the 
increase is needed because rising costs are eating into income. 

</P>
<P>
	No Deaths on US Air Carriers in '98  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after the ValuJet and TWA 800  
crashes raised questions about safety, U.S. airlines finished 1998 
having none of their 615 million passengers die in an accident. It 
appears to be the first year since the dawn of commercial aviation 
for such an achievement.

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- David Boston, a second-team All-American  
who caught more passes than anyone else at Ohio State, announced 
today he will give up his senior season to make himself available 
for the NFL draft. Through his three seasons, Boston picked up Ohio 
State records for receptions in a game (14), season (85) and career 
(191), receiving yards in a season (1,435) and career (2,855) and 
touchdown catches in a career (34).

<HEADLINE> Annan: Arms Inspectors Helped US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- United Nations weapons inspectors may have  
been used to help collect sensitive Iraqi communications for U.S. 
efforts to undermine Saddam Hussein's regime, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe and The Washington Post quoted anonymous  
sources in today's editions as saying the electronic eavesdropping 
operation allowed U.S. intelligence agents to listen in on secret 
communications among military units responsible for the Iraqi 
leader's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post quoted confidants close to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi  
Annan as saying he is convinced Washington used the operation to 
penetrate the security apparatus protecting Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Los Angeles Times reported today that Annan has  
told key staff members he has no knowledge of the activities 
alleged by the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary-general has become aware of the fact that UNSCOM  
directly facilitated the creation of an intelligence collection 
system for the United States in violation of its mandate,'' one 
Annan adviser told the Post. ``The United Nations cannot be party 
to an operation to overthrow one of its member states. In the most 
fundamental way, that is what's wrong with the UNSCOM operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annan accumulated enough evidence on the eavesdropping, some  
through intermediaries passing on classified U.S. information, to 
ask Richard Butler, head of the weapons inspection team, about the 
reports last month, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to two of the confidants, Butler denied them to Annan.  
The newspaper quoted some Annan advisers as acknowledging that 
Annan would like to pressure Butler to resign in favor of a 
replacement who might win the consent of Iraq and its defenders on 
the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe quoted former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter, a  
former U.S. Marine, as saying, ``We knew a hell of a lot of 
information about presidential security.'' But Ritter said if his 
team found any information related to Hussein's personal safety, 
``we would dump it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we did, we did on our own initiative,'' Ritter said  
on NBC's ``Today.'' ``The United Nations was in total control.'' 
His inspection team, Ritter added, ``was not a party to any effort 
to overthrow the president of Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe said the surveillance equipment allowed U.N.  
inspectors to listen in on radio, cell phone and walkie-talkie 
communications by members of the Iraqi security network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe said Rolf Ekeus, former executive chairman of UNSCOM,  
declined to discuss operational elements of the system, but said 
the program was run and controlled by the United Nations 
inspectors, not the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter told the Globe that changed in March 1998 when the United  
States pressured British and Israeli intelligence to stop 
supporting the U.N. eavesdropping operation and took it over 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. decided this system is too sensitive to be run by  
UNSCOM,'' Ritter told the paper. ``They bulled their way in and 
took it over. Now any data collected by the activity is not being 
assessed by UNSCOM. Now, the U.S. gained 100 percent access and is 
not feeding any of it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of member states have assisted UNSCOM in various  
aspects of its work, and one of those is the United States,'' 
Butler told the Post Tuesday night. ``But as far as I am concerned 
I have always been assiduous in insisting that any assistance given 
to us be strictly related to our disarmament mandate. I have never 
approved of any assistance to any member state which would serve 
their unilateral purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Annan acknowledges that the eavesdropping operation was  
meant in part to aid inspectors looking for weapons of mass 
destruction, he also believes UNSCOM enabled the United States to 
listen in on some of the most sensitive communications of the 
Baghdad regime, his confidants told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, told the Post, ``We've already established that Saddam's 
personal security apparatus and the apparatus that conceals weapons 
of mass destruction are one and the same.'' Distinguishing between 
them would be impossible for intelligence-gathering efforts, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA, State Department and White House declined requests for  
formal comment.

<HEADLINE> John Travolta Enjoys His Renaissance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Travolta had just returned from Texas  
where he had been checked out to pilot his Boeing 707. He was still 
flying high. 
</P>
<P>
	Understandable.  
</P>
<P>
	He had fulfilled one of the great ambitions in his longtime  
pursuit of flying. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a new film headed for theaters this winter.  
</P>
<P>
	And he was resting comfortably among the half-dozen male film  
stars whose international appeal and ability to ``open'' a movie in 
its first weekend allow them to demand salaries of $20 million, 
plus benefits that can double that. 
</P>
<P>
	John Travolta remains a rarity among film stars. He roared to  
the heights with ``Saturday Night Fever,'' ``Grease'' and ``Urban 
Cowboy,'' and plummeted just as swiftly with a handful of bad 
choices. Now he's back on top again. 
</P>
<P>
	If you expect him to recall the down period with tales of  
depression and despair, forget it. His attitude remains upbeat, 
even serene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to make it more dramatic, but it wasn't,'' he  
insisted during an interview at a West Side hotel. ``I've always 
been too aware of the 'business' side of this (film) industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're a commodity, to some degree. If you choose the wrong  
projects, or they don't turn out the way you or the studio want 
them to, then your value or viability goes down, but only on a 
superficial level. Not your talent. Not your ability. OK? 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always aware of that, and all my choices I made on my  
own. I had no one to blame. So for the time that I wasn't getting 
the top scripts or getting as many offers as I started out getting, 
there was no one to blame but myself. I could live with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The down period started in 1981 with ``Blow Out'' and continued  
with ``Staying Alive,'' ``Two of a Kind'' and ``Perfect.'' He 
enjoyed a small revival in 1989 with the hit comedy ``Look Who's 
Talking,'' but the star was a talking baby (the voice of Bruce 
Willis). Travolta appeared in two negligible sequels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was still making a good living,'' Travolta recalled. ``Sorry  
I wasn't on every (magazine) cover or being sought after by the top 
studios. But I did work, I did well, I had an occasional hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't until 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) that it was all  
rekindled again. Then the top scripts came again: 'A Civil Action,' 
'Face/Off,' 'Primary Colors.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``A Civil Action'' debuted in Los Angeles and New York on  
Christmas Day, getting under the wire for Academy Award 
consideration. Based on Jonathan Harr's best seller about a 
real-life legal battle, it focuses on Jan Schlichtmann (Travolta), 
a personal injury lawyer who combats two industry giants over 
suspected pollution that may have caused leukemia deaths of 
children in Woburn, Mass. He pursues the case demonically, 
bankrupting himself and his small law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta, 44, came to the interview dressed entirely in black.  
He smiles a lot, as well he should, and he exudes confidence. He 
has a habit of trying to reverse the interview by asking questions 
of the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta's acute sense of perspective may stem from his early  
start as an actor and his upbringing in an Irish-Italian theater 
family. He began acting at 12 in summer theater, moved to 
off-Broadway and Broadway (``Grease''), dropping out of school at 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't become a kind of household name until I was 21,'' he  
said. That was occasioned by his role as the cool, amiable Vinnie 
Barbarino in the 1975-79 TV series, ``Welcome Back, Kotter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When his television fame transformed to stardom in films,  
Travolta sought expert advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was embraced by the old-timers in this business,'' he said  
with a degree of pride. ``Barbara Stanwyck, Jimmy Cagney, Gene 
Kelly, Fred Astaire -- they were all very fond of me. I would dine 
with them, and I felt more at home with them than I did with my 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy wouldn't talk a lot, but he had something to say when he  
did. Gene and Fred would talk about me: 'How's the kid?' Barbara I 
had a terrible crush on; I gave her an Academy Award for lifetime 
achievement. I miss all of them. They were terrific people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those greats may have helped shape Travolta's philosophy about  
the film world. He reasoned: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a business. The last four years I've had many top  
projects, and they've all done very well. But (the down period) 
could happen again. So you brush yourself off and start all over 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``You make a good movie, and you're up on top. You make a bad  
movie, and you fall again. It's no different from any other 
industry. You just have to be able to handle either situation. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can take your abilities away from you. Maybe someone  
can take your employment away from you. Not your abilities.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Projects $76B Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government will have a $76 billion  
surplus this year, its second straight year in the black, President 
Clinton said Wednesday. He asked Congress to consider devoting the 
money to Social Security and ``a lot of other challenges'' rather 
than a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers called for using the money to do both, saying it  
was Clinton, not Congress, who spent chunks of last year's $67 
billion surplus without addressing Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not let that happen again,'' said Senate Finance  
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del. ``We should dedicate this 
surplus to working Americans through tax cuts, and the creation of 
personal savings accounts for retirement and saving Social 
Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the  
projected surplus Clinton announced for fiscal 1999 is $16.4 
billion smaller than it ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was spent on more government,'' Archer said. ``I hope this  
year the president will resist again spending the surplus. I 
believe the surplus should be used for a combination of needs that 
involve saving Social Security and cutting taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president ruled out lowering taxes, telling his budget aides  
at a White House ceremony that while there are ``many arguments 
that can be made to give families further tax relief,'' the 
government has a responsibility to help Social Security bear the 
burden as millions of baby boomers start to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to plan for the future,'' Clinton said. ``We cannot  
use anything as an excuse not to deal with our most pressing 
priorities. I think that we will surprise the skeptics by dealing 
with the Social Security challenge over the next several months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said ``there are a lot of other challenges'' that must  
be met, including reforming Medicare, improving public education 
and expanding patients' rights in health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do all these things,'' Clinton said. ``But believe me,  
at every single turn in the road, we'll have to figure out how to 
make the numbers add up, how to stay within our commitment to 
fiscal discipline, how to be as clever as we can in the use of our 
resources without going over the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $76 billion surplus projected in the latest fiscal 1999  
forecast by the administration's Office of Management and Budget 
was significantly higher than the $54.2 billion surplus estimated 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can say the era of big deficits is over,'' Clinton said,  
noting that when he took office in 1993, projections for fiscal 
1999 called for a $404 billion deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	In its last update, in August, the Congressional Budget Office  
offered an even more optimistic projection of $80 billion for the 
fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The CBO is to release its own 
projections later this month, just before Clinton submits his 
annual budget proposal to Congress.

<HEADLINE> Camry, Ford Pickups Still Sell Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Toyota Camry family sedan and Ford's F-series  
pickup were America's favorite car and truck again last year. It 
wasn't a close contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Final yearend sales figures released Wednesday show the Camry  
outsold the runner-up Honda Accord by 28,504 units to keep the 
sales crown for the second consecutive year. A total of 429,575 
Camrys were sold, compared with 401,071 Accords. Ford's Taurus 
placed third with 371,074 sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camry was redesigned in 1997, and last year's title was the  
first for Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
	``A repeat is always a little more challenging and difficult,''  
said Don Esmond, vice president and general manager of the Toyota 
division of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. ``It shows we have a great 
product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Toyota added a coupe version called the Camry Solara,  
which boosted sales by about 15,000 units. More than two-thirds of 
the Camrys sold here last year were made in Georgetown, Ky.; the 
rest were imported from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had the best seller of all vehicles for the 17th straight  
year with its F-series truck. F-series sales totaled 836,629, the 
most for any one vehicle in the United States in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The F-series has shown once again that it's the cornerstone of  
the Ford franchise,'' spokesman George Pipas said Tuesday. ``There 
hasn't been a vehicle in 20 years that's passed the 800,000 sales 
mark, and the last one was the F-series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	F-series sales were boosted by February's introduction of the  
Super Duty version, which is sold mostly as the F-250 and F-350. 
Pipas said the Super Duty represented 40 percent of F-series sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In a distant second place was the Chevrolet pickup, which was  
sold last year as the C/K series and the '99 Silverado. General 
Motors Corp. sold 538,254 of the pickups, which was up slightly 
from 1998, even though two strikes against GM and the changeover to 
the new model slowed production significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also sells a Silverado twin as the GMC Sierra, which  
accounted for another 160,555 units last year. Combined 
Silverado-Sierra sales still lagged the F-series by 137,820 trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the truck race is expected to be closer this year as  
Chevrolet gets more of the hot-selling Silverados to its dealers. 
Inventories were only at about half year-ago levels in December, GM 
market research chief Mike DiGiovanni said.

<HEADLINE>  Vols' Town Giddy Over Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee fans welcomed home coach  
Phillip Fulmer, snapped up souvenirs and embraced the Vols' 
national football championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting time for all of Tennessee football,''  
Fulmer told a crowd greeting him and his wife Vicky with applause 
as they moved through McGhee Tyson Airport on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids have had a phenomenal season. We're really proud to  
be a part of history by being the first unified champion, and we 
are very appreciative of the unbelievable support all season.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cards' RB Key to Advancement Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *AP Sports Digest    	
</P>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Adrian Murrell isn't satisfied despite  
having the second-best season by an Arizona Cardinals running back 
in 14 years and running for eight touchdowns -- one fewer than the 
entire team in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the playoff touchdown that got away that bothers him as he  
prepares for Sunday's second-round game against the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Murrell broke a 74-yard run last week against Dallas, but only  
reached the 3-yard line before Deion Sanders caught him from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for Deion, and once I stumbled I knew any second  
now he was going to be on my back,'' Murrell said. ``If I wouldn't 
have turned around and looked, it would have been a nice little 
run. But it was a nice run anyway. It kind of took the wind out of 
their team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ensuing touchdown sent Arizona to a 17-0 lead in the third  
quarter, and the Cardinals (10-7) cruised to a 20-7 victory, their 
first in the playoffs in 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Murrell finished with 95 yards in 12 carries, the bulk of  
Arizona's 133-yard rushing effort. Coach Vince Tobin considers it 
essential to put up similar numbers against the Vikings (15-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd certainly like to keep their offense off the field, but  
we're not going to go with three tight ends and try to run it all 
the time,'' Tobin said. ``We've got to run our offense the best way 
we can to move the ball and score some points, because you're not 
going to beat Minnesota if you don't score some points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murrell was acquired from the New York Jets last April in  
exchange for Arizona's third-round pick in the draft. On his 
arrival in Tempe, he promised that the Cardinals would not finish 
last in rushing, as they did in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He improved throughout the season as he got used to his new  
teammates on the offensive line, and finished with 1,042 yards, 
becoming the Cardinals' first 1,000-yard rusher in three years and 
only their third since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaced Leeland McElroy, a smaller back who failed to stick  
with Tampa Bay this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, they were guys that tried very hard, but for  
whatever the reason, it didn't pan out,'' Murrell said. ``I wasn't 
here for that, and I think that's a negative thought saying these 
guys were bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left tackle Lomas Brown wasn't as reluctant to give Murrell  
credit for the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hits the hole a lot faster and a lot harder, he runs with  
more authority than Leeland did,'' Brown said. ``The thing about it 
is all you have to do is stay with your block. If you just get a 
stalemate with your block, you can get some yardage with Adrian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In five years after the Jets drafted him in the fifth round in  
1993, Murrell never got into the playoffs. The only game the Jets 
won in 1996 was against the Cardinals, thanks to his career-high 
199-yard afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	But Murrell, whose 174 yards against Philadelphia on Dec. 13 was  
eighth-best in Cardinals history, doesn't buy the idea that Arizona 
is a huge underdog against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's only opinion,'' he said. ``We're looking forward to  
going in there and playing a 15-1 team. Granted they're good, but 
they still lace their boots up like we do, and we've got as good a 
chance as anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Zereoue Leaving W. Va. for NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- West Virginia tailback Amos Zereoue  
announced today he will forego his final year of eligibility for 
the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given this decision a great deal of thought,'' Zereoue  
said in a statement released by the school. ``After a lot of 
research and consideration, I finalized my decision over the 
holidays while visiting with my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue was at his family's home in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia fans have been in love with ``Famous Amos'' ever  
since he dashed 69 yards for a touchdown against Pittsburgh on his 
first carry in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Don Nehlen said Zereoue will be missed, but ``We will be  
pulling for him on the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Amos is a great back and he's done a great job for us over the  
past three years,'' Nehlen said. ``But we won't forget him -- all we 
have to do is open our record book and Amos is everywhere.'': 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue is the school's career rushing leader with 4,086 yards  
and the Big East's top career rusher with 3,907 yards, not 
including bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue, who wears the same No. 20 as his idol, Barry Sanders,  
followed up a 1,505-yard season a year ago with 1,430 yards and 13 
touchdowns in his junior season, sixth best in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
	But his stock in the draft may have diminished in Tucson with 32  
yards on 22 carries.

<HEADLINE> USDA Searching for Black Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that black farmers and the Agriculture  
Department have reached a multimillion-dollar settlement, both 
sides are focusing on locating the thousands of farmers across the 
country who may have been wronged. 
</P>
<P>
	An 800-telephone number has been set up to take calls from  
farmers wanting to join the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings are being scheduled in Mississippi, Alabama, South  
Carolina and Arkansas so that attorneys can meet with farmers and 
review their cases. A meeting in Albany, Ga., has been scheduled 
for Feb. 12 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expedited procedure is truly unique,'' said plaintiffs'  
attorney Phil Fraas, adding that it should take less than six to 
eight months to process cases. ``It is designed to give farmers 
speedy action on complaints that have languished at USDA for years 
-- or in some cases decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys announced late Tuesday that a settlement had been  
reached in the 1997 racial discrimination lawsuit, ending more than 
two years of sometimes-contentious negotiations. Black farmers sued 
because they were denied access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge gave preliminary approval to the deal, which  
covers black farmers from 1981 to 1996. Final approval is expected 
at a March 2 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement has several tracks under which farmers who have  
documented their discrimination can get relief. The majority of 
farmers are expected to take a simpler provision that would give 
them tax-free payments of $50,000 each and forgive their government 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers with more documented evidence of their discrimination  
can opt to go before an independent arbitrator and seek larger 
damages. Farmers may also choose to opt out of the lawsuit and have 
their cases settled administratively within USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact cost of the settlement is unclear because it is not  
yet known how many farmers will join the class and which settlement 
options they will choose. It could surpass $300 million to $400 
million, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Alexander Pires said he expects a class of  
about 5,000 black farmers, 10 percent of the 50,000 black farmers 
in the country in the early 1980s. He says attorneys have located 
almost 2,000 black farmers. To help locate more, a major 
advertising campaign will kick off on television, in magazines and 
in hundreds of newspapers within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The $450,000 advertising campaign is being paid for by the  
Agriculture Department under the settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE -- The toll-free number for black farmers wishing  
to join the settlement is 1-800-646-2873.

<HEADLINE> Jefferson Genetic Study Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics renewed attacks Wednesday on findings  
of a genetic study that indicated Thomas Jefferson was the father 
of his slave's child. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1802, a year after becoming president, Jefferson was accused  
publicly of fathering several children by slave Sally Hemings. 
</P>
<P>
	To help settle historians' debate over the matter, scientists  
tracked down descendants of both families for DNA testing. In a 
study published in the journal Nature in November, they reported a 
match in Y chromosome DNA -- which is passed along mostly unchanged 
from father to son -- between the descendants of Eston Hemings, 
Sally Hemings' last child, and of Field Jefferson, the president's 
paternal uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding the DNA evidence to prior circumstantial evidence made  
Thomas Jefferson the most likely father, although the DNA couldn't 
rule out other Jeffersons, concluded study author Dr. Eugene 
Foster, a retired Virginia pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported at the time that critics, led by  
an amateur historian whose wife is a Jefferson descendant, insisted 
Eston Hemings' father could instead have been Jefferson's brother, 
Randolph; his cousin, George Jefferson Jr.; or one of Randolph 
Jefferson's sons. 
</P>
<P>
	The historian, Herbert Barger, held a news conference Wednesday  
in Washington to renew those charges and highlight two letters 
published in this month's Nature by scientists who agree the DNA is 
not conclusive proof. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster responded in Nature that the title of his study --  
``Jefferson fathered slave's last child'' -- was misleading because 
it was too simplistic. 
</P>
<P>
	But he defended the study's conclusion: ``From the historical  
knowledge we have, we cannot conclude that ... any other member of 
the Jefferson family was as likely as Thomas Jefferson to have 
fathered Eston Hemings.''

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea in Explosives Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A utility repairman who collected large  
amounts of explosive materials did so for his hobby of making small 
fireworks, not for larger bombs, his lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Madronich Jr., 44, pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges  
connected to the explosives and faces up to six years in prison if 
convicted. He is being held on $1 million bail pending a Thursday 
hearing in San Francisco Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's upset about being arrested,'' said Madronich's attorney,  
Jerrold Ladar. ``I get the very genuine feeling from him that he 
was, like, 'What did I do?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, authorities seized 250 pounds of ammonium nitrate, a  
33-gallon barrel of calcium nitrate, bomb-making books and other 
materials from Madronich's locker at a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. 
repair building, and from the home he shared with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammonium nitrate, commonly used as a fertilizer, becomes a  
powerful blasting agent when mixed with fuel oil and detonated with 
an explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
	``These materials clearly were not being collected for  
charity,'' said John Shanley, a spokesman for the district 
attorney. ``Saying they're for fireworks is not a defense.''

	Stangassinger, the World Cup slalom leader, also finished second  
in the last slalom Dec. 14 in Sestriere, Italy. Norway's Finn 
Christian Jagge, the Sestriere winner, finished fifth.

<HEADLINE> Carotid Artery May Show Health Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Thickening of the carotid artery walls in the neck is a more  
powerful predictor of a heart attack or stroke in elderly people 
than even high cholesterol or high blood pressure, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine used  
ultrasound measurements of the two carotid arteries in people over 
65 with no history of heart disease or stroke-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultrasound can detect cumulative damage to the blood vessels  
before the patient experiences any symptoms, said the study's lead 
author, Dr. Daniel O'Leary, chairman of radiology at Tufts-New 
England Medical Center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've clearly shown in the older age group that this is the  
single most powerful predictor of future heart attack or stroke,'' 
O'Leary said. ``It's clearly a screening test that ought to be done 
once'' at 65, or possibly earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the United States, claiming  
about 500,000 lives each year. Stroke kills an additional 160,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and  
Blood Institute, which financed the study, said ultrasound has 
great potential to prevent heart attacks and strokes in seemingly 
healthy people. 
</P>
<P>
	``By identifying high-risk patients, ultrasound would allow  
doctors to provide aggressive treatment early,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a Yale University cardiologist, said  
ultrasounds probably should not be given to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholesterol tests and blood pressure readings are cheaper and  
also tell doctors what they should treat, Krumholz said. Obesity, 
lack of exercise and smoking are other major risk factors for which 
treatment is straightforward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not clear to me in most cases (ultrasound) would change  
the way patients are treated,'' he said. ``The tests are probably 
most useful in patients who might have one risk factor, such as 
moderately high cholesterol, when doctors are trying to decide how 
aggressively to treat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two carotid arteries carry blood from the heart to the  
brain. An ultrasound to measure them in the neck costs about $250, 
O'Leary said. The tests are not done routinely now. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 4,476 Medicare recipients with an average  
age of 72. 
</P>
<P>
	None had a history of heart attacks, angina, bypass surgery,  
angioplasty, stroke, or surgery to widen a carotid artery. 
</P>
<P>
	An average of six years later, the 20 percent with the thickest  
artery walls had more than three times the risk of suffering a 
heart attack or stroke as the 20 percent with the thinnest artery 
walls, even after other risk factors such as high cholesterol, 
diabetes and smoking were taken into account.

<HEADLINE> NBA To Reimburse NBC and Turner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The TV networks that paid millions of dollars  
and missed out on NBA games during the lockout will be fully 
compensated. And, of course, they'll still have the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports will each be reimbursed by the league --  
either financially or with replacement games. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC already has canceled nine telecasts, plus the Feb. 14  
All-Star game. The network, which signed a four-year, $1.75 billion 
deal prior to this season, is expected to receive its money back 
for the missed telecasts during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner paid $178 million a year for four seasons and will miss  
about 50 games. But it will try to insert about 20 games into the 
remainder of this season's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net took the biggest hit during the lockout. With  
rights to 26 of the 29 NBA teams, it has replaced pro basketball 
games with regional classics and other low-rated programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We produce more NBA games than anyone else,'' said Arthur  
Smith, Fox Sports Net executive vice president for programming and 
production. ``Our substitute programming did well, but not as well 
as our NBA games. It's fair to say we lost the most until now, but 
nobody benefits more than us from here on in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the season expected to begin the first week of February,  
the first NBC telecast should be a triple-header on Feb. 7, and the 
Bulls at the Lakers would have been one of those games. 
</P>
<P>
	An entirely new schedule will be put in place for the 50-game  
season that is expected to be played, so that matchup may not take 
place on that date. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox lost more than 500 games through the end of January,  
although the network would not estimate its financial loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fox regional lost a lot of games,'' said Neal Pilson, the  
former president of CBS who runs a consulting firm. ``NBC won't be 
damaged significantly because the bulk of their season is coming 
up. The postseason is always when they draw their best ratings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings, and advertising dollars, may also depend on the status  
of Michael Jordan. Network executives are hoping Jordan doesn't 
call it a career just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lockout probably won't have any effect on the ratings  
until the postseason,'' said Steve Grubbs of BBDO Worldwide 
Advertising. ``Michael Jordan's return may have a bigger impact 
than anything, but in terms of advertising, we've been walking away 
from the NBA because we feel they've lost touch with the 
consumers.''

<HEADLINE> Newsrooms Raided for Suspect Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Sheriff's deputies armed with search warrants  
raided Reno's three television stations and its newspaper on 
Wednesday for copies of an interview with a man accused of opening 
fire on Interstate 80. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not declaring war on the media,'' said District Attorney  
Richard Gammick, who requested the warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what the press privileges are and we're not trying to  
violate those at all. It's my belief that once a newsperson goes up 
and interviews a defendant in the jail about the crime, they become 
a witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KOLO-TV News Director Ed Pearce said he was surprised and  
puzzled by Gammick's move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling is it's an illegal warrant. It violates the  
federal privacy protection act of 1980.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno Gazette-Journal Publisher Sue Clark-Johnson and Executive  
Editor Ward Bushee, who at one point were threatened with arrest, 
agreed to lock its reporter's notes in the publisher's office until 
a subpoena was issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Gammick said he deliberately kept the wording of the search  
warrants narrow in an effort to keep the demand within legal 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gammick said similar television interviews in the past had been  
erased before his office was able to review them despite his 
request that the footage be retained until they could be 
subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	His office turned to search warrants on Wednesday because a  
subpoena can be served only after a court date is set. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot issue subpoenas until we have a place to subpoena  
things into,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No time has been set for an initial appearance by the alleged  
sniper, Christopher Merritt. He was arrested in Las Vegas Monday 
night -- about 12 hours after allegedly shooting one man in the 
chest and hitting five other vehicles on the outskirts of Reno, 
forcing the interstate closed for five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce said that on the advice of the station's attorney, he  
turned over a copy of the jailhouse interview with Merritt, but 
told the deputies that the attorney believes the warrant could open 
the district attorney's office, the sheriff's office and the 
officers themselves to legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	KRNV-TV sent a copy of its interview to District Judge Edward  
Dannan, who signed the warrant, and KTVN-TV turned over a copy to 
its attorney.

<HEADLINE> China OKs Beijing's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China on Wednesday formally approved Beijing's  
bid to host the Olympic Games in 2008, saying having the games in 
China would help bring East and West closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese capital's application to host the games was  
unanimously approved by a meeting of 75 members of the Chinese 
Olympic Committee, a committee statement said. The committee and 
the city will submit a formal bid to the International Olympic 
Committee in early February, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing was beaten out by Sydney for the right to host the 2000  
Olympics, partly because of concerns over China's human rights 
record and other problems. Stung by the narrow defeat, China did 
not bid for the 2004 games. 
</P>
<P>
	As a fast-developing country of 1.3 billion people, China  
``should make big contributions to humanity, should make 
contributions to the Olympic movement,'' said Wu Shaozu, head of 
the Chinese Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding the Olympic Games in China will benefit cultural  
exchange and blending between East and West, and benefit the global 
development of the Olympic movement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Jingmin, a vice mayor of Beijing, introduced the bid to the  
committee on behalf of the city's 12 million residents, the 
statement said. He promised that the city would create the 
necessary conditions and speed up building work to make its bid 
successful.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached in Desegregation Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A tentative deal was reached Wednesday that  
would bring an end to court-ordered desegregation in Missouri and 
still allow busing to continue for St. Louis schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement will effectively ends decades of litigation and  
save the state significant fees,'' said Missouri Attorney General 
Jay Nixon. ``It allows educators and parents to worry about 
education not litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis desegregation plan is the result of a 1972 lawsuit  
filed by parents of black students and the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People. It features busing students to 
inner-city and suburban schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The state was held partially responsible for creating an  
unlawfully segregated school system in St. Louis and has been 
paying the lion's share of a system put in place in 1983 and 
supervised by the courts. In recent years, the state has asked the 
court to reduce its $70-million-a-year obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative deal, city voters in February would need to  
approve a tax increase that would contribute $20 million a year. 
The state would still pay the city about $40 million a year, said 
William Danforth, who coordinated the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board already has approved the deal, saying they can  
make do even with a $10 million drop in funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Black inner-city students also would continue to be bused to 16  
St. Louis County school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally got justice,'' said Minnie Liddell, one of the  
parents in the 1972 case. ``All I can say is, 'Yeah, St. Louis.' It 
was a long time coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and the NAACP alleged St. Louis Public Schools and the state  
of Missouri were responsible for a dual school system -- one for 
blacks, one for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The case resulted in a court-supervised program in which about  
13,000 black inner-city students are bused each year to 
predominately white St. Louis County schools. In addition, about 
1,300 county students attend the 26 city magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Both programs, which have cost Missouri taxpayers about $1.65  
billion over the years, will continue under the proposed 
settlement, Danforth said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, Kansas City settled a desegregation lawsuit  
with the state in 1996, after the state agreed to pay the district 
$320 million.
